Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad you're here today. Before we start, can you share how you've been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite anxious, especially after the news about my classmate's passing. It’s hard for me to think about anything else, and I find myself constantly worrying about cleanliness and germs.

Consultant: I understand. That must be really challenging for you. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that arise for you when you think about germs or cleanliness?

User: I keep thinking that if I touch something that has been contaminated, I could get sick. This makes me want to wash my hands all the time. It feels like there’s no way to be safe.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel anxious after a traumatic event like that. Your thoughts seem to be creating a lot of fear about contamination. How do these thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: They make me feel scared and helpless. I also get really frustrated with myself because I know that washing my hands so much isn’t normal.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really struggling with this internal battle. So, the anxiety about germs leads to overwhelming feelings and frustration. Have there been specific moments recently when you felt this fear heightened?

User: Yes, especially when I had to return some books that I shared with my classmate. I couldn't stop thinking about how they might be contaminated.

Consultant: That must have been really tough for you. When those thoughts about contamination came up, what did you find yourself doing in response?

User: I just kept washing my hands over and over again. It feels like if I don’t wash them enough, I’ll definitely get sick.

Consultant: It seems like washing your hands is a way to try and gain some control over the fear. But how do you feel after you wash your hands repeatedly? Does it help in the long run?

User: Not really. I feel a bit relieved in the moment, but then the fear comes back, and I end up washing them again. It’s exhausting.

Consultant: That exhaustion is understandable. It's like a cycle that doesn't really provide the relief you’re seeking. How do you think your life and studies are affected by this cycle of washing?

User: It’s affecting everything. I have trouble focusing on my studies because all I can think about is germs and staying clean.

Consultant: It sounds like this worry is impacting your ability to concentrate and be productive. If we consider challenging some of those thoughts, what do you think might be an alternative way to view the situation? 

User: I guess I could think that maybe it’s not as bad as I imagine it to be? But it’s really hard to believe that.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Challenging those thoughts can be difficult, but it’s a step in the right direction. What kind of evidence do you have that supports the idea that contamination is a real threat to your health?

User: I mean, I’ve always been taught to be cautious about germs, and I saw things on the news… but maybe I’m exaggerating it?

Consultant: It sounds like you're recognizing that some of those fears may be influenced more by information and past teachings than actual evidence. If a friend were feeling the way you do, what would you advise them?

User: I would probably tell them that they need to calm down and not let their fears control them, but I find it hard to take that advice myself.

Consultant: That's an important realization. Often, we can offer better advice to others than to ourselves. Let's explore some small steps you can take to gradually lessen washing your hands. What do you think would be a reasonable goal for you?

User: Maybe instead of washing my hands every time I touch something, I could try waiting a little longer? Like before meals or after using the bathroom?

Consultant: That sounds like a manageable goal! It’s a way to test your comfort levels while allowing your anxiety to decrease gradually. How do you feel about implementing that this week?

User: I feel a bit scared, but also hopeful. It makes sense to try.

Consultant: It's normal to feel scared about change, but remember, faced fears can often become less daunting over time. As we continue, we can check in on how that process goes. How would you like to track your feelings around this?

User: I could keep a journal to write down when I feel the urge to wash my hands and how I cope with it instead.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan. Journaling can help you identify patterns and reflect on your progress. As we move forward, let's celebrate every step you take in managing this fear. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel lighter, honestly. It’s good to talk about these things and feel like I’m not alone in this.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, the journey to understanding and changing these behaviors takes time, and you're already making strides. Before our next session, focus on your goals and remember that it's okay to reach out if you need support. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel more empowered now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaowang! It's great to see you again. Last time, we talked about your concerns regarding germs and how they affect your focus in class. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, but I still struggle with my fear of germs. I catch myself washing my hands repeatedly, especially when I think they might be contaminated. It's affecting my ability to concentrate in class.

Consultant: I can see how that would be really frustrating for you. It sounds like you're aware that this behavior is impacting your focus and learning experience. Can you share what thoughts go through your mind when you feel the need to wash your hands?

User: It's like I'm constantly worried that if I don't wash my hands right away, I could get sick. I just keep thinking about all the germs around me, and it's overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds tough. It seems like your thoughts about germs create a cycle of anxiety. Let’s explore this a bit further. What evidence do you have that not washing your hands immediately would result in actually being sick?

User: Well, I know it's not guaranteed, but I read about how easily bacteria can spread, and it just scares me. I don't want to take any chances.

Consultant: I completely understand where you're coming from. Many people worry about germs, especially after hearing about their effects. However, it’s important to question whether your fears are entirely rational. What would you say to a friend who is feeling the same way?

User: I would probably tell them that it's okay to be cautious, but they shouldn't let it control their life. I guess I need to remind myself of that.

Consultant: That's a very insightful perspective! It seems like you're already able to offer yourself advice that is compassionate and rational. Let's try this: how about coming up with a few realistic alternative thoughts you could hold onto when you feel the urge to wash your hands excessively?

User: Maybe I could think, "It's okay to wait a little longer to wash my hands, and my immunity is strong enough." 

Consultant: That's a great start! This alternative thought reframes the way you perceive germs and your body's ability to handle them. As we work on this together, could we also think about some situations where you manage to resist the urge to wash your hands? 

User: Hmm, sometimes in the library I can last a bit longer without washing my hands because I get absorbed in studying. 

Consultant: That’s excellent! Those moments indicate you’re capable of focusing despite your fear. Let’s build on that. Can we plan some small steps for you to gradually increase those periods between hand washing in your daily routines?

User: Yes, I could try waiting until after my class to wash my hands, instead of doing it before. That would be a challenge, but I’d like to try. 

Consultant: That sounds like a reasonable challenge! It allows you to practice reducing the compulsive behavior while still feeling secure. How do you feel about setting that as a mini goal for this week?

User: I feel a little anxious about it, but also hopeful that I can do it. 

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel anxious when trying something new. Remember, it’s a gradual process. What strategies can you use to support yourself if you start to feel that urge to wash your hands while in class?

User: I could focus on my breathing or remind myself of our discussion about germs not being as threatening as I think. 

Consultant: Those are effective techniques! Mindful breathing can really help anchor you in the moment. As you work through this week, how would you feel about keeping a journal to note down your experiences and thoughts when you try out this new strategy?

User: That sounds useful. I think writing it down can help me see my progress or challenges clearly. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Tracking your feelings and actions can offer great insights and help you adjust your approach as needed. How about we check in on how it goes at our next session? 

User: Sure, that sounds good. I really want to work on this.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Xiaowang. You've made a lot of progress today in identifying your fears and exploring alternatives. Remember, every small step counts. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today about this or anything else on your mind?

User: I think I’m okay for now. I just really want to make progress before the next semester starts.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset! As you prepare for the next semester, focusing on these skills will help you manage your anxiety better. Let’s make that our priority in our coming sessions. I’m here to support you every step of the way!

User: Thank you! I feel more confident now. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaowang. I'm excited to see how you apply what we've discussed. Just remember, progress takes time, and you're already heading in the right direction. 

User: Yes, I appreciate your encouragement! I’ll do my best.

Consultant: I believe in you! Don't hesitate to reach out if you need support before our next meeting. Take care, and see you soon!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Wang! I’m glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been doing a bit better, actually. My fear of germs has decreased somewhat, but I still feel really anxious about my hands, especially since they got damaged during that lab class. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing some conflicting emotions regarding your hand hygiene. On one hand, there's been progress in managing your fear of germs, but on the other hand, the damage to your skin has increased your anxiety. Can you tell me more about what you're feeling?

User: Yes, exactly. I feel torn because I want to keep my hands clean, but I also know that my washing habits have made them worse. It's just so frustrating.

Consultant: That frustration is completely understandable, Xiao Wang. It’s good to recognize that your desire for cleanliness is leading to some negative consequences. Let’s explore this further—what thoughts go through your mind when you think about your hand hygiene now?

User: I keep thinking that if I don’t wash my hands constantly, I'm going to get sick. It's almost like a compulsion—I feel like I have to do it to feel safe.

Consultant: It’s insightful that you recognize this compulsion. Let’s work on identifying how these thoughts make you feel. When that thought comes up, what emotions arise for you?

User: I feel anxious and restless, and sometimes guilty for not being able to control it. I know I shouldn’t feel this way, but it's hard to stop.

Consultant: It's very common to feel those intense emotions when faced with fears. It seems like your thoughts about hygiene are significantly impacting your well-being. Can we try to challenge the belief that constant washing is necessary for your safety? What evidence do you have to support that thought? 

User: Well, I’ve read that washing your hands is important, especially in public places, but I’ve also noticed that my hands are dry and cracking now. It just feels like no matter what I do, I can't find a balance.

Consultant: Finding that balance can be challenging, and recognizing the physical consequences of your actions shows you are becoming more aware. What alternative thoughts could you consider that might help reduce your anxiety while still keeping your hands clean?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that washing my hands a few times is enough, and that my skin needs some care too? 

Consultant: That sounds like a positive shift in perspective! It's about finding a routine that allows for both cleanliness and care for your skin. Let’s discuss a plan together: how about setting specific times for handwashing instead of doing it compulsively? 

User: That sounds possible. Maybe I could try washing my hands before meals and after using the restroom, and then give myself a break in between?

Consultant: That’s a great start! It helps create a healthy structure for your hand hygiene without it overwhelming you. Let's also think about skin care—how can you incorporate that into your routine to address the dryness?

User: I guess I should start using hand cream after washing my hands. I often forget, but it could help a lot.

Consultant: Absolutely! Using hand cream can greatly help with skin recovery. It’s a nice, easy step towards taking care of yourself. Can we also schedule some moments during the week where you can gradually expose yourself to situations where you don’t wash immediately after a task?

User: That sounds daunting but necessary. I find it difficult not to wash after touching things in public places. 

Consultant: I understand that it can feel scary. We can start small. Let's pick a specific situation, like sitting in a lecture. How about after class, you wait a few minutes before washing your hands? 

User: I could try that. Just a few minutes doesn’t sound too overwhelming.

Consultant: Exactly! The goal is to gradually extend the time. Each time you practice it, take note of how you feel. You might find that the anxiety diminishes over time. How are you feeling about this approach?

User: I feel a bit anxious, but also hopeful. I really want to reduce my anxiety and improve my habits.

Consultant: That's a positive attitude, Xiao Wang! As you take these small steps, remember, it's perfectly okay to feel some anxiety—it's part of the process. We can review your feelings in our next session. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good to me! I’m looking forward to sharing my progress. 

Consultant: Great! Remember to be kind to yourself during this time. You’ve made significant progress already. Before we end today, let's summarize your goals to ensure you have a clear plan. What will you focus on until our next session?

User: I will try to wash my hands less often, focus on using hand cream, and practice waiting a few minutes before washing after class. 

Consultant: That is a solid plan! I’m confident you'll manage well with these steps. We can discuss how they went during our next session. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Wang! I'm proud of the progress you're making. Remember, I’m here whenever you need support. Good luck with the changes this week! 

User: Thanks! I’ll see you next time! 

Consultant: See you next time, take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Wang! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I've been feeling better, actually. The fear of germs is less overwhelming now, and I’m starting to accept that my hands might not always be perfectly clean. It feels good!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made significant progress in your thoughts about cleanliness. What have you noticed about your social interactions since our last session?

User: I've become more interested in participating in campus activities. I even went to a few events, which I hadn’t done before. I felt a bit anxious, but I managed to push through.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you pushed through the anxiety and engaged in social activities! What was it like for you to be around others during those events?

User: It was a bit nerve-wracking at first, but once I got into the activities, I started to enjoy myself. There were moments when I forgot about my worries.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive experience! It’s normal to feel anxious initially, but it’s encouraging that you were able to enjoy yourself. Can you tell me about any specific moments when you felt your worries fade away?

User: There was a moment during a game where I was laughing and just having fun with others. I realized I wasn't thinking about germs or my hands at all!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic breakthrough! Laughter and enjoyment can be great distractions from anxiety. How did it feel to experience that moment of freedom from your worries?

User: It felt liberating, like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. I wish I could feel that way more often.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to want to feel that way consistently. Let's explore how we can replicate those feelings. What activities do you think could help you get back to that state of enjoyment again?

User: I think I’d like to attend more events, maybe join some clubs. I just hope I don’t feel overwhelmed again.

Consultant: Joining clubs sounds like a great plan! We can develop strategies to help you manage any overwhelming feelings. What specifically makes you feel overwhelmed in social situations?

User: Sometimes, when I think about getting dirty or being around a lot of people, I just feel this need to wash my hands or leave the situation.

Consultant: Acknowledging that is a great first step. Let's work on gradually exposing you to those environments while maintaining your comfort. What if we set small goals for attending events, starting with shorter times or smaller groups?

User: That could work! I think starting small would help. I could try attending just one event for a short period first.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Setting manageable goals can help ease the anxiety of larger events. How about we also discuss coping strategies for when you start feeling those overwhelming feelings in social situations?

User: Yes, that’s important. I think if I have a plan, I would feel more secure.

Consultant: Absolutely! One strategy could be deep breathing exercises that you can do discreetly. Would you like to try a quick breathing technique together now?

User: Sure, I’d love that!

Consultant: Okay, let’s take a deep breath in for four counts, hold for four, and then exhale for four. Ready? Breathe in... hold... and out. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt nice! I think I might use that when I start feeling anxious.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, practicing it regularly can make it more effective during moments of anxiety. What else do you think could help reinforce your confidence in social situations?

User: Maybe reminding myself of the fun I had in the last event could help. Thinking back on those enjoyable moments could give me motivation.

Consultant: Yes, that’s a great idea! Reflecting on positive experiences is a powerful tool for boosting your confidence. Perhaps you could keep a journal of your experiences to remind yourself of those moments.

User: Writing it down might work! I could refer to it when I’m feeling anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! It’s all about reinforcing those positive thoughts. As we continue to work on these techniques, what are some signs you’ll know you’re making progress?

User: I think I’ll notice I’m more comfortable staying in social situations longer, and I won’t feel the urge to wash my hands as much.

Consultant: Those are excellent indicators of progress! It’s essential to celebrate even the small victories along the way. How do you feel about our discussions and the strategies we’ve outlined today?

User: I feel hopeful! I appreciate having a plan to tackle this anxiety and make my social experience enjoyable.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Remember, progress takes time, and you’re already taking significant steps forward. Before we wrap up today, is there anything else on your mind that you’d like to address?

User: No, I think we’ve covered everything. I’m excited to try these strategies!

Consultant: That’s fantastic! I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. You’ve made impressive strides, and I believe in your ability to manage your anxiety. Until we meet again, take care!

User: Thank you so much! I will. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiang Wang! It's great to see you here today. I'm looking forward to hearing how you've been since our last session. What have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a lot calmer actually. My new friends are really supportive, and I think that has helped me manage my anxiety about cleanliness a bit better. But I still sometimes feel the urge to wash my hands excessively.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step forward, and it's wonderful that you have found supportive friends. It's normal to still have some urges, especially since you're working on these behaviors. Can you tell me more about when you experience the urge to wash your hands? What thoughts go through your mind during those moments?

User: Usually, it's when I touch something I think might be dirty, like after using public transport. I immediately feel this panic about germs, and I can't help but go wash my hands, even if I just did it a little while ago.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like those thoughts about germs trigger a strong reaction in you, leading to the compulsion to wash your hands. In CBT, we often explore these automatic thoughts to identify any cognitive distortions. For instance, do you think your thoughts might be exaggerating the actual risk involved?

User: Yes, I think they probably are. Logically, I know that not every surface is really contaminated, but I still feel like something bad might happen if I don't wash my hands immediately.

Consultant: That's a very insightful observation, Xiang Wang. It seems like there's a disconnect between your logical understanding of the situation and your emotional response. We can work on that. When you feel that urge to wash your hands, how about we try to pause for a moment and assess the situation? What do you think you could focus on instead of the compulsion?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that I just washed my hands a little while ago and that it’s okay for me to wait. I could also think about what my friends would say if they were here.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! By reminding yourself of what you know logically, and possibly even using the support of your friends' perspectives, you can create a buffer against that compelling urge. Would you be willing to try using that strategy next time you feel the urge?

User: Yes, I think I can try that. It might help to have those reminders prepared in advance.

Consultant: Excellent! Preparing those reminders can be a powerful tool for you. Let's also think about activities that distract you from those urges. Are there any hobbies or interests that help keep your mind occupied when those thoughts arise?

User: I love painting, and I find it really relaxing. When I paint, I lose track of time and feel so much better.

Consultant: Painting sounds like a wonderful outlet for you. Perhaps you could keep some art supplies nearby to pick up whenever the urge to wash your hands arises. This way, you can engage in something you love while redirecting your thoughts.

User: That sounds like a good idea! I could create a small corner in my room just for painting.

Consultant: Absolutely! Setting up that space could serve as a calming environment that encourages creativity and helps you shift your focus in those moments of urge. Let’s also discuss how your experiences have been in social settings since we last talked. Have you had the opportunity to put into practice any of the skills we discussed?

User: Yes, I've been more open with my new friends about my struggles. They seem supportive, and I feel less isolated. Just talking about it makes a big difference.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you've been able to share your experiences with them. Connecting with others can significantly contribute to reducing feelings of isolation and anxiety. What has been the most rewarding part of opening up to them?

User: I feel like I've built a closer bond with them, and they actually understand what I’m going through. It makes me less embarrassed about my compulsive behavior.

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement! Building that connection can be incredibly empowering. Remember, vulnerability often strengthens relationships. Do you feel more confident in engaging in social activities now compared to before?

User: Absolutely. I feel braver reaching out to them and planning activities together. I even invited them to join me in painting!

Consultant: That's fantastic! Collaborating on a project like painting can further strengthen those bonds. Plus, it allows you to enjoy a safe, hands-on activity that also reduces your stress. What other activities do you think you might want to try with them?

User: I’d love to have movie nights or take walks together. Being outside always makes me feel good!

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful activities! Engaging in different social interactions while doing things you enjoy can serve as great emotional relief. If you feel urge to wash your hands while out, remember your strategies and the positive connections you're nurturing. 

User: Yes, I’ll keep that in mind. I feel like I’m learning to cope with my anxiety better in these situations.

Consultant: You certainly are! You're making great progress. How do you envision maintaining your confidence moving forward as you continue to socialize and tackle these urges?

User: I want to keep applying the strategies we’ve discussed and lean more on my friends for support when I need it. I think that will help me stay on track.

Consultant: That's a solid plan! Building that support network and using the skills you've learned will help you maintain your progress. Before we wrap up, let’s reflect briefly on how far you’ve come and your evolving comfort with these tools. 

User: I feel like I’ve gained a lot of insights into my thoughts and behaviors and become more assertive in my friendships.

Consultant: That's truly wonderful to hear, Xiang Wang! Your journey toward managing your anxiety and behavior seems to be heading in a very positive direction. Remember to celebrate the milestones you've achieved. As we conclude our session, do you have any last thoughts on how you can continue to enhance your coping strategies?

User: I think I’ll keep practicing the reminders and maybe set up a regular painting session with my friends. That feels like a great combination of support and distraction!

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect approach! I'm really proud of the progress you've made. If you ever feel uncertain or need support in the future, remember that I’m here for you. I believe you have the tools to handle your challenges effectively. Thank you for sharing your journey with me today.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance and support. Looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Wang! It's great to see you again. How are you feeling today, especially after your recent success as the team leader?

User: Hi! I'm feeling really good, actually. Leading the team and achieving those results boosted my confidence a lot. I feel more capable, but I also want to make sure I keep this momentum going.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you really enjoyed the experience and gained a lot of self-confidence from it. Let’s take a moment to reflect on your journey so far. What specific skills or strategies have helped you the most in managing your anxiety and boosting your performance?

User: I think learning to redirect my focus helped a lot. Instead of worrying about germs while handling tasks, I tried to remind myself that it’s okay to be a bit relaxed about things. The support from my team also made a big difference.

Consultant: It’s great that you found a way to redirect your focus and leaned on your team's support. That’s a crucial strategy. How do you think you can continue applying those skills, particularly in your studies or social activities in the future?

User: I’m planning to set small goals for myself, like studying in blocks and taking breaks, rather than thinking I have to study for hours straight. I also want to be more open in group projects, sharing ideas without overthinking them.

Consultant: Setting those small goals sounds like a very effective approach! Would it be helpful if we developed a more structured plan together that outlines these goals and strategies for both your studies and social interactions?

User: Yes, that would be really helpful! I want a clear plan I can follow, especially when stress starts creeping in.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s outline your goals and identify some strategies to handle stress. As we do that, can you remind me of any specific situations that tend to trigger your anxiety, especially in academic or social settings?

User: I sometimes feel anxious when I have to present in front of people or when I think I might not meet expectations. I worry about making mistakes, which can hold me back in group discussions.

Consultant: It makes sense to feel anxious about presentations and expectations. It’s common to worry about errors. What thoughts typically run through your mind in those moments that lead to this anxiety?

User: I usually think, “What if I mess up?” or “People will judge me if I don’t do well.” These thoughts can be really overwhelming.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy. Let’s explore them together. How accurate do you believe those thoughts are? Do you think there might be other perspectives or interpretations we can consider?

User: I guess they’re not entirely accurate. Most people are understanding, and I’ve seen others make mistakes without it being a big deal. But it’s hard to remember that in the moment.

Consultant: You’re right! Most people can be quite forgiving. How about we replace those negative thoughts with something more constructive? For instance, instead of thinking “What if I mess up?”, you could think, “I’m prepared and capable, and it’s okay to make mistakes.” How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds better. I think reminding myself that it's okay to be imperfect could really help. I just need to practice it.

Consultant: Exactly! Practicing these alternative thoughts can make a big difference. What are some specific scenarios where you could try this new thinking pattern before a presentation or in a group setting?

User: Maybe before group discussions or when I start preparing for a presentation, I can take a minute to remind myself of this. I could even write down supportive affirmations to read when I need them.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Writing affirmations can serve as a great reminder. Would you like to commit to writing a few affirmations that resonate with you before our next session?

User: Yes, I’ll definitely do that! I think it’ll help reinforce those positive thoughts.

Consultant: Excellent! Now, let’s also discuss how you can maintain your accomplishments moving forward. Reflecting on your recent experiences, what do you think is one key takeaway that could guide you in your future social and academic endeavors?

User: I think the takeaway is that I need to trust in my abilities and not let fear dictate my actions. If I focus on my strengths, I can manage the anxiety better.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight. Trusting your abilities allows you to navigate challenges with confidence. How can we ensure that you regularly remind yourself to trust in your strengths?

User: I could keep a journal or a note on my desk to remind me of my successes and the abilities I have. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! Tracking your successes can reinforce your confidence. Now, let’s summarize our discussion today. We’ve talked about your accomplishments, the strategies for managing anxiety, and a few actionable steps moving forward. How do you feel about the progress we've made today?

User: I feel really good! I have a better understanding of how to manage my thoughts and a plan for the future. It’s comforting to have a direction.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiao Wang! You’ve made significant progress. As we prepare to conclude, I want you to remember that you’ve already developed valuable skills. How do you feel about continuing to use these strategies in your daily life?

User: I feel confident! I believe I can apply what we've discussed and keep improving.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! I believe in your ability to continue this journey. If you encounter challenges, don’t hesitate to reach out. Remember, you can always come back for support. This concludes our session today, and I wish you the best with your goals!

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help. I'll keep in touch for sure!
