Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today's session. I'm glad to see you here. Can you tell me how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really anxious and easily upset, especially when I'm at school. I worry a lot about what my classmates and teachers think of me. 

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to be liked and accepted. Let's explore this a bit more. What specific situations make you feel the most anxious or worried at school?

User: Well, sometimes during group activities, I feel like I have to make everyone happy. If someone looks upset or annoyed, I get really stressed out, and I don’t know what to do.

Consultant: That sounds tough. It’s understandable to want to keep others happy, but it’s also important that you take care of your own feelings. Can you share what thoughts go through your mind when you feel that pressure?

User: I think that if I don’t make everyone happy, they won’t like me anymore. I feel like I need to be perfect all the time.

Consultant: It sounds like you might be putting a lot of pressure on yourself to meet those expectations. Let's take a moment to challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that your friends or teachers would stop liking you if you weren’t perfect?

User: I don't really know. They've never actually said that. But it feels like they would.

Consultant: That’s interesting. Sometimes our feelings can lead us to believe things that may not be true. If a friend felt the same way, what advice would you give them?

User: I guess I would tell them that friends should like them for who they are, not just for being perfect.

Consultant: That's a kind perspective and quite insightful. It seems like you understand that friendships should be based on who we are rather than what we do. Let’s explore a bit more—how do you feel when things don't go perfectly in your interactions?

User: I feel really sad and sometimes I just lose control and get really angry, even though I know I shouldn't.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Emotions can be overwhelming sometimes. Can we think of ways to express those feelings without losing control? 

User: Maybe I can try to talk to someone about how I feel, but I'm afraid they might think I'm just being a baby.

Consultant: It’s brave of you to think about talking to someone. Your feelings are valid, and sharing them does not make you a baby. How about we practice some techniques to help you express your feelings more calmly when you're upset?

User: That sounds good, but I'm not really sure how to do that.

Consultant: One way is to use "I" statements, like saying, "I feel upset when..." instead of blaming or attacking someone. This can help others understand your feelings better. Do you think that could work for you?

User: Yes, I think that could help. I’ll try that next time I feel upset.

Consultant: Great! And also, when you notice anger building up, it might help to take deep breaths or count to ten before responding. Would you feel comfortable trying those techniques?

User: Yeah, I think I could do that. I’ll give it a shot.

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember, it’s a learning process, and you don’t have to be perfect at it right away. Let’s talk about how you feel when you are alone at home. How do those feelings compare to the way you feel at school?

User: At home, I feel lonely sometimes. My mom is often away, and I wish I could see her more. I miss her, and I feel like I have no one to talk to.

Consultant: It makes sense that you’d feel lonely with your mom being away. That can really amplify feelings of isolation. What do you think could help you feel less lonely when you're at home?

User: Maybe I could try to reach out to my friends more. I haven't really talked to them much lately.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Connecting with friends could help you feel less alone. What would be a good first step to take in reaching out?

User: I could send a message or maybe arrange to play with them. I think I’ll try that!

Consultant: Perfect! Making that first move can help you build those connections. Remember, it’s okay to express your need for friendship. Are there specific feelings about being alone that you’d like to understand better?

User: I just feel like there's something wrong with me when I’m alone. Like I should be doing something to fix it.

Consultant: It's common to feel that way, but it's important to recognize that being alone doesn't mean there's something wrong with you. Sometimes we all need our own space. Let's explore how we can shift that perspective. What would it feel like to allow yourself some quiet time without judgment?

User: I suppose it would feel alright if I knew it was okay to just be me.

Consultant: That's a great realization! Allowing yourself to just be and recognize your own feelings can foster self-acceptance. As we move forward, how can you remind yourself that it's okay to have both social connections and quiet time?

User: Maybe I can practice telling myself that it’s okay to be alone sometimes, and that I'm not a bad person for wanting friends.

Consultant: Absolutely! Affirmations like that can really help. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s take a moment to summarize what you’ve learned today about your feelings and connections with others. What stands out to you?

User: I’ve learned that I don’t always have to please everyone, and it’s okay to express my feelings. Plus, it's alright to want friends and feel lonely sometimes.

Consultant: That's a wonderful reflection! You've made some great progress in understanding your feelings and how to connect with others. Remember these insights as you continue to practice your new skills. If you feel anxious or lonely, revisit these thoughts and strategies we talked about.

User: Thank you! I feel a bit better just talking about it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Keep practicing and take it one step at a time. And remember, if you ever need to talk again, I’m here to help. Take care!

User: Thanks, I will!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, especially with everything going on?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really uneasy. Since my parents separated, I often feel lonely when I go home after school. I rely a lot on my classmates for support, but sometimes it just feels like too much.

Consultant: I see that you are feeling lonely after school and that leaning on your friends has become important to you. Let's talk more about what that loneliness feels like. Can you share a bit about what happens when you’re alone at home?

User: Well, when I'm alone, I feel like nobody cares about me. I start thinking that my friends might forget about me if I don't keep talking to them. It makes me anxious.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable to feel anxious about friendships, especially when experiencing loneliness. You mentioned feeling like your friends might forget you. Can you explore what thoughts come to mind when you feel that way?

User: I keep thinking that if I don't message them or hang out, they'll all just move on without me. It’s like I have to be in touch constantly or I'll lose them.

Consultant: So, it feels like you have to always be connected to keep your friendships strong. Let’s take a moment to think about those thoughts. What evidence do you have that your friends would forget about you if you weren't constantly in contact?

User: I guess I don’t have real evidence. It's just a feeling I have, especially when I'm feeling down.

Consultant: It’s insightful to recognize that those feelings might not be based on evidence. Let’s challenge that thought. If a friend needed some space, what do you think would happen to your friendship?

User: I think they'd still be my friend. I mean, we can still talk later when things are better, right?

Consultant: Exactly! Friendships often have ups and downs, and they can survive some distance. How would it feel to give yourself permission to take a break from constant contact with your friends?

User: It sounds kind of relieving, actually. But I also worry they might think I don’t care.

Consultant: That’s an important concern. Let's explore this further. How do you think you could explain to your friends that you just need some time for yourself, without it meaning you don’t care about them?

User: Maybe I could just tell them I'm taking some time to feel better and that I’ll reach out when I'm ready.

Consultant: That sounds like a good approach! Communicating your needs can help clarify things without causing unnecessary worry. As we continue, how about we discuss some activities you enjoy that you could do when you're alone? This might help ease some of that loneliness.

User: I like drawing and playing video games. They help me feel better sometimes.

Consultant: Those are great interests! Engaging in drawing or gaming can be a wonderful way to spend time with yourself. Have you thought about how you might incorporate more of those activities into your daily routine?

User: I guess I could draw for a little after school before reaching out to my friends. It might help me relax first.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Giving yourself that time might ease your mind before interacting with others. Let's also think about some group activities you could join at school. Would you be open to looking for ways to connect with more kids?

User: Yeah, I could look for clubs or activities. I think it might help me make new friends too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Being part of a group can help build stronger friendships and reduce that loneliness. What kinds of clubs or activities interest you the most?

User: I think art club sounds fun because I like drawing, and maybe a gaming club too, just to meet others who like the same things.

Consultant: Both sound like great choices! Engaging in activities that you enjoy will create opportunities to meet new friends who share those interests. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel excited! It’s nice to think I can meet new people who like the same stuff.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Feeling excited about new possibilities is a great sign. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on our session. What do you feel you’ve learned about managing your feelings around being alone?

User: I’ve learned that it’s okay to take breaks from friends, and I can still be close to them. I just need to focus on what makes me happy too.

Consultant: Exactly! Balancing your needs with friendships is important. You’ve made some great progress today. Remember, it's okay to seek both solitude and connection. If you ever feel overwhelmed, just remind yourself that you can take those breaks. I’m looking forward to hearing how your new activities go next time!

User: Thank you! I’m feeling better already. I’ll let you know how it goes!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of you for being open about your feelings and looking forward to the new adventures ahead. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello there! I'm so pleased to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I guess I've been okay, but I still find it hard to focus in class. Sometimes my mind just drifts off, and I worry that I’m disappointing my teacher.

Consultant: I can see that it’s frustrating for you to feel that way, especially when you care about your performance. Let's talk about what happens when you find it difficult to focus. Can you tell me about a recent time when you felt your attention slipping in class?

User: Well, just yesterday, my teacher was explaining something really interesting, but I started thinking about my dad instead. I felt bad because I wasn’t paying attention, and I kept worrying about how I should be focusing instead.

Consultant: It's understandable to have those feelings, especially when thoughts about your dad come up unexpectedly. How did you feel at that moment when you realized your mind was wandering?

User: I felt a bit guilty and anxious. I wanted to understand what the teacher was saying, but I just couldn't help it. It seems like I can’t control my thoughts sometimes.

Consultant: That sounds tough, feeling guilty for something that can happen to anyone. Remember, it’s common for us to have wandering thoughts. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit. What do you think it means about you when you lose focus in class?

User: I guess I feel like I’m not trying hard enough. Maybe I’m just not smart enough to keep up.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that thought. I want you to know that struggling to focus doesn't define your intelligence. Everyone has moments when they find it hard to concentrate. What kind of thoughts do you have when you tell yourself you're not smart enough?

User: I feel really sad and sometimes I even think about giving up. It just makes me not want to try.

Consultant: It’s completely okay to feel sad about that. But I want to challenge that thought: what evidence do you have that says you won’t succeed? Can you recall a time when you felt proud of what you achieved?

User: Well, there was that time I won a small math competition at school. I felt really happy and proud of myself.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic achievement! Winning that competition highlights your capabilities. Let’s try to remind ourselves of those moments when you're feeling overwhelmed in class. Perhaps we can think of this situation differently. If a friend were in your position, how would you encourage them?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone has bad days and to keep trying. Maybe I should listen to my own advice.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s easier to be kind to others than to ourselves sometimes. Let’s work on being a little more positive and forgiving towards yourself. What small change can you make to be kinder to yourself when you find your focus waning?

User: Maybe I can tell myself it’s okay to lose focus sometimes and that I can always get back to it.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Giving yourself permission to come back to focus can relieve some pressure. How about we set a small goal for you this week? Perhaps you can set a timer and take short breaks to help with your attention during class.

User: That sounds good. Maybe setting a timer would make me feel less anxious about if I’m focusing or not.

Consultant: Absolutely! It also helps train your mind to return to the task at hand. After the timer goes off, you can reward yourself with a quick break. What would you like to do during that break?

User: I can play a quick game or draw something I like. That might help me feel better.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Using activities that make you happy will reinforce a positive connection to focusing in class. How do you feel about trying this out for the week?

User: I feel excited to try it. I hope it helps me focus better!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that excitement! It’s important to approach this with positivity. Let's check in next time and see how it went. Remember, it’s all about practicing and being kind to yourself through this process.

User: Sure, I’ll do my best! Thanks for helping me figure this out.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in your ability to make these changes. Keep exploring your interests and remember that you're already doing great. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. 

User: Me too! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better. I started going to the extracurricular classes, and I found some activities I really enjoy.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Finding activities you enjoy can be a great way to boost your mood. Could you tell me more about what activities you've been participating in?

User: I've been taking a painting class and a soccer club. I really like painting; it makes me feel relaxed. And playing soccer with friends is fun too!

Consultant: It sounds like you've discovered some great outlets for your creativity and energy. How does participating in these activities make you feel about yourself?

User: I feel proud when I paint something nice. And in soccer, it's good to be part of a team. Sometimes, I feel like I belong and I can do things well.

Consultant: That sense of belonging and achievement is so important! It's great that you're experiencing pride in your abilities. Have there been any challenges in these classes or activities so far?

User: Sometimes, I worry that I'm not as good as the other kids in soccer. I feel nervous about making mistakes.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about performance, especially when you're learning something new. Could we explore what thoughts come to mind when you’re feeling nervous about making mistakes?

User: I think that if I mess up, everyone will laugh at me or think I’m not good enough.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite intense and might contribute to your anxiety. Let's take a moment to challenge those ideas. What evidence do you have that others would laugh at you or that you aren’t good enough?

User: Well, I guess they really encourage each other and are nice when someone makes a mistake. They don't seem to care too much.

Consultant: That's a great observation! It seems like your teammates actually support each other. If a friend made a mistake, how would you respond to them?

User: I would tell them it's okay and that everyone makes mistakes.

Consultant: Exactly! You would be kind and understanding. Now, what if you treated yourself with that same kindness when you feel nervous? How might that change how you approach playing soccer?

User: I think I would feel less pressure and enjoy the game more.

Consultant: That's a valuable insight! What if we set a small goal for your next soccer practice? Perhaps focusing on having fun rather than on making mistakes?

User: That sounds good! I can try to just enjoy playing with my friends.

Consultant: Fantastic! Setting that intention can really shift your experience. How do you feel about your painting class? Are there any worries there as well?

User: Not really. I enjoy it, and I feel free to express myself. I don’t worry about being perfect when I paint.

Consultant: It’s amazing that you feel free and self-expressive in your painting! Maybe we can take that mindset from painting and apply it to soccer—focusing on enjoying the game rather than being perfect.

User: That makes sense! Maybe doing both at the same time could help me feel more confident.

Consultant: Absolutely! Building that confidence incrementally is key. Would you like to set any goals for your painting as well?

User: I think it would be fun to try and paint something specific next time, like a landscape!

Consultant: That sounds like a beautiful goal! Creating something specific can definitely enhance your sense of accomplishment. How do you feel about tracking your progress in both soccer and painting?

User: I could keep a little journal about how I feel after each session! That would be cool!

Consultant: Great idea! Keeping a journal can really help you reflect on your experiences and recognize your growth. What are you most looking forward to in both of these activities?

User: I'm looking forward to painting something that makes me happy, and playing fun games with my friends in soccer!

Consultant: Focusing on that happiness sounds wonderful! Remember, it’s about enjoying the process. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the goals we've set for yourself moving forward?

User: I feel excited! I think this will really help me enjoy both activities more.

Consultant: I'm excited for you too! Remember, it’s all about celebrating those small achievements. Next time we meet, we can discuss how it went. I'm really proud of your progress!

User: Thank you! I appreciate it. I feel more confident already.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Keep nurturing that self-esteem, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care!

User: Bye! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really happy to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really proud of myself lately. I did well in my interest class, and I got a lot of praise from adults. It made me feel good!

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear that you’re feeling proud and receiving positive attention. Can you tell me more about what you achieved in your interest class?

User: I learned to paint, and I won a little prize for my artwork. Everyone said it was really nice, and my mom was really happy too!

Consultant: Wow, winning a prize is a fantastic achievement! It sounds like your hard work really paid off. How did it feel to receive those compliments from others?

User: It felt amazing! I was really happy and almost wanted to show everyone my painting. I felt like I could do anything.

Consultant: That’s a powerful feeling! It’s great to see how this accomplishment has boosted your confidence. Have you noticed any changes in how you feel about other things, like school or spending time with your dad?

User: Yeah, I think I’m feeling more confident about school. I’m not as scared when the teacher calls on me. But with my dad, I still feel a bit nervous.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel nervous about your dad, especially since you don’t see him as often. What do you think would help you feel more comfortable when interacting with him?

User: Maybe if I could show him my painting? I think he would be proud of me too!

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Sharing your achievement could create a positive moment between you two. How would you feel about approaching your dad with your painting?

User: I think I would feel excited, but also a little scared. What if he doesn’t like it?

Consultant: It's natural to worry about how others will react, but remember, this is about sharing something you’re proud of. What evidence do you have that your dad wouldn’t like it?

User: Well, he doesn’t really say much when we talk. I just feel like he might not care.

Consultant: I can see how you might feel that way based on your experiences. However, what if we try to think of it differently? Maybe he’s just not sure how to express his feelings. If he sees something you’re proud of, it might open up a conversation between you.

User: That makes sense. I guess I never thought about it that way. 

Consultant: I’m glad that resonates with you. It sounds like showing him your painting could really help strengthen your relationship. How about we brainstorm how you would approach this conversation with him?

User: Yeah, maybe I could just ask him what he thinks of my artwork and not be too worried about it.

Consultant: Absolutely! Asking for his opinion can be a good way to invite him into the conversation. It can help you feel more at ease too. What would be the first step you’d take to make that happen?

User: I think I could show him the painting when we next see each other.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! When do you think you’ll get to see him next? 

User: I think he’s coming over this weekend.

Consultant: Perfect timing! You can maybe set it up so the painting is visible when he arrives. How do you feel about that idea?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. I hope he likes it!

Consultant: Feeling nervous is completely normal, especially when you care about someone's opinion. Remember, regardless of his reaction, you should be proud of your talent and effort. What’s one thing you can do to remind yourself of that?

User: I can look at my painting and remember how happy I felt when I won the prize. 

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Keeping that happy memory in mind can help you feel more confident. As you prepare for this interaction, is there anything else you want to talk about or plan for?

User: I think I’m just worried about how to keep feeling good after the excitement dies down.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Let's explore ways to maintain that positive feeling. What activities have made you feel good about yourself recently besides painting?

User: I love playing soccer with my friends. When I score a goal, I feel really good!

Consultant: Soccer sounds like a fantastic outlet for building confidence! How can you incorporate more soccer into your routine to keep that positive momentum going?

User: Maybe I can ask my friends to play more often. I really enjoy it!

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Surrounding yourself with supportive friends can enhance your sense of achievement and happiness. As we wrap up today, what’s one thing you plan to do this week that can help you stay connected to that positive feeling?

User: I’ll definitely show my painting to my dad and play soccer with my friends!

Consultant: That sounds perfect! You’re taking important steps and I’m excited to hear how everything goes. Remember to celebrate your achievements, no matter how small. I’m looking forward to our next session where we can share how it went. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel a lot better talking about this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to hear that. I believe in you and your abilities. Until next time, take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. How are you feeling about everything that's been going on recently?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good, actually. Spending time with my dad has made me feel safer and happier. I look forward to seeing him more often.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like your relationship with your dad is improving and it's having a positive effect on you. Can you tell me more about those interactions? How have they made you feel?

User: Well, we went fishing last weekend. It was fun! I felt really close to him, and that made me feel good. I haven't felt like that in a long time.

Consultant: Going fishing sounds like a great bonding experience! It’s nice to hear that you felt close to him. What do you think has changed in your feelings about spending time with your dad?

User: I think I used to feel nervous and unsure, but now I feel more comfortable. It’s like we are starting to understand each other better.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift! Feeling understood is so important. How does this new understanding impact the way you view your relationship with him?

User: It makes me feel like I can trust him more now. I really want to keep feeling this way.

Consultant: Trust is key in any relationship, especially with family. Let’s talk about some ways to maintain this connection. What activities do you think you could do together in the future to keep building this relationship?

User: Maybe we could go on more outings, like hiking or going to the park. I think spending time together will help, especially if we keep talking.

Consultant: Those sound like great ideas! Enjoying shared activities and keeping communication open can strengthen your bond. How do you feel about discussing what you’d like to talk about when you're together?

User: I think it would be great to share more about our lives. I want to tell him about school and my friends.

Consultant: Sharing about your life is a wonderful way to connect. It helps him to understand you better too. How do you feel about opening up to him about your feelings and experiences?

User: I feel excited! It makes me feel happy that he wants to listen. I just hope I don’t get too shy.

Consultant: It's normal to feel shy sometimes, but remember he cares about you. Maybe you could start with little things and gradually share more as you grow more comfortable. How does that sound?

User: Yeah, that sounds like a good plan. I can start with something simple and see how it goes.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking small steps can make it easier. How do you think your dad would react when you share your thoughts and experiences with him?

User: I think he would be really happy and proud of me for opening up. That makes me feel good too.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It sounds like you are already thinking positively about this step. In our next sessions, we can explore any feelings that arise from these conversations with him. Does that sound good to you?

User: Yes, I’d like that! I want to keep feeling this way and not go back to how it was before.

Consultant: You're doing an excellent job by wanting to maintain this progress. Let's also create a plan for how you'll keep this connection with your dad active and thriving. How often do you see him now?

User: We see each other at least once every week now. It feels nice to have that time together.

Consultant: Weekly visits can definitely help maintain that bond! Would you like to set specific goals for these visits, like trying a new activity or discussing certain topics?

User: Yes! Maybe we could set a fun goal to try something new each week? I think it could be exciting.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Trying new things together could bring even more joy. What’s one new activity you’d love to try with your dad soon?

User: I’ve always wanted to try biking together. I think that would be so much fun!

Consultant: Biking sounds like a wonderful choice! It's active and allows for lots of sharing along the way. How do you feel about discussing this plan with him?

User: I feel confident! I think he would love the idea.

Consultant: Confidence is key! I'm glad to hear you're feeling positive about this. Let’s make sure to document your feelings after each outing, so you can see how this relationship continues to grow. Would you like to keep a little journal of your experiences?

User: Yes, I’d like that! It would help me remember everything.

Consultant: Keeping a journal is a great tool for reflection and growth. As we wrap up today, what’s the key takeaway you'd like to remember as you continue strengthening this relationship?

User: I want to remember to keep sharing more and to try new things together.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway! You're equipped with a wonderful plan for moving forward. It’s been a pleasure talking with you today. I truly believe you can maintain this positive emotional space and strengthen your family ties. 

User: Thank you! I feel happier after talking about all this. I can't wait for our next session! 

Consultant: I’m so happy to hear that! I look forward to our next session too. Remember, you’re making really meaningful progress, and I’m here to support you. Take care until then!
