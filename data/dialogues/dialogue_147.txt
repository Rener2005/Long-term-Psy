Consultant: Hello, J! I'm really glad you could come in today. How are you feeling right now?

User: Hi. I'm kind of anxious. I don't understand why I got in trouble at school. My teacher was upset with me because I fought with another kid.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like that situation has made you feel really confused and anxious. Can you tell me more about what happened in class?

User: We were playing a game, and I just got really mad when he wouldn’t let me have a turn. I pushed him, and then I got in trouble. I don't know why I did that.

Consultant: That sounds frustrating, especially when you just wanted to play. It’s okay to feel upset when things don't go your way. What do you think made you push him in that moment?

User: I don’t know… I just felt like I had to get my way, and I couldn’t help it. 

Consultant: It sounds like you felt a strong need to have a turn, and that led to a quick reaction. Sometimes our feelings can make us act in ways we don’t want to. How do you feel about what happened now?

User: I feel bad. I don't want to get in trouble again, but sometimes I just can't control myself. 

Consultant: That's understandable, J. Recognizing that you want to do better is a great step. In our sessions, we can work on strategies to help you manage those feelings. What kinds of things do you enjoy doing?

User: I like playing video games and drawing. 

Consultant: Those are great activities! How about we think of ways to use those interests to help with your feelings? Maybe we can come up with some games that help you practice taking turns or managing anger.

User: That could be fun. 

Consultant: Excellent! Incorporating games can make it easier and more enjoyable to learn new skills. Have you ever talked about how you feel when you're playing those games?

User: I usually feel happy, but if I lose, I get really mad sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a normal reaction when things don’t go as planned. Let’s try to find out what you can do in those moments when you start to feel that anger building up. What do you think would help you calm down?

User: Maybe I can take a break or do something else for a bit.

Consultant: Taking a break is a smart idea! It gives you time to cool off. We can practice that together. Would you like to role-play a situation where you might feel angry and how to take that break?

User: Yes, that sounds okay.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you’re playing with a friend, and they won’t let you have a turn. How might you feel in that moment?

User: I’d probably feel super mad.

Consultant: Right! And instead of pushing, you could say, “I need a break” or “Can we switch now?” How do you think you could practice that?

User: I can try saying those things next time. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing those words can help. It’s all about finding ways to express how you feel without reacting with anger. Would you like to think of a time in the past when you handled frustration well?

User: Yeah, once I played a game with my dad, and I lost, but I didn’t get mad. I just asked him to play again.

Consultant: That’s a perfect example! You communicated your feelings instead of acting out. Learning from those moments can help you more often, as we practice what to say and how to calm down.

User: I see. That makes sense. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we continue our sessions, we'll work on recognizing those feelings, finding the words to express them, and practicing calming techniques. Can you think of other activities that help you feel calm?

User: Sometimes I like to draw when I'm upset.

Consultant: Drawing is a wonderful outlet for expressing your feelings! If you ever feel overwhelmed, you could switch to drawing as a tool to help you calm down. 

User: Yeah! I really enjoy that.

Consultant: That’s great, J! Keep that in mind as we move along. Let’s also talk about how to share your feelings with your parents or teachers when something is bothering you. 

User: I usually just tell my mom, but I think she gets worried. 

Consultant: That’s understandable. It’s important to communicate how you feel, but we can work on finding ways to do that without causing extra worry. Maybe we can practice some words you can use to talk to her.

User: That would help!

Consultant: Perfect! Talking things through can help both you and your mom understand what you're feeling without her worrying too much. We’ll also work on ways to help you feel more in control of your feelings. 

User: Okay, I like that idea!

Consultant: Great! Let’s summarize what we discussed today. We talked about using breaks when you're angry, practicing expressing feelings, and using drawing as a calm-down tool. 

User: Yes, I remember that!

Consultant: Excellent! As we wrap up today, do you feel a bit better about how to handle situations at school?

User: Yes! I feel a little more confident.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, J! Remember, every small step is progress. If you keep practicing these strategies, you’ll get more comfortable around your friends. I look forward to seeing you again next time. 

User: Thank you! See you next time!

Consultant: Hello J! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately in school?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit frustrated. Sometimes I don’t know why I can’t focus in class, and it makes me worry that my classmates will laugh at me.

Consultant: That sounds tough, J. I understand that feeling frustrated can be really hard, especially when you're worried about what others think. Can you tell me more about what happens when you're trying to focus?

User: Sometimes I can pay attention, especially if it's something I like, like drawing. But other times, I just get distracted by noises or other kids.

Consultant: It sounds like certain things really grab your attention, like drawing, but outside sounds or movements can make it hard to stay focused. How do you feel when you're getting distracted?

User: I feel kind of sad and ashamed. I wish I could just ignore everything and do my work.

Consultant: I hear you, J. That feeling of sadness and shame can be really heavy. Let's think about what you can do when you notice those distractions. Have you tried any strategies to help yourself focus?

User: Not really. I don’t know what to do when I get distracted.

Consultant: That’s okay, J! We can work on some strategies together. How about we start with setting small goals for yourself? For example, you could try to focus on your task for just a few minutes, then take a short break. Would that be helpful?

User: Maybe. But what if I still can’t focus even for a few minutes?

Consultant: That’s a good point. It’s completely normal to feel that way. If you find it hard to focus, we can explore other ways to make it easier. For instance, we can work on creating a quiet workspace or using some calming techniques. Does that sound okay to you?

User: Yeah, that sounds good. But sometimes I feel like I need a reward to help me try harder.

Consultant: Rewards can be a great motivator! Let’s think about what kind of rewards would make you excited to try focusing. What do you like the most?

User: I love playing video games, and I also like stickers!

Consultant: Those are awesome rewards! We can set up a system where you earn time to play video games or stickers for every time you successfully focus for a few minutes. How does that sound?

User: That sounds cool! But what if I don’t get my reward?

Consultant: I understand your worry, J. Sometimes, when we don’t get our rewards quickly, we can feel disappointed. It’s important to remember that part of the learning process is understanding that we may have to wait for our rewards sometimes. What do you think about that notion?

User: I guess that makes sense, even if it’s hard to wait. 

Consultant: It’s normal to find waiting challenging, J. It’s all about finding ways to build your patience. We can work on thinking of it as a fun game you’re playing to help yourself concentrate. Would you be willing to give that a try?

User: Yeah, I’d like to try that! 

Consultant: Great! Now, can we brainstorm a small goal you would like to set for yourself during your next class?

User: Maybe I can try focusing on my math problems for five minutes?

Consultant: That’s a perfect goal, J! Focusing for five minutes on your math problems sounds very achievable. How about we set a timer for that? 

User: Yeah, I think using a timer will help! 

Consultant: Wonderful! After those five minutes, you can check how well you did. If you focused, you can treat yourself with a sticker or some game time afterward. Would that motivate you?

User: Yes! But what if I get distracted before the timer goes off?

Consultant: That’s totally okay! If distractions happen, we can learn to gently bring your focus back to your task. It’s like training a puppy—you keep encouraging it to listen and stay focused. Would you like to try that approach?

User: I can practice bringing my attention back. 

Consultant: That's the spirit, J! It’s all about practice. Each time you do this, you’ll improve little by little! How confident do you feel about trying this in your next class?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel that mix of nerves and excitement! Just remember, it’s a journey, and every attempt counts, even if it doesn’t go perfectly. Are you ready to embrace this challenge together?

User: Yes, I think I can do this!

Consultant: I’m really proud of you, J! And remember, I'm here to support you whenever you need. Let's see how it goes, and we can talk again about what worked and what didn’t. 

User: That sounds good. Thank you!

Consultant: Thank you for sharing with me today, J! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Remember, you're doing an amazing job!
###################
Consultant: Hello, J! I'm glad to see you today. I understand that you've been working on some things with your parents regarding rewards. How have you been feeling about that?

User: Hi! I feel a bit frustrated. Sometimes, I want my rewards right away, and when I don't get them, I think they aren't fair. 

Consultant: I can see how that might be frustrating, especially when you're looking forward to something. Can you tell me more about what kind of rewards you were hoping for recently?

User: I wanted some extra time on my tablet after finishing my homework, but it felt like it would take forever to get there.

Consultant: It sounds like you really enjoy that reward. Waiting for it can be tough! How do you feel when it seems like a long time before you get what you want?

User: I just feel upset and I start doubting if I can really earn it. I wish it could happen right away.

Consultant: That makes sense. It can be hard to stay patient. Let's think about how we can make this waiting feel a little easier. Have you ever thought about what it would feel like to wait for something and finally get it?

User: Yes, I remember waiting for my birthday. It felt like forever, but when it finally came, it was really fun!

Consultant: Great example! That anticipation mixed with excitement is something we can work on building. Do you think we could set up a mini plan that helps you see how waiting can lead to something special?

User: Sure! I’d like that.

Consultant: Wonderful! With your parents' help, we can create a simple chart together that shows small steps you can take towards getting your rewards. This way, you might start to see your progress. What do you think?

User: I think that might help. It would be nice to see where I am.

Consultant: Exactly! And maybe for each small step you accomplish, we can add a fun sticker or a mark on your chart. How does that sound?

User: That sounds really cool! I love stickers!

Consultant: Awesome! Now, let’s think of some small steps you could put on that chart. What’s one thing you think would be easy to start with?

User: I could try to finish my homework on time every day.

Consultant: Excellent choice, J! Completing your homework on time is a great starting point. If you do that for a week, can we think of a fun reward to celebrate? 

User: Yes! If I finish homework for a week, maybe I could have that extra tablet time.

Consultant: Perfect! That sounds like a fair trade. Now, if you find it hard to wait for the tablet time, what could you remind yourself about the fun of waiting?

User: I could remember how fun my birthday was when I waited!

Consultant: Exactly! That can be your reminder. And every time you feel frustrated, you could try thinking back to that exciting feeling. Is there anything else we could add to help you during those tough moments?

User: Maybe I could talk to my mom or dad about it if I feel upset.

Consultant: Yes, that's a great idea! Talking about how you feel can really help. How do you think your parents will respond when you share your feelings with them?

User: They usually listen and try to help, so I hope they can make me feel better.

Consultant: Sounds like you have supportive parents, which is wonderful! They can be your cheerleaders as you practice waiting for your rewards. What other thoughts do you have about this plan?

User: I like it! I feel excited about earning my rewards now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, J! It seems like we’re moving in the right direction. How about we set a date to check in on how things are going with your chart and your rewards?

User: Yes, let’s do that! I want to show you my chart.

Consultant: I can't wait to see it! Remember, even if it gets tough sometimes, you are practicing something really important—waiting and earning. You’re doing great already.

User: Thanks! I’m feeling better about it.

Consultant: I'm so pleased to hear that! As we finish up today, think about how focusing on the process can bring you joy too. What’s one thing you’ll do this week to celebrate your efforts?

User: I think I will draw a picture every time I get closer to my goal.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful way to express yourself! Drawing can be both fun and relaxing. Keep in mind that each step you take counts, and I’m excited to hear about your progress in our next session.

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to it too. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, J! Remember, I'm here to support you. Just keep practicing those skills we talked about. Have a great week, and I’ll see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hi J! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. I participated in a quick math competition at school. I didn't win, but I enjoyed it!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, J! It's great that you enjoyed the competition. Can you tell me more about what made you feel good during the competition?

User: I think it was nice to focus on the math problems and see how quickly I could solve them. I felt really concentrated.

Consultant: Focusing well and enjoying the process sounds like a big achievement, especially since concentration can be tough sometimes. How do you think this could help you in the future?

User: I think if I keep practicing, I can do even better next time. I want to enjoy it like I did this time.

Consultant: That's a fantastic mindset, J! Enjoying what you do often leads to better results. What steps do you think you could take to keep improving your concentration when you're learning or competing?

User: Maybe I could try to do some math games at home. That might help me practice more and have fun!

Consultant: Absolutely! Playing math games sounds like a fun way to practice and stay focused. How does that make you feel about your abilities in math?

User: It makes me feel like I can get better! I liked it when I did well in the competition.

Consultant: It's wonderful that you're feeling more confident. Remember, every time you practice and see improvement, it builds your confidence even more. Have you been able to talk to anyone at school about how you felt during the competition?

User: Not really. I usually talk to my mom about everything. I don't talk much with my dad or grandparents, though.

Consultant: That's understandable. It's great that you have your mom to talk to. What do you think would happen if you tried to share your excitement about the competition with your dad or grandparents?

User: I think they would be happy for me, but I just don't feel like talking to them as much.

Consultant: It's okay to feel that way. Sometimes, talking to different people can be a bit scary, especially if you're not used to it. What if we tried to think of a small way you could start a conversation with them about your experience?

User: I could show them my certificate for participating. Maybe that would make them interested!

Consultant: That's a great idea, J! Sharing your certificate is a wonderful way to start. It might spark a conversation about what you enjoyed and achieved. How would that make you feel?

User: I think it would make me feel proud, and they would think I did something good!

Consultant: Exactly, being proud of your hard work is very important! This could also help strengthen your relationship with them. What other situations do you think could help you practice your social skills?

User: Maybe during recess? I can try to play with other kids more.

Consultant: Playing with your classmates during recess is a perfect way to practice socializing. Is there something specific you would like to do with them?

User: I like playing tag! I think I could ask some friends to play that together.

Consultant: Asking friends to join you for tag sounds fantastic! It's a fun game and a great way to connect with others. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think it's a good idea. I want to try.

Consultant: It's natural to feel nervous, but remember, trying new things is part of growing. Plus, it sounds like you've already built a great foundation with your achievements. What do you think could help ease that nervousness?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it’s okay to just have fun and that they will probably want to play too!

Consultant: That's an excellent strategy, J! Focusing on the fun and the positive aspect can reduce anxiety. What else could you remind yourself of before you approach your friends?

User: I could tell myself I did well in the competition and that I am good at playing games.

Consultant: Absolutely! That's a powerful reminder. Celebrating your successes can boost your confidence. Would you like to set a small goal for the upcoming week related to playing with your friends?

User: I want to try asking someone to play tag at least once!

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect goal! Remember, even if it's just one time, each step counts. How will you feel once you accomplish that goal?

User: I think I’d feel really happy! And maybe a bit more confident for next time.

Consultant: That happiness and increased confidence are essential. You’re doing great work by being aware of your feelings and setting goals for yourself. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you'd like to talk about today?

User: I think I'm good! I'm excited to try playing tag and remember what we talked about.

Consultant: I'm excited for you too, J! You've made fantastic progress today. Remember to celebrate your efforts, and know that it’s okay to feel a bit nervous. I believe in you! 

User: Thank you! I really enjoyed talking today.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, J! I look forward to hearing about how your week goes. Bye for now, and keep up the great work!
###################
Consultant: Hello J! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling about your time at school lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good. I’m a bit more confident in talking with my classmates. I even participated in a group discussion last week!

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, J! It sounds like you've made some really great progress. Can you tell me more about how you felt during that group discussion?

User: Well, at first I was a bit nervous, but then I realized it was fun to share my ideas. I didn’t feel as scared to speak up.

Consultant: It’s great that you found it fun and could overcome your nervousness. What do you think helped you feel more comfortable during that discussion?

User: I think I just remembered that everyone was nice and wanted to hear what I had to say. Plus, I practiced what I wanted to share before!

Consultant: Practicing sounds like a very helpful strategy! How does it feel to know that your ideas were valued by your classmates?

User: It feels awesome! I felt like I was part of the group. I want to keep talking with them.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal, J. Engaging with your classmates is an important part of building friendships. What are some ways you think you could keep that connection going?

User: Maybe I could invite them to play games during recess or work together on school projects.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Playing games and collaborating can really strengthen those friendships. What kinds of games do you enjoy?

User: I like playing tag and sometimes hide and seek. They’re really fun!

Consultant: Tag and hide and seek are great choices for group play! They also help everyone interact and engage as a team. How do you feel when you play those games with your friends?

User: I feel happy and excited. It’s nice to run around and laugh together.

Consultant: That happiness is so important! Being active and having fun with friends helps build those social skills. How about during quieter moments, like when you’re sitting in class—do you still feel confident?

User: I think so! I've been trying to raise my hand more often to answer questions. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Raising your hand is a huge step in participating in class. What motivates you to answer questions more often?

User: I want to show my teacher that I know the answers and also learn more things.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic motivation, J! Wanting to learn and show your understanding is a great mindset. When you do raise your hand, how do you usually feel before and after?

User: Before, I feel a little scared, but afterwards I feel proud of myself for trying.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! Feeling scared before taking a risk is normal, but celebrating your pride afterwards shows how brave you are. Would you be open to trying some role-playing games today that focus on responding to others' emotions?

User: Sure! That sounds fun.

Consultant: Great! These role-playing games will help you recognize different emotions and practice responding. Let’s start with a simple scenario. I’ll pretend to be a classmate who looks sad. You can try to figure out how to help them. Ready?

User: I’m ready!

Consultant: Alright, here we go. (Consultant pretends to look sad.) Oh, hi J. I don’t know what to do. I lost my favorite toy!

User: I’m sorry! That sounds really sad. Do you want to look for it together?

Consultant: That’s a perfect response, J! Offering to help shows you care. It’s important to let someone know they’re not alone. How does role-playing like this make you feel?

User: It feels good! I like helping people.

Consultant: Helping others is a great quality to have and shows your empathy. What do you think are some other ways you could help if you see someone feeling upset?

User: Maybe I could ask them if they want to talk about it or just sit with them. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful suggestions! Talking and being present are very supportive. Keep practicing these skills, and you'll continue to build strong connections. I’ve seen you grow a lot, J. How do you feel about your progress in developing your social skills?

User: I feel really happy! I’ve been working hard, and I can see my changes.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! You’re doing fantastic, and your hard work is paying off. As we wrap up today, what do you think is your biggest takeaway from this session?

User: I think it’s that being brave to talk and help others is really important.

Consultant: Absolutely, J! Being brave and compassionate is key to forming connections. Remember, it’s a journey, and you’re on the right path. If you ever feel unsure, just remember the skills we’ve practiced. You'll do great! 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate it. I feel ready to keep trying!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, J. I’m proud of you for all your efforts. Keep up the great work, and know that I’m here to support you whenever you need it. Looking forward to hearing about your next adventures with classmates!
