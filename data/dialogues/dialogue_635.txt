Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling lately regarding your career choices?

User: Hello, I've been feeling really anxious. With graduation approaching, my parents are putting a lot of pressure on me to give up my plans for a maritime job and return home. I'm really torn about what to do.

Consultant: That sounds like a very stressful situation. You're caught between your own desires and your parents' expectations, which can be quite overwhelming. Can you tell me more about your feelings regarding the maritime job and why it's important for you?

User: I love the idea of working on the sea. It has always been my dream, but my parents want me to find a stable job at home. I'm worried that if I pursue my dream, I’ll disappoint them.

Consultant: It's understandable that you feel this way. Your passion for working at sea is significant, and it's equally important to consider your parents' concerns. What thoughts come to mind when you think about following your dream versus staying home? 

User: I often think about how disappointed my parents would be, and it makes me feel guilty. But at the same time, the idea of a desk job at home seems suffocating to me.

Consultant: It seems like you are experiencing a conflict between your interests and your sense of obligation to your parents. Let's take a closer look at these thoughts. What specific thoughts cross your mind when you think about remaining at home versus pursuing your passion?

User: I worry that if I leave for the maritime job, my parents will think I'm irresponsible. I keep thinking that it's not the "smart" choice. 

Consultant: Those thoughts can indeed be heavy to carry. It sounds like you’re interpreting your desire to work at sea as a sign of irresponsibility. Let's explore that a bit. What evidence do you have that pursuing your dream would be a reckless decision?

User: I guess I've never really thought of it that way. I feel like I've been raised to prioritize stability, and going for this dream might contradict those values.

Consultant: Acknowledging how your upbringing shapes your views is a strong first step. Can we consider other perspectives? How would a friend or someone you admire see your ambition to work at sea?

User: They would probably encourage me to chase my dream, telling me that it's important to do what I love. I just feel so held back by my parents’ expectations.

Consultant: That's a valuable insight. It's great that you recognize the support you might receive from friends. Let’s think about how you might communicate your passions to your parents. What do you want to express to them about your desire to work at sea?

User: I want them to understand that this job means a lot to me, that it’s not just a whim. But I'm not sure how to start that conversation without it turning into an argument.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel apprehensive about that discussion. What if we brainstorm some points you could use to express your feelings constructively? It could help prevent miscommunication or tension.

User: Yeah, I think that could help. I could talk about the advantages of the maritime job, like the skills I would develop and the opportunities it could bring. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid approach! Focusing on the positives can help frame your ambitions in a way that highlights their value. How do you think your parents might react to those points?

User: They might still be skeptical, but I think they’d appreciate that I’m thinking about my future seriously.

Consultant: Exactly! Presenting your thoughts thoughtfully could open a dialogue rather than a debate. How would you feel if they were receptive to your passion and took time to discuss it with you rationally?

User: That would be such a relief. I just want them to see that I have thought this through and that I'm serious about it.

Consultant: It's perfectly reasonable to want that validation. Building trust through open communication about your goals can be key. What steps might you take to prepare for this conversation?

User: I think I could write down my thoughts and plans to express them clearly, maybe even rehearse a bit to feel more confident.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Rehearsing your points can certainly help you present them more clearly. How do you feel now about taking this step towards communicating with your parents?

User: I feel a bit more encouraged. It still feels daunting, but at least I have a plan now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Having a plan can help reduce anxiety. Before we finish, let's recap what you've learned today. What strategies will you take moving forward?

User: I’ll articulate my desires clearly, consider the positive aspects of pursuing my dream job, and rehearse what I want to say to my parents.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! It sounds like you’re making progress in balancing your aspirations with your family dynamics. Remember, it’s okay to seek support as you navigate these discussions. 

User: Thank you! I feel more confident about tackling this. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! I'm happy to hear that. Remember, you're not alone in this journey; if you need more support, I'm here for you.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you could join me today. I want to start by checking in with you. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite lost actually. After that serious talk with my parents, their opposition to my career choice has become even stronger. It’s making me doubt my own decisions about the future.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're feeling helpless and confused because of the differing expectations from your parents and your own desires. Can you tell me more about that conversation with them?

User: Sure. I tried to explain why I want to work at sea, but they kept insisting that it’s risky and that I should find a stable job back home. It just made me feel more frustrated and trapped.

Consultant: It seems like you were really trying to communicate your passion, but their response left you feeling frustrated and trapped. What do you think your parents are most concerned about?

User: I think they're just worried about my safety and want me to have a secure future. They believe that a land job would provide more stability than working at sea.

Consultant: That makes sense. Their concerns come from a place of care. How does that make you feel about their expectations versus your aspirations?

User: Honestly, it makes me feel inadequate. Like I can’t make my own choices without disappointing them. I really want to pursue my interest, but their resistance is discouraging.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. Balancing your own aspirations with your family's expectations can be really tough. How do you think you could express your feelings and aspirations to them in a way that they might understand better?

User: I think I need to show them how passionate I am about this career. Maybe I could share my plans and research on the safety and opportunities in this field.

Consultant: That sounds like a good strategy. By preparing information to present to your parents, you could help them see your perspective. What specific points do you think would help reassure them about your decision?

User: I think highlighting the safety measures in the industry and opportunities for growth might make them feel less worried. I could also explain my vision and goals in this field.

Consultant: Great! It looks like you have some solid ideas to share with them. How would you feel about actively planning that conversation with them?

User: I feel hesitant but also a bit hopeful. If I could explain my perspective better, maybe they would see things differently.

Consultant: It’s perfectly natural to feel hesitant, but hope is a positive step forward. Would role-playing how that conversation might go help you feel more prepared? 

User: Yes, that might help. I always get nervous when talking to them about this.

Consultant: Alright, let’s practice together. Imagine you’re starting the conversation. What would your opening statement be?

User: I would start by saying, "I appreciate your concerns, and I want to share my thoughts on why working at sea is important to me."

Consultant: That’s a great start! It sounds respectful and opens the door to dialogue. How do you think they might respond to that statement?

User: I think they might still be skeptical, but at least I would have expressed my gratitude for their care.

Consultant: Yes, acknowledging their concerns is key! After you share your opening statement, what could you say next to further clarify your intentions?

User: I could explain how much I enjoy my studies and why pursuing this career excites me. I could also share my research about the career path.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your passion and knowledge is a great way to show your commitment. What if they still push back against your decision? How might you navigate that?

User: I guess I could try to remain calm and ask them to share their worries again. I’d like to address their concerns more directly.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach. Engaging them in dialogue can help keep the conversation from becoming confrontational. What do you think would be the most challenging part of this conversation for you?

User: I think it’s handling their disappointment if they're still opposed. I really don’t want to hurt them.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It shows you care deeply for their feelings. Remember, you can express your own feelings while also acknowledging theirs. How might you do that?

User: I could say something like, “I understand that this is hard for you, but my dreams are also important to me.”

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a beautiful way to express both your feelings and validation for theirs. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about taking this step and having that conversation with your parents?

User: I feel more empowered to approach them now. I might not have all the answers they want, but I have a plan.

Consultant: That’s a huge step forward! It’s great to hear you feel empowered. Remember, open communication is key, and you’re allowed to express your own wishes. How do you want to prepare for our next session?

User: I’ll plan that conversation and see how it goes. I would like to share the outcome next time.

Consultant: Wonderful! I look forward to hearing how it goes and discussing any further feelings that arise. You’ve made significant progress today. Thank you for sharing, and take care until our next session!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today, B. How have things been going since our last session?

User: Hi! Well, I've started looking for internships related to marine engineering, and it's been a mix of excitement and anxiety. I really want to experience what it's like to work at sea, but I still worry about what my parents think.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're taking steps toward your interest in marine engineering. It sounds like you're feeling both motivated and a bit anxious about sharing this with your parents. Could you share more about what concerns you when you think about their opinions?

User: I guess I’m afraid they won’t support my decision. They really want me to come back home after graduation and work on something more stable. I don’t want to disappoint them, but I also want to follow my passion.

Consultant: That sounds like a tough situation to be in. Balancing your desire to pursue your passion with your parents' expectations can be challenging. What do you think it would feel like to openly discuss your interests with them?

User: I think it could be relieving to talk about it, but I'm really worried about their reaction. What if they don’t understand?

Consultant: It's understandable to feel worried about their reaction. Have there been any specific moments in your past discussions that made you feel this way?

User: Yes, there have been times when I brought up my thoughts about the future, and they seemed skeptical. They really emphasize the importance of financial stability.

Consultant: It sounds like their concerns come from a place of wanting the best for you. However, it's also important to consider your own desires and interests. How do you think you could approach the conversation to express both your ambitions and address their concerns?

User: Maybe I could explain the job opportunities in marine engineering and how I see it as a stable career. I just don’t know how to make them see that.

Consultant: That’s a good strategy—providing them with information might help bridge the gap. You could also share how passionate you feel about this career. What can you do to prepare for that conversation to feel more confident?

User: I could research the marine engineering industry and gather examples of successful people in the field. That would give me some concrete points to discuss.

Consultant: That's a proactive approach! Gathering information can empower you and might help you feel more at ease when discussing with your parents. How are you feeling about your upcoming internship search?

User: I'm feeling more motivated now, and I’ve applied to a couple of internships. I think actually getting experience will help me feel more secure in my choices.

Consultant: Taking action is an excellent way to build confidence. Reflecting on what you learn during your internship can help solidify your career goals. What specific skills or experiences are you hoping to gain from these internships?

User: I want to learn more about the technical side of marine engineering—like how the systems work on a ship and how to handle them in real situations.

Consultant: Great focus! Gaining hands-on experience will definitely help clarify your interests. In addition to the technical skills, how might the experience influence your conversations with your parents about your career?

User: I think if I can show them what I’ve learned and how passionate I am after the internship, it might change their perspective.

Consultant: That's a promising mindset. Real-world experiences can often speak louder than words. When you have these discussions with them, how do you envision expressing your passion?

User: I could share stories from my internship or even show them some of the projects I’m involved in. That might help them see how serious I am.

Consultant: Sharing your experiences and showing your commitment can be very impactful. Remember, it's also important to be open to their concerns while expressing your own feelings. What might your next steps look like to make both your internship search and conversations with your parents happen?

User: I think I’ll keep applying for internships while preparing information to talk to my parents. Maybe I can set a time to sit down and have an honest conversation.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Setting a specific time can help you approach the discussion with intention. How do you feel about moving forward with this plan?

User: I feel more confident now. It's nice to have a plan. I just hope it goes well.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel apprehensive, but having a clear plan can make the process easier. Remember to take it step by step, and we can discuss how it goes in our next session. Is there anything else you’d like to focus on today?

User: I think I’m good for now. I appreciate your help!

Consultant: You’re welcome, B! It’s great to see you feeling more optimistic. As you continue on this journey, remember that it's okay to seek support whenever you need it. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session! Take care.
###################
Consultant: Hello B! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better about my career options, but I still find it hard to talk to my parents about what I want. There’s this gap between what they expect and what I really want to do.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you feel a bit better about your options! Let's explore this gap you mentioned. Can you share what specifically makes those conversations with your parents challenging for you?

User: I think it’s mainly because they have this strong expectation for me to return home and take a stable job. I want to be an offshore engineer, but I feel like they don’t understand that passion. It makes me anxious to talk to them about it.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Wanting to pursue your passion while feeling pressure from your parents can create a lot of tension. What emotions do you experience when you think about discussing your career choice with them?

User: I often feel anxious and a bit frustrated. I want them to understand my perspective, but it feels like they only care about their traditional views.

Consultant: It sounds like there's a lot of frustration stemming from that disconnect. Could you tell me more about the thoughts that come to your mind during these anxious moments?

User: I often think things like, "What if they get really upset?" or "They’ll never accept my choice." Those thoughts just keep looping in my head, making it harder to talk to them.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem to reinforce your anxiety. Let’s examine these beliefs together—how likely do you think it is that your parents would react negatively if you were to share your passion with them?

User: I guess I can’t be sure how they’d react. Maybe they wouldn’t be as harsh as I imagine. But it’s just hard to believe that they would support me.

Consultant: It’s normal to have concern about potential negative reactions. Wouldn’t it be beneficial to explore this fear of their reaction a bit more? What evidence supports the idea that they wouldn’t be supportive?

User: Well, in the past, they’ve mentioned wanting me to have a stable job, and they didn’t seem to take my interest in offshore engineering seriously. So, I guess that’s what makes me think they won’t support me now.

Consultant: I can see how their previous comments would lead you to feel that way. However, people can change their views over time. Is there a possibility that by sharing more about your passion and the reasons behind it, they might be open to understanding your perspective?

User: Maybe if I explain what interests me about the job and how I see my future in it, they might start to understand. 

Consultant: That sounds like a promising approach! How do you feel about developing a plan to communicate your feelings and aspirations to them, taking it step by step?

User: I like that idea. It makes me feel a little more in control of the situation. But I’m still worried I might break down during the conversation.

Consultant: It's definitely understandable to feel that way. Maybe we can practice some ways for you to express your thoughts calmly. What if we role-play a conversation, so you can feel more prepared?

User: That could help. I would feel less anxious knowing what to say in advance.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s try that. You can start by telling me what you would say about your interest in being an offshore engineer.

User: Okay, I’d probably start with something like, “I know you want the best for me, but I have a real passion for offshore engineering. It’s something I truly enjoy and see a future in.”

Consultant: That’s a strong opening! How do you think they might respond to that?

User: I think they might ask why I can’t just settle for something safer. 

Consultant: Good point. You can respond to that by explaining how offshore work can be fulfilling and secure too, with examples of how it offers stability. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds like a fair response. I could share some facts about the industry to back it up.

Consultant: Absolutely! Being well-informed can help strengthen your case. As you prepare, remember to take deep breaths and pace yourself during the conversation. Would you feel confident approaching them after our practice?

User: I think I would. Just having a plan makes me feel better equipped.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s all about feeling prepared and supported. As we move towards the end of our session, how would you evaluate your progress regarding your feelings about this conversation?

User: I definitely feel more confident now. I’ve got a clearer idea of what to say, and I’m trying to keep my emotions in check.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! You're taking important steps toward maintaining your autonomy in decision-making. Before we close, let’s think about how you can keep this positive momentum going. What could you do if you start to feel anxious before you talk to your parents?

User: I could remind myself of the reasons I want this for myself and maybe practice deep breathing again.

Consultant: Excellent strategies! Maintaining that self-reflection and calmness can really help. Remember, it’s okay to seek understanding and clarity. If you find yourself needing further support, feel free to come back anytime. You’ve made significant progress today.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and feel much better about everything.

Consultant: You’re more than welcome! I believe in your ability to navigate these discussions. Keep being true to yourself, and take care. I look forward to hearing about your experience next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit anxious about my career choices. Thanks to my internship and courses, I have a clearer understanding of my major, but the pressure from my parents about my future is overwhelming at times.

Consultant: It sounds like you're gaining confidence in your chosen field, but the external expectations from your parents are causing some anxiety. Can you share more about what specifically triggers those anxious feelings regarding your career decisions?

User: Yes, my parents really want me to come back home after I graduate and not pursue a job at sea. They work hard in foreign trade, and they want me to have a stable life. But I feel passionate about working on ships, and it's tough to reconcile these feelings.

Consultant: I understand that there’s a conflict between your aspirations and your parents' expectations, which can be quite stressful. What would it mean for you to pursue your passion for working at sea, despite your parents' wishes?

User: It would mean a lot to me. I want to feel fulfilled in my career, and being at sea has always been a dream of mine. But at the same time, I worry about disappointing my parents or creating tension in our relationship.

Consultant: That’s completely valid. Finding a balance between your dreams and family expectations is crucial. Can we explore what specific thoughts come to mind when you think about disappointing your parents? 

User: I often think that they will feel let down, or that I won't succeed in the way they hope I would. Sometimes, I even question my own decisions, making me feel more anxious.

Consultant: It seems like you're caught in a cycle of negative thoughts about potential outcomes. Let’s examine those thoughts more closely. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that pursuing your career at sea will be disappointing for them?

User: I guess there’s no concrete evidence. They've always emphasized stability and wealth, which makes me think they wouldn’t see a marine career as successful.

Consultant: That perception is common, but it might be helpful to consider alternative viewpoints. If a friend were in your position, what might you say to encourage him to follow his passion despite his family's wishes?

User: I think I would tell him to pursue what makes him happy and that he needs to communicate openly with his family about his choices.

Consultant: Exactly! Communication is key. How do you feel about the possibility of sharing your passion and thoughts with your parents in a similar way?

User: I’d like to, but I’m just not sure how they would respond. What if they become angry or dismiss my feelings?

Consultant: It’s natural to feel apprehensive. If the conversation shifts to arguments, we can prepare for that. What if we brainstorm some ways to express your feelings and desires respectfully?

User: That sounds good. Maybe I could start by expressing my gratitude for their support and then share my dreams?

Consultant: Yes! Starting with appreciation sets a positive tone. What are some phrases or points you think you would want to include when you talk to them?

User: I’d probably tell them how much I value their opinions but also emphasize how important it is for me to feel fulfilled and happy in my work. 

Consultant: That’s a great start. By communicating your feelings genuinely, you're likely to open up a more constructive dialogue. What would you like to focus on next in our session today?

User: I’d like to work on reducing my anxiety about their potential reactions. I want to feel more confident in my decisions before talking to them.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reducing anxiety is key. Let’s explore some coping strategies you can use when those anxious feelings arise. What have you tried in the past?

User: I haven’t really tried any specific techniques yet. I usually just feel overwhelmed and avoid thinking about it.

Consultant: Avoidance can be tempting, but facing those feelings can help. How about we try a technique like deep breathing or visualizing a positive outcome when you think about the conversation?

User: Deep breathing sounds manageable. I can visualize a calm discussion where they listen to me.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s practice a simple deep breathing exercise now to help you relax. Inhale deeply… hold for a few seconds… and exhale slowly. How does that make you feel?

User: That feels comforting. I think I can use that before talking with them.

Consultant: Excellent! Using breathing techniques can help ground you during high-stress situations. Let’s also think about potential questions your parents might ask and prepare some thoughtful responses. What might those be?

User: They might ask about job security and how much money I can make working at sea.

Consultant: That’s a likely concern. How can you address those potential questions in a way that conveys your passion while acknowledging their worries?

User: I could explain that while it's true there can be risks, I’ve researched the industry, and there are opportunities for growth and stability too.

Consultant: That's a solid plan. Providing them with information shows you’re making an informed choice. Reflecting on our conversation, how are you feeling about your career goals now and your ability to communicate them to your parents?

User: I feel more prepared and less anxious. I think I have a clearer view of how to approach the situation. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Progress is about taking steps forward, and you’re doing just that. To wrap up, let’s summarize what you’ve learned today and discuss how to stay confident moving forward.

User: Sure! I learned breathing techniques can help calm my anxiety, and I should communicate my feelings to my parents clearly while being respectful.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve made great strides in understanding both your feelings and how to communicate them. As you move forward, remember to trust in your decisions and reach out for support if you need it. I'm here whenever you need to talk. 

User: Thank you! This session was really helpful. I appreciate your guidance! 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to hearing how things go in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. As we start our session, I want to understand how you've been feeling lately, especially with your graduation approaching. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety. I really enjoy my studies and have a passion for working at sea, but my parents want me to come back home and not work on a ship. I’m preparing to have another talk with them about my future, and I’m not sure how to approach it.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re navigating some important decisions and emotions right now. Balancing your aspirations and your parents’ wishes can be challenging. Can you tell me more about your thoughts on this upcoming conversation with them?

User: I feel anxious about it. I want them to understand my passion for working at sea, but I’m worried they might not be supportive. It’s important for me to get their approval, but I also want to follow my dream.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. It’s completely natural to want both support and the chance to pursue your interests. What would it mean for you to have their understanding and support regarding your decision?

User: It would mean a lot to me. I want to feel that my parents believe in me and my choices. It would make me more confident about my path forward.

Consultant: Seeking your parents' belief in you is a significant aspect of your decision-making process. What do you envision as the best outcome from this discussion with them?

User: Ideally, they would accept my choice and see that working at sea is what truly makes me happy. I want them to see that this isn't just a phase for me—it’s my passion.

Consultant: It sounds like having their acceptance and understanding is a core part of your happiness. Have you thought about how you could communicate your feelings and ambitions to them during the conversation?

User: I think I need to clearly explain why I want this job and how it aligns with my values. But I don’t know how to start this conversation. I’m worried they will just dismiss my feelings.

Consultant: Starting the conversation can indeed be daunting. One approach might be to share your passion directly—what draws you to working at sea and how it feels meaningful to you. How do you think they might react to hearing about your passion?

User: I hope they might be moved by my enthusiasm. But I’m also afraid they’ll focus on the risks and uncertainty of the job instead.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those doubts. They care about your well-being, which may be why they emphasize the risks. How do you think you could address their concerns while still sharing your passion?

User: Maybe I could prepare some information about the industry and talk about the career prospects. I could show them that I’ve thought this through and it’s a viable path.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Presenting well-researched information can help alleviate their worries. It shows that you’re serious and responsible about your career choices. What other things could you do to manage the conversation’s direction?

User: I could maybe ask them questions to understand their concerns better. If I know what worries them, I can address those specifically.

Consultant: That’s a thoughtful approach! Engaging them in dialogue could foster understanding. What specific questions do you think might help uncover their concerns?

User: I could ask them what their biggest worries are about my decision and why they prefer I don’t work at sea. That way, I can respond to their points directly.

Consultant: Excellent! By directly addressing their concerns, you may help ease their apprehension. Can you think of any ways to remind yourself to stay calm and focused during the conversation?

User: I think I’ll take some deep breaths before we start talking. Also, reminding myself that this is about sharing my passion might help me feel more grounded.

Consultant: Those strategies sound beneficial. Remaining calm and centered will help you communicate more effectively. As you prepare for your conversation, what is one thing you're aiming to convey most clearly to your parents?

User: I want them to understand that pursuing this career is not just a job for me but a calling. It’s something I’ve thought about deeply and truly care about.

Consultant: That’s a powerful message. Your conviction can speak volumes. As we wrap up, how do you feel about the insights and strategies we've discussed today? Do they give you more confidence for your conversation?

User: Yes, I feel more prepared now. I have a clearer idea of how to express my thoughts and handle their potential objections. Thank you for helping me sort through this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm glad to hear that you feel more confident. Remember, it’s all about open communication and sharing your passions. If you find you need further support after your conversation, feel free to reach out. Good luck!

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your support and guidance.
