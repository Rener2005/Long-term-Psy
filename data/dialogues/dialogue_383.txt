Consultant: Hello, Deborah! It's great to see you today. I want to start by understanding how you've been feeling since our last session. What's on your mind?

User: Hi. I’ve been trying to get out of the house more, but I still feel a lot of guilt and fear. Every time I think about going to work, it takes me a long time to prepare mentally.

Consultant: I can see that it's still quite challenging for you. Preparing mentally can feel overwhelming. Can you share more about what thoughts or feelings come up during that preparation?

User: I often think that people will judge me or that I'm not capable of handling things on my own. It makes me feel ashamed and anxious.

Consultant: Those thoughts about judgment and feelings of shame can be really heavy. When you think about others judging you, how does that make you feel inside?

User: It makes me feel even more anxious and like I want to avoid going out altogether. Sometimes, I just wish I could stay at home and not deal with it.

Consultant: Avoiding those situations can feel like a relief in the moment, but it can also keep you stuck in that cycle of fear. What do you think would happen if you faced the situation instead?

User: I'm not sure. Part of me thinks it might be okay, but the fear of facing people is really strong. I don’t want to embarrass myself.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. Let's explore that fear a bit more—can you tell me a specific situation where you felt anxious about encountering someone?

User: There was a day last week when I saw a colleague I hadn't talked to in a while. I just froze and hurried past them without saying anything.

Consultant: That sounds like a tough moment. Freezing can be a common reaction when we’re overwhelmed. What thoughts went through your mind in that moment?

User: I thought they might notice how nervous I was and think I wasn’t capable or had changed too much. 

Consultant: That’s a tough thought to carry. Have you ever had moments where you felt more confident speaking with colleagues? 

User: Sometimes, when I’m prepared or have a good day, I feel a bit better. But those days are rare.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you have those better days. What do you think makes those days different for you?

User: When I feel more in control of my feelings, or if I manage to distract myself before interacting with others.

Consultant: So it sounds like having some control over your feelings can help. What are some ways you could prepare yourself for those interactions to feel more in control?

User: Maybe I could practice what I want to say beforehand or remind myself that it's okay to nervous.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Deborah. Practicing can definitely help. Let’s take a moment to think about an approach you can use the next time you feel anxious about facing someone. How might you reassure yourself in that moment?

User: I guess I could tell myself that everyone feels nervous sometimes and that it's okay to be human. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Remembering that could help ease some of that pressure. How would it feel to say that to yourself before you go out?

User: It sounds comforting. Maybe it would help me breathe a little easier.

Consultant: That's exactly the right direction. Breathing and positive self-talk can be very effective. What do you think might be a first step for you to put this into practice the next time you go out?

User: I think just focusing on my breathing before leaving the house could be a start, and maybe visualizing a friendly interaction.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Visualizing positive interactions can shift your mindset. How about for our next session, you try this approach and share how it went?

User: That sounds good. I’ll definitely try it. 

Consultant: Fantastic, Deborah! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences. Before we end today, is there anything else you want to discuss or reflect on?

User: I think I've shared a lot today. I still feel anxious, but I appreciate the strategies we talked about.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. Remember, it’s a process, and every step counts. You’re making progress, and I’m here to support you. Thank you for sharing with me today, and take care until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Deborah! I'm really glad you're here today. I want to talk about what you've been feeling, especially regarding your recent attempts to go out alone and the anxiety you experience when you encounter familiar faces.

User: Hi. I've been trying to go out more on my own, but every time I see someone I know, I feel this overwhelming panic. It's really frustrating. I wish I could just enjoy being outside without that fear creeping in.

Consultant: It sounds like you're making progress by going out more, which is commendable! But it also seems that seeing familiar people triggers a lot of anxiety for you. Can you describe what thoughts go through your mind when you encounter someone you know?

User: Well, I panic and think that they will judge me or that I have nothing interesting to say. I feel like I'm a burden to them, and I just want to run away.

Consultant: Those thoughts of being judged and feeling like a burden can be really intense. Let’s explore them a bit. What evidence do you have that supports these thoughts? Have you received any feedback from those familiar faces that might suggest they're judging you negatively?

User: I guess I don't have any solid proof. It's just this feeling I carry from the past. I remember being judged a lot during my childhood, so now I just assume that's how everyone sees me.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that. It’s understandable that past experiences shape how you perceive situations now. However, it might be helpful to challenge that thinking. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about how their thoughts might not reflect reality?

User: I would probably tell them that people are not as focused on them as they think and that everyone has their own worries. Perhaps they are just happy to see them.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! Let’s try to apply that to your situation. Instead of assuming everyone is judging you, what if you shift your focus to the idea that they might be happy to see you? How would that change your feelings about encountering familiar faces?

User: I think it might make me feel a little less anxious, like maybe I can just enjoy the moment instead of overthinking it.

Consultant: Exactly! We can also practice some scenarios together. How about we role-play a situation where you run into someone you know? This could help build your confidence and find new ways to engage. Would you like to try that?

User: Yes, I think that could be helpful. I’m a bit nervous, but I also want to try. 

Consultant: That's totally okay! Let's start simple. Imagine you're walking down the street, and you see someone you know. How would you typically respond in that moment?

User: I usually freeze and just wave awkwardly, feeling embarrassed. 

Consultant: That’s a common reaction. Let’s try instead to practice a more engaged response. If you were feeling more confident, what would you say when you see them?

User: Maybe I could say, “Hi! It's great to see you! How have you been?” That feels a bit more natural.

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a wonderful response. Let’s practice delivering that line. Remember, it’s about being genuine. How would it feel to say that?

User: It feels a bit scary but also a little liberating to think I could say that instead of just freezing. 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Embracing the discomfort can lead to growth. Remember, it’s okay to feel a bit anxious, but taking action like this can truly help reduce those feelings over time. After practicing, how do you think you'd feel in that scenario?

User: I think I’d feel more proud of myself, even if I’m still a bit anxious. Just taking that step feels significant. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Acknowledging your efforts is key. Let's set a goal for your next outing—could you try saying that line to someone you encounter, and just see how it goes?

User: Yes, I’ll definitely try that! I feel a little more prepared now. 

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Remember to celebrate that effort, no matter the outcome. We're all a work in progress. So, as we go from here, let’s talk about how you can continue to challenge those thoughts about being judged and focus on connecting with others. 

User: I really appreciate that. It helps to talk it out. Though I still feel a little isolated at company gatherings, I’m proud of stepping out more often.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you’re recognizing your achievements, even when it’s challenging. As we wrap up today’s session, what strategies can you take with you to help you feel less isolated at these gatherings?

User: I think I can remind myself that people might enjoy seeing me and that I am not a burden. Plus, I guess I can always practice my greeting lines!

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! You've made significant strides today. Remember, it’s about gradual progress, and each step counts. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out again. You’re doing amazing work, and I'm proud of you.

User: Thank you! That means a lot. I feel more equipped to handle things now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep embracing those small victories. Looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care!

User: Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Deborah! I'm glad to see you again. Before we start, I'd like to hear about how you've been feeling since our last session.

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a mix of emotions. I managed to go to a company gathering recently, but I still felt quite isolated, even though I was proud of myself for attending.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you attended the gathering! Feeling isolated in social situations can be tough, but recognizing your effort is so important. Could you share a bit more about what made you feel isolated during the gathering?

User: I just felt out of place and like I didn’t belong. Even when I tried to engage with others, it felt forced, and I was worried they could sense my discomfort.

Consultant: That’s a very valid feeling, Deborah. It sounds like part of you wanted to connect, but you also felt a barrier. What thoughts were going through your mind at that moment, and how did those influence how you interacted?

User: I kept thinking that everyone else was having a good time, and I was just a burden. I felt awkward and didn't know what to say, which made me feel even more anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts were impacting your experience significantly. When you thought you might be a burden, how did that make you feel emotionally?

User: It made me feel ashamed and frustrated. I wished I could just relax like everyone else and not care so much.

Consultant: Shame can be a heavy emotion to carry. Let’s explore that thought about being a burden. How much evidence do you think there is to support that idea? Is it possible there could be other interpretations of the situation?

User: I guess I thought it was obvious I was struggling, but maybe others were focused on their own conversations and didn't notice me as much as I thought.

Consultant: That’s an insightful realization, Deborah. If a friend were in your shoes, feeling like a burden, what would you say to them?

User: I would tell them that everyone has off days and that it's okay to feel uncomfortable sometimes.

Consultant: That’s very compassionate advice! Perhaps you can apply that same kindness to yourself. What might it feel like to give yourself permission to experience discomfort without judgment?

User: I think it could be freeing, like releasing an unnecessary weight. I really want to become more comfortable in social situations.

Consultant: That's a wonderful realization! Exploring ways to gradually engage in social situations can be helpful. What are some small steps you might take to feel more at ease in gatherings?

User: Maybe I could practice talking to one or two colleagues before larger events. That feels a bit less intimidating.

Consultant: That sounds like a manageable plan. Connecting with just a couple of people could help build your confidence. How do you think you might feel before and after these smaller interactions?

User: I would likely feel more prepared and hopefully less anxious, especially if I start to build some rapport with them.

Consultant: Exactly! Building connections this way can help ease some of the anxiety. As we continue working together, how do you feel about sharing more of your experiences with the group? It might ease some of the feelings associated with isolation.

User: I think sharing could help, but I worry about how others might react. 

Consultant: I understand that concern, Deborah. Sharing can feel vulnerable. What if we take baby steps? You could try sharing something small or a brief insight about your experience. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds manageable. Just a small part of my story might not feel too overwhelming.

Consultant: That’s a positive approach! Each little step counts. Let's keep that in mind moving forward. How are you feeling about these ideas so far?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Accepting that it’s okay to not be perfect in social settings is a relief.

Consultant: Hope is an important feeling to hold onto. As we wrap up today, what have you learned about yourself and your social interactions that you’d like to carry with you?

User: I’ve learned that I can challenge my negative thoughts and that I don’t have to face these situations alone. Sharing might actually help me feel more connected.

Consultant: Absolutely, Deborah! Recognizing the power of sharing and challenging those thoughts is a significant step forward. As you continue to practice these skills, remember that it’s all about progress, not perfection.

User: Thank you! I’ll keep that in mind. I’m looking forward to our next conversation.

Consultant: I’m looking forward to it too, Deborah! Remember, you are not alone in this journey. Take care, and we’ll talk soon.

Consultant: Hello, Deborah! It’s great to see you again. I remember from our last session that you found participating in the support group helpful. How have you been feeling since then? 

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling a bit lighter after sharing my story in the group. But I still have moments where I feel overwhelmed by guilt and shame when I think about my past. 

Consultant: It's wonderful that you’re feeling a bit lighter. Those feelings of guilt and shame can be really heavy. Can you tell me more about what triggers those emotions for you when you reflect on your past?

User: Sometimes, certain memories just pop up, like when I hear a song that reminds me of those times. It’s like I’m reliving those moments of pain, and I can’t seem to shake it off.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, especially when memories come flooding back unexpectedly. It must be very challenging to manage those feelings. What do you typically do when those memories surface?

User: I often try to distract myself by watching TV or scrolling through my phone, but it doesn’t always work. I still feel this tightness in my chest.

Consultant: It makes sense to want to distract yourself when those feelings arise. However, it sounds like that tightness in your chest is a sign that those emotions need to be acknowledged. Would you be open to exploring some of those memories in a safe space together today?

User: I think I would. I want to understand why those feelings linger. 

Consultant: That’s a great step forward, Deborah. Let’s start by identifying one specific memory that comes up for you. What’s one moment that stands out, related to those feelings of guilt or shame?

User: There’s a moment from my childhood that comes back often. I can remember an event where I didn’t stand up for a friend who was being bullied, and I always feel guilty about not having been brave enough.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It’s understandable to feel guilt about a situation like that. What thoughts run through your mind when you recall that memory? 

User: I think about how I should have acted differently. I keep telling myself that I failed to protect her, and that’s why I feel so ashamed.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re being very hard on yourself. If you could step back and think about that young girl in the moment, what do you think she might have needed from you or from others?

User: I think she needed someone to speak up for her, to make her feel less alone. 

Consultant: Absolutely, she needed support and courage. And it’s important to remember that as a child, you were still learning how to navigate those difficult situations. What if we reframe that thought about failing? 

User: How so?

Consultant: Instead of seeing it as a failure, could we view it as a moment where you simply didn't have the tools or confidence to act as you would today? Your understanding and empathy now, as an adult, shows growth. 

User: I never thought of it that way. That does make sense. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s important to recognize your own growth and the learning that comes from these experiences. How does this new perspective make you feel about that memory?

User: I feel a bit relieved, actually. It’s still hard, but I see it in a different light now. 

Consultant: That’s a positive step, Deborah. It sounds like you’re starting to release some of that burden. Would you like to explore whether there are other memories or experiences you’d like to view differently?

User: Yes, I think there are more moments I could look at like this. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s think about another significant event or memory from your past. What’s another experience that brings up strong emotions for you?

User: There’s a time when I felt like I had to smile and pretend everything was okay, even when I was hurting inside. It was exhausting and made me feel even more alone.

Consultant: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry, always putting on a brave face. What thoughts come to mind when you remember having to pretend to be okay?

User: I remember feeling completely isolated, like no one could really see me or understand what I was going through. 

Consultant: Feeling unseen can be incredibly lonely. In that moment, what do you wish someone could have said or done to support you?

User: I wish someone had just asked if I was really okay, or offered a listening ear. 

Consultant: Those simple gestures can have such a profound impact. Now, as you reflect on that memory, how might you give yourself that support today? 

User: Maybe I could practice being kinder to myself and allow myself to feel those emotions instead of pushing them away.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Being kind and compassionate towards yourself is so important. How might you incorporate that kindness into your daily life?

User: I could start by journaling more about my feelings and checking in with myself regularly. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan, Deborah! Journaling can be a great tool to process your emotions. How are you feeling about our conversation today and the insights we've uncovered?

User: I feel hopeful. It’s nice to know that I can change the way I view my past. 

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! It seems like you’re making great progress in understanding and accepting your experiences. As we wrap up today, how would you like to continue building on this journey?

User: I want to keep exploring my feelings and maybe share more in the group. It helps to talk about these things.

Consultant: That sounds like a meaningful approach, and sharing within your support group can really enhance your journey. Keep fostering that sense of connection, and remember that I’m here for you whenever you need to dig deeper. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Deborah! Remember, taking one step at a time is key. I look forward to seeing you in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Deborah! I’m really glad to see you again today. Last time, we talked about the importance of the volunteer activity you participated in and how it’s helped you feel a sense of belonging. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better. The volunteer work gave me a nice boost, and for the first time in a long time, I actually felt connected to others. But I’m worried that this feeling won’t last.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you’re feeling better and experiencing that connection! It's completely natural to worry about maintaining these positive feelings. Let's explore what you've enjoyed about volunteering and how we can keep that momentum going. What specific aspects of the volunteering experience have you found most fulfilling?

User: I really liked helping others, and seeing their smiles made me happy. I finally felt I was doing something meaningful. I haven’t felt that kind of joy in quite a while, and it makes me fearful that I won’t be able to replicate it.

Consultant: That joy from helping others is significant, and it sounds like it has given you a sense of purpose. It’s understandable to feel concerned about not being able to feel that way again. Let's think about it this way—what if we could find more activities that could give you similar joy and fulfillment? What other meaningful activities do you think you might want to explore?

User: Maybe I could continue volunteering or try something new, like joining a local community group or class. But I still have this fear of social situations because of everything I’ve been through.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense, Deborah. Social situations can be daunting, especially when you've faced challenges in the past. It’s a brave thought that you might join a community group or classroom setting! Let's take this gradually. Can we identify some smaller steps you could take to ease into social interactions while still staying connected to that joy you found in volunteering?

User: I suppose I could start by attending a single meeting or event instead of jumping straight into something big. That feels less overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic approach! Attending a single meeting is a manageable step. It allows you to ease into the situation and gradually build your confidence. If you decide to go, what strategies can you think of that might help you feel more comfortable during those interactions?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it’s okay to take my time and not to pressure myself too much. I can also prepare some light conversation starters. 

Consultant: Those are great strategies, Deborah! Reminding yourself to take your time can help reduce pressure, and having conversation starters gives you a helpful tool to ease into social situations. Have you had any experiences recently where you felt comfortable expressing yourself to others?

User: I actually did! During the volunteer event, I shared my thoughts with some of the other volunteers. It felt nice to be heard and connected.

Consultant: That’s an excellent example of stepping outside your comfort zone and successfully connecting with others. It’s clear that you have the capability to engage. What did that experience teach you about your ability to connect with others in the future?

User: It showed me that I can share my thoughts, and it felt good to see that people were supportive and receptive. I guess I don’t always have to keep everything bottled up inside.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization, Deborah! Acknowledging that you can share and that others are supportive is a significant step in enhancing your identity and self-worth. How might you apply that insight moving forward, especially as you continue to engage in activities that matter to you?

User: I think I’ll try to be more open in my interactions. Maybe even practice some of those conversations with friends first so I feel more prepared.

Consultant: Practicing with friends is a fantastic idea! It provides a safe space to express yourself openly and receive feedback. As you think about your future involvement in meaningful activities, what are some specific goals you would like to set for yourself in terms of social interactions?

User: I’d like to aim for attending at least one new event every month. That way, I can gradually increase my social interactions without overwhelming myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a very achievable and positive goal! By setting a target of one new event each month, you're giving yourself the opportunity to explore new connections while also respecting your pace. How do you feel about this goal?

User: I feel excited and a little nervous, but I think it’s a good step for me. I want to keep moving forward.

Consultant: Excitement and nervousness are perfectly normal feelings, and they show that you’re pushing yourself towards growth! We can continue to build on the positive impacts you’ve encountered through volunteering. What are some ways you’ve noticed yourself changing since participating in that activity?

User: I feel more confident in my abilities to connect with others, and I’m starting to feel a sense of belonging, which I’ve missed for a while.

Consultant: Recognizing that change in confidence and a sense of belonging is significant! It's important to celebrate those wins. What other emotions do you think might arise as you continue on this path of connecting with others in meaningful ways?

User: I think I might feel more content and perhaps even happier. I really want to embrace that feeling of connection.

Consultant: Embracing contentment and happiness is a great mindset to have! Are there any potential challenges that you think you might face in this journey, and how do you plan to address them?

User: I might struggle with self-doubt sometimes, especially if I feel rejected. I guess I need to remind myself of the positive experiences I’ve had.

Consultant: That's a wise approach. It’s crucial to reflect on those positive experiences and remind yourself of your ability to connect. Keeping a journal to document these experiences could also serve as a powerful tool to combat self-doubt. How do you feel about trying that?

User: That sounds helpful! Writing things down could help keep my thoughts organized and remind me of my progress.

Consultant: Absolutely! Journaling can be an effective way to process your feelings and reflect on your growth. Now, as we wrap up today’s session, let’s take a moment to summarize your progress and set some intentions for our next meeting. What do you feel proud of accomplishing since we started this journey?

User: I feel proud that I’ve taken steps to connect with others and that I’m setting goals to keep doing that. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Deborah! Your awareness and proactive steps are commendable. For our next session, let’s plan to check in on how the events are going and continue to build on your achievements. Remember, you’ve got this, and I'm here to support you. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel more hopeful now, and I appreciate your guidance. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Embrace that hope, and remember, you can always return whenever you need support. Looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello Deborah! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite proud of my progress. I’ve been participating in community service activities regularly, and it feels great to connect with others. But I’m a bit uncertain about where to go from here.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Engaging in community service can be such a fulfilling experience. Let’s take a moment to reflect on your journey. What specific aspects of socializing have you noticed improving?

User: I think my confidence has grown. I used to feel so anxious in social situations, but now I can strike up conversations more easily. It feels like I belong.

Consultant: That's a significant achievement, Deborah! Feeling a sense of belonging is so important. It sounds like you’ve worked hard to build your confidence. What are some activities or interactions that stood out to you recently?

User: Last week, I volunteered at a local shelter, and I really enjoyed the conversations with other volunteers. We shared our thoughts and experiences, and I didn’t feel judged at all.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It’s great that you felt comfortable sharing your thoughts. How did that make you feel about yourself and your ability to connect with others?

User: It made me feel valued and heard. I realized that I can contribute positively, which is a new feeling for me. I want to keep building on that.

Consultant: It's incredible to see you embracing your value and contributions. What do you think are the key strengths that have helped you improve your social skills during this journey?

User: I think it’s my willingness to open up and my desire to help others. I’ve learned that sharing helps build connections, and I want to keep doing that.

Consultant: Those are powerful strengths, Deborah. Your openness and desire to help not only benefit others but also serve to enhance your connections. Looking ahead, what areas do you feel you might need to work on to continue this growth?

User: I still sometimes struggle with feelings of guilt and shame from my past. They pop up unexpectedly, and it can be hard to shake them off.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to have those feelings resurfacing given your experiences. Let's explore how you can manage those emotions more effectively. What strategies have you tried so far to cope with them?

User: I've been trying to remind myself that I'm not defined by my past. I also practice mindfulness, but it can be challenging.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Reminding yourself that your past doesn’t define you is crucial. Mindfulness can be tough at first, but it’s worth developing further. We can explore some techniques to make it easier. Would that be helpful?

User: Yes, I would appreciate that. I want to learn how to manage those moments better when they arise.

Consultant: Great! We can focus on some grounding techniques that can help bring you back to the present moment when you feel overwhelmed. In terms of your future goals, what would you like to achieve in the next few months regarding your social life and self-identity?

User: I want to continue engaging with community activities, but I also hope to join a social group where I can meet people with similar interests. I believe that would further boost my confidence.

Consultant: Joining a social group sounds like a wonderful way to expand your network and interests! What kind of group are you considering, and how do you envision yourself participating?

User: I've been thinking about a book club or a hiking group. I love reading, and being outdoors always lifts my mood.

Consultant: Those both sound like fantastic options! They can provide a great environment for connection and enjoyment. What steps can you take to explore these opportunities further?

User: I can start by researching local groups and perhaps asking around in my community service network. I might even reach out to see if anyone is interested in joining me.

Consultant: That’s a proactive plan, Deborah! It’s great to involve others and make it a shared experience. As you work towards this goal, how can you remind yourself of your accomplishments and strengths along the way?

User: I could keep a journal of my experiences and feelings. Writing has always helped me process things, and it might keep me motivated.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Journaling can provide clarity and serve as a reminder of your progress. How do you feel about our discussion today? 

User: I feel really positive! This conversation helped me clarify my thoughts and has given me a clearer sense of direction.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’ve shown such resilience and dedication. As we wrap up today’s session, what’s one key takeaway you want to hold onto moving forward?

User: I want to remember that I’ve made positive changes and that I can keep building on them. I’ll focus on being open to new experiences.

Consultant: That’s a powerful intention, Deborah. Remember, you are capable of continued growth and connection. If you ever need support, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m here for you.

User: Thank you so much! I feel more equipped to handle things moving forward.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. I look forward to hearing about your future successes. Take care and see you next time!
