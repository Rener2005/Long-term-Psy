Consultant: Hello Bernadette! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling really frustrated. After missing a day of work because I was sick, Daisy made some decisions without consulting me. It feels like she's undermining my authority in the shop. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling quite disrespected and concerned about your control in the partnership. Can you tell me more about what specifically upset you about her decision?

User: Well, she decided to purchase red African daisies and changed the work schedule. I wasn't there to discuss these changes, and it makes me anxious that my opinions don’t seem to matter.

Consultant: It seems like you value having a say in decisions and any deviation from that makes you anxious. Why do you think having control over these decisions is so important to you?

User: I think it’s because I need to feel organized and in charge. If everything goes the way I planned, I feel more secure about our business.

Consultant: That makes sense. Wanting to maintain organization and security in your work is a natural feeling. But it can also lead to tension. How do you think this need for control affects your relationship with Daisy?

User: I realize I might not give her enough space to share her ideas. I feel like I have to micromanage everything to avoid chaos, but I don’t want to push her away either.

Consultant: Recognizing that balance is key. It seems you want to have control while also maintaining a good partnership. How can we explore ways to communicate your needs without taking away her autonomy?

User: I guess I could try to express my concerns about not being involved in decisions. But I still feel anxious about letting go of control.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel anxious about that. What if we worked on ways for you to express your needs while also encouraging Daisy to share her ideas? 

User: That sounds helpful. Maybe using "I" statements could help me communicate better without sounding accusatory.

Consultant: Absolutely! Using "I" statements is a great way to assert your feelings while fostering a collaborative spirit. What might an "I" statement look like in this situation?

User: Maybe I could say something like, "I feel left out and anxious when decisions are made without my input." 

Consultant: That's a great start! By sharing your feelings, you open the door for dialogue. How do you think Daisy might respond to that?

User: I think she might understand where I'm coming from, but I worry it could lead to a bigger discussion about control.

Consultant: It's possible. But having an open conversation can strengthen your partnership. What if you framed it as a way to improve teamwork rather than simply asserting control?

User: Framing it as teamwork is a good idea! It makes it less about me opposing her and more about us working together.

Consultant: Exactly! Team-based approaches can reduce tension and enhance understanding. Do you think you could practice that approach with her?

User: Yes, I could definitely try! I feel a little more optimistic about it now.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! As you prepare to discuss these ideas, what else do you think would help to ease your anxiety about the conversation?

User: Maybe rehearsing what I want to say a few times could help make me feel more confident. 

Consultant: Practicing is a smart strategy. Would you like to role-play that conversation with me now? 

User: Sure! That could be really helpful.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you are starting the conversation with Daisy. What would you say first?

User: I’d probably start with how much I appreciate her contributions and discuss how I’ve been feeling.

Consultant: That’s a positive opening. How would you feel saying that to her? 

User: I think it would help to diffuse any tension. It’s nice to focus on appreciation first.

Consultant: Yes, setting a positive tone is important. What else might you want to include in the conversation?

User: I want to express my need for collaboration and ensure she feels valued too. 

Consultant: That's essential for fostering a supportive environment. Let's continue practicing this approach. 

User: Okay! I’m feeling a lot more prepared now. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, this kind of communication can really enhance your teamwork. How do you feel about moving forward with this strategy? 

User: I feel much more confident. I know it will take some effort but I’m ready to try.

Consultant: That's the spirit, Bernadette! It’s a process, but with practice, it can become easier. Let's summarize what you want to focus on before we wrap up today.

User: So, I’ll use "I" statements and highlight teamwork while expressing my feelings. Also, I’ll practice beforehand.

Consultant: Exactly! Those steps will help you approach the situation with clarity. I’m proud of you for working on this. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help in making me feel more equipped to handle this.

Consultant: It’s been a pleasure working with you today. As we conclude this session, remember, communication is a journey. You’re on the right path!

User: I’ll keep that in mind. Talk to you soon! 

Consultant: Looking forward to our next session, Bernadette. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Bernadette! I'm glad you're here today. Before we dive in, I'd like to hear about what has been on your mind recently. How have you been feeling?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really uneasy lately, especially with the disagreements I've been having with Daisy about some business decisions. It's been affecting not just me, but the whole atmosphere in the shop.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like there’s a lot of tension between you and Daisy right now, and that it's impacting the morale of the team. Can you share more about what those disagreements have been about?

User: Well, it's mostly about how we should order our stock and some marketing strategies. I feel very strongly about what we should do, but Daisy seems to have different ideas, and it's frustrating for me.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel frustrated when there’s a clash in ideas, especially in a partnership. It sounds like there might be a lack of trust in the decisions being made. How do you think that’s affecting your relationship with Daisy?

User: Definitely. I feel like I can't rely on her input anymore, which is making me anxious. I know I need to find a way to improve our communication, but I’m not sure how.

Consultant: Recognizing the need to improve communication is a positive step forward, Bernadette. In our session today, we can explore some of those feelings and thoughts further. What would it take for you to feel more at ease in your partnership with Daisy?

User: I guess I want to feel like we're on the same page again. It's essential for the shop's success, and I just want to have open conversations without feeling anxious about it.

Consultant: That’s a great goal to aim for, wanting to have open conversations. Let’s consider your current thoughts about decisions. Do you find yourself often doubting Daisy's choices? How does that affect your feelings toward her?

User: Yes, I do doubt her choices. I often think they are not the best for the shop, which makes me feel insecure about my own opinions too. It’s like a cycle of mistrust and anxiety.

Consultant: It sounds like there's a cycle of negative thoughts at play here. Can we try to identify what specific thoughts come up when you doubt Daisy's choices? What do you find yourself saying to yourself in those moments?

User: I often think things like, “She doesn't know what she's doing,” or “If I don’t take control, everything will fall apart.” 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite heavy and overwhelming. Have you noticed how these thoughts influence your feelings toward Daisy and the decisions you both make?

User: Yes, it makes me feel angry and frustrated. I realize that these thoughts might affect the way I communicate with her. 

Consultant: Acknowledging that is an important step. What if we challenged those thoughts a bit? For instance, what evidence do you have that Daisy's decisions would cause everything to fall apart? 

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence. It’s more of a fear that something small could lead to bigger problems. 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, but it’s also important to recognize where fears may lead to overthinking. If a friend were in a similar situation, what would you advise them to do?

User: I would probably tell them to trust their partner and to communicate their concerns openly.

Consultant: Exactly! So if you gave that advice, can you see how you might also apply it to your situation with Daisy? When you trust her and communicate openly, what do you think could change?

User: I think we could work through our issues more effectively. If I can manage to express my concerns without coming off as controlling, it might help.

Consultant: That sounds like a productive approach, Bernadette. Would you like to work on a specific strategy for how to express your thoughts to Daisy without feeling anxious or controlling?

User: Yes, I think some role-playing could help. I want to practice my words and tone to ensure I come across as collaborative.

Consultant: Great idea! Let’s imagine a scenario where you approach her about a decision. What would you like to say to her to open up that conversation?

User: I might start with something like, “I really appreciate your ideas about our marketing strategy, but I’m a bit worried about one aspect. Could we discuss it together?”

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! It’s both appreciative and invites collaboration. What do you think you would like to express next if she responds positively to that?

User: I would like to share my thoughts but also invite her input to find a middle ground. It’s important that we both feel heard.

Consultant: Perfect. That’s a healthy way to communicate. How do you feel about using this approach moving forward?

User: I feel more confident now. It seems less intimidating to have a conversation like that.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Bernadette. Remember, it’s all about fostering trust and understanding in your partnership. After our session, how will you keep this new way of thinking in mind?

User: I think I’ll write down our conversation and remind myself of it before speaking with Daisy. That way, I can stay focused on staying collaborative.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! As we wrap up today, let's reflect on what you’ve learned about your thoughts and how they impact your relationships. What stands out to you?

User: I realize I need to work on my trust in Daisy and my tendency to control situations. I feel a bit guilty for how I've handled things so far.

Consultant: It’s good that you’re reflecting on these aspects. Learning from experiences is key to growth. Remember, establishing trust takes time, and you're already on the right path. If you need support, I'm here for you!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today. I’ll try my best to improve things.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Bernadette! I'm confident that with these insights and strategies, you'll strengthen your relationship with Daisy. If you need further assistance, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Bernadette! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing some thinking about my management style. I've noticed that my tendency to control everything is making my team less motivated, and it's been weighing on me a lot.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve been reflecting on your controlling behavior and its impact on your team. That can be quite challenging. What specific situations have made you feel this way recently?

User: Well, I noticed that when I micromanage their tasks, they seem disengaged and less enthusiastic about their work. I feel guilty about it, but I struggle to let go.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel guilty when you realize your actions may affect others negatively. Let’s explore this a bit deeper. What thoughts come to your mind when you think about stepping back and allowing your team more freedom?

User: I worry that if I don’t oversee everything, things will go wrong. I have this belief that I need to be in control to ensure everything runs smoothly.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. It seems like your desire for control stems from a fear of things not going as planned. Can you share how this belief affects your emotions when you're in the middle of managing your team?

User: I often feel anxious and overwhelmed, and sometimes I snap at my team out of frustration. I regret it afterward, but in the moment, it feels justified.

Consultant: It’s tough to manage those feelings, especially when there’s so much pressure. Let’s take a moment to look at those thoughts more closely. On a scale of 1 to 10, how much do you believe that being in control is the only way to ensure things go right?

User: I’d say about an 8. I really believe that if I don’t keep a close eye on everything, there will be mistakes.

Consultant: That’s a strong belief! But let’s challenge it. Can you think of instances where your team has successfully managed tasks without your close supervision? How did that make you feel?

User: I remember a time when I let Daisy handle the flower arrangements for a big event. I was nervous, but they turned out beautifully, and Daisy felt proud of her work.

Consultant: That’s a great example! It seems there are situations where your team can perform well independently. What alternative thought can you draw from that experience regarding your belief in needing to control everything?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that giving my team trust can lead to positive outcomes. I don’t have to be involved in every detail.

Consultant: Absolutely! Building that trust is essential for both you and your team. How could you start practicing this alternative thought in your daily management?

User: I could try delegating small tasks at first and observe the outcomes without stepping in too much. 

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive plan! As you practice delegating, what emotions do you think might arise, and how can we prepare to manage those feelings?

User: I might feel anxious initially, but maybe I can remind myself of the positive outcomes I’ve seen before. It might help to breathe or take a step back when I feel that urge to intervene.

Consultant: That’s a helpful strategy! Using breathing techniques to manage anxiety can be very effective. Would you like to role-play a scenario where you delegate a task and observe your feelings and thoughts?

User: Sure, that sounds like a good idea! Let’s say I tell Daisy to handle the flower arrangements for an upcoming event.

Consultant: Great! As you delegate, notice the thoughts and feelings that come up. Go ahead and practice what you might say to her.

User: "Daisy, I trust your judgment on the arrangements for the event. Please feel free to make the decisions you think are best."

Consultant: Excellent work! How does saying that make you feel?

User: Honestly, it feels a bit scary but also freeing. I really hope she does well.

Consultant: That’s completely normal! Embracing that fear is part of the process. Let’s focus on what you can learn from this experience, regardless of the outcome. What will be your next step after this delegation?

User: I think I’ll ask for her input afterward and reflect on how it went, regardless of how I think things turned out.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Engaging in reflection will help you to reinforce your progress and adjust your management style as needed.

User: I feel like I understand my feelings and thoughts much better now. I really want to work on this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize what you’ve learned. You’ve recognized the impact of your controlling behavior on your team, and you’ve identified the importance of trust and delegation. How do you feel about applying these insights moving forward?

User: I feel more confident and motivated to change. I realize that if I adjust my approach, it could really benefit my team and myself.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Remember, change takes time, so be patient with yourself. Let’s set a date for our next session to discuss your progress and any challenges you face along the way. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great. I’m looking forward to it!

Consultant: Me too, Bernadette. Take care until then, and remember that you’re making positive strides in your management journey.
###################
Consultant: Hello Bernadette! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better about managing my emotions, but I still find myself struggling in certain situations, especially during conflicts with my partner or employees. 

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've made some progress. Could you tell me more about those specific situations where you struggle to manage your emotions?

User: Sure. Recently, during a team meeting, I found myself getting frustrated when my partner didn't agree with my suggestions. I could feel my irritation rising, and I didn't handle it well.

Consultant: It sounds like that was a challenging moment for you. What thoughts were running through your mind when you felt that frustration?

User: I kept thinking that my ideas were being dismissed, and it felt like I wasn't being valued or respected. 

Consultant: Those thoughts could definitely trigger strong emotions. How did that frustration affect your behavior during the meeting?

User: I ended up raising my voice a bit and stopping the conversation. I felt bad right after, but it was hard to control in the moment.

Consultant: Acknowledging that feeling is important. In those situations, it can be helpful to identify how your emotions and thoughts connect. What other feelings did you notice alongside your frustration?

User: I think I felt a bit anxious too, like there was pressure to prove myself. 

Consultant: Anxiety can often accompany frustration, especially when you feel the need to assert yourself. Can you recall any cognitive distortions, like all-or-nothing thinking, during that meeting?

User: Yes, I think I saw things as either my way or the wrong way. I didn't consider my partner's perspective at all.

Consultant: That’s a common distortion. If you were to challenge that thought by asking what evidence supports it, what might you find?

User: I suppose I would recognize that my partner often has valid points, and there are multiple ways to approach a problem.

Consultant: Correct. Recognizing that there are different perspectives can help shift how you engage in discussions. Moving forward, how might you respond differently in those situations?

User: I could try to remain calm and remind myself that they might have good reasons for their opinions.

Consultant: That’s a positive step! Practicing deep breathing before responding could help you manage that initial emotional reaction. How do you feel about trying that?

User: I think that could really help. I sometimes forget to pause and breathe when I'm upset.

Consultant: Absolutely! Pausing for a moment can give you the space to choose a more constructive response. Would you also like to practice some role-playing scenarios for future conflicts?

User: Yes, I think that would be beneficial to see how I might react differently.

Consultant: Great! Let's imagine a situation where your partner disagrees with you again. How would you like to initiate the conversation?

User: I’d probably start with something like, "I see you have a different view, could you share your thoughts?" 

Consultant: That sounds like a respectful opening. What might you say if you start feeling frustrated during the conversation?

User: I can remind myself to breathe and say something like, "I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed, can we take a moment?"

Consultant: Excellent approach! Expressing your feelings directly can foster a more collaborative environment. How do you think your partner might respond to that?

User: Hopefully, they would appreciate my honesty and be open to continuing the conversation calmly.

Consultant: It’s likely! Being open about your emotions can create space for better dialogue. How do you feel about this role-playing exercise in your real-life situations moving forward?

User: It makes me feel more prepared. I think I can manage my responses better now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Bernadette. It’s about practice and becoming more aware in those moments. What strategies will you use to reinforce this when you're in those situations?

User: I’ll keep practicing those opening lines and remember to take a breath before reacting.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. As you continue to implement these techniques, what kind of changes do you hope to see in your interactions with your team?

User: I hope to create a more open environment where everyone feels heard and valued, reducing any unnecessary tension.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! It's all about fostering collaboration and understanding. How confident do you feel about achieving that?

User: I feel more confident than before, especially with these new tools. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress! Remember that it’s a journey, and that every small step counts. As we conclude today, what would you say your main takeaway from our session is?

User: I learned that managing my initial reactions can lead to better conversations and outcomes for everyone involved.

Consultant: Absolutely! Your willingness to adapt and learn is commendable. I believe you can make a significant positive impact on your team dynamics. If you encounter challenges, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance. I look forward to our next session to share my progress. 

Consultant: I’m looking forward to that too, Bernadette. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Bernadette! Welcome to our session today. I’m really looking forward to discussing your journey with team collaboration and communication skills. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite open to my team lately. The role-playing workshop has really helped me see things from different perspectives. I'm starting to share my ideas more but I still feel a bit hesitant.

Consultant: That’s great to hear that you’re feeling more open! Sharing ideas is a vital part of collaboration. Can you share a specific moment since the workshop where you felt you successfully used these new skills?

User: Yes, there was this one time when Daisy and I were discussing the upcoming flower arrangement for a wedding. I didn’t initially agree with her design idea, but I listened and ended up incorporating some of her suggestions. It felt good to collaborate.

Consultant: It sounds like you had a productive conversation! Listening and incorporating your team’s suggestions is such a valuable skill. How did that experience make you feel about your working relationship with Daisy?

User: It made me feel more connected to her. I think our communication improved, and I felt more like part of a team, rather than just managing everything myself.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful shift in perspective! Feeling connected and part of a team can significantly enhance workplace morale. Do you notice any changes in how you approach your role since implementing this collaborative mindset?

User: Yes, I find myself less focused on having complete control over everything. I feel more relaxed about delegating some responsibilities. However, there’s still a part of me that worries about how the team will handle things without me.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you care deeply about the success of your flower shop. What thoughts come up for you when you worry about delegating tasks?

User: I start thinking that they might not do things as well as I would, or that my vision for the shop will get lost. It makes me anxious to let go of control.

Consultant: Those thoughts can certainly create anxiety. Let’s explore that a bit. How much evidence do you have that your team can’t handle the tasks you assign to them? Have they shown any competence in their roles so far?

User: Well, Daisy does have a good eye for design, and she’s handled customer orders really well. I guess I’m just worried about certain situations that I might see differently.

Consultant: It sounds like they've proven themselves to be capable in many ways. What if you reframed your thinking to consider their strengths instead of focusing on your worries? What would that look like for you?

User: I think it might help me feel more relaxed about working with them, rather than feeling like I have to manage everything. I could focus more on guiding rather than controlling.

Consultant: That’s an excellent perspective! Focusing on guidance instead of control can open up more space for creativity and problem-solving within your team. How might you start to practice this in your day-to-day interactions with them?

User: Maybe I could try asking for their input more actively and letting them take the lead on certain tasks without stepping in too soon. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful strategy. Taking a step back can empower them and strengthen your team dynamics. What specific tasks do you feel comfortable delegating to them starting this week?

User: I think I could start with some of the routine inventory tasks. I could outline what I need and let Daisy take charge of that.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! By delegating inventory tasks, you’re not only freeing up your time but also giving Daisy a chance to take ownership. How do you feel about making this change?

User: I feel a bit anxious about it still, but at the same time, I’m also excited! It will be a relief to share some responsibility.

Consultant: That’s completely normal to feel a mix of emotions. Embracing this change can lead to great outcomes not just for you, but for your team as well. How will you check in with yourself to reflect on this experience after you try it out?

User: I think I’ll set aside some time at the end of the week to review how it went and see how I felt about it. I might ask Daisy for feedback too.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Reflecting on your experiences and seeking feedback reinforces positive change. What are your thoughts on how you can maintain this newfound balance in your management style moving forward?

User: I hope I can consistently remind myself of the benefits of teamwork and keep pushing myself to trust my team. It seems like a better way to work.

Consultant: Absolutely! Trusting your team will likely lead to an even more positive work atmosphere. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you see as the biggest takeaway from our discussion?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is that collaboration can enhance not only our work but our relationships too. I really want to keep building on those connections.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful insight, Bernadette. Fostering collaboration and connection is vital for a healthy team environment. Remember, you have the tools and skills to enhance your team’s dynamics. I look forward to hearing how your delegation efforts go in our next session!

User: Thank you! I feel encouraged about trying these new approaches. I can’t wait to share my progress!

Consultant: You’re doing great, Bernadette. I believe in your ability to create a collaborative and uplifting environment. Have a wonderful week ahead!

User: Thank you! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Bernadette! I’m really glad to see you for this session. Let's talk about how you're feeling and how the recent changes at the shop have affected you.

User: Hi! Thank you. I feel so much better since we implemented the new management and communication styles. The atmosphere in the shop has improved, and I’m more confident in my partnership with Daisy.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like those changes have had a really positive impact. Could you share more about how these new approaches have influenced your daily interactions and workflow?

User: Sure! We’re communicating much more openly now, and I find it easier to express my ideas and concerns. We’ve also started to collaborate on orders, which used to overwhelm me. It's a lot more manageable now.

Consultant: It’s great that collaboration has become a source of support for you. How do you feel about your role in the partnership now, compared to before implementing these changes?

User: I feel more empowered and involved. Previously, I was quite anxious about making decisions and felt like I needed to have everything under control all the time. Now, it’s nice to share responsibilities.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant shift! Feeling less anxious about control must be quite freeing. Have you noticed any specific strategies or techniques that have worked particularly well for both you and Daisy in this new dynamic?

User: Yes, definitely! We set clear goals for our daily tasks and check in with each other regularly. This way, we stay on the same page and support each other. It has really helped to build trust too.

Consultant: Trust is such an important aspect of teamwork. How has this new trust affected your relationship with Daisy in the long term? Are there any challenges that you've faced during this transition?

User: Honestly, it has strengthened our bond. However, I sometimes worry about slipping back into my old habits of needing control. I don’t want to revert to being overly dominant in decision-making.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those concerns, especially when you've worked hard for this progress. What strategies could you implement to remind yourself to maintain this balance and avoid reverting to old habits?

User: I think setting reminders to check in with Daisy regularly could help. Also, maybe I could practice letting go of certain decisions and trusting her more.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Practicing trust and open communication will help reinforce your new dynamics. How do you feel about creating a plan for these check-ins? Would it help to structure them in some way?

User: Yes! Scheduling weekly check-ins could work. I’ll also write a short summary of what I want to discuss to keep things focused. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan to enhance your collaboration. As you continue this journey, what specific goals do you have for your partnership moving forward?

User: I’d like to establish a consistent process for decision-making. I want us to feel equally involved in all aspects of the business and be flexible with our responsibilities.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful aspiration! Flexibility can create a more resilient partnership. Are there any potential challenges you foresee in achieving this goal?

User: One challenge might be getting stuck in our comfort zones. If we grow too comfortable, we might stop innovating or trying new things.

Consultant: It's true that comfort zones can be limiting. What steps do you think you and Daisy could take to encourage innovation while maintaining a strong partnership?

User: Perhaps we could set aside time each month to brainstorm new ideas or projects. That way, we can keep things fresh and exciting.

Consultant: Fantastic! Designating time for creativity ensures that both of you remain engaged. After our conversation today, how are you feeling about the progress you've made so far?

User: I feel really encouraged! Reflecting on our journey makes me realize how much we’ve accomplished together.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It’s essential to acknowledge your achievements. Looking ahead, how can you ensure that you continue to support each other effectively?

User: I think it will be important to remain open and honest about our feelings as we move forward. We must ensure we communicate any issues that arise.

Consultant: Absolutely! Open communication will be key to navigating future challenges. Before we wrap up, do you have any lingering thoughts or feelings you'd like to express about our discussion today?

User: I just feel really grateful for the changes we've made and the support you’ve offered. It’s reassuring to know we’re on the right track.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Bernadette. I’m really pleased with the progress you’ve made. Remember to keep nurturing that collaboration and trust. If you ever find yourself needing support again, don't hesitate to come back.

User: I will, thank you! I look forward to our next session.

Consultant: Me too! Take care, Bernadette. I believe you’ll continue to thrive in your partnership.
