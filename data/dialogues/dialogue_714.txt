Consultant: Hello, Xiaomsy! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really low and isolated, especially after failing a couple of exams. It just intensifies the feeling that my parents don't care about me. I struggle to connect with my classmates, and I often feel inadequate. 

Consultant: I can hear that this has been quite challenging for you. It sounds like your recent exam results have compounded feelings of being unworthy and isolated. Can you share more about how you're processing these feelings?

User: Yeah, when I see my classmates talking to their families or enjoying their time, I feel even more left out. I just wish my parents showed more interest in my life, but it feels like they don't. 

Consultant: That sounds really painful. Feeling unsupported from your parents can certainly affect how you view yourself and your relationships with others. What kind of support do you wish you could receive from them?

User: I just want them to notice when I struggle or at least check in on me more often. It feels like I have to deal with everything alone. 

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to want that kind of connection and support. Let’s explore how this desire for recognition impacts your self-esteem and how you interact with others. What thoughts run through your mind when you think about your relationship with your parents?

User: I often think that maybe I’m just not good enough or that they don’t care about my achievements. It makes me feel even less confident when I'm around my classmates. 

Consultant: It sounds like there's a strong belief that you aren't good enough, which is understandable in your circumstances. Can we examine that thought together? What evidence do you have that truly indicates your worth is tied to your parents' attention?

User: I guess I just feel like I need their approval to feel valuable. It seems like my worth is tied to how much they care or notice what I do.

Consultant: That's an important realization. It’s common to feel a need for external validation. But let's think about your value—what are some things you like about yourself or have achieved on your own, regardless of their recognition?

User: Well, I did manage to make some friends at school, and I enjoy my economics classes. I just wish that my academic struggles didn’t overshadow those positive things. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Making friends and engaging in your interests like economics are significant achievements. How might focusing on those strengths change the way you see yourself?

User: I suppose if I focused more on those positives, I might feel a bit better about myself. But then I worry that I'll just end up failing again, especially with the upcoming exams.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel anxious about future performance, especially after experiencing setbacks. Let’s talk about how we can prepare you for those upcoming exams. What strategies do you think could help reduce your anxiety while studying?

User: I’m not sure... Maybe breaking things into smaller tasks? But I find it hard to stay focused without distractions.

Consultant: Breaking tasks into smaller, manageable parts is a great start. Have you tried setting specific times for study sessions to help increase your focus while also allowing for breaks?

User: I haven’t really structured my studying like that. I usually just try to cram everything in at once. 

Consultant: That makes sense. Cramming can increase anxiety. Let’s consider setting structured study sessions. You could create a timetable where you balance study time with breaks. Would you be willing to try that this week?

User: I think I could try that. It feels less overwhelming compared to my usual way of studying.

Consultant: That’s a positive step! Alongside that, how about finding a study buddy or someone to talk to about your studies? It might help you feel less alone and provide encouragement as well.

User: I haven't really thought about that. It could be nice to have someone else to study with since I feel so isolated often.

Consultant: Studying with someone can create a sense of community and sometimes makes learning more enjoyable. It could help both your academic performance and your feelings of isolation. 

User: That sounds encouraging. I could reach out to some classmates and see if anyone wants to form a study group.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! It’s a way to build connections while also enhancing your study habits. Remember, it’s okay to lean on others when you need support. 

User: I hope that helps. I really want to feel more confident in my interactions with others and perhaps improve my relationship with my roommates too.

Consultant: Absolutely, improving your relationship with your roommates is also an important goal. What do you think are some initial steps you could take to engage with them more?

User: Maybe I could invite them to study with me or just have casual conversations to get to know them better. 

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Taking small steps to engage can gradually build your confidence. It’s okay to start slow and let the connections develop over time.

User: I’ll definitely try that. I hope it will help me feel more connected and less lonely. 

Consultant: I believe it will! As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed. You’re taking proactive steps toward managing your emotions and improving your self-esteem. How do you feel about the strategies we’ve talked about?

User: I feel more hopeful about the changes I can make. It feels nice to talk about these things out loud. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiaomsy! Remember, acknowledging your strengths and seeking support are both empowering actions. I’m here to help you along this journey. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care until then.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaomei! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’ve been feeling quite down. My relationship with my roommate has been tense, and it’s taken a toll on my mood. I really feel like I'm struggling to connect with people.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like the tension with your roommate is making it even harder for you to feel confident in social situations. Can you tell me more about what happened with your roommate recently?

User: We had a small argument over something trivial, but it escalated quickly. I ended up feeling misunderstood and more isolated. I wish I could communicate better.

Consultant: That sounds really frustrating. It can be tough when misunderstandings arise, especially when you already feel like you don’t belong. What do you think you could have done differently during that argument?

User: I guess I could have tried to explain my feelings more clearly instead of just reacting emotionally. But in the moment, I felt so overwhelmed.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed during conflicts. Let’s explore those feelings a bit more. What thoughts were running through your mind when the argument started?

User: I just kept thinking that no one really cares what I have to say. It felt like my roommate wasn’t listening to me at all.

Consultant: That thought, that no one cares about what you say, sounds quite heavy. How did that make you feel in that moment?

User: It made me feel really small and insignificant. Like I didn’t matter, you know?

Consultant: I can see why that would hurt. Feeling insignificant can lead to a lot of pain in relationships. Let’s try to challenge that thought. Is there any evidence that contradicts the idea that people don’t care about what you say?

User: Well, sometimes my friends do listen and support me, but I think I focus on the negative experiences more.

Consultant: It’s common to pay more attention to negative experiences, but it’s great that you can recognize when your friends are supportive. Moving forward, how can we shift your focus onto those positive interactions?

User: Maybe I could remind myself of those moments when I feel ignored in the future.

Consultant: That’s a good strategy! Practicing gratitude for those positive interactions can help reframe your thinking. Now, let’s talk about how you could approach a conversation with your roommate to improve communication.

User: I think I could initiate the conversation about how I feel more directly. But I’m worried about how she’ll react.

Consultant: It’s understandable to be concerned about her response. What if we role-play that conversation? It might help you feel more prepared.

User: That sounds helpful! I can try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you’re starting the conversation. You could say something like, “I’d like to talk about what happened, can we find a moment to discuss it?” How does that sound to you?

User: I like that! It feels calmer than just jumping into accusations.

Consultant: Exactly, a calm approach can set a positive tone. When expressing how you feel, use “I” statements, like “I felt hurt when…” instead of focusing on what she may have done wrong. How do you feel about trying that?

User: I think it makes sense! I need to express my feelings without making it sound like I’m blaming her.

Consultant: Yes! That shift can open up dialogue instead of causing defensiveness. How do you think this approach might help your relationship with your roommate?

User: I hope it could clear the air and help us understand each other better.

Consultant: That’s a positive outlook! Understanding can lead to a stronger bond. Looking ahead, how else can you apply this approach in your other relationships, including with your family?

User: I guess I could try to express my feelings more openly with my parents too, but I still feel unsure about that.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel uncertain. How does your family dynamic influence your feelings of confidence in communication?

User: My parents often seem busy or distracted, so I worry they won’t listen to me. I think that’s where my fear comes from.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s hard when you don’t feel prioritized. Let’s work on some strategies to help you articulate your feelings to your parents. What’s one way you could start that conversation?

User: I could ask them for a specific time to talk instead of just bringing it up randomly.

Consultant: That’s a solid idea! Requesting a specific time can show them that you have something important to discuss. Now, thinking about what we’ve discussed today, what’s your biggest takeaway?

User: I think learning to express myself calmly and using “I” statements will really help me communicate better, not just with my roommate but also with my family.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization, Xiaomei! Remember, this takes practice. You’re making great strides in improving your communication skills. How do you plan to follow up on what we talked about in our next session?

User: I want to try talking to my roommate and maybe arrange a chat with my parents. I’ll let you know how it goes.

Consultant: I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress. You’re doing amazing work, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support before then. See you next time!

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about handling these conversations now. See you!

Consultant: Hello, welcome to our session today! I sense there’s a lot weighing on your mind. Could you share with me your current feelings and what has been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. Lately, I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed. I received messages about my parents arguing again, and it makes me feel helpless and confused about how to deal with them and my studies.

Consultant: I see, it sounds really tough to deal with the impact of your parents' conflict on your emotions and studies. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel helpless in this situation?

User: I just feel like I can't do anything to fix their relationship, and it stresses me out. I want their attention and support, but it seems like they’re too caught up in their own issues to notice how I’m feeling.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling isolated and craving connection with your parents while facing the stress of their situation. Let’s explore how this affects your daily life. How has this impacted your studies and interactions with others?

User: I’ve been having trouble focusing on my coursework, and I feel lonely compared to other students who seem to have supportive families. I think I’m really struggling to keep up with everything.

Consultant: That must be incredibly frustrating for you, especially since you’re trying to navigate your studies too. When you see other students with supportive relationships, how does that affect your self-esteem?

User: It makes me feel even more inadequate. I feel like I should be able to manage my feelings better, but I get so caught up in comparing myself to them.

Consultant: Recognizing those comparisons can be really challenging. It's important to remember that everyone has their struggles, even if they don't show them. Let’s delve deeper—what thoughts do you have that make you feel inadequate?

User: I often think that if I were better, my parents wouldn't fight, and I wouldn’t feel this way. It feels like I have to be perfect to keep my family together.

Consultant: It seems there's a lot of pressure on you to be the solution for your family’s issues. What if we challenge that idea a bit? Can we explore how much responsibility you truly have in this situation?

User: I guess not all of it is on me, but it's hard to shake off that feeling. It's like I have to be the peacemaker, but I don’t know how.

Consultant: That’s a heavy burden to carry. Let’s think about this: if a friend were in your position, how would you advise them regarding feeling responsible for their parents’ relationship?

User: I’d probably tell them it’s not their fault and they shouldn’t carry that weight. They should focus on themselves instead. 

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! Remember, your well-being is important too. What if you applied that same advice to yourself? How might that change your feelings?

User: I think it would help me feel less guilty. Maybe I could focus more on my own studies and self-care instead of trying to fix others’ problems.

Consultant: Yes, that’s an empowering shift in perspective! Let’s talk about self-care. What are some things you enjoy or activities that help you relax?

User: I used to love drawing and listening to music, but I hardly have time for that now. 

Consultant: It’s understandable that with everything going on, it’s tough to find time for things you enjoy. How about we set some small goals to integrate those activities back into your routine? 

User: That sounds good, but I often feel guilty about taking time for myself when I should be studying.

Consultant: It’s common to feel that way, but remember that self-care can enhance your focus and productivity. Let’s experiment with balancing both. What if you scheduled short breaks for drawing or listening to music?

User: That could be helpful! As long as I can manage my study time, I’d love that.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s set a small goal. How about dedicating 10-15 minutes a day to these activities? It may help clear your mind and renew your focus.

User: I think I could try that! I just need to remind myself it’s okay to take those breaks.

Consultant: Yes, it’s all about finding that balance. Additionally, what can you do to remind yourself that it’s okay to prioritize your well-being during this time?

User: Maybe I can write myself a note or set reminders on my phone. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Visual reminders can help reinforce that mindset. As we wrap up this session, let’s reflect on what insights you’ve gained today regarding your family dynamics and self-care.

User: I realized I shouldn't carry the entire weight of my family’s issues. And I really need to take time for myself without feeling guilty.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization, and I’m proud of you for acknowledging that. What steps can you take moving forward to maintain this healthier perspective?

User: I’ll try to remind myself not to compare myself to others and prioritize my own happiness.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive plan! Remember, it's okay to seek joy and understanding in your life. I believe in your capability to apply these strategies. If you ever need support again, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you so much! This session really helped me feel more hopeful.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Keep focusing on yourself, and take care. Goodbye for now!

Consultant: Hello, welcome to today's session. You seem a bit down today. Can you share what’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling disappointed with myself after participating in a recent campus event. I thought I would do better, but I didn’t feel I performed well. I keep worrying about what others thought of me.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you really wanted to shine at that event, but it didn't go as planned, leading to feelings of self-doubt and fear of judgment. Can you tell me more about the specific thoughts that crossed your mind during and after the event?

User: I remember thinking that I embarrassed myself in front of everyone. I kept wondering if they were judging me for not being more outgoing or competent.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. So, you've been hard on yourself by focusing on perceived shortcomings. How did those thoughts make you feel emotionally at that moment?

User: I felt anxious and embarrassed. It was as if I was letting everyone down, not just myself.

Consultant: It makes sense that those feelings would arise from such thoughts. Let’s try to unpack those thoughts a bit. When you think about your performance, do you notice any patterns in your thinking? For instance, do you see any extremes, or perhaps some exaggerations in how you view the situation?

User: Yes, I guess I do tend to think that if I’m not perfect, I must be a failure. I see everything in black and white.

Consultant: That’s a common way of thinking—often referred to as “all-or-nothing” thinking. It can be very limiting. If a friend had the same experience, how would you encourage them to view their performance?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to have bad days and that one event doesn’t define their worth.

Consultant: Exactly! You showed great kindness and understanding toward your friend. Now, how might you apply that same attitude towards yourself in this situation?

User: I suppose I could remind myself that it’s okay to not be perfect, and one event doesn’t really reflect who I am.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! Recognizing that one experience doesn’t define you is a significant step. Next, let’s brainstorm some positive aspects of your participation. Were there any moments during the event that you felt like you managed well or learned something?

User: I did manage to talk to a few people, even if I felt awkward. That was a bit of a win for me.

Consultant: That’s an important win! Engaging with others is a positive step. Let’s focus on that. How about setting a goal to record such positive moments in future events? This could help build your confidence over time.

User: That sounds helpful. I think writing down my wins could remind me that I’m making progress.

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping track of your achievements, no matter how small, can reinforce positive self-perception. How are you feeling about using this approach moving forward?

User: I feel a bit more encouraged. I like the idea of celebrating even small successes.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Now, regarding your relationship with your family, how has that been lately? You mentioned wanting to improve communication with them.

User: It’s been okay, but I often feel like they don't really understand me. I want to change that.

Consultant: That’s a very valid feeling. Would you be open to exploring ways to communicate your thoughts and feelings more effectively with them? 

User: Yes, definitely. I think I need to express what I’m experiencing more clearly.

Consultant: Great! It might help to prepare what you want to say beforehand. Do you think having a conversation about your feelings, especially about wanting their support, could be beneficial?

User: Yes, I can see that. Maybe I’ll try sharing my experiences in a light manner first, so they can understand me better.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Approaching it lightly can open up a more comfortable dialogue. What might be your first step in initiating that conversation?

User: I think I can start by telling them about the event and how it made me feel. 

Consultant: Excellent idea! Sharing your experiences can create empathy and understanding. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel more hopeful. I hope they will listen and understand.

Consultant: With this approach, I believe it’s very possible. How about we set a small intention for you this week—perhaps try to express something positive you achieved, whether at school or at home?

User: That sounds good. I’ll try to recall at least one positive experience to share with them.

Consultant: Wonderful! It sounds like you’re making significant progress. As we approach the end of our session, how would you sum up what you’ve gained from our time together today?

User: I feel more equipped to view my experiences positively and to communicate with my family better. I appreciate how you helped me see things differently.

Consultant: I’m thrilled to hear that! You've brought a lot of insight into our conversation today. Just remember, progress takes time, and it's okay to take small steps. If negative thoughts come up, challenge them like we discussed.

User: Thank you! I’ll definitely keep that in mind.

Consultant: Today is our last session, so let's recap. You've learned about recognizing your wins, challenging negative thinking, and approaching your family with openness. You’re moving towards feeling more stable and optimistic.

User: Yes, that sounds right! I'm excited to keep working on these things.

Consultant: That's a fantastic attitude! I believe you’re well-equipped to continue this journey. Remember, if you ever need support, you’re always welcome to come back. Take care, and I wish you all the best!

User: Thank you! I appreciate it.
###################
Consultant: Hello, welcome to today's session! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a mix of emotions. I notice that our conversations with my parents have improved a bit, which makes me feel warm and hopeful, but I also struggle with the overall pressure from my studies.

Consultant: That's great to hear that your conversations with your parents are improving. It sounds like you’re experiencing some positive changes in that area. How do you feel these improvements are impacting your overall emotional state?

User: It definitely helps to feel supported, but the stress from school is really overwhelming. Sometimes I feel like I can't keep up with everything and it brings me down.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed with school responsibilities, especially when you're also trying to strengthen family ties. Let’s focus a bit on your feelings about school. Can you tell me more about the specific pressures you're facing?

User: Well, I have a lot of assignments, and I worry about not doing well. I keep comparing myself to others who seem to handle everything so easily, and that makes me feel even worse.

Consultant: Comparing ourselves to others can often intensify our anxieties. Let’s take a moment to explore those thoughts. What are some of the thoughts that come to your mind when you find yourself comparing with your classmates?

User: I often think that I'm just not smart enough or capable. I feel like everyone else is doing better than I am, and it makes me doubt myself even more.

Consultant: It sounds like you're dealing with very critical inner thoughts. These thoughts can be harmful. What would you say if a friend expressed those same thoughts to you? How might you respond to them?

User: I guess I would tell them that everyone has their own pace and that they shouldn’t be so hard on themselves. 

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate response! Now, let’s see if we can apply that same kindness to yourself. How do you think you could challenge the thought that you’re not smart enough or capable?

User: Maybe I can remind myself of the things I have accomplished, like getting through the first year of college and improving communication with my family.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing your achievements is crucial in building self-confidence. Let’s talk about some strategies to help you maintain this mindset and manage school stress. What activities or practices have you found helpful or enjoyable in the past?

User: I used to enjoy drawing and going for walks, but I haven’t made time for those lately.

Consultant: Incorporating activities you enjoy can significantly alleviate stress. How about we create a plan to make time for drawing or walking each week? 

User: That sounds nice! I think it would help me feel more relaxed.

Consultant: Great! Let’s aim for a couple of hours each week dedicated to those activities. How does that sound to you?

User: I like it! It feels manageable. 

Consultant: Fantastic! This should also aid in boosting your energy and mood. As we draw near the end of our session today, let’s reflect on the progress you’ve made. What do you feel has been your biggest achievement recently?

User: I think my biggest achievement has been improving my relationships with my parents. I feel like they understand me a bit more now.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful accomplishment to recognize! Strengthening relationships takes effort, and it sounds like you’re doing a great job at that. Considering your recent progress, what goals would you like to set for the future?

User: I want to keep improving my family communication and also become more confident in my studies.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! Let’s outline some steps you can take to work towards them. For family communication, maintaining regular check-ins can help. For your studies, perhaps setting small, achievable milestones will reduce the pressure?

User: Yes, I can see how that might work. I can focus on one assignment at a time and keep my parents updated on my progress.

Consultant: Perfect! That approach can definitely help you stay organized and reduce feelings of being overwhelmed. As we conclude today’s session, how do you feel about your progress and plans moving forward?

User: I feel a lot more hopeful and motivated. I like having a plan and recognizing what I've achieved so far.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, celebrating your progress is important. You’ve done so well, and I believe you’ll continue to grow. If you ever feel uncertain again, remember to apply the strategies we discussed today. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and understanding.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It's been a pleasure working with you. Remember, you’re always welcome to come back if you need more support. Take care and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a lot better, actually. I feel like I'm more open to trying new things and I've overcome some of my fears about participating in social activities. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some significant progress. Can you tell me more about that experience with the mock interview? 

User: Sure! Participating in the mock interview was really challenging for me at first, but I pushed myself to do it. I was so nervous, but once I started, I felt more in control than I expected. 

Consultant: That's impressive, Xiao! Facing such a fear and coming out feeling more in control is a big achievement. How did you feel afterwards? 

User: I felt relieved and proud of myself. It was nice to see that I could do something I was so afraid of. 

Consultant: It's very encouraging to hear how you felt proud of yourself. What do you think contributed to your success in that situation? 

User: I think having a positive mindset really helped. I told myself it was okay to be nervous and that I could still handle the situation. 

Consultant: Exactly! Being kind to yourself and acknowledging your feelings can have a huge impact. Moving forward, how do you see these recent changes affecting your day-to-day life? 

User: I hope it helps me not just with interviews but with my classes too. I want to feel more involved and less anxious. 

Consultant: That's a great goal. Let’s explore ways to apply that same mindset to your classes. Can you think of any specific situations in your academic life where you’d like to feel more involved? 

User: I guess speaking up in class or participating in group projects is something I struggle with. 

Consultant: Those are common challenges. What thoughts come to mind when you think about speaking up in class or during group work? 

User: I often think that my ideas won't be good enough or that I'll embarrass myself. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those thoughts. Do you feel those thoughts have stopped you from participating? 

User: Yes, definitely. They make me feel really anxious, so I often just stay quiet. 

Consultant: Let's try to challenge those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that your ideas aren't good enough? 

User: I guess I don’t really have any concrete evidence. It’s just a fear I have. 

Consultant: That’s a good insight. Many times, fears don’t hold up against reality. If a friend were in your position, how would you advise them? 

User: I would probably tell them to give their thoughts a chance and that everyone has something valuable to contribute. 

Consultant: Exactly! And you deserve to give yourself that same kindness. What could be a small step you could take to start participating in class? 

User: Maybe I could aim to share at least one idea during each class. 

Consultant: That sounds like a very manageable goal! How about we set that as your goal for next week? 

User: Yes, I would like to try that. 

Consultant: Fantastic! Let's discuss how you can prepare for that moment. What could help you feel more comfortable when it’s your turn to speak up? 

User: I could jot down my thoughts before class so I feel more prepared. 

Consultant: That’s a solid strategy! Writing down your thoughts can definitely help boost your confidence. How do you feel about this plan? 

User: I feel excited and a bit nervous, but more hopeful than before. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous, especially when stepping out of your comfort zone. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. 

User: Thank you for reminding me of that. 

Consultant: Of course, Xiao. Let’s also discuss some strategies to manage your anxiety before you share your thoughts in class. What typically helps you when you feel anxious? 

User: Deep breathing and trying to focus on positive outcomes usually help me. 

Consultant: That’s great to recognize! Deep breathing can definitely help calm your nerves before speaking. How about we practice a quick deep breathing exercise together? 

User: Sure, that sounds good! 

Consultant: Alright, let’s take a deep breath in for four counts... hold for four... and exhale for four. How did that feel? 

User: That felt calming; I think I can use that before class. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember, practice makes it easier over time. As you prepare for your classes next week, keep this in mind. 

User: I will, thank you! 

Consultant: Before we wrap up, let’s take a moment to reflect on your progress since we started these sessions. What are some key takeaways you’re happy about? 

User: I’m proud that I faced my fear of the mock interview and I feel more optimistic. 

Consultant: Those are significant achievements! You’ve come so far. How do you plan to maintain this positive momentum in the future? 

User: I think by continuing to set small goals for myself and reminding myself of my progress. 

Consultant: That sounds like a strong plan, Xiao. It’s been wonderful to witness your growth. Do you feel ready to conclude our sessions today? 

User: Yes, I think I’m ready to wrap it up. 

Consultant: I’m so proud of you and everything you’ve accomplished. Remember, you have the skills to manage any challenges that arise. If you ever feel the need to talk again, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you so much for everything! 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao! Take care and good luck with everything ahead.
