Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you today! I understand you've been feeling anxious about your English class recently. Can we start by talking about how you feel when you think about attending? 

User: Hi! Yes, I feel really nervous and scared. When I think about English class, my heart starts racing, and I can't focus on anything else. It’s like I just want to escape from the situation.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult. It’s understandable to want to avoid something that makes you feel anxious. Can you tell me more about what happened in your English class that led to these feelings?

User: Well, the teacher gave me a really harsh criticism during class. I felt embarrassed and like I messed up. Now, I can't help but feel scared before every English class. I dread it.

Consultant: It makes sense that the criticism would have such an impact, especially when it’s something you care about. How does thinking about that experience shape your view of attending English class now?

User: I keep thinking that I’m going to fail again or embarrass myself. It feels like all the other students are better than me, and I don’t want to look stupid in front of them.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are really overwhelming. Let’s try to explore them a bit. When you think about the possibility of making mistakes in class, what specific thoughts come to your mind? 

User: I think that everyone will laugh at me, and I won't be able to answer questions. I feel like I’ll just freeze up.

Consultant: I hear how paralyzing those thoughts can be for you. It's important to recognize that these thoughts can distort how you see the situation. What evidence do you have that people would react the way you fear? 

User: Well, I don’t really have any proof, but it just feels that way. I guess I’m just assuming the worst.

Consultant: That’s quite common, especially in situations where we feel vulnerable. Let’s consider other perspectives. If a friend were feeling the same way, what would you tell them about their fears?

User: I’d probably say it’s okay to make mistakes and that no one is perfect. I might remind them that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses.

Consultant: That’s really insightful! Using that same advice for yourself could be helpful. Would you be willing to try to challenge those fears the next time you’re in class? 

User: I would like to try, but I still feel really anxious about it. Just thinking about it makes me nervous.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous. How about we work on some small steps to gradually face those fears? Perhaps by setting a small goal for your next class, like participating in one question?

User: Yes, I think I could handle that! Maybe I could just raise my hand if I know the answer, but I’m still afraid it won’t be right.

Consultant: That’s a good goal! Remember, it's okay if the answer isn’t right. What’s most important is that you’re trying to engage. Would you like to practice a way to calm yourself before class that might help?

User: I think that would be helpful. Sometimes I forget to breathe, and I just panic.

Consultant: Let’s try a simple breathing exercise together. Imagine inhaling deeply through your nose for a count of four, holding for four, and then exhaling through your mouth for a count of four. Do you want to give it a go?

User: Okay, let’s try it. *User practices breathing exercise.*

Consultant: How did that feel for you? 

User: It felt a bit better. I think I’ll try this before class.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Incorporating this technique can really help ease those physical symptoms of anxiety. How do you feel about attending your next English class with this new approach in mind?

User: A little better, but I still feel that familiar fear.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to still feel some fear. Remember, it’s a process, and small steps can lead to progress over time. Would it help to talk about what you can focus on during class to keep your mind engaged?

User: Yes, maybe I could focus on what the teacher is saying rather than worrying about myself. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Shifting your focus outward towards the lesson may help reduce those anxious thoughts about yourself. How do you plan to remind yourself of this during the class?

User: I could write it down and keep it in my notebook. That way, I can look at it if I start feeling anxious.

Consultant: That’s a smart idea! Setting reminders for yourself will serve as a helpful tool to navigate those feelings. Let's also talk about any potential challenges you might face when trying to implement this.

User: I might forget to look at the note if I get too panicky.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. How about creating a routine where you review your note at the beginning of class, so it becomes a habit? 

User: That could work! I can even remind myself to breathe and then look at the note.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! As you implement these techniques, it’s important to track your progress. Would you like to have a follow-up session where we can discuss how this goes?

User: Yes, that would really help! I think having someone to discuss it with will keep me motivated.

Consultant: Definitely! I’m proud of you for taking these steps. Remember, it’s okay to feel anxious, but you have strategies in place now to help you manage it. Let’s check in after your next class and see how you’re doing.

User: I can’t wait! Thank you for your help today!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your experience. Take care, and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Zhu! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to face my English class, but whenever it's about to start, I still feel really anxious and my heart races. 

Consultant: I can see that you're making an effort to confront your anxiety regarding English class. Can you tell me more about what specifically triggers these feelings as class approaches?

User: I think it’s mainly the fear of getting criticized by the teacher again. I still remember the moments when I felt embarrassed, and it just makes me dread attending the class.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable to feel apprehensive after experiencing criticism. What thoughts go through your mind when you think about your teacher’s feedback?

User: I often think that I’m not good enough or that I’ll mess up again. Those thoughts make me feel really small and nervous.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very powerful. Let's explore how realistic those thoughts are. Is there any evidence that supports the idea that you are not good enough? 

User: I guess I do well in other subjects, and my grades in English aren’t awful... but it’s just that when my teacher says something critical, it feels like I fail entirely.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize your overall success in school! It's common to focus on negative feedback, but let's challenge that. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about their abilities and feedback?

User: I’d probably tell them that one mistake doesn’t define their abilities and that they should keep trying. 

Consultant: Exactly! How would you feel if you applied that same advice to yourself? 

User: It seems like a good idea. I just find it hard to believe that one mistake doesn’t mean everything.

Consultant: It makes sense that it’s hard, especially when emotions are involved. Let's try a small exercise. Can you recall a specific time when you received feedback, and how did you cope with it afterward?

User: Once I presented in class, and I stumbled over my words. The teacher pointed it out, and I felt awful. I just wanted to disappear.

Consultant: That sounds really uncomfortable. After that experience, did anything good come out of it, or did it teach you anything?

User: I did learn to prepare better for the next presentation, but I still feel anxious about speaking English now as a result.

Consultant: Learning from that experience is a strong step forward! How could preparing for class differently help alleviate some of your anxiety?

User: Maybe if I practice speaking more beforehand or focus on the material I am confident with, it might help.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Practicing can boost your confidence. Can we also think about some ways to gently face those anxiety-inducing moments such as speaking in class? 

User: Like what? 

Consultant: We could work on gradually exposing you to speaking situations without putting too much pressure on you all at once. For example, you might start by reading quietly or answering questions in smaller groups before transitioning to larger groups.

User: That sounds a bit easier. I might feel safe in a smaller group.

Consultant: Absolutely! Creating a supportive environment is important. Do you think you could start with that next week? 

User: Yes! I can try with a small study group first before class.

Consultant: Wonderful! I’m proud of you for taking that step. What other small actions could help you feel prepared before English class?

User: Perhaps reviewing vocabulary and phrases that I know I’ll use in class. That might give me more confidence.

Consultant: Great idea! Familiarity can significantly increase your comfort level. Let’s also talk about how you can handle any critical feedback you might receive. 

User: I guess I can remind myself that it’s just one person’s opinion and doesn’t define my worth. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic insight! Reinforcing that belief can help lessen the sting. Can we agree to work on this positive self-talk together?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful. I really want to believe that more.

Consultant: I believe in you, Zhu! It takes time, but you are making progress already. By our next session, let's evaluate how these strategies worked for you in English class.

User: Okay! I hope I can feel less anxious by then.

Consultant: That’s the goal! Remember, it's about gradual improvement. Well done today, and I look forward to hearing your updates next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: Hello, Zhu! I'm glad to see you again. Last time, we discussed your progress in participating in English class and the fears you have about making mistakes. How have you been feeling about that lately?

User: Hi! I’ve been trying to focus on participating more, but I still get really nervous about speaking up. I just keep imagining making a mistake and feeling embarrassed again.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way, especially after experiencing embarrassment before. Let's explore that feeling a bit more. What specifically do you think will happen if you make a mistake in class?

User: I worry that my classmates will laugh at me or that the teacher will think I'm not trying hard enough.

Consultant: I hear you. Those thoughts can be really distressing. Let's consider this together. How likely do you think it actually is that your classmates would react negatively if you made a mistake?

User: I guess it’s not very likely, but it's just hard to shake off that fear.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It sounds like you're acknowledging that the fear might be exaggerated, but it still affects you strongly. Can you think of a time when you made a mistake but it didn't turn out as bad as you expected?

User: Well, once I mispronounced a word, and instead of laughing, my classmates helped me to say it correctly. It actually felt nice!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful experience to reflect on! It shows that your classmates can be supportive. How can we use that positive moment to help you feel more confident in speaking up in class?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that they might be supportive—just like that time.

Consultant: Absolutely, that's a great strategy! We can create a little reminder for you to focus on that supportive environment. How about we also discuss setting small goals for your class participation? 

User: Small goals sound good. What kind of goals do you think I should set?

Consultant: Perhaps, start with aiming to answer one question in class each week. How does that sound to you?

User: That seems manageable! I could try to raise my hand once during each class.

Consultant: Perfect! That feels achievable and gives you a chance to practice. Along with that, how about sharing your experiences afterwards? This can help reinforce the confidence you build.

User: Yes, sharing would help! Then I could see how it went and reflect on it.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re creating a positive feedback loop. After you’ve shared, let’s recap what worked well and maybe what you want to improve for next time. 

User: Okay, I will definitely do that. 

Consultant: Great! Also, let’s consider when you start to feel anxious about making mistakes. Can we practice a few phrases you can tell yourself to counter those negative thoughts?

User: Sure! Like what?

Consultant: How about something like, “It’s okay to make mistakes; they help me learn,” or “My classmates are here to support me”? You could repeat these to yourself in class when you feel nervous.

User: I like those! They are encouraging and positive. 

Consultant: I'm glad you do! Integrating those affirmations into your mindset can really help shift your focus away from fear and towards growth. 

User: I will definitely try to remember those during class.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. As we continue our sessions, we’ll focus on celebrating your achievements, no matter how small. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel more hopeful about participating in class now. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Zhu! Remember, progress takes time, and it’s about taking those small steps. I believe in your ability to overcome these challenges. For our next session, think about your experiences applying these strategies. 

User: I will! Thank you for your help today.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Just remember, you’re making great strides. I look forward to hearing about all your successes next time. 

User: Me too! See you next time!

Consultant: See you, Zhu! Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Zhu! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've felt a lot less fear about being in class. I've started participating more, but I'm still a bit anxious when I have to speak up.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Zhu! It sounds like you're making great progress. Can you tell me more about the situations in class where you feel anxious?

User: Well, when the teacher asks questions, I still hesitate before responding. I don’t want to say something wrong, but I want to participate more.

Consultant: That’s a very common feeling, and it shows you care about your contributions. How do you feel right before you respond to a question?

User: I feel a knot in my stomach and my mind races with worry about getting it wrong. 

Consultant: I understand, that tension can be quite challenging. What if we explored some of those thoughts you're having before you speak? What kinds of thoughts run through your mind?

User: I often think, “What if everyone laughs at me?” or “What if I freeze and can’t think of anything to say?”

Consultant: Those thoughts can definitely make you feel anxious. Let's consider them for a moment—how strong do you think the evidence is that people would laugh at you or that you might freeze up? 

User: I guess I don’t really have any proof that they would laugh, but it's just a fear I have.

Consultant: That’s a great realization, Zhu. It might be helpful to challenge those thoughts. If a friend had a similar fear, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably say it’s okay to make mistakes and that it’s a good thing to participate.

Consultant: Exactly! So, can we try adapting that kind of supportive thought for yourself the next time you're feeling anxious? What could you tell yourself before you respond in class?

User: I could tell myself that it’s okay to be wrong and that participating is important for my learning.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Let’s also think about what small steps you could take to practice participating more comfortably. Do you think role-playing might help?

User: Yes, that sounds interesting! It might give me some practice before I actually respond in class.

Consultant: Great idea! We can role-play a class discussion. I will ask some questions, and you can practice responding as if we were in your classroom. How does that sound?

User: I’d like that! It’ll help me prepare.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s say we’re discussing your favorite book. What is your favorite book and why do you like it?

User: I love "Harry Potter" because it’s full of adventure and magic. I like how the characters grow throughout the series.

Consultant: That's a wonderful point! Now, remember that there are no wrong answers—everyone has their own preferences. If you were to answer this in class, what relaxation technique could you use to ease your nerves?

User: Maybe I could take a deep breath before speaking to calm down?

Consultant: Yes! Deep breathing can be a great tool. Let’s try it together: inhale deeply, hold for a moment, and then exhale slowly. How does that feel?

User: It feels good and helps clear my mind a bit!

Consultant: That's great to hear! Now, before we wrap up, let’s summarize the strategies we’ve discussed today to boost your confidence in class.

User: Sure! I can challenge my negative thoughts, practice role-playing, and use relaxation techniques like deep breathing.

Consultant: Exactly! How do you feel about applying these strategies in your next class?

User: I feel excited! I really want to try and see how it goes.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic attitude, Zhu! Remember, it’s okay to take it one step at a time. We can review your experiences in our next session. You've made a lot of progress today, and I'm proud of you!

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about participating now.

Consultant: You're welcome, Zhu! Keep practicing, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support. I'm looking forward to our next conversation!

User: Me too! Goodbye for now!

Consultant: Goodbye, Zhu! Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Zhu! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling about your English class and your studies recently?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really great about my English class lately. After the group project, I feel so much more confident. I even enjoyed speaking up in class!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like the group project was a positive experience for you. Can you tell me more about how that feedback affected your confidence during the class discussions?

User: Yes! When my teacher praised our group, I felt really proud. It made me want to participate more and express my ideas without fear.

Consultant: It's great that you're starting to feel proud of your contributions. That's a significant step towards overcoming your fear. How do you think this newfound confidence can help you in future classes or discussions?

User: I believe it will help me speak up more often and share my opinions. I also think it will make studying feel less stressful, knowing I can express myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy mindset! By focusing on expressing yourself, studying can indeed feel less daunting. Are there specific strategies or goals you have in mind to keep this positive momentum going?

User: I want to set a goal of participating at least twice in every class and maybe work on a few practice conversations with friends to build my confidence further.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals, Zhu! Practicing with friends can definitely help solidify your confidence. How do you think you'll hold yourself accountable for reaching those goals?

User: I guess I could ask my friends to help remind me to speak up in class and even keep track of how many times I contribute during lessons.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Having a support system can motivate you to stay on track. How do you feel about sharing your progress with me in our future sessions?

User: I like that idea! Sharing with you will help me reflect on my achievements and keep me motivated.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Reflecting on your progress is an important part of growth. If you encounter any challenges along the way, how might you handle them?

User: I think I could remind myself of the positive feedback I've received, and maybe talk with my parents or friends if I feel stuck.

Consultant: That's a wise approach. Leaning on your support system and recalling positive experiences can be very effective when facing difficulties. Is there anything else you want to explore today that could help you maintain this positive mindset?

User: I guess I'd like to discuss how to stay calm when I feel anxious about speaking in class or making mistakes.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s normal to feel anxiety in those situations. Can you pinpoint what specifically makes you feel anxious when thinking about speaking in class?

User: I worry that others might not agree with me or think I'm wrong, and that makes me afraid to speak up.

Consultant: A lot of people share that concern. Let's try to challenge that thought. Is there evidence that supports the idea that your classmates would disagree with you? 

User: Not really! They usually seem interested in what we’re discussing, and I've gotten positive feedback.

Consultant: That’s a key insight! It seems like the reality of your classroom environment is more encouraging than your initial fears suggest. How can you remind yourself of this when the anxiety starts to creep in?

User: I could write down the positive feedback and read it whenever I feel nervous. That might help anchor me back to the truth.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Keeping a reminder of positive experiences can serve as a great grounding tool. In what ways do you think this practice could impact your participation in class?

User: I think it would make me feel less afraid to voice my thoughts, and hopefully help me articulate them better when I speak.

Consultant: Exactly! By reinforcing the positive beliefs about your experiences, you’re paving the way for more confident participation. As we wrap up today’s session, what overall feelings do you have about your progress since we started?

User: I feel really proud of myself! I’ve made a lot of progress and I can see how my confidence has built up. I’m excited to continue working on my goals.

Consultant: That’s wonderful, Zhu! You’ve done a great job exploring your feelings and setting actionable goals. Remember to celebrate each small victory along the way. I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello Zhu! I'm really glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing pretty well. I did really well on my mid-term exams, and my parents and teachers were very proud of me. It really boosted my confidence!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like your hard work paid off, and it's great that you received such positive feedback. How do you feel about your learning abilities moving forward?

User: I feel more confident now. I think I can handle my studies better, but sometimes I worry about future exams and whether I can keep up this performance.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way, especially after experiencing success. Let’s discuss how you can maintain this positive momentum. What strategies have you found helpful in your studies so far?

User: I usually make a study plan and try to stick to it. I also ask my teachers for help when I’m stuck. That really helps me understand things better.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Having a study plan and seeking help when needed are both effective strategies. Looking ahead, what goals do you want to set for yourself in your studies?

User: I want to keep getting good grades, but I also want to explore some new subjects, like art or coding. I think it would be fun to learn something different.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Exploring new subjects can keep your learning experience fresh and exciting. How do you feel about balancing your current studies with new interests?

User: I’m a bit nervous about managing my time, but I think I can make it work. I just need to plan it out properly.

Consultant: It's great that you recognize the need for planning. You might consider allocating specific time blocks for these new subjects while keeping your study commitments. Does that sound feasible to you?

User: Yes, I can try that. It would be nice to have a mix in my schedule.

Consultant: Perfect! Mixing subjects can help keep things interesting. Let's also touch upon how you plan to handle any potential challenges that might come up while you’re pursuing these new interests.

User: I think I could face some pressure if I don’t do well at first, but I want to remind myself that it’s okay to struggle while learning something new.

Consultant: That's a healthy mindset! It’s important to give yourself permission to face challenges and not expect perfection right away. If you do encounter difficulties, how might you cope with that?

User: I could talk to my friends or teachers about it, and remind myself that learning takes time. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Having a support system is crucial, and it's wise to remind yourself of the learning process. You’ve made so much progress already. How would you summarize your experiences and growth from our sessions together?

User: I think I’ve learned to be more confident in my abilities and to handle pressure better. The strategies you suggested have really helped, like making plans and reaching out for help.

Consultant: That’s inspiring to hear! It's clear you've not only gained confidence but also practical strategies to manage your studies. As we conclude our session today, what key takeaway do you want to focus on as you continue to grow?

User: I want to remember to stay open to new experiences and not be too hard on myself when things get tough.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway! Staying open and being kind to yourself are important aspects of growth. Zhu, you've done a remarkable job in shaping your mindset and abilities through our work together. If challenges come up in the future, remember the strategies you've learned.
