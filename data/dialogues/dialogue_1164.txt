Consultant: Hello Li! It's great to see you today. I know that you've been feeling quite anxious and self-critical lately. How can we work together during our session today to address these feelings?

User: Hi. Yes, I’ve been really struggling. I feel so self-conscious and anxious, especially after that incident at the singing competition. I just can’t seem to shake off the embarrassment, and it makes me doubt myself even more.

Consultant: I can hear that this experience has really impacted your confidence. Let’s take a moment to explore what happened at the singing competition and how it made you feel about yourself. Can you share more about those feelings?

User: Well, during the performance, I got really nervous and I just went blank. It was so embarrassing. Since then, I’ve been thinking that I'm not good enough, that I’ll never be able to perform well in public. It’s really hard to concentrate in class too.

Consultant: It sounds like that incident has created a bigger narrative for you—that you’re not capable. This kind of thinking can really affect your focus and self-esteem. What thoughts come to your mind when you think about performing or speaking in public?

User: I keep thinking everyone is judging me and that I’ll fail again. I guess I feel like I should just avoid those situations altogether to protect myself from feeling embarrassed again.

Consultant: That makes sense. Avoiding situations where you might feel judged can feel like a way to protect yourself. However, it seems like this avoidance is also making it harder for you to engage in school and other activities. Let’s consider this—what evidence do you have that supports this fear of failure?

User: I mean, I did fail once in front of everyone, and that is hard to forget. It sort of confirms that I’m not good at this, right?

Consultant: I understand why you feel that way, but let’s explore this together. One moment doesn’t define your abilities as a whole. If a friend of yours faced a similar situation, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably encourage them to keep trying and to not be so hard on themselves. I think I’d tell them that everyone makes mistakes.

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate perspective. What if you applied that same kindness to yourself? How might your view of the situation change if you considered it just one experience rather than a reflection of your worth?

User: I guess I would feel a bit better. I suppose it’s just hard to break out of that negative thinking.

Consultant: It definitely takes time and practice. One strategy is to challenge those negative thoughts whenever they arise. For instance, when you think, “I’ll fail again,” try to reframe it as, “I can learn from my past experience.” Does that sound manageable to you?

User: Yes, that seems doable. I can see how it could help me shift my mindset a little.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Now, let’s also think about small steps you can take to gradually face public situations. What’s a low-pressure scenario where you could practice speaking in front of others?

User: Maybe I could start by sharing my opinion during class or even talking to a small group of friends. It might not be as intimidating.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Starting with a small, supportive group sounds like a wise choice. How about setting a goal to do that this week? 

User: Yeah, I’d like that. I can try to speak up during my next group project. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. How do you feel about the steps we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I think acknowledging that I can change my thoughts may help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Li. Before we wrap up, let's reflect on what we've discussed. How do you think you might use these strategies moving forward to improve your situation?

User: I want to remember to challenge my negative thoughts and to practice speaking little by little. I hope that will help me build my confidence.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy, Li. It's about taking those small steps. As we conclude today’s session, keep in mind all the progress you've made. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss before we finish?

User: No, I think we’ve covered a lot. I appreciate your help and guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the insights you’ve gained today. Remember to be kind to yourself and that every step counts. If you need support in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out again. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite uneasy, especially with my friend moving in with me. It just feels too close, and I don’t know how to handle it. I feel a mix of annoyance and sadness.

Consultant: I understand that the change in your living situation has created some tension in your friendship. Can you share more about what specifically makes you feel uncomfortable?

User: It’s like, we used to have our own space, and now everything feels too overwhelming. I’m worried that I’m being too sensitive, but I can’t help it.

Consultant: Feeling overwhelmed in such a close arrangement is completely valid. It’s important to recognize your needs in this situation. What thoughts come to your mind when you feel this discomfort?

User: I keep thinking I should just adapt, but then I feel frustrated and guilty because I know she didn’t do anything wrong.

Consultant: It sounds like you're placing a lot of pressure on yourself to accommodate her while also feeling frustrated. Let’s explore those thoughts further. What does it mean to you to feel guilty about this situation?

User: I guess I’m afraid that if I express how I feel, I might lose her friendship. It’s so important to me, and I don’t want to hurt her feelings.

Consultant: That concern is quite common in friendships, especially when change happens. It seems that you’re valuing the friendship highly but feeling trapped by your feelings. What do you think could be a balanced way to express your needs without damaging the relationship?

User: I’m not sure. Maybe I can just talk to her about it, but I’m scared she might take it the wrong way.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel apprehensive about opening up. However, communication can help you maintain the friendship while also addressing your discomfort. What small step could you take towards having that conversation?

User: I guess I could start by asking her how she’s feeling about our new arrangements. That way, it opens up a dialogue without putting all the pressure on me.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Asking her how she feels can create a safe space for both of you to share your thoughts. How do you think you might feel after having that initial conversation?

User: I think it might make me feel relieved, even if it's a bit scary. I suppose just getting it off my chest would help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Relief from sharing your feelings can lead to a deeper understanding between you. Let's also think about how you can manage your worries about her reaction. What’s a positive thought you can remind yourself of during this conversation?

User: I could remind myself that true friends can handle honesty and that it's better to be open than to keep harboring these feelings.

Consultant: That’s a powerful perspective! True friendships often grow stronger through honesty. How will you prepare yourself to remind yourself of this thought when you feel anxious?

User: Maybe I could write it down and keep it somewhere I can see it, like my phone or a note on my desk.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Having a visual reminder can help reinforce that positive mindset. As you think about the conversation, what other feelings come up for you?

User: I still feel anxious, but also a little hopeful. I really want to tackle this without causing more issues.

Consultant: Hopefulness is a good sign! It's natural to feel that mix of anxiety and hope. As you prepare for your conversation, what is one thing you can do to ground yourself if those anxious thoughts start to creep in?

User: I could take a few deep breaths and remind myself that it's okay to express my feelings. I’ll also remember that it’s a conversation, not a confrontation.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Breathing deeply and framing it as a conversation can help ease anxiety. How are you feeling about your plan as we discuss it?

User: I feel more empowered now. I think I can approach this situation more confidently than I did before.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! It seems you're on the right path to addressing your feelings. Are there any other supports you feel you might need as you take these steps?

User: Maybe just some moral support from a couple of friends who understand my situation can help me feel more at ease before I talk to her.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy approach! Having a support system can help you feel more confident. As we wrap up today’s session, what is your biggest takeaway from our discussion?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is that it’s okay to express my feelings without feeling guilty, and that it could even strengthen my friendship.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! Remember, honest communication is vital in any relationship. Keep practicing these strategies, and I believe you’ll continue to make progress. I look forward to our next session.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you here today, Li. I understand you've been feeling quite anxious about how others perceive you. Can you share a bit more about what's been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been really sensitive to how my roommates talk about their friends, and it makes me feel insecure about myself. It's been hard to focus in class because I keep worrying about what others think of me.

Consultant: I see. So, you're feeling anxious and insecure when it comes to the opinions of those around you, which is affecting your attention in class. What do you think those worries are linked to? 

User: I guess it stems from my upbringing. Growing up in a rural area, I always felt like I had to prove myself. I don’t feel like I’m as good as others, and that makes me worried about what they think of me.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, Li. Feeling like you have to prove yourself can create a lot of pressure. Could you describe a specific situation recently where you felt judged or evaluated by someone?

User: Just last week, my roommate was talking about her friend’s accomplishments, and I started thinking about my own shortcomings. I felt so small and like I could never measure up.

Consultant: It sounds like that comparison made you feel really inadequate and frustrated. When those thoughts come up, what are the specific thoughts that run through your mind?

User: I often think, "I’ll never be as successful as them," or “They probably think I'm a failure." It makes me feel overwhelmed and want to withdraw from social situations.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Li. Those thoughts definitely sound heavy. What do you think happens to your emotions when these thoughts arise? 

User: I feel sad and anxious. It’s hard to even want to talk to my friends because I’m scared they might think badly of me.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Your thoughts seem to create a cycle of anxiety and withdrawal. Let's try to identify if there are any cognitive distortions in those thoughts. For example, “I’ll never be as successful as them” sounds like it might be an overgeneralization. Can we look at the evidence for and against that thought?

User: I suppose I have done well in some of my studies, but it doesn't feel like enough compared to what others have achieved.

Consultant: It's great that you recognized your own achievements! Let's consider if you might be focusing too much on others when you have your own successes. If a friend came to you with those thoughts, what might you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that they are doing their best and that it’s okay to be different. Everyone has their own path, right?

Consultant: Exactly! That’s very insightful. Now, how can you apply that same compassion towards yourself? What would it look like for you to practice self-acceptance during times when you feel judged?

User: Maybe I could remind myself of my strengths and celebrate small successes instead of comparing myself to others?

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful approach! Celebrating your progress can help shift your focus back to your own journey. What small step could you take this week to practice recognizing your achievements?

User: I could keep a journal to write down things I accomplish, no matter how small they seem.

Consultant: I love that idea! Journaling can be a powerful way to reflect on your mindset. How do you feel about sharing what you've written in your journal with someone you trust?

User: I think sharing it could actually help me feel a bit more confident. Maybe I can talk to my roommate about it.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan, Li! Opening up to your roommate could strengthen your connection and support. Let's talk about how to express your feelings when you share your experiences with them.

User: I might start with something simple like, "I’ve been feeling insecure lately about where I stand academically." 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic way to begin! Opening up with honesty often fosters understanding and support. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I also feel hopeful. It’s nice to think I could be more open and maybe find encouragement.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Remember, feeling nervous is a normal part of growth, and taking small steps like this can really help. What else might you do on your journey to focus less on others’ opinions and embrace your own worth?

User: I could start practicing mindfulness or a few deep-breathing exercises when I feel overwhelmed. 

Consultant: That’s excellent! Incorporating mindfulness can help you ground yourself in the moment and reduce anxiety. When can you dedicate some time to practicing that this week?

User: I can set aside ten minutes in the morning before my classes to do some deep-breathing exercises.

Consultant: Perfect! That sounds like a manageable plan. Let’s also think about how you can reflect on your progress during our next session. How will you know if you’re starting to feel less affected by others’ opinions?

User: If I start to feel less anxious or if I’m more willing to engage with my friends, I guess that would show I’m making progress.

Consultant: Exactly, those are great indicators. It will be exciting to hear how you feel about those changes next time. Remember, this process takes time, and it’s all about small steps towards improvement.

User: Thank you! I feel more optimistic about dealing with my feelings and being more open with others.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! You've taken some important steps today. Before we wrap up, let’s summarize what you’ve learned and discussed today.

User: I’ve realized I need to focus on my own journey and achievements rather than comparing myself to others. Writing in a journal and practicing mindfulness will help me feel more confident.

Consultant: Absolutely! You've made fantastic insights today, Li. I believe you have the tools to strengthen your self-acceptance and maintain healthier relationships. Remember, I’m here whenever you need support in the future.

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to our next session. 

Consultant: Me too! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you again. It's great to hear that you've been able to open up a bit more with your friend. Can you share how that conversation made you feel?

User: Hello! It felt really nice to talk with her. I felt understood and accepted for the first time in a while. It’s like we connected on a deeper level, but afterward, I started feeling a bit anxious again.

Consultant: It sounds like that conversation was quite meaningful for you, bringing a sense of warmth and support. However, the anxiety you felt afterward is something we can explore further. What do you think triggered that feeling?

User: I guess after sharing so much, I started to worry about how much I opened up. What if I said too much? What if she judges me?

Consultant: That's a very valid concern, and it's common to feel that way after being vulnerable. You mentioned fear of judgment—can you tell me more about those thoughts? What specifically do you worry she might think?

User: I worry that she'll think I'm weak or too emotional. It's hard for me to believe that sharing my feelings is okay.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, Li. It seems like there's a part of you that equates vulnerability with weakness. Let's work on challenging that thought. What evidence do you have that sharing your feelings makes you weak?

User: Well, I’ve always been told to be strong and not show too many emotions. I guess that idea has stuck with me.

Consultant: I understand where that belief comes from. Many people grow up with the idea that strength means hiding emotions. However, being open and expressive can actually be a sign of strength. How would you feel if you viewed vulnerability as courage instead?

User: That sounds different. I like the idea of being courageous. But it’s hard to shift my thinking like that.

Consultant: It can indeed be challenging, but it’s a journey worth taking. Let's try a small exercise: Can you think of a time when sharing your feelings actually helped you connect with someone or made you feel stronger?

User: Yes, like when I talked to my friend. I felt closer to her afterward, and it made me feel good, even though I initially felt nervous.

Consultant: That's a great example! It shows that expressing your feelings can lead to positive outcomes. Let’s focus on that feeling of connection. How can you remind yourself of this positive experience the next time you feel anxious about being open?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal of moments where I felt good about expressing myself. It might help to look back on it when I feel anxious.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Keeping a journal can reinforce your journey and provide you with evidence that being open can lead to positive connections. How are you feeling about this approach?

User: I feel more hopeful about it. It feels doable to write things down, and I think it might help me remember those good feelings.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Li! Writing can be a powerful tool for reflection. Now, let’s talk a bit about your interactions with others. Are there any upcoming situations where you feel nervous about sharing your thoughts or feelings?

User: Actually, I have a class presentation soon, and I'm really anxious about speaking in front of everyone.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel anxious about public speaking. Let’s explore that a bit. What thoughts go through your mind when you think about the presentation?

User: I keep thinking that I might forget what to say or that everyone will judge me if I mess up.

Consultant: Those are common fears, and it’s important to acknowledge them. Let’s challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that forgetting your lines or being judged will actually happen?

User: I mean, I don't have proof that it will happen. I just have this overwhelming fear.

Consultant: Acknowledging that fear is a big step. What if we reframe that thought? Instead of focusing on the worst-case scenario, what if you focused on preparing and doing your best? How might that change your feelings about the presentation?

User: I think if I focus on preparing, it would help reduce my anxiety. I could remind myself that it's okay to not be perfect.

Consultant: Absolutely! Preparation is key, and embracing the idea of imperfection can free you from a lot of pressure. What specific steps can you take to prepare for your presentation?

User: I could practice in front of the mirror and maybe ask my friend to listen to me run through it.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies! Practicing can boost your confidence. Remember, it’s also important to take deep breaths and visualize yourself succeeding. How do you feel about trying these steps?

User: I feel a bit more confident about it now. It sounds manageable.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Li! As our time is coming to an end today, let’s reflect on what we discussed. What strategies are you taking away from this session that you think will help you in the future?

User: I think journaling will really help, along with practicing for my presentation. I feel like I have a better understanding of the importance of being vulnerable, too.

Consultant: That’s a great takeaway! Remember, you’re making progress in recognizing and challenging those negative thoughts. I'm proud of you for your efforts today, and I believe in your ability to continue checking in with your feelings. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support and guidance.

Consultant: My pleasure, Li! Keep practicing those strategies, and remember, it’s okay to reach out whenever you feel you need help. I look forward to speaking with you again soon.
###################
Consultant: Hello Li! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to practice some mindfulness techniques. I think my emotions have become a bit more stable, but I still struggle with feeling self-conscious in social situations.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've been practicing mindfulness. Building emotional stability is a positive step. Can you share more about the situations where you feel self-conscious? What thoughts come to your mind in those moments?

User: Well, during class discussions, I often feel like everyone is judging me when I speak. I worry that I'll say something wrong or look foolish, which makes me hesitate to participate.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging for you, feeling judged by others. It's common for people to have those fears in social situations. What kind of thoughts do you notice when you start feeling anxious about speaking up?

User: I often think that my classmates are criticizing my ideas, and I can’t shake off the feeling that they think I’m not smart enough. 

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts amplify your anxiety. Let’s take a moment to examine them. How much evidence do you have to support the idea that your classmates are criticizing you? Could there be a different interpretation of their reactions?

User: I guess I have no solid proof. They might just be focused on what the teacher is saying. I tend to overthink things.

Consultant: Recognizing that you may be overthinking is an important insight! It can help to challenge those negative thoughts. If a friend felt the same way you do, how would you suggest they approach the situation?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to make mistakes and that their ideas are valid. But I find it hard to follow that advice myself.

Consultant: That’s a common struggle. It seems you can offer support to others, yet be hard on yourself. What if we tried a small exercise? Next time you’re in class, try to remind yourself of what you would say to a friend instead of focusing on the fear of being judged.

User: That sounds like a helpful idea. I can definitely try reframing my thoughts that way!

Consultant: Excellent! Along with that, let’s plan some small steps to gradually increase your participation in class. How about starting with asking a question or sharing a brief opinion in your next class?

User: I like that idea! Asking a question feels less daunting than sharing a full opinion. I can do that.

Consultant: Great choice! Remember that participating, no matter how small, is a victory. Let’s also practice some mindfulness techniques together to manage the anxiety beforehand. How comfortable are you with mindfulness breathing exercises?

User: I’ve been practicing some breathing techniques! They help, but sometimes I forget to use them when I need to.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Let’s create a reminder system. Perhaps you could set an alarm a few minutes before class to remind you to engage in mindful breathing. Would that work for you?

User: Yes, that sounds doable. I can set an alert on my phone.

Consultant: Fantastic! As you incorporate mindful breathing, focus on grounding yourself in the moment. This can help reduce anxiety before you speak. How do you feel about these strategies we’re discussing?

User: I feel more optimistic. Having a plan makes me feel less overwhelmed.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we wrap up, let’s reflect on your progress. You’re recognizing your thoughts and creating actionable steps. What do you feel your biggest takeaway is today?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is that I have control over my thoughts and that I can challenge them. Accepting that it’s okay to make mistakes is freeing.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! Believing in your ability to manage your thoughts is key to building confidence. As we continue, keep practicing these strategies, and we can discuss your experiences in our next session. What do you think?

User: I think that sounds good! I’m looking forward to seeing how I feel next time.

Consultant: Wonderful! Keep being kind to yourself as you work through these challenges. I believe you’re on the right path. See you next time!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel much better. I've been more confident during group activities, and I find it easier to participate.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made significant progress in your confidence. Can you tell me more about how you've been applying that confidence in social situations?

User: Well, during class discussions, I spoke up more often. It felt new for me, but I managed to share my thoughts with less anxiety. 

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you're speaking up more! How did that make you feel in those moments of sharing?

User: Honestly, it felt freeing. I realized that my contributions were appreciated, and it boosted my mood. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Feeling appreciated can reinforce your confidence. Have there been any moments when you felt your old self-doubt creeping back in?

User: Yes, there were times when I hesitated before speaking, thinking I wouldn’t say anything valuable. But I pushed through those feelings.

Consultant: It’s a commendable effort to push through those doubts. What did you tell yourself in those moments to help you move past that hesitation?

User: I reminded myself that everyone has unique perspectives, including me, and that it’s okay to make mistakes while sharing.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Acknowledging that everyone has something to contribute can help lessen the pressure. Do you think this mindset shift has affected other areas of your life?

User: Yes, it has. I feel more comfortable interacting with my classmates outside of class too, and even helped a friend understand some material we learned.

Consultant: That’s a meaningful achievement! Helping a friend signifies growth in both social skills and self-esteem. Looking ahead, are there specific areas or situations where you'd like to continue developing your confidence?

User: I think I'd like to become more confident in one-on-one settings, like when I have to present assignments to the class.

Consultant: That’s a great target! Focusing on one-on-one presentations can make it easier to build confidence further. What steps do you think you could take to work on that?

User: Maybe I could practice my presentations with a friend first to get more comfortable before the actual one.

Consultant: Practicing with a friend is an excellent approach! It allows you to familiarize yourself with the material and receive constructive feedback. How do you feel about scheduling some practice sessions?

User: I’m excited about that! I really think it will help me feel more confident during the real presentations.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Let's also consider how you might handle any nerves that arise before your presentations. What are some strategies you could use to stay calm?

User: I could try deep breathing exercises or positive affirmations before starting to present.

Consultant: Both of those techniques are very effective! Deep breathing can help ground you, and positive affirmations can boost your confidence. Have you tried those methods before?

User: I've practiced deep breathing a bit, but I never thought about using affirmations. I’d definitely give it a try!

Consultant: That's the idea! Using affirmations can reinforce your self-belief. Let's brainstorm some affirmations you could use before your presentations.

User: How about saying, “I am knowledgeable and capable of presenting well”?

Consultant: That's a strong affirmation! Repeating that statement can help settle your nerves. How do you plan to integrate that into your routine leading up to a presentation?

User: I think I’ll say it to myself a few times before I start, and maybe write it down in my notes.

Consultant: Writing it down is a great way to solidify it in your mind. You’re building a solid toolkit for yourself! As we wrap up, what do you feel has been your biggest takeaway from our sessions so far?

User: I’ve learned that pushing through my fears and recognizing my achievements are key to building confidence. 

Consultant: Absolutely, and that’s a valuable realization. You’ve made impressive strides, Li. It’s important to celebrate these victories! Do you feel ready to maintain this momentum moving forward?

User: Yes, I feel prepared to continue growing. Thank you for your guidance!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of your progress. Remember, you have the skills to manage challenges. If you ever need support, don’t hesitate to reach out. This will be our last session for now; I believe you can carry this confidence forward. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate everything. I've learned a lot, and I’ll definitely keep in mind the strategies we discussed.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Best of luck, and keep building on your strengths. Goodbye, Li!
