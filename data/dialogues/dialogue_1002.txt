Consultant: Hello there! I'm glad you're here today. Let's begin by discussing how you're feeling right now. What's been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite anxious and low lately. Even though the doctor said I'm healed after my injury, I still have these occasional pains, and I'm not sure if I really am okay. It makes me feel really restless and unsettled.

Consultant: It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of uncertainty and that the pain is causing you more distress. It's understandable to feel anxious about your health after an injury. Can you tell me more about how these feelings have been affecting your daily life?

User: Well, I find it hard to concentrate on my studies. My sleep has also been terrible because my classmates stay up late and make noise. I'm constantly worried about my health and it's really frustrating.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. Lack of sleep can definitely affect your emotions and overall well-being. It seems like your worries about your health might be amplifying your feelings of anxiety. What specific thoughts do you have when you experience this pain or when you think about your health?

User: I often fear that there might be something more serious wrong with me. Even when I feel the pain, I question whether it’s a sign of something that hasn't healed properly.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like those thoughts are quite distressing for you. Let's take a moment to explore those thoughts further. When you think, "There might be something serious," how does that make you feel emotionally?

User: It makes me feel really anxious and helpless. I just want to feel normal again and not worry about things that might not even be true.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to want to feel a sense of normalcy again. Let’s work on that together. Can we explore whether those thoughts about something being seriously wrong are based on facts or if they might be an exaggeration based on your fears?

User: I guess they might be exaggerated? I mean, the doctor said I am healed, and my friends tell me I’m okay. 

Consultant: That's a great insight! It seems that there's evidence from your doctor and your friends that supports your healing. What do you think would happen if you tried to challenge those anxious thoughts with evidence from those around you?

User: I suppose I could try to remind myself that I am okay and focus on the things I can do, rather than the pain.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy strategy. It’s about finding a balance and reminding yourself that while you might feel discomfort, it doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong. How about using a journal to track your thoughts and feelings, and see if you can gradually replace anxious thoughts with more rational ones?

User: A journal sounds like a good idea. Writing things down might help me make sense of everything.

Consultant: I believe it could be a valuable tool for you. By capturing your thoughts, it may help you identify patterns in your thinking and emotions. As you notice those patterns, you can start to challenge the more negative or anxious thoughts. What activities can you do to complement this journaling?

User: Maybe I could try doing some light exercise or meditation. I've heard those can help reduce anxiety.

Consultant: Absolutely! Light exercise and meditation are excellent ways to manage anxiety and promote relaxation. It might be beneficial to incorporate these activities into your routine. What specific exercises or meditation practices are you considering?

User: I’m thinking about going for short walks and trying some breathing exercises or guided meditations online.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Short walks can definitely help lift your mood, and breathing exercises can ground you during moments of anxiety. Could you set a goal for how often you'd like to do these activities each week?

User: I think I can commit to walking three times a week and trying to meditate for a few minutes each day.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic commitment! It's important to be gentle with yourself as you navigate through this. Remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time. As we work together, let’s continue to keep track of how these changes affect your thoughts and feelings.

User: I really appreciate how you’re helping me see things differently. I do feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It's a positive step forward. Your willingness to explore your thoughts and feelings is commendable. As you continue to work through these strategies, we can touch base on how you’re feeling in our next session. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?

User: Not right now, I think I've said a lot already. I just want to feel better overall.

Consultant: That’s perfectly okay! We’ve made a lot of progress in understanding your feelings and developing strategies. Remember, improving your emotional well-being is a journey, and I'm here to support you along the way. During our next session, we can review how your strategies are working. 

User: Sounds good! I’ll keep you updated.

Consultant: I look forward to hearing about your experiences. Thanks for sharing today! Take care of yourself, and remember that it's completely okay to seek support whenever you need it.

Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you again! I understand that you've been going through some challenges since our last session. Let's start by discussing how you've been feeling lately regarding your health and your emotions.

User: Hi. I've been really on edge. Even though the doctor said I'm fine now, I can't stop worrying about the pain. I feel irritable and overwhelmed with everything going on, especially with my roommates. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're still feeling quite anxious about your health despite the doctor's reassurance. And it seems that your interactions with your roommates have added to your feelings of irritability. Could you share more about what specifically has been bothering you with them?

User: Well, there was a misunderstanding last week. I thought they were making fun of me for not being able to play football yet. Since then, I've been feeling isolated and frustrated. 

Consultant: That's understandable. It can be really tough when we feel misunderstood by those around us, especially in a living situation. How did that misunderstanding affect you emotionally? 

User: It just made me feel more angry and sad. I thought they didn’t care about what I was going through. 

Consultant: Feeling like others don’t understand or care about your struggles can be really painful. Have you had a chance to talk to your roommates about how you’re feeling?

User: No, I haven't. I'm worried that it might just make things worse, and I don't want to confront them.

Consultant: It's really common to feel hesitant about confronting people when we're already feeling vulnerable. What do you think might happen if you did share your feelings with them? 

User: I guess I’m afraid they’ll dismiss my feelings or say I’m overreacting. 

Consultant: That fear is very valid. It can be daunting to open up when you worry about how others will respond. Let’s think about it this way: what evidence do you have that they would dismiss your feelings? 

User: Well, I don’t really have any clear evidence. I just feel this way because I've been anxious lately. 

Consultant: It’s interesting that you recognize that. It might be helpful to challenge that thought—considering there is no concrete evidence. How would you feel about finding a way to express yourself to them, perhaps in a more controlled manner? 

User: Maybe writing a message would be better than talking face-to-face. I can express myself without worrying about their immediate reaction. 

Consultant: That sounds like a good strategy! Writing can give you the space to communicate your feelings without the pressure of a direct conversation. What would you want to say in this message?

User: I want to explain how their comments made me feel and let them know I’m still recovering and not back to normal yet. 

Consultant: That’s a great start. Writing down how their comments made you feel can help them understand your perspective better. It’s also a way to create awareness of your current situation. How do you think sending that message might help you emotionally? 

User: I think it could help ease some tension and maybe bring us closer again. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Opening that line of communication can be important in repairing the relationship. Moving on to your health worries—when you think about the pain you experienced, how are those thoughts impacting your emotions right now?

User: I constantly think about it, and sometimes I feel like I'm never going to feel completely normal again. 

Consultant: Those thoughts seem to reinforce your feelings of uncertainty and anxiety. Let's try to challenge that mindset. What are some things you can remind yourself of that reflect the positive progress you've made in your recovery?

User: I guess I could remind myself that the doctor has cleared me and that I’m actually feeling a bit better than before. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent point! Acknowledging your healing process can help shift your focus away from the fear of pain towards recognizing your strength and recovery. How does thinking this way make you feel?

User: I suppose it makes me feel a little more hopeful. 

Consultant: Hope is a powerful emotion! Let's build on that. When you start feeling anxious about your health again, could you practice reminding yourself of the progress you've made? 

User: Yes, I can try that. 

Consultant: Perfect! This can be a manageable way to create some emotional distance between fear and reality. Lastly, as we conclude our session today, what do you feel is one key takeaway you can apply this week to help manage both your emotions and your interactions with your roommates?

User: I think writing a message to my roommates could be really helpful, and I’ll also try to remind myself of my recovery progress whenever I feel anxious about my health. 

Consultant: Those are both fantastic strategies, and I believe they will encourage your growth. You have shown a real willingness to engage with these issues today. Remember, it's okay to reach out for support when needed. I'm here to help you whenever you're ready to continue. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: You’re welcome! Take care, and I look forward to hearing how everything goes in our next session.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. Before we start, I'd like to know how you've been feeling recently, especially concerning your living environment.

User: Hi! Well, I've been feeling quite frustrated and a bit down lately. I still find myself sensitive to my dorm environment, which is affecting both my studies and my overall mood.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like your sensitivity to the dorm environment is really impacting you. Could you share a bit more about what specific aspects are bothering you?

User: It's mostly the noise and the overall clutter. I can't seem to focus, and it feels really overwhelming at times. I want to get back to my studies, but I can't concentrate.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It must be difficult when that environment makes it hard for you to study effectively. How has this been affecting your daily life, besides your studies?

User: I feel like I'm on edge all the time. I try to study but end up feeling anxious, which makes me avoid it even more, creating a vicious cycle.

Consultant: That sounds tiring and frustrating. It seems like there’s a cycle of anxiety that’s making the situation worse. Have you had any moments where you felt more relaxed or at ease, even briefly?

User: There were times when I went for walks outside. Those moments felt refreshing, but once I'm back in the dorm, the anxiety creeps back in.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that walking outside helps you feel refreshed, even if temporarily. Let's consider this—a change in scenery helps. What are some small changes you could make in your dorm to help reduce that feeling of overwhelm?

User: I guess I could try organizing my space more or use headphones to block out some noise, but even thinking about doing that feels stressful.

Consultant: Starting with small changes can sometimes lessen the stress of getting started. What if we break these tasks down? For instance, you could aim to organize just one part of your room today. How does that sound?

User: That might actually help. I could focus just on my desk or something manageable. But what if I still feel stressed?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. If stress comes up, you could use some breathing exercises or even take a short break. Remember, taking it step-by-step will help build your confidence. Would it help to set a small time limit for yourself?

User: Yes, maybe setting a timer for 15 minutes could help me stay focused, and if I don't finish, I can just stop without feeling guilty.

Consultant: Exactly! That sounds like a fantastic plan. Setting a timer can help create structure and reduce that feeling of being overwhelmed. What other strategies could we think about to support your emotional state?

User: I’ve been trying to remind myself that I am capable, but sometimes it feels like I’m just convincing myself without really believing it.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially under stress. Let’s explore that thought a bit more—what evidence do you have that supports your capability? Sometimes reflecting on past successes can help reinforce that belief.

User: Well, I managed to handle my recovery from the injury well, and I had good grades in my undergrad. I guess I can do this as well.

Consultant: That's a great insight! Recognizing your past successes is an essential step. How could you remind yourself of these achievements when you start feeling doubtful?

User: Maybe I could write them down or put up some notes where I can see them regularly. That could help me to stay motivated.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! Creating visual reminders can be a fantastic way to boost your confidence. Let's also think about your reaction to clutter—what negative thoughts come to mind when you think about it?

User: I often think I'm falling behind and that it means I'm not managing my life well. It makes me feel inadequate.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, but let's challenge that thought. What might be a more balanced way of viewing your situation, considering the recovery you've gone through?

User: Well, maybe it’s normal to need some time to adjust. I’ve been through a lot, and it doesn’t define my ability to manage everything perfectly.

Consultant: That's a much healthier perspective! Acknowledging that adjustment takes time can ease some of that pressure. As we move forward, how might you practice this kind of self-compassion on a daily basis?

User: I think I can start my day with affirmations, reminding myself that it's okay not to be perfect, and I can take things one step at a time. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Implementing daily affirmations can really enhance your emotional resilience. How do you feel about integrating these ideas into your routine?

User: I feel more optimistic about it. It seems manageable and gives me hope. I want to start working on it right away.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, let’s review what we discussed. You’ve identified some practical strategies for your living space and boosted your confidence through affirmations. How do you feel about this progress?

User: I feel good about it. I finally see that I have tools to help manage my feelings and make changes in my environment.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Remember, you have the skills to adapt and manage your emotions. If you encounter challenges, reflect on your experience today and know you can always reach out for support. Until next time, I believe you can implement these strategies effectively!

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help and guidance. I look forward to our next session.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I look forward to hearing about your progress. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you’re here for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've been trying to focus on managing my emotions better since joining that psychological growth group. But sometimes I still feel anxious and a bit low. 

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re engaging with the group and working on your emotions. Can you share a specific situation from the past week where you felt anxious or low?

User: Well, I had this conflict with a classmate about a project. It really frustrated me, and I couldn’t help but dwell on it for days.

Consultant: I understand how conflicts can really linger in our minds. When you think about that situation, what thoughts come up for you?

User: I keep thinking that maybe I’m not good enough to work in a team, and that others might not take me seriously.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound pretty tough. They can trigger feelings of self-doubt. Can you tell me more about how those thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: They make me feel anxious and a bit depressed like I’m not valuable in group settings. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way when facing such conflicts. We often have thoughts that exaggerate our insecurities. Have you noticed any patterns in your thoughts during these moments?

User: Yes, I tend to jump to conclusions. Like, I think everyone thinks I’m a failure right away, even though it might not be true.

Consultant: That’s an important insight. It sounds like you're experiencing some cognitive distortions surrounding these thoughts. What if we explore some alternative ways to view the situation? What could be another explanation for your classmate's behavior?

User: Maybe my classmate was just stressed about their workload, and it wasn't personal at all.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a more realistic perspective. If a friend came to you with the same situation, what would you advise them?

User: I’d tell them not to take it personally and remind them that one disagreement doesn’t define their abilities.

Consultant: Great advice! Let’s practice using that kind of compassionate perspective towards yourself. What positive affirmation could you tell yourself in these situations?

User: I could say, “I am capable and my worth isn’t defined by one project or one opinion.”

Consultant: I love that affirmation! Using positive self-talk can make a significant difference. As we move forward, have you been able to incorporate any relaxation or self-care techniques?

User: I’ve started meditating a bit and taking short walks outside. It helps, but sometimes I forget to make time for it.

Consultant: That’s a good start! Incorporating these activities regularly can enhance your emotional resilience. What might help you remember to prioritize these self-care practices?

User: Maybe setting a reminder on my phone or scheduling them into my day like commitments.

Consultant: That sounds practical! It can be helpful to treat self-care as essential as your study commitments. How do you feel about making this a new routine?

User: I think I’d feel better having a set time to calm my mind. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Consistency is key. As we continue, let’s also discuss how you can balance academic pressures with social interactions while taking care of your emotional needs. What challenges do you foresee in this balance?

User: Sometimes, I just feel so overwhelmed with studying that I skip socializing, which makes me feel even worse later.

Consultant: It's common to feel that way. Ignoring social interactions can lead to further isolation. What if we brainstorm some quick ways to connect with friends without taking away too much study time?

User: Maybe I could join them for a short coffee break or a quick game in between study sessions?

Consultant: That’s a perfect idea! Just short breaks can help renew your energy. How do you think this could impact your emotional state during study times?

User: It could help reduce my anxiety and make me feel more connected. 

Consultant: Exactly! Staying connected can alleviate stress. As we wrap up today, let’s recap what we've worked on. How do you feel about your progress in understanding your emotional management strategies?

User: I feel more confident about my ability to handle emotions and I really like the idea of positive affirmations.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Remembering to use those affirmations and to incorporate social breaks can greatly enhance your emotional well-being. Looking ahead, what strategies will you implement to maintain this balance in your life?

User: I will prioritize my self-care with a phone reminder and ensure to take short breaks to socialize.

Consultant: Sounds like a solid plan! As you continue practicing these strategies, remember the progress you’ve made. This brings us to the end of our session today. If you keep applying what you’ve learned, I believe you can manage your emotions more effectively. You’re doing wonderfully, and I’m here if you need support in the future. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance, and I will definitely work on these strategies. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.

Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially considering your recent experiences with sports and social interactions?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better since I started participating in sports again. It's nice to be active, but I still worry about keeping it up with my studies and social life.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear you’re finding some positive effects from being active! Balancing sports, studies, and social life can be challenging. Can you share a little more about your current feelings and any specific worries you have about maintaining this balance?

User: Well, when I play football, I really enjoy it and feel happier. But when I think about my assignments, I get anxious and sometimes I avoid them. I feel like I might let my friends down if I don’t keep joining activities, but then I neglect my studies.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re caught in a cycle where the joy from sports is overshadowed by anxiety about your studies and friendships. Let’s explore that—what thoughts come to mind when you think about your assignments or the possibility of letting your friends down?

User: I think that if I don’t do well on my assignments, people will judge me. And I also worry that if I skip playing football, my friends won't want to include me anymore.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite overwhelming. It’s understandable to feel pressured when you care about both your performance and your social connections. What do you think would happen if you didn’t do as well on an assignment? 

User: I guess I imagine people thinking I’m not smart or capable. It just makes me even more anxious about completing them.

Consultant: That’s a common fear, but it might help to question that belief. Do you have any evidence that your friends truly think less of you based on your academic performance? 

User: I don't really have evidence for that. My friends support each other, but still, it’s hard to shake that feeling.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize your friends are supportive. Perhaps we can reframe that thought. If your friend were in your position, struggling with similar feelings, what advice would you offer them?

User: I’d probably tell them it’s okay to mess up once in a while, and that friends care about them for who they are, not just for their grades.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a compassionate perspective. Now, let’s consider practical steps to manage your schedule to include both study and sports. What activities could you try to ensure you’re maintaining both areas effectively?

User: Maybe I can set specific time slots for studying, and leave certain days for football. That might help me stay on track without feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Creating a structured schedule can help reduce the stress of managing both. How do you feel about starting with that kind of approach?

User: I feel positive about it. Having a clear plan gives me something to work with rather than feeling lost.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Would you like to set a goal for how you can start implementing this plan in the next week?

User: Yes! I can aim to dedicate at least three days to study and reserve weekends for football matches or practice.

Consultant: That’s a great goal! It allows you to enjoy your time with friends while also staying on top of your studies. How will you track your progress with this new schedule?

User: I could use a planner or my phone calendar to mark study sessions and football activities. It might help keep me accountable.

Consultant: Using a planner is an excellent idea! It will give you a visual representation of your commitments. How do you feel about sharing this plan with a friend for extra support?

User: That could help. I feel like letting someone know will keep me more accountable and less likely to skip out.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your goals can foster accountability and support. How do you envision discussing this plan with your friend?

User: I could just be honest and tell them I’m trying to balance things better, and I’d appreciate their encouragement.

Consultant: That’s a healthy approach! Being open about your feelings offers a chance for deeper connections. How does thinking about sharing this with your friend make you feel?

User: It makes me feel relieved, actually. Knowing that I have support feels comforting.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful insight! It sounds like you’re gradually gaining a better sense of control over your emotions. Let’s check-in about how you feel about your emotional management overall. What are your thoughts?

User: I feel like I'm starting to handle my stress better. I can see that I have some tools to deal with things.

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress! Recognizing that you have tools to manage stress is a significant step. In this session, we’ve discussed your worries, developed a practical plan, and highlighted the support around you. What do you see as your biggest takeaway today?

User: I think it’s that I can balance both my studies and social life without feeling overwhelmed, as long as I communicate and plan.

Consultant: Exactly! Communication and planning can make a huge difference. As we wrap up today, how will you use this insight moving forward, especially when you feel those anxieties creeping back in?

User: I’ll remember to stick to my plan and reach out for help when I need it. I’ll aim to keep a positive mindset.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid strategy! Keeping that positive mindset is crucial. Just remember, it’s completely normal to have ups and downs in this process. You've made great strides in your emotional management. If you ever find yourself needing further support, don’t hesitate to return. 

User: Thank you! I truly appreciate your help and guidance today. It means a lot.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made and look forward to hearing about your success in balancing everything. Take care, and remember, you’re not alone in this journey!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. I appreciate you coming back for this session. Last time we spoke, we discussed the improvements you've made in managing your emotions and your relationships with your classmates. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a lot better overall. My interactions with classmates have improved, and I don't feel as burdened by my emotions as before. However, I still wonder how to maintain this positive state moving forward.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant improvement! It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling lighter emotionally and connecting better with your classmates. So, what do you think has contributed most to this positive change?

User: I think being able to talk openly with my classmates helped a lot. I managed to clarify misunderstandings, and that eased a lot of tension. However, I'm still not entirely sure how to sustain this going deeper into the semester.

Consultant: It's remarkable that you've taken the initiative to clarify misunderstandings—communication is so key in maintaining relationships. Let's explore some strategies to help you sustain this positive momentum. What aspects of your life or studies do you think could benefit from further development?

User: I feel like I could improve my time management skills, especially as assignments pile up. Balancing my studies with social interactions is tricky, and I want to avoid feeling overwhelmed again.

Consultant: Time management is a great focus, especially when juggling studies and social life. It sounds like you want to create a balance that allows you to engage with your friends while keeping up with your responsibilities. Have you tried any strategies for managing your time so far?

User: I've tried making a schedule, but I often end up deviating from it. I think I need more discipline to stick to it.

Consultant: Creating a schedule is a solid step, and it’s normal to struggle with sticking to it at first. What if we brainstorm some ways to make your schedule more manageable? For example, what if you break your tasks into smaller, more straightforward steps?

User: That might help. If I could focus on just one small task at a time, it might feel less daunting. I guess I could also set up short breaks to avoid burnout while studying.

Consultant: Absolutely! Breaking tasks down into smaller, actionable steps can make them feel less overwhelming and more achievable. Additionally, incorporating breaks can rejuvenate your focus. How do you feel about trying this approach moving forward?

User: I feel optimistic about it! I think it could really make a difference, especially since I can be flexible with my schedule when I need breaks.

Consultant: That's a great mindset to have! Flexibility is essential. Let's also consider other aspects of your personal development. Have you thought about any specific goals you want to achieve, either academically or personally, in the coming weeks?

User: I'd like to improve my self-confidence, especially when it comes to participating in class discussions. I often find it hard to speak up, even when I have something to say.

Consultant: That’s a valuable goal! Building self-confidence in discussions can enhance your learning experience and your connection with others. What do you think holds you back from speaking up in class?

User: Sometimes I worry about saying the wrong thing or being judged. I think this fear prevents me from sharing my thoughts.

Consultant: It's entirely natural to feel that way. Many people experience similar fears. Let’s reframe this—what if we focus on the idea that everyone contributes from their own perspective, and your input is valuable? How would that change your approach to participating?

User: I like that perspective! Realizing that my voice is important could help me feel more at ease. Maybe I just need to remind myself of this when I hesitate to speak.

Consultant: Exactly! That self-reminder can be powerful. We can also practice some techniques to help boost your confidence. For instance, what if you prepared a few points to share each class? This way, you'll have a plan and can gradually build up to contributing more spontaneously.

User: That's a good idea! Preparing beforehand will likely ease some of the anxiety. I’ll give it a try.

Consultant: Wonderful! It sounds like you’re ready to take proactive steps. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you've decided to focus on: improving your time management through smaller tasks and breaks, and boosting your confidence in class participation. How does that sound?

User: That sounds perfect! I feel like I have a clear plan moving forward, and I’m excited to start implementing these changes.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Your enthusiasm is inspiring. Remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time. Keep in mind the progress we've discussed today. You have all the tools you need to manage your emotions and relationships positively. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out again.

User: Thank you so much for your guidance! I’ll definitely keep everything in mind and hope to continue improving.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you, and I’m confident you'll continue to build on the progress you've made. Take care, and I wish you all the best in your studies and personal development.
