Consultant: Hello, Xiaoju! I'm really glad you're here today. Before we start, I’d love to hear how you’ve been feeling lately. Can you share with me what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really down recently. I cry for no reason and can't seem to concentrate in class. With the simulation exams coming up, I’m feeling overwhelmed, and my mom keeps nagging me on the phone about my grades. It's just a lot to handle.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a lot on your plate right now, especially with the pressure from school and your mom. Let’s unpack that a little. When you say you feel down, what kinds of thoughts go through your mind during those moments?

User: I often feel like I'm not good enough and that I’m a disappointment. Even when I try to study, I get distracted and end up thinking that nothing really matters anyway.

Consultant: I hear you. It seems like those thoughts are really heavy for you. You mentioned feeling like it doesn't matter—can you tell me more about what leads you to feel that way? 

User: Well, ever since the pandemic and being stuck at school for so long, I’ve just felt so isolated. Then with the mock exam scores being low, it just felt like everything I do is pointless.

Consultant: Being isolated and receiving disappointing exam results can definitely lead to those feelings of hopelessness. It's understandable that you'd feel overwhelmed. Can we explore what you think about yourself during these low moments? 

User: I often think that I’m just not trying hard enough, or that I’ll never get into the university I want. It's like a cycle of negative thoughts that I can’t escape from.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s important to recognize that this cycle of thinking can intensify your feelings of sadness and anxiety. When you notice these thoughts, do you ever write them down or reflect on them? 

User: No, I haven’t really tried that. I just sort of let them sit there and drag me down.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Writing down your thoughts can be a helpful strategy to start identifying patterns in your thinking. It may also help you to see that not all thoughts are true. Would you like to try that in our sessions moving forward?

User: I guess that could help. I just worry it might make me feel worse seeing them written down.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel that way. However, recognizing those thoughts is the first step in challenging them. Once you see them, we can work together to find more balanced ways to think about them. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds okay. Maybe if I can see them clearly, I can understand why I feel this way?

Consultant: Exactly! We can work on identifying those negative thoughts together. Let’s consider what some of these negative thoughts are, and we can work to understand their impact on your emotions. What was one of the most recent thoughts you had that made you feel this way?

User: I remember just feeling like I’ll never be successful, especially when I saw my friends doing better in their studies while I felt lost.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel discouraged when comparing yourself to others. Can we challenge that thought a little? What evidence do you think there is to support the idea that you won’t be successful?

User: I mean, I have done well in the past... but it just feels so distant now. It’s like all my good moments are just forgotten.

Consultant: It sounds like those past successes seem overshadowed by your current feelings. It’s important to acknowledge your strengths and achievements. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their past successes?

User: I’d probably remind them of their good grades before, or when they excelled at something—like in sports or art.

Consultant: That’s right! You would remind them that they have capabilities and potential. Can you try to give yourself the same kindness and recognition? 

User: I’ll try. It's just hard to see it for myself sometimes.

Consultant: It's completely understandable, and it often takes practice. How about we think of a small step you could take this week to remind yourself of your strengths? 

User: Maybe I could list out some things I’ve done well in the past?

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Writing down those positive experiences could serve as a nice reminder of your capabilities. Additionally, how about setting a small daily goal to focus on? 

User: I could try to study at least for an hour each day without distractions. That feels manageable to me.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Focusing on small, achievable goals can really help you build momentum. And if you ever feel overwhelmed, remember to refer back to that list of your accomplishments. 

User: Yes, I’ll try to remember that. I just hope it helps.

Consultant: It’s a process, and it’s great that you’re willing to put in the effort. Each step you take will bring you closer to finding that balance. Remember, I'm here to support you throughout this journey.

User: Thank you. I appreciate your help. I’ll try to focus on the positive and keep track of my thoughts.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s really encouraging to see you taking these steps. Just remember, it’s okay to have ups and downs. We will continue to explore these feelings together in our next sessions.

User: I look forward to it. Thanks again for listening!

Consultant: Of course! I’m glad you’re here to share your thoughts. Take care and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaojv! I'm glad to see you for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last discussion?

User: Hi! Honestly, it's been a bit of a rollercoaster. Some days I feel okay, but other times I just can't shake off this sadness and memories from the past.

Consultant: I hear you, Xiaojv. It sounds like those feelings from the past are still weighing on you. What specific thoughts or memories have been coming up for you lately?

User: I've been thinking a lot about my family's issues, especially the times when my parents almost divorced. It makes me feel anxious and a bit lost about my own future.

Consultant: That must be really tough to carry such memories around. How do you feel these thoughts impact your day-to-day life, especially with everything you're going through in school?

User: Sometimes, when I'm studying for exams, the anxiety gets so overwhelming that I can't focus. I keep thinking about how my parents' problems might affect me.

Consultant: It makes sense that those thoughts could create anxiety, especially during such a key moment in your life like preparing for exams. Could you share any specific thoughts that pop up while you're trying to study?

User: I often find myself thinking things like, “What if I fail? Or what if I let my parents down?” 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really frightening and heavy. Let's take a moment to reflect on them. What emotions arise for you when you think, "What if I fail?" 

User: I feel this deep sense of fear and pressure. It's like I don't want to disappoint anyone, especially my parents. 

Consultant: Absolutely, it sounds like there's a lot of pressure you feel coming from your family expectations as well. Do you notice any particular patterns in these thoughts or how they make you feel?

User: Yes, when I think like this, I usually feel sad and overwhelmed. It's like this cycle that just keeps repeating.

Consultant: That’s a critical observation! Recognizing these patterns is a big step. Can we explore whether there might be alternate ways of thinking about these situations? 

User: I would like that. But it's hard to see another way sometimes.

Consultant: It can definitely feel that way. Let’s try to challenge those thoughts together. For example, what evidence do you have that failing would lead to letting your parents down?

User: I suppose they haven’t explicitly said that my grades are everything, but I feel like they expect so much from me.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way given the situation, but it might be helpful to consider other interpretations too. If a friend were in your position, what might you tell them about those expectations?

User: I think I would say that they should do their best but that their worth isn't just based on grades.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s a powerful realization. So, your worth is not solely defined by your performance, right? How does that make you feel when you apply that perspective to yourself?

User: It feels a bit relieving, but it’s tough to always believe it, especially when I’m struggling with my studies.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, Xiaojv. It’s a process to change those internal dialogues. Let’s think about some small steps you could take to reinforce that new belief. Perhaps simple affirmations that focus on your efforts rather than outcomes? 

User: That sounds like a good idea. Maybe I can remind myself that my effort is what matters.

Consultant: Yes! That's crucial. It’s about progress, not perfection. What’s one small thing you can do this week that focuses on your effort rather than just results?

User: I could set aside some time each day to study without stressing about grades. Just focusing on learning.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! By focusing on the learning process, you might find that studying becomes less stressful. How do you think you can keep yourself motivated to do that?

User: I can reward myself by taking breaks or doing something enjoyable after my study times.

Consultant: Perfect! It’s great to provide yourself with those rewards. What activities do you think would be most enjoyable for you?

User: I really enjoy drawing and listening to music. I could plan some time for those after studying.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful, Xiaojv. It’s important to make time for activities that bring you joy. How are you feeling about implementing these changes into your daily routine?

User: I feel more hopeful. Having a plan makes things seem less daunting.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Hope is a powerful emotion. Before we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed and how you can continue to develop this positive thinking moving forward. 

User: I realized that I can challenge my negative thoughts and that my worth isn’t just based on my grades. It’s still going to be hard, but I feel like I have strategies now.

Consultant: You’ve articulated that beautifully, Xiaojv! Remember, change doesn’t happen overnight, but you’re already taking significant steps toward aligning your thoughts with a healthier mindset.

User: Thank you! It means a lot to have this support.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m here for you as you continue this journey. For our next session, let’s focus on how those strategies worked for you and any new thoughts that come up. Remember, I’m here whenever you need support.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaojun! I'm glad you're here today. I remember our last session focused on using new communication techniques with your mother. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I've been trying to apply those techniques. It’s been challenging, but I do feel a bit better about my interactions with her. However, I still find myself getting quite anxious about school and my family situation.

Consultant: It's great that you’re trying to apply those techniques! It shows your willingness to improve. Can you share a specific moment where you felt this anxiety particularly strong? What was happening around you at the time?

User: Well, just yesterday, I was studying for a math test, and I kept thinking about how my mom might react if I do poorly. That thought just made me freeze and feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult. It seems like the fear of your mom’s reaction is creating added pressure for you. What specific thoughts ran through your mind when you were feeling overwhelmed?

User: I thought about how disappointed she would be if my grades dropped. I also worried that if I don’t do well, it might lead to more arguments between my parents.

Consultant: I can hear how much weight that thought carries for you. You seem to be feeling a mix of anxiety about your performance and concern for your family dynamics. In moments like this, do you notice any patterns in how you’re thinking? For example, do you find yourself going to extremes in your thoughts?

User: Yes, I think I do! I immediately jump to the worst-case scenarios. Like, if I fail this test, what if everything gets worse? It feels like a spiral.

Consultant: That’s a crucial insight, Xiaojun! Recognizing these extremes can be the first step in challenging them. Can you think of any evidence that supports or contradicts those worst-case scenarios? 

User: I guess there have been times when I did poorly on a test but it didn’t lead to big fights at home. My mom often calms down after she has time to think.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a valuable observation. It sounds like not all situations have led to the outcomes you fear. How might you reframe your thoughts during those moments of anxiety to incorporate this understanding?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that my mom isn’t always angry and that it’s okay to make mistakes. I could also tell myself that one test won’t define my worth or my relationship with her.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! Incorporating that self-compassion and understanding can indeed help mitigate the anxiety. How would you feel about practicing this new way of thinking the next time you're faced with those overwhelming thoughts?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful about it! I’ll try to remind myself of those positives instead of just focusing on the negatives.

Consultant: That’s a promising start! Let’s shift our focus to your study routine. What’s one way you could incorporate a break or a positive activity while preparing for your exams?

User: I could take short breaks to listen to music or go for a walk. It might help clear my mind.

Consultant: That sounds like a really constructive plan. Engaging in activities you enjoy can help alleviate stress. How do you feel about scheduling those breaks into your study sessions?

User: I think it would be good for me. I often forget to take breaks, so writing it down might help.

Consultant: Great idea! Writing it down can serve as a concrete reminder. What else would you like to include in your study plan to support your emotional balance?

User: Maybe I could set aside some time to talk with friends or just enjoy some time for myself after studying.

Consultant: Connecting with friends sounds like a fantastic way to recharge! Social support is important during stressful times. How do you feel after you spend time with your friends?

User: I usually feel much lighter and happier. It’s a good distraction from everything.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Finding balance through socializing is a beneficial strategy. Let’s talk about your family dynamic. Have you seen any positive changes in communication with your mom since trying those techniques?

User: Yes, it feels a bit easier to express myself now without worrying so much. I think she appreciates my efforts as well.

Consultant: That’s wonderful progress! Open communication can really change the dynamics in a relationship. How might you continue to enhance that communication further? 

User: I could share more about how I feel and maybe ask her about her day to keep the conversation light.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Taking an interest in her day could lead to more positive interactions. What's one approach you can take to implement this in your next conversation with her?

User: Next time we talk, I think I’ll ask her about how she feels and share something positive about my day.

Consultant: That’s a lovely approach, Xiaojun! Focusing on positive interactions can lessen tension. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on your progress. You’ve identified negative thinking patterns, practiced reframing, and even planned positive actions. How do you feel about all of this?

User: I feel accomplished! It’s been tough, but I can see how changing my thought process can help improve things. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Remember, it’s okay to have setbacks. The key is to keep reinforcing the strategies you’ve learned. Before our next session, try practicing these techniques, and let’s reflect on how they work for you when we meet again.

User: Thank you! I’ll definitely do that. It feels good to have a plan. 

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xiaojun! I believe in your ability to navigate these challenges. Until our next session, take care and keep practicing those strategies. 

User: I will! See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ju! I’m glad to see you for today’s session. How have you been feeling recently, especially with the mid-term exams approaching?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling quite anxious. It’s hard to concentrate on my studies, and I often find myself second-guessing whether I’m doing enough. But I did have a nice talk with my mom the other day, which felt different from before.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that your conversation with your mom went well. It sounds like you’re experiencing a mix of anxiety about your studies while also making some progress in your family relationships. Can you tell me more about what specifically has been causing you anxiety around studying?

User: I guess it's mostly the pressure of wanting to do well. I know it’s important and I want to make my parents proud, but sometimes it feels overwhelming, and I just freeze up when I sit down to study.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. Wanting to meet those expectations can create a lot of pressure. When you find yourself freezing up, can you recall what thoughts are running through your mind at that moment?

User: I usually think that if I don’t study enough, I’ll fail the exams and that would disappoint my parents. It's like a cycle of negative thoughts.

Consultant: I understand. Those thoughts can be really heavy to carry. You mentioned a fear of failing and disappointing your parents. How do those thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: They make me feel anxious and sometimes even a bit hopeless. I start doubting my abilities, thinking I’m not smart enough.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially with the pressure of exams. Let’s pause for a moment to evaluate those thoughts. How much evidence do you think supports the idea that you're not smart enough? Have you had successes in your studies before?

User: I’ve done well in some subjects and even received praise from my teachers. But when it comes to tests, I still worry a lot.

Consultant: It seems like you do have evidence of your abilities. It might help to remind yourself of those successes during moments of doubt. What might happen if you allowed yourself to acknowledge your strengths instead of focusing solely on the fear of failure?

User: Maybe I would feel less anxious and could focus better on studying. I guess I just need to change how I think about things.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive shift! Changing your perspective is key. Can we explore some practical strategies to help you manage your anxiety during study sessions, like taking scheduled breaks or practicing relaxation techniques?

User: Yes, I think that could help. I often just push through without breaks and get overwhelmed.

Consultant: Taking breaks is essential to maintain focus and energy. Maybe we can set a timer for study intervals followed by short breaks. How does a study routine that includes breaks sound to you?

User: That sounds good! It would give me something to look forward to. 

Consultant: Great! Another technique could be relaxation exercises to help you feel more centered before studying. Have you tried any kind of relaxation techniques like deep breathing or mindfulness?

User: No, I haven’t really thought about those. I’d be open to trying them.

Consultant: Excellent! Deep breathing can be quite effective. Before we finish today, we could practice a simple breathing exercise together. Would you like that?

User: Yes, I'd like to give it a try!

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s take a moment to settle in. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four… hold it for a count of four… then exhale through your mouth for a count of six. Let’s repeat this a couple of times.

User: *follows the breathing exercise* That felt nice. I feel a bit more relaxed now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Practicing that regularly can help you manage anxiety. As we wrap up, can we review what we've discussed today? 

User: Sure! I've learned to challenge negative thoughts, use timed study breaks, and practice relaxation techniques.

Consultant: Yes, those are fantastic strategies! Remember to celebrate your small victories and not be too hard on yourself. How do you feel about your study approach going forward?

User: I feel a lot more hopeful! I think I can manage my time and emotions better now.

Consultant: That's encouraging to hear, Xiao Ju! You’ve made great progress. As a final thought, what can you do to maintain this positive mindset, especially when facing challenges?

User: I can remind myself of my past successes and use the techniques we've talked about. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Continue applying these skills, and they’ll help you navigate through stressful situations. Remember, it’s okay to reach out when things feel tough. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You're very welcome. I believe in your ability to manage these challenges, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!

User: It definitely helps. I feel like I can think more clearly after practicing it, and my anxiety is less intense.

Consultant: It sounds like you're gaining more control over your anxiety. Can you think of a specific situation where you applied this technique recently?

User: Yes, last week I had a test and I was really nervous before it. I took a few deep breaths beforehand and it calmed me down a lot.

Consultant: That’s an excellent example. You’re already taking proactive steps to manage your feelings. How did you feel about your performance after using the breathing technique?

User: I think I did okay! I wasn't as anxious as I usually am, which allowed me to concentrate better on the questions.

User: I feel more confident. I think I can handle things better now, and I’m looking forward to applying what I’ve learned.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset to have! Moving forward, what specific challenges do you foresee that you’d like to tackle using these strategies?

User: Well, I’m worried about the final exams coming up. I want to maintain this calmness and confidence.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel some concern about finals. With the techniques you've learned, how can you prepare yourself both mentally and emotionally for them?

User: I could try to set up a study schedule and remind myself to breathe when I start feeling overwhelmed again.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Structuring your study time and incorporating relaxation techniques will certainly be beneficial. Do you feel ready to face these upcoming exams with this structure in place?

User: Yes, I do! I feel equipped to manage my stress and I think I can handle it better this time.

Consultant: That's the spirit! Remember, you can always lean on those strategies you’ve practiced. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to discuss regarding your current state or future plans?
