Consultant: Hello Xu! I'm glad you could come to our session today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’ve been feeling really lost since starting university. I used to be a central figure in high school, and now I feel like nobody notices me. It’s confusing.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. The transition from being a big fish in a small pond to a more ordinary role can be difficult. Can you tell me more about how this change has affected your emotions?

User: I have these emotional ups and downs. Some days I feel like I don’t know who I am anymore. It's like I have two different sides of myself—one that wants to fit in and another that feels like I don't belong.

Consultant: It sounds like this internal conflict is creating a lot of uncertainty for you. Can you share a specific situation where you felt these emotions particularly strongly?

User: Sure. During a group project, I tried to share my ideas, but they got overlooked. It made me feel insignificant, like I didn’t matter at all. Afterward, I just felt really down about myself.

Consultant: I can see how that experience would make you question your value. What thoughts went through your mind at that moment regarding your role in the group?

User: I thought maybe my ideas were stupid, and I kept wondering why I even tried. It made me feel like I wasn’t good enough, you know?

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It seems your mind jumped to a negative conclusion about your worth based on that one experience. Can we explore if there’s evidence for that thought? 

User: I guess there really isn't evidence. I mean, it was just one project. But it still bothers me because I feel like I should be doing better.

Consultant: It's understandable to want to excel, especially in a new environment. If a friend experienced a similar situation, how might you advise them to view it?

User: I would probably tell them that it was just one project and that everyone has off days. They shouldn’t judge their worth based on one moment.

Consultant: Exactly! It's great that you can recognize that for someone else. Can we try applying that same kindness to yourself? 

User: Yeah, I see your point. I just don’t always feel that way about myself. 

Consultant: It’s a process, Xu. We can work on building that self-compassion together. You mentioned wanting to understand your emotional ups and downs. What do you think might be at the root of these feelings?

User: I think it might stem from not knowing who I am right now. I have this perception of myself that is tied to my past accomplishments, but now I feel like a blank slate.

Consultant: That’s a profound insight. It’s common to struggle with identity during transitions. Could there be strengths or interests from your past that you could explore to help form your new identity?

User: I used to enjoy writing and debating, but I haven't really engaged in those things since coming to university. 

Consultant: Why not recommit to those activities? They could help you reconnect with your interests and provide a sense of accomplishment again.

User: That could help. I guess I’ve just been so focused on fitting in that I forgot what I actually like doing.

Consultant: Finding time for your interests can be a powerful way to reinforce your identity and boost your self-esteem. How do you feel about setting a small goal this week to engage in one of those interests?

User: I think that’s a good idea. Maybe I can join a writing club or something. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Engaging with others who share your interests could also help you feel more connected. How are you feeling about this idea?

User: A bit excited, actually! I feel like I might be able to rediscover a part of myself.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on the progress you’ve made. You’ve identified some root causes of your feelings and begun to think about reclaiming your interests to boost your self-esteem. 

User: Yeah, I feel more hopeful. But I know there are still challenges ahead.

Consultant: That’s completely normal. Remember, it’s a journey, and there will be ups and downs. What strategies will you use to maintain this newfound understanding as you move forward?

User: I think I’ll keep reminding myself to be kind to myself and seek out those activities I enjoy. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Xu. I believe in your ability to navigate this transition. Today has been a great step towards building a more stable self-image, and I'm here for you as you continue this journey.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to our next session. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello Xu! Welcome back. I’m glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed. University life is different from what I expected, and I often feel anxious about fitting in with everyone.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you’re finding it challenging to adjust to the new environment and socialize. Can you tell me more about the specific situations that make you feel anxious?

User: Well, during group activities or when I try to approach someone to start a conversation, I feel really self-conscious. I worry that they won’t like me or that I’ll say something stupid.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable, Xu. Many people experience such feelings when trying to connect with new people. What thoughts run through your mind in those moments?

User: I often think things like, "They probably don't want to talk to me" or "I'll just embarrass myself." It's frustrating because I want to make friends, but my mind keeps getting in the way.

Consultant: Those thoughts you’re having seem quite negative. They can create a barrier to forming connections. Can we explore how these thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: They make me feel really anxious and sad. It’s like a cycle; the more I think like that, the worse I feel, and the harder it is to reach out to others.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that, Xu. It seems that your thoughts are contributing to your feelings of anxiety and sadness. What would happen if you tried to challenge those thoughts? For instance, what if you considered the possibility that others are open to meeting new people?

User: I guess I really haven't thought of it that way. I mostly focus on the worst-case scenarios. It's just hard to picture a positive outcome.

Consultant: That’s a common struggle. Let’s try this together. Can you think of a time when someone approached you and you felt pleased about that interaction? What made that encounter positive?

User: Hmm... there was one time during orientation when someone came up and introduced themselves. I remember feeling glad because it was nice to connect, even though I was nervous.

Consultant: That’s a great example! It shows that people can indeed be open to connection. How could you apply what you learned from that experience to future interactions?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that other people might feel just as nervous, and that starting a conversation could be a good thing for both of us.

Consultant: Exactly! By reframing your thoughts, you can create a more balanced perspective. What do you think would be a small step you could take to practice this in your daily life?

User: I could try to smile and say hi to someone in my class. It doesn’t have to be a big conversation to start with, right?

Consultant: That's a perfect idea! Small, manageable steps can lead to more comfort over time. How do you feel about setting that intention for your upcoming classes?

User: I feel a bit excited actually, but also a little nervous. It’s kind of a leap for me.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that mix of excitement and nervousness. Embracing those feelings can be part of the process. If you find it overwhelming, you can always take a moment to breathe and remind yourself of the positive outcome you illustrated earlier.

User: Yes, I’ll definitely keep that in mind. I really want to improve my self-esteem and feel more confident in myself.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal, Xu. Each step you take will help reinforce your self-esteem. Would you like to set some other goals for our next session to track your progress?

User: Absolutely! I’d like to find ways to express myself more and maybe even participate in a group project without feeling anxious.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! Let's work together to figure out strategies for those scenarios. For now, remember to celebrate small wins, like saying hi in class. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds great! It feels nice to have small goals to work towards. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. As we continue working together, we’ll keep building on these strategies. You’re doing well, Xu, and I'm here to support you through this process.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’m feeling a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, it’s a journey, and you’re making progress. Let’s review what we discussed today and how you plan to implement these strategies. What’s one thing you’d like to take away from this session?

User: I want to focus on challenging my negative thoughts and taking small steps towards engaging with my classmates. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic takeaway! Challenging those thoughts will be key, and starting small makes it manageable. Before we wrap up, do you have any final thoughts or questions?

User: No, I think I’m all set for now. I just feel grateful to have a plan.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re feeling grateful and ready to take on the challenge. I look forward to our next session, where we can discuss your experiences and any progress made. Take care!

User: Thank you! I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: Hello, Xu! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, especially regarding your interactions with others?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit confused about my relationships. I’ve been trying to connect more with my classmates, but I often feel misunderstood and distant from them. It makes me doubt my social skills.

Consultant: I understand that navigating relationships can be challenging, and it's normal to feel a bit uncertain. What specific situations have made you feel that way recently?

User: Well, there have been a few instances where I thought I was joking with a friend, but they seemed upset. I'm worried that I might be saying the wrong things.

Consultant: It's great that you're reflecting on these interactions. Humor can sometimes be tricky in friendships. Can you recall the feelings you experienced when your friend reacted unexpectedly?

User: Yes, I felt embarrassed and anxious afterward. I worry they might not want to be friends with me anymore. 

Consultant: That sounds tough, and it's understandable to feel anxious about it. Let's explore that thought: "My friend might not want to be friends with me anymore." How likely do you think that is?

User: I guess it's not very likely. We've been friends for a while, and they usually respond positively. 

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! It's easy to jump to negative conclusions. What alternative thought might you have in that situation, considering your friendship history?

User: Maybe I could think, “They might just need some time to process it.” 

Consultant: That sounds much healthier! By challenging the negative thought, you're allowing more space for positive possibilities. As we continue, let’s think about specific social skills that could help you feel more confident. What skills do you think you need to work on?

User: I think I need to work on reading people's reactions better and maybe how to communicate more clearly. 

Consultant: Excellent points! Developing those skills is essential. We can practice reading non-verbal cues together and role-play some communication scenarios. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds helpful! I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let's start with a simple situation. Imagine you were in a group discussion, and one person seems uncomfortable with what is being said. What do you think you should do?

User: I might try to change the subject or ask them how they feel.

Consultant: That's a solid approach! Being observant and checking in can help create a more supportive environment. Would you like to role-play that scenario now?

User: Sure, I can try that. 

Consultant: Perfect! I’ll play the role of your classmate. Let’s say we’re discussing a topic, and I look uneasy. How would you approach me?

User: I’d say, “Hey, you seem a bit uncomfortable. Is everything okay?” 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful way to express concern! How did that feel for you?

User: It felt good to check in and maybe help someone. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Such questions can foster connection and understanding. How do you feel about practicing more of these interactions in real life?

User: I think it could help, but I’m still a bit nervous about it. 

Consultant: Feeling nervous is completely normal. We can work on gradually increasing your exposure to these situations. Would you like to set a specific goal for the coming week regarding your interactions?

User: Yes! I want to start a conversation with someone in my class that I don't know well. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Starting a conversation can be a great way to build new connections. How do you plan to approach this?

User: Maybe I'll ask them about a project or a shared class we have.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect icebreaker! Keep it light and casual. As you prepare for this, what can you remind yourself if you start feeling anxious? 

User: I could think about how it’s just a conversation, and they might be just as nervous as I am.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful reminder! Everyone experiences social anxiety at some point, and approaching the situation with understanding can ease some of the pressure. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel like I’ve gained some useful strategies. Talking through those scenarios helped me see things differently.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xu! It's great to notice how discussing these situations can shift your perspective. As we wrap up, let's reflect on your progress. What do you believe is your biggest takeaway from our sessions?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is that I can manage my anxieties about social interactions and actually improve my skills. 

Consultant: Absolutely! You've made significant steps toward understanding your feelings and setting goals. Remember, if you encounter challenges in the future, you can always revisit these techniques. I'm here to support you. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your guidance. 

Consultant: You're welcome! It was a pleasure working with you today. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Good luck with your conversations, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xu! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing okay. Participating in school club activities has given me a sense of self-worth, but I also feel a lot of pressure about planning my future.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're finding value in your club activities! It sounds like you're enjoying the social aspect while also feeling the weight of future expectations. Can you tell me a bit more about the pressure you're feeling around your career planning?

User: Well, I’ve made new friends and that makes me happy, but I keep wondering if I'm choosing the right path for my future. I’m not sure what I want to specialize in yet.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel uncertain about your future, especially when you’re still exploring your interests. What have you thought about in terms of your interests and what you might want to study further?

User: I like literature and writing; they make me feel inspired. But I'm worried they might not lead to a stable job.

Consultant: It sounds like literature and writing resonate with you deeply. Let's explore that more. What kind of careers do you think could arise from pursuing your interest in literature and writing?

User: Maybe something in publishing or even teaching, but I'm not sure if I really want to pursue those. I'm scared of not succeeding.

Consultant: Fear of not succeeding is a common concern when considering a career path. Let's break this down a bit—what specific thoughts come to mind when you think about not succeeding in a career related to literature or writing?

User: I think about how competitive it is in those fields, and I worry that I may never get a chance to prove myself.

Consultant: I understand that competition is daunting and can create feelings of insecurity. Could we consider alternative perspectives, though? What other qualities or skills do you have that might help you stand out in a competitive field?

User: I guess I'm good at connecting with people and understanding their stories. I could use that in writing.

Consultant: That's a valuable skill! Connection and empathy can greatly enhance storytelling and writing. Given that strength, how can we begin to weave that into your future plans? 

User: I could think about focusing on writing stories that represent different perspectives. That might allow me to use my skills effectively.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Focusing on diverse perspectives could not only fulfill your interests but also create a meaningful impact. What are your thoughts on setting short-term goals to explore this path? 

User: Maybe I can join a writing workshop or take an elective class in creative writing this semester.

Consultant: That’s an excellent suggestion! Engaging in a workshop or class can provide both practice and feedback, which is essential for growth. How do you feel about committing to that as a short-term goal?

User: I feel excited about it. It sounds like a good way to practice and learn more about writing.

Consultant: Wonderful! That enthusiasm is key. As we move forward, let’s also keep an eye on how it impacts your feelings about your capabilities in this field. How might you handle any feelings of doubt that arise while pursuing this goal?

User: I could remind myself of my strengths and focus on progress rather than perfection. 

Consultant: Exactly! Developing that habit of self-encouragement will help immensely. As you explore this new goal, what strategies could you use when you notice self-doubt creeping in?

User: I could keep a journal to reflect on my progress and jot down positive feedback I receive. 

Consultant: A journal is a wonderful tool for reflection and affirmation. It can serve as a reminder of your journey and your growth. As we begin to wrap up, what steps will you take in the coming week towards your goal of exploring writing opportunities?

User: I’ll look for writing workshops available at school and register for a creative writing elective.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! As you take these steps, remember to celebrate each little achievement along the way. Before we end today's session, how are you feeling about your chosen path now compared to when we started?

User: I feel more confident than before. I have a clearer idea of what I want to pursue, and I feel less anxious about the future.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’ve made significant progress today. As a final thought, if you encounter challenges in the future, remember the strategies we discussed, and don’t hesitate to seek support. You’re doing great, Xu, and I look forward to hearing about your journey next time.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xu! I'm glad you're here for today's session. Before we start, how have you been feeling lately regarding your studies and your interest in your major?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling a bit anxious. I’m really interested in my major now after talking with some seniors, but I still feel uncertain about how to improve my skills. I'm worried that I might not keep up.

Consultant: It's great to hear that your interest in your major has increased! Feeling anxious when trying to improve is completely normal. Can you share more about what specifically makes you feel uncertain about improving your skills?

User: I think it’s mostly about not knowing where to start. I feel overwhelmed by all the information and methods out there. I want to be effective in my studies, but I often just sit there, unsure of what to do.

Consultant: That sounds tough, feeling overwhelmed can be really difficult. Let’s explore this together. What would you say is your current study routine like, and how do you decide what to focus on?

User: I usually try to study a lot but don’t have a clear plan. I just go through my notes, read some articles, and sometimes I end up just scrolling my phone instead of studying.

Consultant: It seems like you’re putting in the effort, but without a structured approach, it can lead to distractions. Would you be open to discussing how we might create a more effective study plan together?

User: Yeah, I think that would help. I definitely need a better plan to manage my time and focus.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s start by looking at what specific goals you’d like to achieve with your study plan. What do you want to accomplish in the next few weeks?

User: I want to improve my understanding of my courses. Also, maybe even finish my assignments ahead of time to avoid the stress of last-minute work.

Consultant: That’s a solid goal! It sounds like managing your time and assignments better could really help with your stress. How about we set up a weekly schedule that includes specific times for studying each subject and breaks to help you stay focused?

User: That sounds good! I think having specific times might help me stick to studying instead of getting distracted.

Consultant: Great! Let’s break it down. How many subjects do you have, and how often do you think you’d like to study each one?

User: I have four main subjects. I’d like to study each of them at least twice a week if possible, along with some time for assignments.

Consultant: That’s a good start! So, if we plan for each subject twice a week, we can create a balanced schedule. How long do you think each study session should be?

User: I think maybe about 1 to 1.5 hours per session would be manageable.

Consultant: That sounds reasonable. What would you like to do during those sessions? For example, reviewing notes, practicing problems, or something else?

User: I think reviewing my notes and doing some practice problems would be helpful. It would reinforce what I’ve learned.

Consultant: Excellent choice! Combining review with practice is a great way to solidify your understanding. Let’s set some specific times now. Perhaps you want to designate certain days for certain subjects?

User: Yes! I can study Subject A on Mondays and Tuesdays, Subject B on Wednesdays and Thursdays, and so forth. That sounds doable.

Consultant: That plan sounds promising! How do you feel about committing to this schedule for the next week and seeing how it goes?

User: I feel excited! I hope this helps me feel more in control of my studies.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Tracking your progress next week will be important. Let’s also discuss how you can handle feelings of anxiety if they pop up during your sessions. What do you think might help you in those moments?

User: Hmm… maybe taking a short break to breathe or remind myself that it’s okay to struggle a bit?

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Taking a break can definitely help reset your focus, and self-compassion is key. You’re not alone in this, and it's okay to face challenges. 

User: Yeah, I sometimes forget to be kind to myself about my progress. I’ll try to keep that in mind.

Consultant: Remember, recognizing your feelings and allowing yourself some grace is a big part of the learning process. You’re making progress! How do you feel about your self-esteem right now in relation to your studies?

User: I feel somewhat better since I’m more decisive about studying, but I still have those lingering doubts.

Consultant: Those lingering doubts are a natural part of the learning process, but let’s work on building your confidence. Can you think of one small success you’ve had recently in your studies that made you feel good?

User: I suppose discussing things with seniors and understanding parts of the topic better has helped me feel a bit more confident.

Consultant: That’s an excellent win! Recognizing your progress is important. Hold on to that feeling, and let’s think about how you can replicate that success when studying on your own. 

User: I can definitely try to reach out to classmates as well when I have questions. I think studying with others might help clear up confusion.

Consultant: Absolutely! Collaborative learning can be very effective. Scheduling study sessions with classmates could also boost your confidence and understanding. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I’ll definitely look into that.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we approach the end of our session today, let’s summarize what you’ve learned and planned to implement moving forward.

User: Sure! I’ll create a structured study schedule for my subjects, include time for practice, and try to reach out to classmates for study sessions.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan for growth! Also, remember to be gentle with yourself during this process. What strategies will you use to maintain your emotional balance?

User: I’ll remind myself to take breaks when I feel stressed and think positively about my accomplishments.

Consultant: That’s excellent! Keeping a positive perspective is key. You've made tremendous strides today, Xu. session. How do you feel now compared to when we started?

User: I feel much more optimistic. I think I'm ready to tackle my studies with a clearer approach!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Keep building on this momentum. If challenges arise, don’t hesitate to come back. You’ve got this! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate the support and guidance. I feel more equipped to handle my studies now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to see your confidence growing. Have a fantastic week, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xu! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty good, actually. Finishing that project really boosted my confidence, and I’ve been enjoying my time in college more than ever.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made some significant progress. Can you tell me more about how completing that project impacted your self-esteem?

User: Sure! Getting positive feedback from my teacher made me feel recognized and capable. I realized that I'm capable of achieving my goals and that my efforts really pay off.

Consultant: It's great that you felt recognized and capable. That acknowledgment can really reinforce your motivation. How are you planning to maintain this positive outlook moving forward?

User: I think I want to set more goals for myself, maybe take on new projects. I just want to keep building on this confidence.

Consultant: Setting new goals sounds like a healthy way to build on your recent successes. What types of projects are you considering?

User: I’m thinking of joining a student organization or maybe starting a small community service project. It would be nice to engage more with my peers.

Consultant: Engaging with peers can be a wonderful way to expand your social network while also challenging yourself. Have you thought about how you might feel when you embark on these new activities?

User: I guess I’m a little nervous about meeting new people. But I also feel excited about potential friendships and new experiences.

Consultant: That mix of nervousness and excitement is completely normal. It shows that you care about the outcome. How can you prepare yourself to manage any anxiety that may arise when meeting new people?

User: Maybe I could practice some relaxation techniques or remind myself that everyone is probably just as nervous as I am.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach! Practicing relaxation techniques can help ground you during social interactions. What relaxation techniques have you tried before?

User: I’ve done some deep breathing exercises and meditation; they really help calm my mind.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies. Incorporating them before social interactions can help minimize anxiety. How confident do you feel about using these techniques going forward?

User: I feel quite confident about it. I just need to remember to use them in the moment.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a solid plan in place. To help you remember, you might consider setting reminders or visual cues for yourself. How does that sound?

User: That sounds like a good idea! I could keep a reminder on my phone or put a sticky note on my desk.

Consultant: Great! Those simple reminders can be really effective. What else do you think would help you maintain this positive mindset as you take on new challenges?

User: I think it would help to reflect on my successes regularly. Just taking a moment to acknowledge my achievements might keep my spirits high.

Consultant: Reflecting on your successes is an excellent way to reinforce your confidence. Perhaps you could keep a journal to document these moments. Would that be something you’d be interested in trying?

User: Yes, I love that idea! Writing things down will help me see how far I’ve come.

Consultant: I'm glad you like it! Journaling can be a powerful tool for self-reflection. As we wrap up today, is there anything else on your mind that you’d like to discuss before our next session?

User: No, I think we covered everything important today. I feel really motivated to keep moving forward.

Consultant: I'm happy to hear that, Xu! It sounds like you're in a great place to continue growing. Remember, you have the tools and mindset to face future challenges. I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Take care, Xu! See you at our next session. Remember to stay proactive and keep reflecting on your achievements.
