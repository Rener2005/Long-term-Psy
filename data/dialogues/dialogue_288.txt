Consultant: Hello, Xiaolu! It's nice to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. To be honest, I've been feeling really anxious. The thought of finding a job is overwhelming, and I feel like everyone around me is moving on while I'm just stuck.

Consultant: I hear you. It's completely understandable to feel anxious about job hunting, especially when it seems like everyone else is making progress. Can you tell me more about what's going through your mind when you think about finding a job?

User: I keep thinking that I’m not good enough compared to my classmates. They seem to have everything figured out, and I feel lost and hopeless. 

Consultant: It’s tough to feel that way, Xiaolu. It sounds like you’re comparing yourself to others and feeling inadequate. How does that make you feel about your own abilities?

User: It makes me feel really small and sad. I used to be confident in my skills, but now I’m doubting them all the time. 

Consultant: I can see how that doubt can be really discouraging. What specific thoughts go through your mind when you're feeling this way?

User: I often think that I’ll never find a good job, or that I’m not qualified enough for what I want. I just feel like giving up sometimes. 

Consultant: It sounds quite overwhelming. Let's explore those thoughts a bit. How realistic do you think it is that you’ll never find a good job? 

User: I guess it’s not completely realistic, but it’s hard to shake that feeling off, especially when I get rejection emails. 

Consultant: Rejection can really sting, and it’s understandable that it would reinforce those feelings of doubt. But what if, instead of thinking you’ll never find a job, we considered other possibilities? 

User: I suppose there are jobs out there that I might actually be qualified for... It’s just hard to see them when I’m feeling this way.

Consultant: That’s valid. Sometimes, our anxiety can cloud our vision of opportunities. How about we try to identify some potential job roles that align with your skills and interests? 

User: That could help. I used to enjoy project work in my studies; maybe something related to that might work for me.

Consultant: Great! Remembering what you enjoy is important. Let’s look at how you can shift your focus back to your strengths in project work. What specific skills do you think you have that are valuable in that area?

User: I think I’m good at organizing tasks and collaborating with others. But I still worry if they’re enough to stand out.

Consultant: Organization and collaboration are valuable skills! It’s common to worry about standing out, but what if you considered how your unique experiences shape your approach to projects? 

User: That’s a good point. I guess my background gives me a different perspective. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Your unique experiences can set you apart in a positive way. How do you feel about learning to emphasize those strengths in your job applications? 

User: I think that might boost my confidence. I’d feel more proud of who I am and what I bring to the table.

Consultant: It sounds like a promising approach! Let’s also consider if there are any activities or strategies you can implement to manage your anxiety better while navigating this process. 

User: I haven’t really thought about that. What do you suggest?

Consultant: One strategy could be setting smaller, manageable goals for your job search—like applying to one job a day or networking with a classmate each week. What do you think?

User: That sounds reasonable. It would feel less daunting than trying to tackle everything at once.

Consultant: Exactly! Breaking it down can make it feel more achievable. You could also incorporate some relaxation techniques to help with the anxiety. Have you tried any before?

User: Not really. I’m not sure what would help me to relax.

Consultant: Some people find that deep breathing exercises or mindfulness can be very calming. Would you like to learn a simple breathing technique for our next session?

User: Sure, that could be useful. 

Consultant: Perfect! I’m glad you’re open to trying new strategies. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed. You’ve identified your skills, and we’ve talked about setting smaller goals and relaxation techniques. How do you feel about the progress made today?

User: I feel a bit better, actually. I see that there are things I can do to take control. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiaolu! Remember, it’s a journey, and taking small steps can lead to meaningful change. For our next session, we can explore those strategies further. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’ll see you then!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to our next session. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaolu! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite overwhelmed, actually. With TOEFL preparations, I can't seem to focus on my studies. I'm also feeling confused about my career path because my family's financial situation makes me doubt whether studying abroad is even realistic.

Consultant: I can see that you’re feeling a lot of pressure with your studies and the uncertainty regarding your future. Let’s start by clarifying your feelings around your studies and your family situation. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you try to focus on your exam preparations?

User: Sometimes, I think that I’m just wasting my time because I'm not sure if I can afford to study abroad. It makes me anxious, and I end up staring at my books without absorbing anything.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of anxiety due to the uncertainty of your situation. Your thoughts about time being wasted can be quite heavy. What kind of emotions does this thought bring up for you when you study?

User: I feel frustrated and defeated. It's like I’m stuck between wanting to study hard and feeling that all my efforts might be pointless.

Consultant: That frustration is completely understandable given your circumstances. Let’s explore that thought a bit more—what evidence do you have that studying hard is pointless? Are there any examples that suggest your efforts could lead to something positive?

User: Well, I did pass my previous exams, which means I can study well. But, I guess I just feel like there’s a big gap between passing tests and actually making a successful career out of this education.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you’ve had success with your exams! It’s important to acknowledge your accomplishments. However, it’s also understandable to feel like there’s more to achieve. How do you see that gap between your studies and your career plans? What thoughts come to mind about your future?

User: I think I have a lot of interests, but I don’t know which one I should pursue. Sometimes, I feel like it’s better to stick to something safe rather than risk it all for something uncertain.

Consultant: Sticking to something safe can feel comforting, especially in uncertain times. But fear of risk can also hold you back from discovering what truly excites you. What if instead of focusing on the uncertainty, you listed your interests and potentials? Could we do that together?

User: I guess I could try that. My interests include research in sustainable agriculture and environmental science, but I'm unsure if they would lead to a good job afterward.

Consultant: Those are incredibly worthwhile fields, and they have a growing demand. Let’s examine your thinking a bit: Are you leaning toward dismissing your interests purely based on job security? What if we explored the possible opportunities in those areas?

User: That makes sense. I often worry about not finding work in those fields, but I haven’t really researched what jobs are out there.

Consultant: Researching potential job opportunities can take away some of the fear and uncertainty. Let’s start by setting small goals around this. Would you be open to dedicating some time this week to look into careers related to your interests?

User: Yes, that sounds doable. I think just having a plan could ease my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a positive thought! Having a plan can indeed help reduce anxiety. You mentioned earlier about feeling defeated with your studies too. Let’s consider setting up a daily study schedule that includes breaks and rewards. What do you think about that?

User: A schedule sounds helpful. I struggle to stay motivated, especially since I feel overwhelmed by all my responsibilities.

Consultant: That’s a common feeling, but we can tackle it together. Creating a structured study plan with clear, manageable goals can help. Why don’t we set a specific time for your TOEFL study and a small reward for completing those tasks?

User: I like that idea. Maybe I could treat myself to a nice snack or watch an episode of my favorite show if I stick to my plan.

Consultant: Perfect! Treats can be great motivators. As you follow the plan, notice how you feel after completing your study goals. It might also help to reflect on how focusing suddenly becomes easier when you have a clear, relaxed mindset. 

User: That does sound better. I’ll try to stay positive. However, sometimes those positive thoughts feel unrealistic.

Consultant: It’s understandable to struggle with believing in positive thoughts. What if we worked together to challenge those unrealistic thoughts? For instance, when you catch yourself thinking positively is unrealistic, you could ask yourself, “Is this thought valid? What evidence supports it?”

User: I can see how challenging negative thoughts could change how I approach things. I’ll give that a shot!

Consultant: Wonderful! Notice how taking a moment to question those thoughts can give you a different perspective. As we work through this, it may take time, so be patient with yourself. How do you feel about our discussion so far?

User: I feel a bit lighter! Talking about it helps me see things more clearly. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiaolu! Before we wrap up, what are your next steps based on our conversation today?

User: I plan to look into job opportunities in my fields of interest, follow a study schedule for TOEFL, and practice challenging my negative thoughts. 

Consultant: Sounds like a solid plan! Remember, it’s a journey, and I’m here to support you. We can connect again to discuss your progress and any new challenges. 

User: Thank you for your help today! I’ll take these steps seriously.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I believe you have the strength to manage this. I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaolu! I'm glad to see you today. I know you've been feeling quite overwhelmed with your thesis revisions. Can you share more about how you’ve been coping with the pressure recently?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been struggling a lot. My advisor keeps asking for changes, and every time I think I'm done, there’s more to fix. It's really disheartening, and I just feel stuck.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly frustrating, especially when you're putting in so much effort. I'm here to help you work through some of these feelings. Can you tell me how this constant revision process has affected your confidence in your academic abilities?

User: It makes me doubt myself a lot. I used to feel confident about my research, but now I keep questioning if I'm even cut out for this. I feel powerless.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when facing repeated challenges. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. When you think, "I'm not cut out for this," what emotions come up for you?

User: Mostly anxiety and sadness. I think about the time and energy I've invested, and it feels like it's all for nothing. I can't help but feel like I'm failing.

Consultant: It’s tough when you feel like your efforts aren’t yielding results. Let’s dig a little deeper into that thought. How realistic do you think it is to consider yourself a failure based on the feedback you've received?

User: I don't know... it feels pretty real to me right now. But I guess I could try to think about all the successes I've had before, like my past projects.

Consultant: That's a valuable insight! Reflecting on past successes can help balance your current feelings. If a friend were in your position, how would you advise them? What would you say to encourage them?

User: I would probably tell them that revisions are part of the learning process and that it doesn’t mean they’re a failure. It’s just feedback, right?

Consultant: Exactly! It’s a process many go through, and feedback is meant to help you grow. Let’s challenge that negative thought about failure together. What evidence do you have that you are succeeding in your studies despite these challenges?

User: I’ve completed other projects successfully, and I’ve even received good feedback on my work before. I guess I can’t ignore that.

Consultant: Precisely! You have a track record of success. It’s important to acknowledge that the current revisions don't erase your accomplishments. How would it feel to shift your focus from the pressure of revisions to the learning opportunities they provide?

User: That might help. If I see it as a chance to learn, it could take some of the pressure off. But I still feel so anxious about all the expectations.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious. Since it might help to manage your time and expectations, would you be open to creating a structured plan for your revisions? This could help you feel more in control.

User: That sounds good. If I have a clear plan, it might reduce some of the chaos in my mind. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s outline that plan together. How about starting with specific goals for each revision session? What do you think would be a reasonable goal for your first session?

User: I think I could aim to work on just one section of my paper at a time. It feels more manageable to break it down like that.

Consultant: That's an excellent approach! Breaking it down makes it less overwhelming. How many sessions do you think you need to revisit each section?

User: Maybe two or three focused sessions per section, depending on how much feedback I get.

Consultant: That sounds balanced. Remember, it's okay to take breaks in between to clear your head. Have you thought about incorporating any self-care activities into your schedule?

User: Not really. I usually just dive back into work, but I suppose I could use some breaks to recharge. Maybe watching a show or going for a walk.

Consultant: Those are wonderful ideas! Incorporating breaks to recharge can significantly help manage stress. How do you feel about integrating those activities into your revision plan?

User: I feel more hopeful thinking about it. It seems doable now. I could plan some fun breaks between my revision sessions.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Having those breaks will help keep your energy up and your mind fresh. As we conclude our session today, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway about managing your thesis stress?

User: I realize that I can organize my work better and that it's okay to seek balance with self-care. I don’t have to do it all at once.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway, Xiaolu! Remember, it’s perfectly fine to take things step by step. You’re capable of handling your challenges. As we wrap up, how confident are you in your ability to implement this plan going forward?

User: I'm feeling more confident now. It feels nice to have a clear plan and some strategies to handle my feelings better.

Consultant: I'm so pleased to hear that! Remember, you're not alone in this process. We can revisit and adjust your plan together when needed. As you move forward, trust in your skills and accomplishments. You’ve got this! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I feel more prepared now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It's been great working with you. If you ever want to discuss your progress or any new challenges, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care! 

User: I will. Bye for now!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaolu! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been thinking a lot about my career choices lately. I attended that career guidance lecture and it's made me really think about my future, but I'm still uncertain about my abilities.

Consultant: It's great to hear that the lecture sparked some thoughts about your future. What specifically has been on your mind regarding your abilities and these new career options?

User: I guess I'm worried that I'm not qualified enough to pursue something different, especially considering my family's background. Sometimes I wonder if I'll just end up failing.

Consultant: I hear you. The fear of not being qualified can be quite overwhelming, especially when you're considering a big change. Can you tell me more about what parts of your current situation make you feel unqualified?

User: Well, my family isn't well-off, and I see my friends who come from better backgrounds. They seem to have more resources and opportunities. I worry that I don't measure up and might struggle to compete with them.

Consultant: That sounds tough, feeling pressured by comparisons. It’s important to recognize that your journey and experiences are unique. What strengths do you think you have that could help you in a new career path?

User: I do have strong research skills from my studies, and I've been involved in group projects which taught me teamwork. But I doubt if that’s enough compared to what others might bring.

Consultant: Those are valuable skills, Xiaolu! Strong research and teamwork abilities are crucial in many fields. How might you evaluate these strengths against the jobs you're considering?

User: I haven't really thought about it that way. Maybe if I list out my skills and see them alongside the job requirements, it could give me a clearer picture.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Putting your skills in the context of potential job requirements can help shift your focus from doubt to possibility. Would you be open to trying that exercise together?

User: Yes, I would appreciate that. I think it could really help.

Consultant: Excellent! Let's start by identifying a few job options that interest you. Can you name a couple?

User: Sure, I’ve been looking into positions in research and maybe even some jobs in NGOs that focus on community development.

Consultant: Those are wonderful options. Now, let’s list out the skills and experiences you currently have that align with these roles. How about you begin by mentioning any relevant experiences related to research or community work?

User: Well, I did a research project on sustainable agriculture last semester, and I volunteered at a local community center for a few months. 

Consultant: Both experiences are significant! They show your initiative and commitment. How do you feel about including these experiences in your career exploration?

User: I feel a bit more confident, actually. Maybe I do have something to offer!

Consultant: Absolutely! Now, let’s focus on the potential challenges you might face and how you can address them. What concerns do you have about applying for these roles?

User: I think the biggest concern is that I might not have enough practical experience or connections in these fields.

Consultant: That’s a common concern. Building connections can take time. What steps could you take to start networking or gaining more practical experience in these areas?

User: I could attend more workshops or events related to my interests, and maybe reach out to professors or professionals in those fields for advice.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Taking proactive steps can empower you and build your confidence. How does that sound to you?

User: If I can just get started on those, I think it might alleviate some of my worries.

Consultant: Definitely! By focusing on actionable steps, you’re taking control of your career path. As you consider these actions, what do you think might energize you to follow through?

User: I think the idea of finding a job that I actually enjoy and contributes to my community sparks my motivation.

Consultant: That’s a powerful motivator! Remembering why you’re interested can keep you moving forward. Let’s reflect on this session today. What insights or feelings are you taking away?

User: I feel like I have more clarity and a plan to evaluate my strengths. I also feel less alone in this process.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made progress in recognizing your capabilities and potential avenues for growth. Are there any specific strategies you want to carry forward from here?

User: I want to focus on networking and maybe reach out for more mentorship opportunities. That feels like a solid plan.

Consultant: Great! Engaging with others can really enhance your confidence and understanding of the field. As we wrap up today, I want you to remember that you are capable of navigating this journey. 

User: Thank you! This really helps me to see things in a new light. I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaolu! I’m excited to see how you progress. Remember, you're always welcome to come back if you need more guidance. Take care and I look forward to hearing about your journey next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaolu! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since we last spoke? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling somewhat better. My motivation for studying and working has returned a bit, which is nice. But I still have this lingering anxiety about my new internship and whether I'm really cut out for a career in human resources.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling a bit better! It's completely normal to feel anxious when starting something new. Can you tell me more about what specific aspects of the internship are causing you anxiety? 

User: I’m worried that I won’t perform well. I have a fear of making mistakes and disappointing my supervisor. I really want to do a good job, but sometimes it feels overwhelming.

Consultant: It sounds like you have high expectations for yourself, which can indeed be overwhelming. What kind of thoughts go through your mind when you think about potentially making a mistake at your internship? 

User: I often think that if I make a mistake, it means I'm not qualified for this field. I start imagining all the negative consequences that could come from it.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy to carry. Let's try to explore that a little more. What evidence do you have that making a mistake would mean you're not suited for this field? 

User: Well, I guess I don't have concrete evidence. I just feel that if I mess up once, I won't be able to recover.

Consultant: It's understandable to worry about that, but it's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes, especially when starting out. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them? 

User: I would probably tell them that making mistakes is a part of learning and that they shouldn't be too hard on themselves.

Consultant: Exactly! Just like you would support a friend, it's essential to turn that same kindness toward yourself. What if we reframe that belief? Instead of seeing mistakes as evidence of your inadequacy, how about viewing them as opportunities for growth? 

User: That makes sense. I guess I can see it that way, but it’s still hard to let go of the fear.

Consultant: That’s completely normal. Let’s think about ways to approach this fear. Have you had any positive experiences during your internship that could help build your confidence? 

User: Yes, actually! I received some positive feedback on a project I worked on last week. It felt great to know I was on the right track.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It's a powerful reminder that you are capable. How can you use that positive feedback to challenge the negative thoughts when they arise? 

User: I could remind myself of that feedback and think about what I did well, instead of fixating on the fear of making mistakes.

Consultant: Absolutely! That's a great strategy. You might even consider keeping a list of your accomplishments and positive feedback, so you can refer to it anytime those fears creep in. What do you think about this strategy? 

User: I think it could help. Having a tangible reminder of my achievements might make me feel more secure.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Xiaolu. Let's delve into some practical ways to incorporate this strategy into your daily routine. What specific steps could you take to remind yourself of your successes? 

User: Maybe I can start a journal where I write down positive feedback and moments I felt accomplished at work.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Journaling can also help you process your emotions and track your growth. How do you feel about trying this out for the next week? 

User: I feel motivated to give it a try! I think it could really help me shift my perspective.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let’s also discuss some activities you could engage in to help reduce your anxiety in general. What kinds of things usually help you feel more relaxed? 

User: I enjoy going for a walk or practicing yoga. Those usually calm my mind.

Consultant: Perfect! Incorporating walks or yoga into your routine could help reduce that anxiety. How about setting a goal to include one of these activities a few times a week? 

User: Yes, I think I can commit to that. It sounds manageable.

Consultant: Great! Remember to celebrate those moments of self-care. Lastly, as you continue with your internship, what long-term goals do you have for your career in human resources? 

User: I want to develop my skills and eventually take on more responsibility. I’d love to help create a positive workplace culture.

Consultant: Those are wonderful goals, Xiaolu! Focusing on positive contributions to workplace culture can be very motivating. As we wrap up, let’s summarize some of the strategies we've discussed today. What will you take away from this session? 

User: I’ll focus on reframing my thoughts about mistakes, keep a journal of positive feedback, and incorporate more relaxation activities into my routine. 

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! I'm proud of you for taking these proactive steps. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. If you ever feel overwhelmed, just come back, and we can work through it together. 

User: Thank you so much for your support! I feel more optimistic now and ready to tackle my internship.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaolu! I’m here whenever you need assistance. I believe in your ability to succeed. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaolu! It's great to see you again. As we start today's session, I'm eager to discuss what you've achieved since our last meeting. How are you feeling overall?

User: Hi! I'm feeling pretty stable and positive. I've been reflecting on my internship experience, and I'm happy with the feedback I received from my advisor. It's made me feel more hopeful about the future.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you have gained a lot of valuable insights from your internship. Can you tell me more about what specifically you found rewarding from that experience?

User: I was able to apply what I’ve learned in class, and my advisor praised my work. That acknowledgment really boosted my confidence and made me more excited about my field.

Consultant: It sounds like receiving that praise from your advisor was a significant turning point for you. How do you think this experience will influence your future career decisions?

User: I’m thinking of continuing my research with this advisor. I'm feeling more inclined to pursue a PhD, which I wouldn't have considered before.

Consultant: Pursuing a PhD is a big decision! What aspects of your current journey are you most excited about regarding this potential path?

User: I think the opportunity to conduct independent research and contribute to knowledge in my field excites me. Plus, I enjoy the academic environment.

Consultant: That's a great perspective! Engaging in research can be incredibly fulfilling. It seems like you have a clearer vision for your future now. Are there any concerns you still have about taking this next step?

User: I do worry about the stress that comes with graduate studies and whether I can manage it alongside everything else in life.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have some concerns about managing stress. Let's explore this together. What strategies have you considered or used in the past to cope with stress during demanding times?

User: I usually try to stay organized and plan my tasks ahead. However, when things get overwhelming, I sometimes shut down and avoid facing my responsibilities.

Consultant: Recognizing that pattern is an important step. It might be helpful to explore ways to balance organization with self-care practices to prevent that shutdown. What activities do you find relaxing or energizing?

User: I enjoy reading and taking walks outside. Those moments help me clear my mind.

Consultant: That's excellent! Incorporating those activities into your routine, especially during busy periods, could be very beneficial. How do you feel about scheduling specific times for those activities alongside your study plans?

User: I think that could work well. Having that time set aside might prevent me from feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! Setting aside time for relaxation will help you recharge and maintain focus. Let's also discuss how you can structure your goals to create a balanced schedule. What goals do you have in mind for the upcoming months?

User: I want to finish my current coursework, start preparing for the GRE, and explore potential research topics. 

Consultant: Those sound like solid goals. Breaking them down into manageable steps can make them less daunting. What might be the first step you could take toward reaching each of these goals?

User: For my coursework, I can create a weekly study schedule. For the GRE, I can start with a study guide. As for research topics, I could dedicate some time to reading relevant literature.

Consultant: Those are clear and actionable steps! How do you feel about setting check-in points for yourself to assess your progress on these goals?

User: That seems helpful. I could use a journal to track my progress and reflect on what’s working and what isn’t.

Consultant: Journaling is a powerful tool. It can not only keep you accountable but also serve as a space for reflection. How does this plan make you feel about handling your future challenges?

User: I feel more in control and less anxious just thinking about it. Having a plan gives me a sense of direction.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It seems like you're gaining clarity and confidence for your future. As we begin to wrap up, let’s summarize what you’ve gained from our discussion today. What stands out to you the most?

User: I think the importance of balancing my academic demands with self-care. Also, having a structured plan makes me feel more equipped to face challenges. 

Consultant: That's a significant insight. Maintaining that balance will serve you well as you navigate your academic and personal goals. As we conclude today’s session, what would you like to take away from our conversation?

User: I want to commit to my goals and ensure I make time for myself. I believe I can manage my responsibilities better now.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic takeaway, Xiaolu. You’ve made great strides, and I have no doubt you’ll continue to succeed. Remember, it's okay to seek support as you need it. If challenges arise, feel free to reach out again. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support and guidance throughout this process.

Consultant: You're welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Take care and good luck with your plans!
