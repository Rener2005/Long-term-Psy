Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello. I've been feeling quite low, to be honest. I often think I'm a burden to my family and that I'm not really helpful to anyone anymore. It's been hard to shake those feelings.

Consultant: I understand that those feelings can be really heavy. It seems like you’re feeling disconnected and perhaps a bit isolated. Have there been any specific moments recently that have made you feel this way?

User: Yes, during the lockdown, I just felt so alone. I can’t go out like I used to, and it makes me feel like there's no purpose anymore. I hate feeling like this.

Consultant: It sounds really challenging to feel so isolated, especially when you value connection with others. Let's explore that a bit more. When you say you feel like a burden, what kind of thoughts come to mind in those moments?

User: I often think that my family would be better off without me. I feel like just a hassle to them. It makes me want to keep to myself.

Consultant: I hear you. It’s understandable to have such thoughts, especially in tough times. But let’s take a moment to examine the evidence behind those feelings. Is there any part of you that feels your family values your presence?

User: They do say they love me, but I just can't shake off this feeling that I'm just in their way.

Consultant: Those feelings are valid, but it can help to look at this differently. If a friend felt the same way, what would you tell them?

User: I would tell them they are loved and that they matter, even if they can't do much anymore.

Consultant: Exactly! You would remind them of their worth. What if you tried to speak to yourself with that same kindness? What might shift in how you view your role in your family?

User: I suppose I could try to remind myself that I’m loved, but it’s hard to believe.

Consultant: It can be tough, but it's a good start. Let’s work on identifying small moments when you can connect with your family. What’s a small interaction you enjoy having with them?

User: I like when they visit and we have tea together. It feels nice, but I also worry I’m just slowing them down.

Consultant: Enjoying a cup of tea together is a lovely way to connect. Instead of focusing on slowing them down, could you focus on the joy that the connection brings—both to you and to them?

User: I guess I could focus on how nice it is for all of us to be together, rather than worrying so much.

Consultant: That sounds like a good shift! Another aspect we could explore is how you might initiate these moments of connection more often. Do you think that could help?

User: Yes, if I felt up to it, I could try to invite them more often. 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Let’s think of one small step you can take this week to invite a family member over for tea. What could that look like?

User: Maybe I could ask my daughter to come over this weekend; I think I can manage that.

Consultant: Wonderful! That sounds like a great plan. How do you feel about reaching out to her this weekend?

User: I feel a little nervous, but also excited about it. I want to try.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous, but it’s also great to see some excitement. Remember, creating these connections could reinforce your own sense of value. Let’s practice thinking positively about this invitation. What positive thoughts might help you feel more confident?

User: I could tell myself that spending time together is valuable for both of us. 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a fantastic way to frame it. You’re not just a guest; you bring value to these interactions. Lastly, how can we ensure you keep these thoughts close, especially when feeling down?

User: Maybe I could write them down and read them when I'm feeling low.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Keeping reminders of your value could be really helpful. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize our steps. You’ll invite your daughter over, focus on the positive aspects of your family connections, and jot down affirmations about your worth. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I feel a little lighter just talking about it.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it’s okay to seek connection and build on those moments as they come. If you ever feel overwhelmed, we can always talk more about it next time. How are you feeling about our session today?

User: I feel hopeful. I really want to try these things. Thank you for helping me.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of you for being open and willing to engage. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to hearing how it goes with your daughter next time.

Consultant: Hello! It's wonderful to see you today. I understand you've been feeling a bit lonely lately. Can you share more about how you're feeling?

User: Hello. Yes, I often find myself sitting alone and staring into space. I feel quite isolated, especially when the caregivers are busy and don't seem to notice me.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds really tough to feel that way, especially when you want to connect with others. Could you tell me more about those moments when you feel isolated? 

User: Well, when I see other residents chatting with each other, I want to join in, but I hesitate. I worry they won’t want to talk to me, or I’ll just be a bother.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. It’s hard to put yourself out there when you're feeling unsure. What do you think stops you from joining in when you see others interacting?

User: I guess I'm afraid of being ignored. Sometimes I feel like I'm just taking up space and it makes me think I'm a trouble for everyone. 

Consultant: It sounds like you have some really strong feelings about being unwanted. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. When you think, "I'm a bother," how does that make you feel about yourself?

User: It makes me feel worthless, like I'm not good enough to be around anyone. It's really depressing.

Consultant: I can see how those thoughts could bring you down. Let's try to challenge that thinking. What evidence do you have that would suggest you are a bother to others? 

User: I don’t know... sometimes maybe I talk too much or say the wrong thing, but I really don’t mean to. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're afraid of saying the wrong thing, which is very common. But are there times when others have engaged positively with you? 

User: Yes, actually. There are a few caregivers who seem to enjoy my stories about my time as a doctor, but I don’t think it’s the same with the residents.

Consultant: That’s valuable to note. It sounds like when you share your stories, some people appreciate them. What if you tried sharing those stories with the residents in small ways? 

User: I guess I could try that, but what if they don't want to hear it? 

Consultant: That is a valid concern, but by sharing a little bit at a time, you can gauge their interest. How would this feel to you, to take small steps to interact more?

User: It feels a bit scary, but maybe less overwhelming than just diving in completely.

Consultant: Exactly! Why don't we set a small goal for you: perhaps you could aim to say hello to one resident or caregiver each day. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds doable. I could just say hello and see where it goes from there.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! It's important to celebrate those small victories. How about we add another layer to this? What if you kept a short journal to note down these interactions and how they made you feel afterward?

User: I’ve never really kept a journal, but I could try writing down how it went each day. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Journaling can help you reflect and see your progress. How do you feel about starting that practice along with your new interactions?

User: I feel a little more confident. I think it would help to write it down and see if I can find anything positive.

Consultant: Great! It's all about gradually building up your confidence. As you engage more, remember to be gentle with yourself. If you do feel anxious, that's okay; it’s part of the process.

User: I understand. It’s comforting to hear that feeling anxious is normal.

Consultant: Absolutely! With each small interaction, you are recognizing your worth and the positive aspects of social connections. Would you like to share how you think you’ll feel after trying this for a week?

User: I hope to feel a bit prouder of myself, like I’m making an effort. Maybe I’ll feel less alone.

Consultant: That's a lovely goal! Recognizing your efforts is crucial. It might also help reduce that feeling of loneliness. How do you plan to acknowledge your progress at the end of the week?

User: Maybe I can reward myself with a little treat or a favorite activity if I’ve succeeded.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Rewards can motivate us. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Just remember, it’s about the little steps and building connections. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit lighter talking about this. I’m going to try to make those connections.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You've got this. Let's meet next time and share how it went. Remember, I’m here for you every step of the way. 

User: Yes, I will. Thank you so much for your support. I feel more positive now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been great talking with you today. I look forward to our next session. Take care and see you soon!

Consultant: Hello, Grandma! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello. I've been feeling a bit better since I tried joining the reading group, but I still feel nervous about how I come across to others.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you've taken that step to join the reading group! Feeling nervous in social settings is completely normal, especially when trying something new. Can you share more about what specifically makes you feel anxious in those situations?

User: I worry that I might not read well or that people will judge me. Sometimes I feel like I'm just a burden or not good enough.

Consultant: Those feelings are very understandable, and many people experience similar concerns. It sounds like you’re worried about how others perceive you. Let's explore that a bit—what thoughts go through your mind when you feel this way?

User: I keep thinking, “What if I mispronounce a word?” or “What if they think I'm too slow?” It makes me hesitant to share my thoughts.

Consultant: It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to perform perfectly. How do these thoughts make you feel emotionally? 

User: They make me feel anxious and sometimes a bit sad. I want to be involved, but those thoughts hold me back.

Consultant: I can see how that tension between wanting to participate and feeling anxious can be overwhelming. Let’s try to challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that others would judge you harshly for mispronouncing a word?

User: I guess I don’t really have any evidence. It’s just how I feel. 

Consultant: That realization is an important step. Often, our fears are based more on assumptions than on reality. If a friend made a mistake while reading, how would you respond to them?

User: I would probably reassure them that it’s okay. Everyone makes mistakes, right?

Consultant: Exactly! We can be much kinder to others than to ourselves. Can we try to reframe your thoughts about your own reading? For example, you might tell yourself, “It’s okay to make mistakes; I'm here to enjoy and learn.”

User: That makes sense. I think I could try to remind myself that it's about the joy of reading together, not just perfection.

Consultant: That’s a positive approach! It allows you to focus on the experience rather than the fear of making mistakes. How do you feel about practicing this new thought next time you're in the reading group?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It’s hard, but I want to try.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s all about taking small steps. Let’s discuss some strategies you can use to ease your anxiety during these reading sessions.

User: Yes, that would help! What can I do?

Consultant: One strategy is to prepare a few calming techniques, like deep breathing or positive affirmations to say to yourself just before you start. Have you tried any similar techniques before?

User: I’ve heard of deep breathing, but I haven’t really tried it.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be very effective. It helps calm the nervous system. Would you like to practice it with me right now?

User: Sure, I’d like that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in together through your nose… and then slowly breathe out through your mouth. Feel the air coming in and out. How do you feel after that?

User: Actually, I feel a little lighter. It’s nice to take a moment to breathe.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Incorporating this simple practice before your reading group can help manage anxiety. What do you think about trying this next time?

User: I think I can do that. It sounds manageable.

Consultant: Perfect! The more you practice it, the more natural it will feel. Let’s also set a small goal for your next reading group. What’s one thing you want to focus on achieving?

User: Maybe I can focus on just sharing one thought, even if I feel nervous.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! Sharing even a single thought can be a significant step. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. Is there anything specific you would like to remind yourself before sharing in the group?

User: I think I will remind myself that I'm allowed to be part of the conversation, even if I'm a bit slow.

Consultant: That’s an excellent reminder! Embracing your participation, no matter how it looks, is key. How do you feel about our conversation today and the strategies we’ve discussed?

User: I feel relieved, actually. It helps to talk about it and have a plan.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Remember, it’s normal to have ups and downs. You’re making great strides towards feeling more confident. 

User: Thank you! It’s nice to have someone to talk to about these feelings.

Consultant: It’s my pleasure, Grandma! I’m here to support you. For our next session, think about how the reading group goes with your new strategies. We’ll discuss everything then. 

User: Sounds good! I look forward to it. 

Consultant: Me too! Enjoy your reading group, and remember to be kind to yourself. Take care, and I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. I know we discussed your interest in art therapy last time, and I understand you’ve been feeling some pressure regarding the upcoming showcase. Can you share how you're feeling about it now?

User: Hello. Yes, I'm still a bit anxious about the showcase. I worry that my artwork won’t be good enough and that others might judge me. I really want to enjoy the process, but I find myself focusing too much on what others will think.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re really passionate about the art therapy course, but anxiety about external judgment is holding you back. Can you describe what specifically makes you feel this way? What thoughts cross your mind when you think about the showcase?

User: I just keep thinking that if my artwork isn’t perfect, people will see me as a failure. I’ve been feeling like I’m a burden, and I don’t want to disappoint my family either.

Consultant: I hear you. It’s tough when there’s so much pressure to meet expectations, both from yourself and from others. Let's explore this further—what are some of the specific expectations you feel you need to meet for yourself in this showcase?

User: I think I want my artwork to be outstanding and to really impress everyone. I feel like I need to prove that I can still do something meaningful at my age.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to want to make a positive impression, especially when participating in something new. What do you think would happen if your artwork didn’t meet those expectations? How does that make you feel?

User: That thought is pretty scary. I think I would feel embarrassed and maybe even like I'm wasting my time. But I also know that I shouldn't feel this way.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel that way, and recognizing that is an important first step. Let’s take a moment to challenge these thoughts. What evidence do you have that not being perfect would lead to a negative outcome for you or that it would reflect poorly on you?

User: I guess I don’t really have solid evidence. It’s more like a fear I’ve built up in my mind. I suppose most people just want to have a good time and appreciate each other's efforts.

Consultant: Absolutely. Sometimes, our fears can create narratives that aren’t entirely based on reality. What if, instead of focusing solely on the outcome, you shifted some of your attention to the enjoyment of creating art and the experience you’re having?

User: That sounds good, but it’s hard to let go of that fear. I really want to enjoy it, but I can't help but think about what others will say.

Consultant: It’s definitely a challenge, but maybe you could start by setting small, personal goals for the showcase that aren’t based on external validation. What would a successful experience look like for you, regardless of what others think?

User: I guess it would be nice to just take pride in what I create and enjoy the moment without worrying too much about others’ opinions.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset! Let's practice recognizing and celebrating your own efforts. After the showcase, how about you take time to reflect on what you felt proud of regarding your artwork? 

User: That could help me remember to focus on my own feelings rather than worrying about what others think. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about creating space to acknowledge your own achievements, however small they may seem. If we look at this from a different angle, what are some strengths or talents you have that you can appreciate in your artwork, regardless of others' opinions?

User: Well, I’ve always been told I have good attention to detail and creativity. I should focus on those strengths.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Recognizing your unique talents is essential. Let’s also think about how you can remind yourself of this during the showcase. What kind of positive affirmations or reminders can you use?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that I’m doing this for me and that my perspective is just as valuable as anyone else’s.

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation! Repeating that to yourself can empower you to shift your focus. Would it help to write it down or even practice saying it a few times before the event?

User: Yes, writing it down sounds like a good idea. I could keep it with me for a quick reminder.

Consultant: Perfect! Keeping those positive reminders close can be very helpful. As you prepare for the showcase, remember that it’s about sharing your journey in art, not just the final product. How do you feel about all of this now?

User: I feel a bit lighter and more hopeful. I just need to keep my focus on enjoying the art, not just how it’s perceived.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Emphasizing enjoyment over judgment is a healthy approach. Before we wrap up, let’s discuss how family support can play a role. How do you think your family can help you feel more secure and supported during this process?

User: I think if they express their excitement about my art, it would boost my confidence. Just knowing they’re proud of me, no matter what, would help.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization. Communicating with your family about your feelings could strengthen that support. Maybe you could let them know how much their encouragement means to you. 

User: Yes, I’ll talk to them about it. Thank you! 

Consultant: You’re welcome! Remember, this journey is all about embracing who you are and enjoying the process. Reflecting on your progress is key. Let’s summarize what you've learned today. How has your perspective shifted?

User: I feel more empowered to focus on my own enjoyment and creativity rather than worrying about judgment. I’m also grateful for my family’s support.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Remember, you have the tools to embrace this journey. If you ever feel overwhelmed, you can always revisit these affirmations. I look forward to hearing about your experience after the showcase!

User: Thank you, I will! I appreciate this session and all your help. 

Consultant: It’s been a pleasure to work with you! Good luck, and remember to enjoy every moment. You’ve got this!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really pleased to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hello. I feel a bit better, actually. I've noticed my children have been reaching out to me more often, which makes me feel supported. However, sometimes I also struggle with thoughts that I'm a burden to them.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear you're feeling more supported by your family. Feeling like a burden is common, though, and can be quite distressing. Can you share more about when these feelings come up for you?

User: Usually when I need help with simple things, like getting dressed or moving around. I keep thinking that they have their own lives to lead, and I don't want to be a hassle.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like there’s a conflict between valuing your independence and the natural need for support. Can you recall a recent moment when you felt your children were genuinely happy to assist you?

User: Yes, just last week, my daughter came over to help me with cleaning my apartment. She seemed really happy to spend time with me and help out.

Consultant: That's a lovely moment to hold onto. Your daughter’s happiness in helping you reflects her love and care. In those moments, how did you feel about accepting help?

User: I felt grateful, but also guilty sometimes. I don't want them to think I can't handle things on my own.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. Accepting help doesn’t make you less capable. In fact, it can strengthen your relationships. How might you communicate your feelings about needing support with your family?

User: I could try telling them how much I appreciate their help and how it makes me feel loved. 

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Expressing gratitude not only helps you feel better but lets your family know how much their support means to you. How do you think sharing those feelings with them might impact your relationship?

User: I think it would make us all closer. They might realize I enjoy our time together, and it's not just about the help.

Consultant: Absolutely, nurturing that connection can lead to more fulfilling interactions. What about socializing with your family? Do you engage in any activities together?

User: Sometimes we have meals together, but I haven’t suggested doing more activities. I’m not sure they’d want to do that.

Consultant: It’s worth exploring! Often, families appreciate the opportunity to create shared experiences. What activities do you think you’d enjoy if you asked them to join you?

User: I’ve always enjoyed watching old movies. Maybe I could invite them for a movie night?

Consultant: A movie night sounds delightful! It’s a wonderful way to bond and enjoy each other’s company in a relaxed setting. How do you feel about proposing this idea to your family?

User: I feel good about it. I think they would love it, and it might make me feel less isolated.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You deserve to feel connected and included. Once you set up the movie night, how do you think that will impact your mood or feelings of support?

User: I think it will make me feel more positive and uplifted. Being around family always brings me comfort.

Consultant: That’s an important insight. Engaging in these social activities can further enhance your sense of belonging. How have you been managing your feelings of guilt about needing support during moments like this?

User: I try to remind myself that everyone needs help sometimes, but it’s hard to shake the feeling entirely. 

Consultant: It is challenging, but recognizing that it’s okay to ask for help is a significant step. What if we brainstorm ways to gently challenge those guilty thoughts when they arise?

User: That sounds helpful. I think I could remind myself that my family wants to help me because they care.

Consultant: Exactly! Reframing those thoughts to emphasize your family’s willingness to support you can be powerful. How about we think of a few affirmations or phrases you can use when those guilty feelings resurface?

User: I could say, "I am loved, and it's okay to seek help."

Consultant: That’s perfect! It's a reassurance that reinforces your worth and acknowledges your needs. Do you feel ready to practice this when you need to?

User: Yes, I feel more equipped to handle it now. 

Consultant: That's fantastic! As we wrap up today, let's reflect on your progress. How do you feel about the steps we're exploring to enhance your interactions with your family?

User: I feel optimistic. I believe being open with them will strengthen our relationship.

Consultant: I’m so pleased to hear that! Remember, it’s a journey, and you’re making important strides. As you continue this, what do you think will be your next steps?

User: I plan to invite my family for a movie night and express my appreciation more openly.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! And keep reinforcing those positive affirmations when needed. I believe in your ability to embrace this journey. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and the strategies we've discussed.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. I look forward to hearing about your movie night in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Z Grandma! It’s great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello. I've been feeling a bit better and more positive about my interactions with the caregivers and the other residents. I've started sharing more about my life, but sometimes I still feel uncertain.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made some progress in your social interactions. Can you share a specific moment when you felt good about communicating with someone?

User: Well, I had a nice chat with one of the caregivers yesterday. I talked about my experiences during the war and how it was back then. I felt like she was really listening to me.

Consultant: That sounds like a meaningful conversation! It’s great that you shared your experiences. How did that make you feel afterwards?

User: I felt happy and appreciated. But sometimes, I worry if they find my stories boring or irrelevant.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those worries, but your stories are a part of your life and can be very interesting to others. What evidence do you have that they find them boring?

User: Just a feeling I get. Sometimes they might seem distracted when I talk.

Consultant: I understand. It might help to remember that everyone has moments of distraction. Maybe we could explore how you can gauge their interest better when you share your stories. What do you think?

User: That sounds helpful. I could ask them if they're enjoying the stories, I guess.

Consultant: Absolutely! Asking for their feedback can also open up the conversation more. Have you thought about any other topics or activities you might like to discuss or engage in with them?

User: Yes, I've been thinking about organizing some small activities, like card games or sharing favorite recipes. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Organizing activities can be a great way to bond with others. How do you feel about taking the lead on that?

User: I’m a bit nervous, but it sounds exciting. I want to make sure everyone enjoys it.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel nervous when taking the lead. Perhaps you can start small and see how it goes. What if you invite just a couple of residents to join you for a game?

User: I could do that! It would be less overwhelming to start with a few people.

Consultant: Exactly! This way, you can test the waters and see how everyone reacts. Building those connections gradually might make you feel more confident. What do you think?

User: That makes sense. I feel more confident about trying this now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s also think about how you can handle any negative thoughts that might arise if things don’t go as planned. How would you talk to yourself in those moments?

User: I usually tell myself that I’m not good at this and that nobody wants to listen. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to think that, but let’s challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that nobody wants to listen?

User: I can’t really say for sure, just my feelings.

Consultant: Sometimes our feelings can be misleading. Focusing on the positive reactions you’ve received so far can help counter those negative thoughts. Would that be something you’d like to practice?

User: Yes, I can definitely try that. Focusing on the good moments might help.

Consultant: Great! Recognizing your successes, no matter how small, will help build your confidence. As we wrap up today, what strategies do you feel you could use moving forward to support your social interactions?

User: I think I will remind myself of the positive moments and take small steps to engage with others.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember to take it one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel good! I’m looking forward to trying out these ideas.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’ve made great strides, and I believe you can continue to grow in your confidence. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time!

User: Thank you! I’ll see you next time.
