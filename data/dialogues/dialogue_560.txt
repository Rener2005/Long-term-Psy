Consultant: Hi Rosie! It's great to see you again today. I know you’ve been feeling overwhelmed lately. Could you share how you've been since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been really exhausted. Between my work and trying to take care of my kids, I feel like I'm on the edge. I keep worrying about my older sons and how they are doing in school. It’s just so stressful.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly challenging. Balancing work and family responsibilities can be tough. When you think about your sons' schooling, what specific worries come to mind?

User: I worry that they are falling behind and that their future opportunities are slipping away. I feel like I’m failing them.

Consultant: Feeling like you're failing can be a heavy burden to carry. It's understandable to be concerned about their future. What thoughts do you have when you think about their academic struggles?

User: I often think that if I was a better mother or if I could manage my work better, they wouldn’t be missing school. 

Consultant: Those thoughts can lead to a lot of blame on yourself. It's really crucial to recognize that many factors contribute to a child's education. Have you had a chance to talk with your sons about how they feel about school?

User: I haven’t really asked them. I'm so caught up in my worries that I haven't thought to talk to them directly about it.

Consultant: That's understandable. Speaking with them could provide you with more insight into their feelings. Sometimes, kids have their own reasons for their behavior that we might not see. What do you think would happen if you asked them about their school experience?

User: I guess I might find out they’re struggling with things that I didn’t even know about. But I’m also scared they’ll say they don’t want to go at all. 

Consultant: It's natural to feel apprehensive about their response, but it could open up a valuable conversation. What could be a supportive way for you to approach this discussion with them?

User: Maybe I could ask them casually how school is going during dinner or something. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! Creating a relaxed environment might help them open up. Alongside this, how are you coping with your workloads as you try to manage these feelings?

User: I try to remind myself I’m doing my best, but I still feel worn out. I fantasize about solving my financial issues, but it feels out of reach.

Consultant: Managing finances can add to your stress, especially when paired with family concerns. Have you ever thought about specific small steps you could take to alleviate some of these financial pressures?

User: Not really, I feel so overwhelmed that I don’t even know where to begin.

Consultant: It might be helpful to break it down into smaller, manageable pieces. What if we brainstormed together a few realistic options that could relieve some financial stress?

User: That sounds good, but I still feel stuck thinking about what to do.

Consultant: That’s completely normal. Recognizing your feelings is an important first step. Can you think of even small, actionable tasks you could consider? Perhaps creating a budget or exploring additional job opportunities might be a start?

User: A budget sounds simple enough. I can try that, at least, to see what I’m working with.

Consultant: Excellent! Creating a budget can be empowering, as it gives you a clearer picture of your finances. Once you see where your money goes, you might feel more in control. How do you think setting aside some time to work on a budget would feel for you?

User: I think it might feel like I’m finally doing something positive rather than just worrying.

Consultant: That's a great perspective! Taking that initiative can make a difference in how you feel about your situation. Moving forward, besides budgeting, what else do you think would help ease the burden you feel right now?

User: I really wish I could communicate better with my family. Sometimes it feels like we’re all struggling silently.

Consultant: Communication is indeed key! It might help to share how you're feeling with your family too. What if you had an open conversation about everyone's thoughts and feelings? 

User: That scares me, but it could be a way to bring us closer together. 

Consultant: It can be daunting, but often those conversations can lead to better understanding and support. What kind of feelings do you hope to express in that discussion?

User: I think I want to share that I feel overwhelmed and that I’m there for them. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful sentiment to convey. Letting them know you’re feeling overwhelmed can also help them feel safe to share their own struggles. What steps can you take to initiate this conversation?

User: If I can find a calm moment, maybe during dinner or game night, I’ll just bring it up honestly. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Remember, it doesn’t have to be a heavy conversation; just expressing your feelings can open the door for others to share theirs. How are you feeling about everything we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel a little lighter actually, like there are small things I can do to ease some of the pressure.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Rosie! Acknowledging small actionable steps can create meaningful change. Let’s keep working together to build on these ideas in our next session. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good. I’m looking forward to it. I really want to work on my communication and my stress levels.

Consultant: Great! Keep in mind that progress may take time, but with each step, you're moving forward. I'll see you next time, and take care of yourself until then!

User: Thank you! I will.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Rosie! I'm glad you're here today. I understand that you've been feeling quite overwhelmed with your children's education and communication within your family. Can you share more about what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. Yes, I feel so helpless regarding my kids missing school. It's frustrating because I really want to help them, but I don't know how to start. I also struggle to talk to my elders about it; it just feels like I'm hitting a wall.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling stuck and uncertain about how to address your children's schooling issues. It's completely understandable to feel that way when facing such challenges. What do you think has been the main reason for your children's absences from school?

User: I think a lot of it has to do with their motivation. They don’t seem interested in going, and I just can't figure out how to encourage them. I feel like I should be doing more.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really concerned about their motivation and your own role in supporting them. Let's take a moment to explore what you believe is causing their lack of interest. What thoughts go through your mind when you think about their schooling?

User: I keep thinking that maybe I’m not a good enough mother because my kids are skipping school. I worry that I’m failing them and that they won't have a good future because of it.

Consultant: It’s understandable that you would feel that way as a mother. However, it's crucial to challenge these thoughts. Could we explore the idea that your worth as a mother isn't defined by your children's actions? What might you say to a friend in a similar situation?

User: I guess I'd tell them that they are doing their best and that kids go through phases. But I don't seem to apply that same kindness to myself.

Consultant: That’s a really compassionate perspective. It’s interesting how we can often extend more kindness to others than to ourselves. Considering that, what would it look like if you treated yourself with that same understanding in your situation?

User: Maybe I would accept that I am doing the best I can, given the circumstances. But it’s hard to let go of that guilt.

Consultant: Letting go of guilt can be difficult, especially when we care so deeply about our children’s well-being. What are some steps you can take to help alleviate that guilt while also focusing on positive actions that could improve your children's situation?

User: Perhaps I could start by talking to them about school more and understanding why they're not interested. I feel like I need to communicate better with them.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Rosie! Open communication with your children can really help you understand their perspective. How do you feel about trying a new approach when you talk to them?

User: I think trying a different way of talking could help. I usually end up scolding them, which doesn’t go well.

Consultant: Scolding can sometimes lead to defensiveness. What if we role-play a conversation where you approach them with curiosity instead? For example, you could ask them about their feelings towards school and listen without interrupting.

User: That sounds useful. I can see how it might lead to a better understanding of their feelings. I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Excellent! Let's practice that here. Imagine you're having that conversation with one of your children. How might you open up the dialogue?

User: I could start by saying, “I’ve noticed you seem to not want to go to school lately. Can you share with me what’s going on?” 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start! It shows concern while inviting them to share. How do you think they might respond to that?

User: I think they would be more open to talking than if I just told them to go to school. It feels less confrontational.

Consultant: Absolutely. Approaching it that way can help them feel safe to express their thoughts. Now, as you plan to implement this, how can you keep track of the changes you want to make in your communication?

User: I could write down my thoughts beforehand so I remember to stay calm and open. Maybe keeping a journal could help too.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Keeping a journal can help you reflect on your thoughts and monitor your progress. How does that make you feel in terms of what you've achieved so far?

User: I feel a bit more empowered. If I can really communicate better with my kids, maybe this can lead to some solutions.

Consultant: That's a positive mindset, Rosie! As we wrap up today, what do you see as your next steps towards improving your family communication and supporting your children’s education?

User: I think my next step is to have that conversation with my children and start using my journal more consistently. I want to be more mindful of my feelings too.

Consultant: Those steps sound solid and proactive. Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s okay to take one step at a time. As we conclude our session, how have you felt about the progress you’ve made today?

User: I feel like I've gained clarity and a plan, which is much better than feeling overwhelmed and lost. It helps to know that talking about it can lead to change.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Rosie! You’ve made great progress in identifying what you can do. As you move forward, remember to be gentle with yourself. If you ever need to talk again, I’m here for you.
###################
Consultant: Hi Rosie, welcome back! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling a mix of emotions lately. On one hand, I see some improvements in my kids' attendance at school, which feels rewarding. But on the other hand, I’m worried about how things will play out in the future.

Consultant: It sounds like you're recognizing some positive changes but also facing uncertainty about the future. Can you share more about what you've noticed in your children's behavior or your interactions with them?

User: Well, I’ve been trying my new communication strategies with them. It seems like they’re more responsive, and I can sense that our conversations have more connection. But then I start worrying if it will last or if I'm just seeing a temporary shift.

Consultant: It's great to hear that your strategies are making a difference! It's completely natural to feel uncertain about lasting changes. What specifically makes you unsure about the sustainability of this improvement?

User: I think it's the financial stress we are facing. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed with the thought of how our financial situation might affect everything, including my kids' behavior and education.

Consultant: Financial concerns can certainly add a lot of pressure. It’s understandable to worry about how this could impact your family. Have you and your kids discussed how you can navigate these financial challenges together?

User: Not really. I don’t want to burden them with adult worries, but I do think they sense something is off. I'm torn between protecting them and being open about our situation.

Consultant: That’s a tough balance to strike. It’s wonderful that you want to protect them while also being honest. How do you think involving them could benefit both you and your children in managing these feelings?

User: Maybe if they understand some of what we’re facing, it could open the door for us to work together. But I'm worried about how to explain it in a way that’s appropriate for them.

Consultant: That makes sense. It's important to approach this delicately. We could explore some ways to frame your discussions that encourage openness without overwhelming them. Would you be open to doing that?

User: Yes, I think that would help. I just want to make sure I'm doing the right thing by them.

Consultant: Absolutely, it's clear that you care deeply about their well-being. Perhaps we can start by thinking about small, age-appropriate conversations to ease into this topic. Can you think of a specific question or concern that might help initiate the discussion?

User: Maybe I could start by asking them how they feel about school lately and if they notice any changes at home. That might open up the conversation naturally.

Consultant: That sounds like a great way to start! Asking about their feelings can encourage them to express concerns they might have. How do you think engaging them in this way might affect your relationship?

User: I hope it would strengthen our bond and help them feel more involved. I also think I might feel less alone in dealing with everything.

Consultant: That's a beautiful insight, Rosie. Strengthening your bond and sharing feelings together can be empowering for both you and your children. How do you feel about starting this conversation with them this week?

User: I’ll definitely try. I feel a bit nervous, but I think it’s worth it.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous before such conversations. Remember, it’s a learning process for everyone involved. After your discussion, it might be helpful to reflect on how it went. What strategies do you think could assist you in processing that reflection?

User: I could keep a journal or maybe even talk to my partner about it afterward. That way, I can process my feelings and feedback from them.

Consultant: Keeping a journal sounds like a wonderful idea! It can help you clarify your thoughts and emotions. And discussing it with your partner could provide additional support. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I often feel better when I talk it out.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s important to have outlets for your feelings. As you prepare for your conversation with your kids, let’s also consider your feelings around finances. What steps could you take to alleviate some of that anxiety related to your financial situation?

User: I could look into budgeting or finding extra resources to support us. It might feel less overwhelming if I have a plan.

Consultant: Creating a budget sounds like a proactive approach. It might also help you regain some sense of control. How would you feel about setting up a time to work on that plan this week?

User: I think I can do that. I need to make sure I’m managing it rather than letting it manage me.

Consultant: Exactly! Taking charge of your financial planning can contribute positively to your overall well-being. As we reflect on today’s session, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway regarding your family and the changes in communication?

User: I realize that I need to be more open with my kids while also being proactive about resolving our financial issues. Balancing that is key for us.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization, Rosie. Keeping that balance in mind will be helpful as you navigate these changes. How do you feel about our sessions, and what are your thoughts on continuing to work on these strategies?

User: I feel encouraged! I appreciate how you’ve helped me see things differently. I want to keep exploring these strategies.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Your willingness to explore these strategies shows your commitment to creating positive changes for your family. Remember, I'm here to support you whenever you need it. You’re doing such a great job, and I look forward to seeing your progress!

User: Thank you! I feel more optimistic now, even if there are still challenges ahead.

Consultant: That's the spirit, Rosie. Embracing optimism can truly make a difference. Don't hesitate to reach out if you want to share updates or if new challenges arise. You're not alone in this journey.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Rosie! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling recently? 

User: Hi! Well, I've had some nice moments with my kids lately, which felt good. But I’m still really worried about our financial situation and how it affects our family. 

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've had some positive moments with your children. Those moments can really help strengthen family bonds. I'm hearing that despite the joy with your kids, financial stress is still weighing heavily on your mind. Can you tell me more about how this financial worry affects you?

User: Yes, it just keeps swirling in my head. I feel like I need to find a way to improve our situation, but I’m not sure how. It makes me anxious, and I sometimes doubt my abilities as a mother. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Rosie. It’s understandable that financial concerns would bring about anxiety, especially when you want the best for your family. In what ways have you thought about improving your situation? 

User: I’ve tried to think of extra ways to make money, but it’s hard to balance that with my current responsibilities. I often feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Managing extra responsibilities alongside your current commitments can feel like a lot to handle. You mentioned feeling overwhelmed; can you share what specifically makes you feel this way?

User: I think it’s the pressure to find solutions quickly. Sometimes I feel like I'm letting my kids down if I can’t provide for them the way I want.

Consultant: It’s clear that you care deeply about your children, and that desire to provide for them is significant. This pressure you feel can be very heavy. What would it look like for you to feel more at ease with this situation?

User: I guess I would feel more relaxed if I could find a steady way to contribute financially, while still spending time with my kids. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great goal. Finding that balance would alleviate some of your stress. Let's explore some smaller, manageable steps that might help you work toward this goal. What are some activities you enjoy doing that could potentially bring in some extra income?

User: I really enjoy crafting, and I thought about selling some handmade items online. But I’m not sure if I have enough time to do it.

Consultant: Crafting sounds like a wonderful creative outlet! It’s understandable to feel uncertain about time management, especially with everything you have on your plate. How do you feel about setting a small time commitment each week to start on this? 

User: I could probably set aside an hour or two a week. It might feel good to create and see if it goes anywhere. 

Consultant: That sounds like a positive and practical approach, Rosie. Creating even a small amount of time for crafting could not only boost your mood but also help ease your concerns about finances. How do you think you might feel after starting this small commitment?

User: I think it might make me feel more proactive. At least I would be doing something instead of just worrying. 

Consultant: That proactive feeling is powerful! Taking steps forward can truly help reduce anxiety. Are there any other small changes we could brainstorm together that might contribute positively to your family's environment?

User: Maybe I could plan a family activity each week, like game night or a walk in the park. I think it’s important to strengthen our bond, especially with everything else going on.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea, Rosie! Family activities can foster connections and create joy amidst stress. Which activity do you feel most excited to try first?

User: I really like the idea of a game night! It sounds fun and something we can all do together easily.

Consultant: Great choice! Game nights can be a wonderful way to connect and unwind as a family. How do you envision setting this up? 

User: I could set a specific day each week to do this, maybe Fridays. It will give us something to look forward to. 

Consultant: Fridays sound perfect! Having something to look forward to can really change the rhythm of your week. As you move forward with these ideas, how confident do you feel about implementing them?

User: I feel a bit more confident now. Just having a plan makes it seem less daunting. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're building a foundation for positive change. Let's also celebrate those little victories as you try these activities. What’s one thing you’re proud of from our conversation today? 

User: I’m proud that I’m actually thinking about taking action instead of just worrying. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization, Rosie! Recognizing your ability to take action is a significant step. As we wrap up today’s session, what strategies do you think you can carry forward to maintain this positive momentum? 

User: I can schedule my crafting time and family game night, and remind myself that it’s okay to take it one step at a time. 

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies, and taking things one step at a time is very important. I believe in your ability to create positive changes for your family! Remember, it’s okay to reach out if you need support along the way. How are you feeling as we end our session today? 

User: I feel motivated and a bit lighter. Thank you for your help! 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Rosie! I’m glad you’re feeling motivated. Remember, you have the strength to make these changes. I look forward to hearing how things progress for you. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Rosie! I’m so glad you could make it to our session today. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit more confident lately. Attending that parent-teacher meeting really opened my eyes to how much my kids are trying. I felt proud hearing positive feedback from their teachers.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like that experience brought you a lot of joy and motivation. How do you feel this newfound confidence could influence your daily life and family dynamics?

User: I think it makes me want to be more involved and support my kids better. I want to create a more positive atmosphere at home where they can thrive, just like they are in school.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, Rosie. It sounds like you’re truly committed to fostering a positive environment for your children. What specific steps do you think you could take to support them even more at home?

User: I think I could set aside more time for activities with them, like reading together or just talking about their day. I’ve noticed they really open up when I show interest in what they’re doing.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent strategies! Engaging in activities they enjoy can help strengthen your bond and keep the positive energy flowing. Have you had a chance to do any of these activities recently?

User: Not yet, but I’m planning to start this weekend. I just want to make sure that I’m fully present and engaged when I do.

Consultant: That’s a great intention! Being present can really enhance those moments. What do you think might come up for you while trying to be fully engaged with your kids?

User: I sometimes worry that I might get distracted or feel overwhelmed with everything else going on in life. It's hard to balance everything, especially with another baby on the way.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way, especially with the added responsibilities of a growing family. Let’s explore what strategies you could use to stay focused in those moments, even amidst distractions.

User: Maybe I could set a specific time for our activities and just dedicate that moment to them? 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Creating a dedicated time can help you carve out a space where you can focus on your kids without interruptions. What other resources do you have in your life that could support you in this goal?

User: I guess I have some friends and family who could help out. Sometimes they offer to help babysit or do stuff so I can spend that time with the kids.

Consultant: Those support resources are invaluable! Have you thought about how you might communicate your needs to them so they can assist you more effectively?

User: Not really. I usually feel shy asking for help, but I know it could make things easier if I did.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel hesitant when asking for help. Perhaps we can try to reframe that thought—what if you viewed asking for help as a strength rather than a weakness? 

User: That makes sense. It would actually show that I’m trying to be better for my kids, right?

Consultant: Exactly! Seeking help is a proactive step towards creating a better environment for your children. What do you think would help you feel more comfortable asking for support from your friends and family?

User: I guess I could start small, maybe just ask for a bit of time on weekends or for someone to check in on the kids while I spend time with them.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Starting small can help build your confidence in asking for support. How does this feel for you as you think about taking these steps?

User: It feels good, actually. Like I’m not alone in this, and I do have a network I can lean on.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Recognizing your support network is a powerful step. Let’s take a moment to reflect on what you’ve been able to achieve so far. How have those positive changes impacted you and your family?

User: I feel more hopeful and motivated, like I’m on the right track to create that positive change at home. I want it to be a loving space for my kids.

Consultant: That's a beautiful vision, Rosie. It shows how committed you are to your family’s well-being. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s think about any stressors you might still be facing and how you can navigate them moving forward.

User: I think the main stress would be managing my time and dealing with the anxiety of having a newborn. It’s a lot to handle.

Consultant: Absolutely, it can feel overwhelming. What are some strategies you might use to keep your anxiety in check as you prepare for the new baby?

User: I think creating a routine could help. Also practicing mindfulness when I start feeling anxious might be a good idea.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid approach! Routines can provide structure, and mindfulness can help you manage those feelings as they arise. How do you feel about implementing these strategies in the coming weeks?

User: I feel optimistic about it. It gives me something to focus on, along with all the positive changes I’m making with my kids.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! I have no doubt that with your determination and the strategies we’ve discussed, you’ll continue to create a nurturing environment for your family. Remember, change takes time, but you’re making great progress. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. I will definitely keep working on these things.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Rosie! It’s truly inspiring to see your commitment. If ever you feel like you need to check in or discuss more, don’t hesitate to reach out. Looking forward to our next session together!

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to it as well.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Rosie! I'm glad to see you today. How have things been going since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty positive overall. The kids' attendance has improved, and the atmosphere at home is much better. But I'm still worried about our financial situation.

Consultant: It sounds like you've experienced some positive changes in your family, which is wonderful to hear! Yet, financial concerns can certainly weigh heavily. Let's focus first on your feelings about these improvements. How has it felt to see the changes in your children?

User: It's such a relief! I feel proud of them for making progress. It’s nice to see them more engaged, but then I stress about money, and I worry it might affect their stability.

Consultant: I can understand why you would worry about finances affecting their stability, especially after witnessing such positive changes. It's important to acknowledge both the pride and the stress. How do you cope with this stress about finances?

User: I try not to dwell on it too much, but sometimes it feels overwhelming. I know I should stay positive, but the financial issues are always there in the back of my mind.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel that way, especially when you have other positive developments happening. Let's examine that overwhelming feeling together. Can you share a specific thought or worry you have when you think about your financial situation?

User: I often think that if I can't fix our money problems soon, it will ruin the good changes we've made with the kids. I worry they'll go back to the way things were.

Consultant: That sounds like a heavy thought, and I can see why it would lead to anxiety. It seems like you're connecting the financial situation closely to your family's progress. What evidence do you think supports this thought? 

User: I guess I don't really have solid evidence. It just feels like if I can't provide them with what they need, they'll lose the improvement we've seen.

Consultant: That's an insightful realization, Rosie. Sometimes, our fears can exaggerate the possibility of negative outcomes. If you were to speak to a friend in your situation, what alternative perspective might you suggest to them? 

User: I suppose I would tell them that good changes can happen regardless of money issues. It's about the effort we put into being present for our kids.

Consultant: That’s a really encouraging perspective. It sounds like you've already identified some resilience within you. How might you apply this same encouraging mindset to your own situation with finances? 

User: I could focus more on the positives and the efforts we're making as a family instead of just the financial stress. Perhaps I could look for practical ways to manage the money worries instead of letting them take over my thoughts.

Consultant: That's a fantastic strategy, Rosie! Identifying positives and focusing on actions can help reduce that overwhelming feeling. Have you thought about what practical steps you might take regarding your finances?

User: I haven't really explored that yet. Maybe I could create a budget or find local resources that could help us.

Consultant: Creating a budget sounds like a great start! It could help you gain a better understanding of the financial picture. There are often local resources or community programs that offer support—would you like help finding some of those?

User: Yes, that would be really helpful! I didn't know there were resources available.

Consultant: Absolutely! I can help connect you with those resources. Also, as you begin to implement these changes, how can you remind yourself to focus on the progress your family has made, rather than just the stress of finances?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal. I could write about the good things that happen each week, even small ones.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! A journal can be a great way to channel your thoughts and remind yourself of the positives. What do you think would be the biggest challenge as you start this new journaling habit?

User: I think just remembering to do it. Life gets busy, especially with the kids.

Consultant: Understandable! Maybe you could set a specific time each week to reflect and write. What time of day do you think might work best for you?

User: I think weekends might be quieter for me, when the kids are occupied with their activities.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical plan! Weekends could serve as a dedicated time for you to reflect. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the strategies we've discussed? 

User: I feel hopeful! Coming up with a plan for staying positive and managing finances gives me something to work towards.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear, Rosie! You've made great strides in today’s session. Remember, it takes time to put these strategies into practice, but you're already on the right path. 

User: Thank you so much for your help! 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of your progress, and I look forward to hearing about your journaling and any resources you find next time we meet. If you ever feel overwhelmed, just reach out. Take care!
