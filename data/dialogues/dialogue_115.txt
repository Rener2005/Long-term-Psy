Consultant: Hello Xiaohua, it's good to see you today. How are you feeling since our last session?

User: Hi... I'm still feeling quite nervous, especially after being scolded by my teacher for turning in my homework late. I keep thinking about it and feel bad.

Consultant: I understand how being scolded can be upsetting. Can you tell me what thoughts come to mind when you think about that incident?

User: I keep thinking that I'm never good enough. I just wish I could get things right and not feel so scared when people notice my mistakes.

Consultant: It sounds like you're setting very high standards for yourself, which can be overwhelming. Do those feelings of not being good enough happen in other situations?

User: Yes, especially when I have to do something in front of others or talk to someone I don’t know well. I get really anxious and want to run away.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me. It seems like being in social situations is challenging for you. What do you feel is the biggest fear when you are around new or unfamiliar people?

User: I feel like they will notice all the things I'm doing wrong and laugh at me. I just don't know how to talk to people properly.

Consultant: It's understandable to be worried about others' reactions. Let's explore this a bit — have you had experiences where people actually responded like that?

User: Not really. I guess it's mostly in my head, but it still feels real.

Consultant: Sometimes our minds can exaggerate these fears, making them seem more real than they actually are. Recognizing this is an important step. What if we try to shift this perspective slightly—could there be a different way to view social interactions?

User: I'm not sure... Maybe if I focus on what I'm interested in rather than what others think?

Consultant: That's a wonderful insight! Focusing on your own interests can make interactions feel more genuine and less stressful. What activities or topics make you feel excited?

User: I like playing games and talking about them. Sometimes I get along with people who like the same things.

Consultant: Great! Games can be a wonderful way to connect with others who share your interests. Starting a conversation about something you enjoy could make it easier to connect. Would you be willing to try this approach?

User: I guess I could try it. It sounds a bit less scary when you put it that way.

Consultant: Taking small steps can lead to big changes. Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous—it’s how we manage that feeling that counts. Let's look into creating some strategies you can use when faced with these situations.

User: Okay, but it still feels a bit overwhelming to think about.

Consultant: That's completely natural. What if we break it down into smaller, manageable steps? For example, choosing one person to talk to about a game you like?

User: Yeah, that seems doable. Maybe I can start with someone I’ve seen around a lot.

Consultant: That sounds like a wise choice. Taking initiative to approach someone you’re somewhat familiar with can make the effort feel less daunting. How do you feel about giving this a try before our next session?

User: I can try... I think I might be able to.

Consultant: Wonderful. Remember, whatever happens, it's a step forward just for trying. It's about progress, not perfection. Let's also talk about how you felt during our last activity. You mentioned some things about struggling with your behavior. Do you recall any specific moments you would like to discuss?

User: I keep getting told I don't follow the rules properly, like leaving a mess or not focusing on my work. I want to change, but it feels like I can't do it no matter how hard I try.

Consultant: It can feel discouraging when efforts don't lead to the changes we want. What do you think might be influencing these behaviors?

User: I really enjoy playing games, and I sometimes forget about other things... It's hard to stop once I start.

Consultant: Games are fun and engaging, which can distract from responsibilities. We can work on finding a balance between enjoying games and fulfilling responsibilities. Would setting specific times for each help you plan better?

User: I could try sticking to a schedule, I guess. I just find it hard to switch from one to the other.

Consultant: Let's consider forming a schedule that includes breaks for what you enjoy and time set aside for tasks like homework as well. Would you like to try putting this into practice before our next meeting?

User: Alright. I can write it down and see how it goes.

Consultant: Excellent decision. Remember, it's okay to adjust the schedule as needed. You're taking commendable steps by trying new approaches. Are there any other concerns or thoughts you wish to discuss today?

User: Sometimes I feel like no matter what I do, it's not noticed.

Consultant: Feeling unrecognized can indeed be disheartening. Have there been instances where you felt proud of something you've done but didn’t receive acknowledgment?

User: I once tried helping at home by cleaning up, but no one said anything. It made me feel like it wasn't worth it.

Consultant: I can see how that could be discouraging. Recognition is important. It might take time for others to notice changes, but your efforts are valuable nonetheless. Would more self-appreciation for these actions help motivate continued efforts?

User: I guess I could try giving myself credit more often. It's just hard to remember to do that when I'm down.

Consultant: Consider writing down your accomplishments, no matter the size, as a reminder of your progress. These can serve as prompts to acknowledge your efforts. How does that sound as a way forward?

User: That seems like a good idea. I think I’ll try to note things down daily.

Consultant: Wonderful, Xiaohua. Remember, change and self-awareness take time and effort, and you're heading in a positive direction. We’ll continue working together on these strategies to support your growth. Is there anything else you’d like to cover before we finish today?

User: I think that's everything for now. Thank you for listening.

Consultant: Thank you for being open and willing to explore these topics with me. You’re doing a fantastic job, Xiaohua. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care until then!

User: Bye. Thank you.
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaohua, I'm glad to see you today. Don't worry, this is a safe space to talk about whatever you're feeling. How are you doing lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit down because I know I'm not good at talking to people. I tried joining a group activity in class, but I was so nervous that I couldn't talk to anyone.

Consultant: It's okay to feel that way, Xiaohua. Joining in can be tough sometimes. What were some thoughts running through your mind during that activity?

User: I kept thinking that maybe the others wouldn't like me or they'd think I'm weird. So I decided not to say anything.

Consultant: I understand. It's natural to have those thoughts, but let's explore if there's evidence to support them. Have you ever experienced a time when a classmate responded positively to you, even in small ways?

User: Well, one time a classmate did help me when I dropped my books. But it's hard to focus on those things when I'm so worried about messing up.

Consultant: That's a great example of a positive interaction. Sometimes our worries magnify negative possibilities, overshadowing good experiences. How would you feel if next time you focused more on those positive moments?

User: It sounds better, but I'm not sure if I can do it. My mind just keeps coming back to what could go wrong.

Consultant: It's okay to have doubts. Let's try breaking them down. For each negative thought, can you think of at least one positive or neutral thought to counter it?

User: If I think "they won't like me," maybe I can say "I could try to understand them instead."

Consultant: That's a good start! By practicing these thought patterns, you can gradually change your focus. How would you feel about practicing this in small, manageable steps?

User: I think I could try that. It feels a bit more manageable when I think of it in smaller parts.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let's also work on some simple social skills like making eye contact or saying hello. We can practice these until they feel a bit more natural. Does that sound okay?

User: Yeah, I think starting with eye contact might be easier for me.

Consultant: Great choice. Eye contact can be a powerful tool in connecting with others, even if it's just a few seconds at a time. Would you like to practice it a little here with me?

User: Um, I can try. It's just that I get really nervous looking people in the eye.

Consultant: I completely understand. No rush—just give it a try when you're ready. It's like a muscle that will get stronger the more you use it.

User: Okay, I did it for a little bit. It felt weird but not as bad as I thought.

Consultant: You're doing great, Xiaohua! Every bit of practice helps. How about we set a goal for this week to make brief eye contact with one person a day? Just for a moment, to build your comfort.

User: I can try that. I just hope I can remember to do it when I'm nervous.

Consultant: You can also remind yourself with a small note or a friend to help you remember. How do you feel about writing these experiences down?

User: Uh, I've tried keeping a diary before. I forget or feel too tired sometimes.

Consultant: That's okay. Maybe writing just one sentence about your experiences or feelings each day could be a good start. How does that sound?

User: I can try, but I worry I won't keep it up.

Consultant: Let's not worry too much about missing a day. The key is persistence, not perfection. What if we find a way to tie it into something you already do daily?

User: Like maybe after dinner, I could remember. It's something I do every day.

Consultant: That's a perfect anchor for your new habit! I'm confident with practice, it will become easier. Is there anything you're specifically concerned about?

User: I just don't want to feel like I'm failing if I miss out on doing it.

Consultant: It's completely understandable. Remember that making changes is a journey, not a race. Each attempt, whether successful or not, is a step forward. Would you feel comfortable setting a reminder for yourself or someone to check in?

User: Maybe my mom could remind me. I think she'd be happy to help.

Consultant: That's a good idea, enlisting support can really help in the beginning. How does it feel knowing that someone is there to encourage you?

User: It feels a little better, like I'm not just doing it alone.

Consultant: That's the spirit! Having support makes a big difference. As we move forward, let's focus on continuing these small positive steps towards your social confidence.

User: Thank you. I feel a bit more hopeful now about improving.

Consultant: You're welcome, Xiaohua. I’m proud of you for opening up today and taking these first steps. Remember, I'm here whenever you wish to talk. Keep those goals in mind this week, and we’ll discuss how it went next time.

User: Thanks! I'll try my best until then.
###################
Consultant: Hi there, little buddy. It's good to see you today. How have you been feeling since the last time we talked?

User: Hi, um, I’ve been trying to keep up with my diary, but I keep forgetting to write in it every day. It makes me feel kind of bad about myself.

Consultant: I understand that it can be frustrating to miss some days. It sounds like you're working hard to build a habit, and sometimes it takes time. Could you tell me more about how you've been managing your time for writing?

User: Well, sometimes I remember to do it after dinner, but then I get distracted with other things like games or homework. Then I just forget.

Consultant: It's okay. You're not alone in feeling this way. Creating a new habit can be tricky. Do you think setting a specific reminder or rewarding yourself for each day's entry might help you remember more consistently?

User: A reward sounds nice, but what kind of reward should I have?

Consultant: That's a great question. We could think about things you enjoy doing that can be a nice treat but aren’t too time-consuming. Maybe a few extra minutes of game time or choosing a special sticker for your diary after a week's worth of entries?

User: I like the idea of more game time. I could definitely try that.

Consultant: Excellent choice! Remember, the idea is to encourage yourself, not to pressure. How do you feel about trying to set a small goal first, like writing in your diary at least three times this week?

User: I think I can try that. It doesn't sound too hard.

Consultant: Fantastic! You're taking steps in the right direction. Do you find writing down your feelings and behavior helps you understand yourself better?

User: Yeah, I guess. Sometimes it makes me realize why I get upset or angry.

Consultant: That's very insightful of you. Understanding those feelings is a big part of learning to manage them. Have you noticed any times when you felt more confident or less worried recently?

User: Hmm, there was one time I talked to a classmate, even though I usually don’t. It felt nice, but I was really nervous.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful step, and it’s normal to feel nervous in new situations. How did you feel after you managed to talk to them?

User: I felt proud that I did it, but also worried if I said something silly.

Consultant: Being proud of yourself is a big win! It's great that you took that step. Everyone worries about saying the wrong thing sometimes, and that's perfectly okay. The more you practice, the more comfortable you’ll become.

User: I really want to be able to talk to more classmates. I just don’t know how to start.

Consultant: Starting a conversation can be as simple as asking someone how their day is going or sharing something that you think is interesting. Sometimes talking about shared activities is a good way to start too.

User: Maybe I can try asking about our homework or what game they like to play.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! People often appreciate when someone takes an interest in them. If you feel nervous, reminding yourself that it’s okay to take it slow can help.

User: I can try that. It does make it sound less scary.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that. Remember, you’re making progress, and each small step counts. How about practicing this strategy a couple of times this week and keeping a note of how it goes in your diary?

User: Okay, I’ll give it a try. I just hope I can remember everything.

Consultant: You’re doing great, and it’s perfectly alright to have setbacks or forget sometimes. That's what we're here for—to figure things out together. Do you think talking to someone you trust about this could help you feel more supported?

User: Maybe I could tell my mom or my friend about what I'm trying to do.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan. Sharing your goals can bring more support. They might even help remind you or share encouragement. How about we set a small check-in next time we meet to see how it's going?

User: Yeah, I’d like that.

Consultant: Wonderful! As you continue working on these little changes, remember that every bit of progress is a victory. Do you have any other thoughts or concerns you’d like to discuss before we finish today?

User: I guess I just want to feel less nervous around people and more sure of myself.

Consultant: And that’s a very valid goal. With each step you take, like joining conversations and practicing your diary, you’re building more confidence. I’m really proud of how open you’re being and the effort you’re showing. Keep it up, my friend!

User: Thanks, I’ll do my best.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing about all your proud moments next time. Don’t hesitate to share any thoughts or feelings you have in between. See you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hi Xiao Hua, welcome back to our session. I'm really proud of you for trying out the techniques we discussed and using them to communicate better with your classmates. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I feel a bit better, I think. I was able to talk to my classmate after the game situation, and it wasn’t as bad as I thought. But I still feel unsure sometimes, like I might mess up.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel a bit uncertain when trying new things. It's great that you took the step to communicate. What do you think worked well in that conversation, and what parts felt challenging?

User: I think being calm helped, and I tried to really listen first. But I was worried I might say something wrong, so I didn't say much.

Consultant: Listening is indeed an important part of communication, and it's wonderful that you focused on that. Let's work on building your confidence in expressing yourself more next time. Can you remember any specific moment where you felt unsure during the conversation?

User: Um, maybe when my classmate was explaining his side. I wasn’t sure how to respond without making it worse.

Consultant: I see. Sometimes, using “I” statements can help you express your feelings without causing conflict. For example, saying something like “I felt a bit upset during the game and wanted to understand what happened” can be constructive. How do you feel about trying this approach?

User: Yeah, that sounds like it might help. I think I can try it.

Consultant: Great! Let's practice using that in a few role-playing scenarios. Imagine I'm your classmate and we're replaying a similar situation. How would you start the conversation?

User: Okay, um... “I felt a bit upset when we argued during the game and I want to understand your side better.”

Consultant: That’s a good start, Xiao Hua. It's clear and focuses on your feelings, inviting the other person to share theirs too. How does it feel to express yourself that way?

User: It feels... a little strange but also kind of relieving.

Consultant: That's understandable; it takes some time to get used to it. With more practice, it will start to feel more natural. How about we try another scenario to explore different responses?

User: Sure, I can do that.

Consultant: Fantastic. Suppose this time, your classmate is upset because of a mistake you made. How might you acknowledge that and keep the conversation positive?

User: Uh, maybe I could say, “I didn’t realize that affected you. I’m sorry for what happened, and I want to make it better.”

Consultant: Excellent, Xiao Hua. Acknowledging their feelings shows you care, which helps in resolving misunderstandings. I can see your confidence growing already. What do you think will help reinforce these skills in real situations?

User: Maybe more practice, like this, or reminding myself before talking.

Consultant: Both sounds like great strategies. Consistent practice will reinforce these skills over time. How about we set a small goal for you to use these techniques with someone in your life this week?

User: Okay, I can try speaking like this with my sister when we argue over stuff.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant idea! Let’s also add reflecting on the conversation afterward as part of your practice. What will you look back on after your conversation with her?

User: I’ll think about how it went and what I could say differently next time.

Consultant: That’s a thoughtful approach. Reflection helps you become more aware of your growth and challenges. Remember, you’re doing amazingly well, Xiao Hua. Any concerns you’d like us to address before our next session?

User: Not really right now. I’m feeling good about trying this.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. Remember, I'm always here to help you explore and strengthen these skills. Let's touch base after you tried the conversation, and we can discuss how it went. Looking forward to hearing all about it, Xiao Hua.

User: Thanks a lot! I can’t wait to tell you how it goes.

Consultant: Anytime, Xiao Hua. Keep up the fantastic work, and take care until we meet again.
###################
Consultant: Hi there, Xiao Hua! I'm so glad to see you today. Last time we talked, you were feeling more confident after your role in the school play. How have things been going since then?

User: Hello. It's been pretty good. I felt really proud after the play. My friends and teachers praised me, and it made me feel like I could actually do things well. But sometimes, I still get nervous in new situations.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear you felt proud! That acknowledgment from your friends and teachers was well-deserved. Let's talk about those nervous feelings. Can you tell me more about when they usually happen?

User: Well, it usually happens when I meet new people or try something I haven't done before. I'm always worried about doing something wrong or making a fool of myself.

Consultant: That makes sense, especially since these are new experiences for you. It's natural to feel a bit anxious in situations where you're not sure what to expect. Do you remember how you felt just before your performance and how you managed that?

User: Yeah, I was really nervous before the play too. But my friends helped me relax, and once I got on stage, it wasn't as scary as I thought.

Consultant: That's great that you had support from your friends. It sounds like having support and actually taking the step to participate allowed you to overcome your initial nerves. Do you think something similar could help in other situations?

User: Maybe. If I had my friends around or maybe if I just tried to think about how good it felt after the play, I might be less nervous.

Consultant: That's a wonderful insight. Thinking about past successes and having supportive people around are both excellent strategies. What other areas or activities would you like to try to extend this newfound confidence?

User: I think I'd like to try joining a club or maybe participate in a group activity at school. But I'm not sure which one to choose or how to start.

Consultant: Exploring these options sounds exciting! Maybe we can start by figuring out what activities you’re interested in. What do you enjoy doing in your free time?

User: I like drawing and sometimes playing games. I heard there's an art club and even some sports teams in school, but I've never really joined any.

Consultant: Drawing is a fantastic skill, and joining an art club could be a great way to meet others with similar interests. Joining a sports team can also be a way to have fun and learn something new. What would it be like to take that first step towards joining?

User: I guess it would be scary at first, kind of like before the play, but exciting too if I think about what could happen after.

Consultant: Exactly, it's a bit nerve-wracking but also full of potential for new friendships and experiences. Maybe we can set a small goal, like visiting the art club meeting one time just to see how it feels?

User: I could try that. It sounds less scary if I just think of it as a visit, not a commitment yet.

Consultant: That's a great approach! Just a visit to check it out, no pressure to decide immediately. How about we plan this out? Think about when the next meeting is and what you might need.

User: I'll ask around and see when their next meeting is. Maybe I can go with a friend who is interested too.

Consultant: Having a friend go with you sounds like a wonderful idea. That way, you have someone familiar with you. Let's focus on this step for now and see how it goes.

User: Okay, I'll try it. Thinking about it as just a visit makes it not too overwhelming.

Consultant: I'm really proud of you for taking this step, Xiao Hua. It's all about these small, manageable steps. Remember how well you did with the play—those same skills and confidence will help you here too.

User: Thanks for saying that. I think I'll try it and see how it goes.

Consultant: You're very welcome. And remember, it's all about trying and learning. Whatever happens, it’s a step forward. Is there anything else on your mind that we should talk about?

User: Not really, I think setting this goal is enough for now. I'll focus on it and let you know how it goes next time.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan. I'm here for you, and I'm excited to hear about your experience. Let’s meet again soon to chat about how the visit went.

User: Sure, I'll do that. Thanks for helping me plan it out!

Consultant: Anytime, Xiao Hua. Keep believing in yourself, and take things at your own pace. You've got this!
