Consultant: Hello, Yaya! I'm really glad to see you today. I know you've been going through some tough feelings related to school. Can you share with me what's been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious about school and my studies. I just can't shake off this feeling that I'm going to fall behind when I go back to school. Sometimes, it just feels overwhelming.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really concerned about keeping up with your studies, and that can definitely be stressful. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about returning to school?

User: I keep thinking that my friends will be ahead of me and I’ll look like a failure. It makes me feel like I don't even want to go back.

Consultant: That's understandable, Yaya. It seems like you're worried about how your performance will compare to your friends'. Let me ask you, what emotions does this thought of being a "failure" bring up for you?

User: I feel really anxious and sometimes even sad. It makes it hard to sleep, and I can't focus on my work.

Consultant: I can see how those feelings can really impact your ability to study and rest. Regarding your loss of sleep, can you share more about what happens when you try to go to bed?

User: Well, when I lie down, my mind just races. I think about everything I haven't done for school, and it keeps me awake.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Yaya. It seems like your thoughts about school are keeping you awake at night. Let's try to identify some of those thoughts that cause your anxiety. What do you think about when you're lying in bed?

User: I think about how I should be studying more, and then I imagine getting bad grades. I feel like I have to be perfect or I’ll disappoint everyone.

Consultant: It sounds like there's a lot of pressure you’re putting on yourself to achieve perfection. How do you feel when you think about needing to be perfect?

User: It makes me feel really worried and tight inside. I feel like I can't make any mistakes or else everything will go wrong.

Consultant: That’s a heavy burden to carry. Let's challenge that idea a bit. If your friend was in a similar situation, what would you tell her about making mistakes?

User: I would tell her that it’s okay to make mistakes and that everyone struggles sometimes.

Consultant: Exactly, Yaya! Everyone has challenges, and it's perfectly normal to not be perfect. Now, considering that, what might happen if you allowed yourself to not be perfect in schoolwork? 

User: Maybe I wouldn’t feel so anxious, but it’s really hard to see it that way.

Consultant: I get that; it's definitely a process. Let’s think about practical steps. What’s one small thing you could do that would help you feel less anxious about your schoolwork?

User: I guess I could try doing some study sessions with my friends. That might help me feel less alone.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Studying with friends could support you and take off some pressure. Let's also think about this: What are some enjoyable activities you can do to help ease your mind when you start to feel anxious?

User: I like drawing and playing games with my siblings. Those make me feel better.

Consultant: Awesome! Making time for those activities could really help balance out the stress from school. Can we agree to try to incorporate some drawing or games into your routine this week?

User: Yes, I think I can do that!

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Now, as you go through this week, I want you to pay attention to your thoughts. If you notice that worry creeping in, acknowledge it, but also remind yourself that it’s okay to struggle.

User: I will try. Sometimes it’s just hard to remember that.

Consultant: It is hard, and that’s completely understandable, Yaya. It takes practice. We can also create a little mantra or an encouraging phrase that you can say to yourself when those anxious thoughts arise. Would you like to try to create one together?

User: Sure, that sounds good! 

Consultant: How about something like, “I am doing my best, and that is enough”? How does that resonate with you?

User: I like it! It reminds me that I don’t have to be perfect.

Consultant: Exactly! Remembering that can be powerful. Let’s check in next time about how things go with this mantra and spending time doing what you enjoy. I believe you can do it!

User: Thank you! I feel a bit better thinking about this.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Keep practicing those strategies, and remember, it's okay to feel anxious. It’s part of being human. We’ll continue to work through this together. 

User: Yes! I look forward to that.

Consultant: Great! I’ll see you next time, Yaya. Stay positive, and remember to take care of yourself!

User: Bye! Thank you!

Consultant: Hello, Yaya! Welcome back to our session. It's great to see you. How have you been feeling since our last talk?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really worried about my studies lately. Since we started physical classes, I just can’t shake off this anxious feeling, and I've been thinking about some really dark things. I can't sleep well either.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds really tough for you. Let’s start by discussing what specifically about your studies is worrying you. Can you share more about that?

User: I don’t know… I just feel like I can't keep up with my classmates. I think I might fail. Sometimes, it feels like everything is just too much for me.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really feeling overwhelmed and worried about not meeting expectations. When you think about keeping up with your classmates, what thoughts come to your mind? 

User: I keep thinking I am just not good enough and that everyone else is doing better than I am. 

Consultant: That’s a very strong feeling, and it’s understandable to worry about comparisons. Can we take a moment to reflect on what evidence you have to support the idea that you're not good enough? What about your achievements or strengths can provide a different perspective?

User: Well, I do get decent grades in some subjects... but it feels like I could be doing better. 

Consultant: It’s okay to want to improve, but it’s also important to recognize your efforts and achievements. What would it look like for you to feel good about your progress, even if you're not at the top? 

User: I guess if I could see some improvement and feel less stressed, that would help. But sometimes, I just lose hope.

Consultant: Losing hope can be really distressing. Let’s see if we can identify small steps you can take to feel more in control. Can you think of something specific you can do that might help you feel more organized or less anxious? 

User: Maybe if I could have a study schedule or something... but I'm not sure how to stick to it.

Consultant: A study schedule sounds like a fantastic idea! We can definitely create one together. What subjects would you like to focus on, and how much time do you think you could dedicate to studying each day?

User: I think I can study for about an hour a day after school. I want to focus on math and science, since those are my toughest subjects.

Consultant: That’s a great start! One hour of focused study can make a difference. Let's break that down into smaller, manageable tasks. For math and science, what specific topics do you want to cover in your study schedule?

User: I really struggle with fractions in math, and in science, I find the experiments hard to understand.

Consultant: We can definitely include practice with fractions and review the key concepts for your science experiments. How does it feel to plan for this structured time? 

User: I feel a little better thinking about having a plan. It makes it seem less overwhelming.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Having a plan can help put you in control. Remember, it’s okay to go slow and give yourself time. Let’s also think about some relaxation techniques to help improve your sleep. Have you tried any methods to calm yourself before bedtime?

User: Not really... sometimes I just lie in bed for hours feeling anxious.

Consultant: That’s tough. We can try a few simple relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or reading a calming book before sleep, to help you unwind. Which of these do you think you might want to try?

User: Maybe deep breathing sounds good. I’ve heard about it before but never really tried.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be very effective. Let’s practice it together! Inhale deeply through your nose for four counts, hold for four, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for six. Want to give it a shot now?

User: Okay, let’s try it. Inhale... hold... exhale... That was nice! 

Consultant: Excellent job! How did that feel for you?

User: It felt calming. I think I could use that more often.

Consultant: That's a great realization! You can try it whenever you feel anxious or before going to bed. As we work together on improving both your studies and your relaxation techniques, how are you feeling about your progress so far?

User: I’m still a bit skeptical about my ability to study better, but now I hope my study schedule and the breathing exercise will help.

Consultant: That’s completely normal to feel skeptical, but it's encouraging that you recognize the benefit of these strategies! As we continue working, remember that change takes time. What will be your next steps after today's session?

User: I’ll write out a study schedule and practice deep breathing before bed tonight.

Consultant: Those sound like great steps! I believe it will help you. Remember, you’re not alone in this process, and I'm here to support you. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful than when I started. Thank you for helping me through this!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Yaya! I'm glad to hear you're feeling hopeful. Remember to take one step at a time. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need further support. Looking forward to our next session together!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yaya! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi! I've been a bit nervous, especially about my studies. I joined a study group at school, and while I'm excited about it, I still doubt my ability to keep up with everyone else.

Consultant: It's natural to feel nervous about changes like this, especially when it comes to schoolwork. Let's explore your feelings a bit more. What specifically makes you doubt your ability to keep up with your peers?

User: I guess I feel like they're all much smarter than I am. Sometimes I struggle to remember things, and I worry that I won't be able to contribute to the group discussions.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. It sounds like you've been comparing yourself to others, which may be affecting your confidence. Can you share with me what thoughts go through your mind when you feel this way?

User: I often think, “I’m not as good as them,” or “I’ll mess up.” It makes me anxious and wanting to avoid participating.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy. Let’s try to unpack them. How true do you think those thoughts are, and are there other ways to think about your abilities?

User: I... I don’t know. I haven’t really thought about it. Maybe there are times when I do understand things, but I just focus on the bad moments instead.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Yaya! It sounds like you might be experiencing a cognitive distortion known as "filtering," where we focus only on the negative. Can we work together to identify moments when you’ve had a better understanding and felt engaged?

User: I remember during a science project, I actually helped explain things to my friend, and it felt good. But it was just one time...

Consultant: That’s an important moment to acknowledge! It shows that you have the ability to understand and explain things. What if we replace those negative thoughts with positive reminders about your strengths? 

User: That sounds okay. But how do I remind myself during those group meetings?

Consultant: How about preparing a small list of positive affirmations based on your strengths? For example, “I contribute valuable ideas.” You can use this list as a reminder when you start feeling anxious. Would you be willing to try creating a few affirmations together?

User: Sure! I think I can try that. Maybe something like, “I am learning and improving.” 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! “I am learning and improving” is a powerful affirmation. How do you feel about repeating that to yourself whenever you start feeling anxious?

User: It feels kind of nice to say! I think that could help me remember that I'm still growing.

Consultant: Absolutely! Along with affirmations, let’s think about setting small, achievable goals in your study group. What’s one thing you could aim to accomplish in the next meeting?

User: I think I could try to ask a question about something I don’t understand. That’s a small step, right?

Consultant: Yes, that’s a perfect small step! Asking questions shows that you’re engaged and willing to learn. How do you feel now about that goal?

User: A bit less scared, I think. Just thinking about it makes it seem more doable.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Celebrating those small victories is key to boosting your confidence. How do you think you could celebrate when you achieve your goal?

User: Maybe I could tell my family about it. They always cheer me up!

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely idea! Sharing your successes with your family can bring more positivity into your life. What other strategies could you use to keep that feeling of accomplishment going?

User: I could keep a journal and write down things I’ve learned and felt good about after each meeting.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan, Yaya! Journaling can help reinforce those positive feelings and remind you of your progress. How are you feeling about your studies now after discussing all this?

User: I feel a bit more optimistic. I can see that if I keep trying and use these strategies, things might get better.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you feel more optimistic! Remember, progress takes time, and every small step counts. Are there any worries or thoughts you'd like to talk about before we finish today?

User: I think I just need to keep reminding myself that it’s okay to make mistakes. I want to keep moving forward.

Consultant: That’s a crucial realization, Yaya! Mistakes are opportunities to learn. I believe in your ability to embrace this journey. For our next session, we can talk about how these strategies are working for you and explore any additional support you might need.

User: I’d like that! Thank you for encouraging me.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your progress and experiences. Take care until next time, Yaya!

Consultant: Hello, Yaya! Welcome back. I’m really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. My anxiety about school has lessened, and I’m starting to see my abilities in a new light.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It sounds like you’ve made some progress. Can you tell me more about what specifically has helped you feel this way?

User: I started journaling my study progress every day, which helps me see what I’ve done. And I also asked my teacher for help when I struggled with a subject.

Consultant: Journaling sounds like a useful tool, and seeking your teacher's guidance shows initiative. How do you feel when you look back at your journal entries?

User: I feel proud, like I'm actually achieving something. It’s nice to see I’m making progress, even if it's small.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Celebrating those small achievements is important. What new learning methods or strategies have you tried that you find particularly effective?

User: I’ve been using flashcards for math, and I try to practice a little every day instead of cramming before the tests. It feels less overwhelming.

Consultant: Using flashcards and consistent practice can be very effective! How do you feel when you work on math this way, instead of cramming?

User: It feels much better! I don’t get as stressed out; I feel like I’m actually learning instead of just memorizing for a test.

Consultant: That’s a significant change in your approach! It appears to be boosting your confidence too. What other changes have you noticed in your feelings about school since you started these methods?

User: I feel less anxious overall, I’m looking forward to my classes more now, and I don’t dread the tests like I used to.

Consultant: That’s a huge step forward! What do you think has contributed most to this shift in your feelings about school?

User: I think it’s the combination of keeping track of my progress and the support from my teacher. I feel like I can ask for help.

Consultant: Recognizing that you can seek help is key. It strengthens your learning and reduces feelings of isolation. Is there anything else you’ve discovered about your study habits that you want to share?

User: I realized that when I take breaks, I come back much more focused. I used to study for hours without stopping, and I was just too tired to remember anything.

Consultant: Taking breaks is very important! It helps your mind recharge. How do you plan to incorporate breaks into your study routine moving forward?

User: I think I’ll set a timer to remind me to take short breaks every half hour. That way, I won’t forget.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Setting a timer can help you maintain balance. As we discuss these achievements, what are some positive affirmations or self-talk phrases you can remind yourself of during challenging moments?

User: I can tell myself, "I’m making progress," or "It’s okay to ask for help." Those help me feel better when I’m struggling.

Consultant: Those affirmations are really encouraging. Remembering that you’re progressing and allowed to seek assistance is vital. How confident do you feel about maintaining these positive habits moving forward?

User: I feel pretty confident! It’s nice to feel like I’m in control of my learning now, rather than just letting it happen to me. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent mindset to have! As we move towards the end of our session, what strategies do you think will help you maintain this progress?

User: I’ll keep journaling, talking to my teacher, and reminding myself that it’s okay to make mistakes as long as I keep trying.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies. Keeping that supportive environment and encouraging self-talk will help you continue to grow. Before we wrap up today, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think I’ve realized that I can manage my anxiety better than I thought. I’m learning to trust myself more.

Consultant: That’s an empowering realization! Recognizing your ability to manage and trust yourself is a big step. I’m really proud of the progress you’ve made. When we meet again, we’ll keep building on this momentum. Remember, you’re always welcome to return if you need support. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I’m looking forward to our next session!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Yaya! I look forward to our next conversation too. Keep up your amazing work!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yaya! I'm really glad you're here today. It's great to hear about your recent improvements in your studies. How are you feeling about your academic journey so far?

User: Hi! I feel much better than before. I’ve been using the study strategies we talked about last time, and I’m starting to see my grades improve a little bit. But sometimes I still worry a lot about keeping up with everything.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear you’re making progress! It’s completely natural to feel worried about maintaining those improvements. Can you share what specific worries come to your mind when you think about your studies?

User: I sometimes think that if I don’t keep studying hard, I might fall behind again. I worry I won’t be able to remember everything or that I might fail at some point.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re putting a lot of pressure on yourself to consistently perform well. When those thoughts come up, how do they make you feel during your study sessions?

User: They make me feel anxious and a bit overwhelmed, which makes it hard to focus. I start to second-guess myself and then I feel like I can’t do anything right.

Consultant: I can see how that could be really difficult. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. When you think "I might fail" or "I won't remember everything," how do you react to those thoughts? Do you have any counter-thoughts or alternative views?

User: I usually think I just need to study harder or longer, but that doesn’t always work. It feels like a cycle I can't escape.

Consultant: It’s tough when it feels like you’re stuck in that cycle. What if we tried to challenge those thoughts together? For instance, what evidence do you have that supports the idea you might fail? Are there instances where you've succeeded in the past that counter that worry?

User: Well, I did better in my last math test than I expected, so I guess I can do well if I keep practicing. But I still feel scared that it won't be enough.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! It sounds like you have evidence of your ability to succeed. How might you remind yourself of that accomplishment when those fearful thoughts come up again?

User: Maybe I could keep a list of my achievements and look at it when I feel anxious. I could remember that I’ve worked hard for those results.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy, Yaya! Having a visual reminder of your success could help you reframe your worries. Would you like to think of additional strategies that can support you when you feel overwhelmed?

User: Yes, I think that might help. Sometimes I just feel like I want to give up when things get too hard.

Consultant: Feeling overwhelmed can definitely make you want to take a step back. What’s something enjoyable or relaxing that you do when you feel that way? How might that activity help you recharge?

User: I like to draw or listen to music. It makes me happy and helps me forget about school for a bit.

Consultant: Those are wonderful activities! Incorporating breaks for drawing or listening to music could provide you with some relief from the stress. How about planning specific times in your week to include those activities?

User: That sounds good! I can schedule some drawing time after studying to reward myself.

Consultant: That's a lovely idea! Also, practice self-compassion. Understand that it's okay to have challenges and that you're doing your best. How does that idea resonate with you?

User: It sounds nice. I should be kinder to myself when things don’t go perfectly.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing that everyone faces struggles can help ease that pressure. What can you say to yourself when you're feeling anxious to shift your perspective?

User: I could remind myself that it's okay to have ups and downs, and that I’ve already improved a lot.

Consultant: That's a great affirmation! It emphasizes your progress and encourages a more balanced viewpoint. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the strategies we discussed? 

User: I feel hopeful! I really like the idea of focusing on my achievements and scheduling fun activities. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Yaya! You've made great strides, and I believe with these strategies, you'll continue to thrive. Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. If you ever feel overwhelmed again, you have the tools to handle it. 

User: Thank you! I feel more confident now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm proud of the progress you've made. Keep practicing those techniques, and know that I'm here if you need support in the future. 

User: I will! Thank you for everything.

Consultant: Today was a fruitful session, Yaya. I believe you're ready to handle your school challenges with confidence. Take care, and feel free to reach out anytime you need. Bye for now! 

User: Bye!
