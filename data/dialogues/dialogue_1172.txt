Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. To be honest, I'm still feeling pretty down about my college experience. I thought it would be amazing, but so far, it's been really disappointing.

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like your expectations for college life haven't matched your reality, which can be really tough. Can you share more about what aspects have been disappointing for you?

User: Well, for starters, the facilities at the school are not what I imagined. The dorm is cramped and not well-maintained. I also thought I would easily make friends, but I feel isolated and awkward in social situations.

Consultant: It makes sense to feel disheartened when things don't meet your expectations, especially when it comes to both your living situation and social life. Let’s explore how these experiences are affecting you. What emotions do you find yourself experiencing most often?

User: I feel a lot of disappointment and loneliness. I see other students making friends and enjoying their time, and it just makes me feel worse about myself.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, watching others have the experiences you hoped for. These feelings of disappointment and loneliness can be quite heavy. Can you identify any particular thoughts that come to mind when you feel this way?

User: I often think things like "Everyone else is happy," or "I'm failing at college." It feels like I'm the only one struggling.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound pretty intense. It’s common to believe that everyone around us is thriving when we are feeling down. How do those thoughts affect your mood or your actions throughout your day?

User: They just make me not want to engage with anything. I skip classes sometimes because I feel like what’s the point if I’m not enjoying it?

Consultant: I hear you. Skipping classes can seem like a way to cope with those heavy feelings, but it might also contribute to your sense of isolation. Let's challenge those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that everyone else is happy and that you're failing at college?

User: I guess I don't really know for sure. I just see the surface level; I don’t actually know what others are feeling.

Consultant: That's a key insight. Often, we only see others' successes without knowing their challenges. If you were to talk to a friend in your position, what would you advise them?

User: I might tell them that they are not alone and that it’s okay to find things difficult. Everyone has their own struggles.

Consultant: Exactly! Your advice to a friend reflects a more compassionate perspective. How might you apply that same kindness to yourself? 

User: Maybe I should remind myself that it's okay to struggle, and that I shouldn't expect everything to be perfect right away.

Consultant: That's a great realization. Adjusting your expectations can be really helpful. What actions could you take to start shifting your experience in college, given that it's normal to struggle?

User: I could try reaching out to classmates or joining some clubs, even if it feels uncomfortable.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step! Engaging with others, even when it's hard, can help you feel more connected. Can we brainstorm some specific actions or clubs you'd be interested in?

User: I think I might enjoy joining a study group for my classes since that would combine getting help with meeting new people.

Consultant: Excellent choice! Study groups can be both supportive and social. As you move forward, how would you feel about setting a goal for yourself to attend a meeting or join a club this week?

User: I think setting that goal would motivate me. Even if I just try it once, it’s better than doing nothing.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s about taking small steps. Let’s reflect on this before our next session. What feelings do you hope to walk away with after trying these new steps?

User: I hope to feel more hopeful about meeting new people and maybe even seeing my classes as more beneficial.

Consultant: That’s a great goal. Hope is powerful, and it seems you're starting to see potential for change. Before we end for today, what do you want to focus on in our next session?

User: I’d like to talk about how my experience went with the study group and explore any feelings that come up during that.

Consultant: That sounds perfect. We'll review your experience and feelings in our next session. Thank you for sharing so honestly today. Remember, progress is often gradual, and you’re not alone in this journey. 

User: Thank you for your support. I'm looking forward to discussing this more. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm here for you, and I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences. Take care until we meet again!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for this session. Before we start, could you share how you've been feeling since our last meeting? 

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit down. I'm struggling with my new courses and I just feel like everything is not matching my expectations. Plus, I haven't really made any new friends yet.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like the gap between what you were expecting from your courses and what you've actually experienced is causing you some disappointment. Can you tell me more about your feelings regarding your courses?

User: Yes, I thought the courses would be more engaging. But I'm finding them quite dull and overwhelming. It's like, I'm losing my motivation to study.

Consultant: That sounds frustrating. Losing motivation can make things so much harder. Let's explore this together. What specific aspects of the courses are you finding dull or overwhelming?

User: I guess it’s mostly the pace and the content. I feel lost during lectures, and it seems like everyone else is managing just fine, which makes me feel even worse.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel lost when everything seems to move too quickly. It might also intensify your feelings of isolation. When you notice others seeming to manage well, what thoughts come to your mind about yourself or your situation?

User: I start thinking maybe I’m just not cut out for college or that I’m not smart enough to keep up.

Consultant: Those thoughts must be disheartening. Let’s take a moment to evaluate those beliefs. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're not smart enough or that college isn't for you?

User: Well, sometimes I struggle to grasp concepts, and I feel overwhelmed by the workload. That makes me doubt myself.

Consultant: It makes sense that struggling with new material can lead to self-doubt. However, struggling doesn't mean you're not capable. Have you considered that everyone might face difficulties, even if they don't show it?

User: I haven’t really thought about it like that. I just see others participating actively, and I think they’re doing much better than me.

Consultant: It's easy to fall into the trap of comparing ourselves to others. Let's try to shift this perspective. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you say to them to encourage them?

User: I would tell them it's okay to struggle and that they should keep trying and not give up.

Consultant: Exactly! You would support your friend because you understand that struggles are a part of learning. Can you be as compassionate with yourself as you would be with a close friend?

User: I suppose I could try to be more understanding toward myself. It just feels harder in practice.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Changing our mindset takes time and practice. What if we set some small, manageable goals for you to engage with your courses more actively?

User: That sounds good. What kind of goals do you have in mind?

Consultant: How about aiming to ask at least one question in each class or joining a study group? This way, you can engage more with the material while also fostering connections with your classmates.

User: Joining a study group sounds intimidating, but I see how it might help. I’ll consider it.

Consultant: That’s a great start! It’s understandable to feel hesitant at first. How about taking smaller steps, like reaching out to one classmate and discussing study materials? 

User: I could do that. It feels like it would be less overwhelming than joining a whole group.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking baby steps is the key. How do you think reaching out to a classmate might change your feelings about both the course and the possibility of making new friends?

User: It might help me feel less alone in this and maybe alleviate some of my worries about the courses.

Consultant: Yes, and it can also create a sense of community, which is essential in college. Speaking of community, how have you been feeling about forming new friendships so far?

User: Honestly, I’m kind of nervous. I really want to make friends, but I don't know how to start.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about making new friends, especially in a new environment. Have you considered participating in any clubs or activities that could match your interests?

User: I’ve thought about it, but I’m afraid I won’t fit in or that I won’t enjoy the activities.

Consultant: Those worries are very common. Remember, the best way to find out is to give it a try. What kind of clubs or activities are you interested in?

User: I like art and creativity, so maybe I could look into an art club or something similar.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Joining an art club could be a great way to meet people with similar interests. Plus, having something you enjoy can help ease the anxiety of new environments.

User: I think I would enjoy that. I’ll look into it.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Remember, the goal is to explore and see what feels right for you. We can also reflect on your experiences in our next session. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I feel a bit more hopeful about things now. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’re taking important steps toward improving how you feel about your courses and potential friendships. Let’s meet again soon to discuss your progress. 

User: Okay, I’ll see you then. Thank you! 

Consultant: You’re welcome! Take care and good luck with your exploration. Remember, be gentle with yourself through this process.

Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling lately about your new university experience?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit lost, to be honest. I recently tried to join a club, but I just didn’t feel like I belonged there. Now I’m unsure if I should keep pushing myself to participate or look for something else.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like you're seeking a sense of belonging, which is so important. Can you tell me more about the club you joined and what specifically made you feel out of place?

User: Well, it was a cultural club, and I thought it would be a nice way to meet new people. But during the meetings, I felt like everyone already knew each other. It was hard for me to connect, and I ended up feeling more isolated.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. Feeling out of place can be tough, especially when you’re trying to make connections. Have you considered what aspects of activities you enjoy or what makes you feel included?

User: I enjoy creative activities, like painting and writing. I thought about joining a different club that focuses on art, but I worry that I might face the same situation again.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you have identified your interests in creative activities! Let’s explore this—what would you envision being different in a club focused on art compared to the cultural club?

User: I think in an art club, people might share more personal experiences through creativity, which could lead to deeper connections. But I'm still scared of not fitting in.

Consultant: That makes sense; art can indeed bring people together in unique ways. Let’s work on some strategies to help you feel more comfortable. What’s one small step you could take to explore that art club without feeling overwhelmed?

User: Maybe I could attend a single session as a guest first to see how it feels before fully committing.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Attending as a guest allows you to ease into the environment without pressure. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit excited about it, but there’s still some anxiety. What if I don’t connect with anyone?

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious about meeting new people. Let’s reframe that thought. What evidence do you have that you won’t connect with anyone? 

User: I guess I don’t have any strong evidence; it’s just a fear of rejection I keep thinking about.

Consultant: Rejection can be a tough fear to face. What if, instead, you thought about how others might feel similarly nervous? How could that perspective help you in this situation?

User: That's a good point! Knowing that others might be nervous too makes me feel a bit better. Maybe I won’t be the only one feeling out of place.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re not alone in this experience. It might help to remember that many people in those situations seek connection too. How about we consider some ways to break the ice when you're there?

User: I could prepare a simple question or introduce myself. That might help me engage with others.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Starting with a simple introduction or question could open up a conversation. What’s one question you could prepare?

User: Maybe I could ask what kinds of art projects they enjoy or what inspired them to join the club.

Consultant: Perfect! That not only shows your interest but can also spark conversations. How do you feel about having that in mind when you attend?

User: I feel more confident already! It seems manageable now, and I feel more hopeful about the possibility of making connections.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Remember, taking these small steps is key. Now, let’s talk about how you can keep building on these feelings. What steps can you take after the first session to maintain this positive momentum?

User: I could set a goal to attend regularly if I feel comfortable, and maybe reach out to someone I connect with after the meetings.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Building relationships takes time, and reaching out can show your willingness to connect on a deeper level. How does that feel to you?

User: It feels encouraging! I think I can do this. I’m excited to try out the art club now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let’s summarize what you’ve achieved today. You’ve identified your interests, created a plan for exploring the art club, and developed strategies to connect with others. How do you feel about these changes?

User: I really feel a lot more positive now! It’s nice to have a plan and some ideas on how to manage my fears.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It's all about taking those steps forward. Before we wrap up, what’s one takeaway you’d like to keep with you from today’s session?

User: I want to remember that I’m not alone in feeling nervous and to focus on the connections I can make rather than my fears.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway! You have the skills now to approach this situation with a new perspective. Remember, you can always return if you need support in the future. Take care, and I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes!

User: Thank you so much! I feel much better and more prepared now. I’ll keep in touch!

Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. I'm excited to continue our discussions. How have you been feeling about your recent experiences with the club and making new friends?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good. Joining the club has been a positive change. I've met some amazing people, and it's great to have that connection with others.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear that you're enjoying this connection. Can you share a specific moment or interaction from the club that made you feel particularly positive?

User: Sure! There was this event last week where we all worked together on a project. I felt really involved, and I was able to share my ideas, which made me feel valued.

Consultant: That's a fantastic experience! It sounds like you really engaged with your peers. How did sharing your ideas make you feel about your own contributions?

User: I felt proud and more confident. Before, I sometimes hesitated to speak up, but this time I felt I had something to offer.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear how your confidence is growing. Let's explore that a bit. What do you think has changed in your mindset that allowed you to share your ideas more freely this time?

User: I think being in a supportive environment helped a lot. Everyone was encouraging, and I realized that my thoughts are valued too. 

Consultant: A supportive environment can make a huge difference. It seems like those positive interactions are reinforcing your belief in your own value. How do you think you can maintain this sense of confidence in future group activities?

User: I want to remind myself of that feeling I had during the project. Maybe I can set small goals for myself to contribute more in discussions.

Consultant: Setting small goals sounds like an excellent approach. It’s about building on your successes. How would you feel about practicing sharing your thoughts in smaller settings before larger group discussions?

User: That makes sense! I can try sharing in smaller groups first. It could help build my confidence for the bigger discussions.

Consultant: Absolutely! Starting small can really help you prepare for larger interactions. Is there a particular situation or setting where you would feel comfortable practicing this?

User: Maybe within my classes or with friends. I could suggest discussing topics that interest us, so it feels more casual.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Making it casual can ease the pressure. What topics are you most passionate about that you could start with in these smaller conversations?

User: I really enjoy discussing current events and movies. Those are fun topics that my friends also like.

Consultant: Perfect! Those topics can inspire lively discussions. As you engage with your friends, how will you know that you're successfully building your confidence and social skills?

User: I guess if I notice myself feeling less anxious about speaking up and enjoying the conversations, that would be a good sign.

Consultant: Those are excellent indicators. Recognizing when you feel more at ease in discussions is key. If you start feeling nervous, what strategies can you use to help calm those feelings?

User: I could take deep breaths and remind myself that it’s just a conversation among friends. 

Consultant: Deep breathing is a great technique! It's all about creating a moment to regroup. Would you like to integrate any other strategies to further support your confidence-building?

User: Maybe I could prepare some topics or questions beforehand. Having a few ideas in mind might make it easier to jump in when there’s a lull.

Consultant: Preparing topics is a smart strategy! It will help you feel more ready to contribute. How do you feel about setting a specific goal for our next meeting regarding your social interactions?

User: I’d like to aim for speaking up at least once during each class. That feels manageable.

Consultant: That’s a solid goal! Speaking up once in each class will give you the chance to practice consistently. How do you feel about the progress you’ve made so far?

User: I feel really encouraged. Talking through this has helped me see how far I've come and what I can do next.

Consultant: It's fantastic to hear that you’re feeling encouraged! Reflecting on your progress is crucial. Is there anything specific you’d like to share or explore further before we wrap up today?

User: No, I think we've covered a lot. I just feel excited to put these ideas into practice!

Consultant: That’s great! You have a clear plan moving forward, and I believe in your ability to follow through. Remember that building social skills is a journey, and each step counts. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session!

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help, and I feel more equipped to tackle this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here to support you, and I’m excited to see how you apply what we've discussed. Until next time, take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. I want to hear about how you've been feeling lately in your classes and social interactions. 

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good lately. I've been participating more in class discussions, and my teachers and classmates have given me positive feedback. It feels amazing!

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear that you’re actively engaging and receiving recognition. What specific moments made you feel this sense of achievement?

User: Well, just last week, I answered a question that my teacher seemed impressed with. It made me feel proud and more confident about speaking up.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic experience! Feeling proud can really boost your confidence. How has this newfound confidence affected your interactions with your classmates?

User: It has made me more open to talking to others. I used to be shy, but now I feel more willing to share my ideas in group activities.

Consultant: That's impressive! Being more open and participating actively can create stronger connections with your peers. Have there been any challenges as you navigate this newfound confidence?

User: Sometimes, I worry that I might say something wrong, which makes me hesitate a bit before contributing.

Consultant: It’s natural to have those worries. Can you describe what thoughts come to mind when you hesitate? 

User: I often think, “What if they don’t like my idea?” or “What if I mess up?”

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite powerful. Let’s explore them together. Do you notice how those thoughts might be influencing your willingness to speak up? 

User: Yes, I see that they definitely hold me back sometimes. 

Consultant: Recognizing those thoughts is a crucial step. Can you think of any evidence that counters the idea that your contributions might not be well-received?

User: I guess when I shared my thoughts last week, my peers seemed engaged, and my teacher even complimented me.

Consultant: That's an excellent point! It sounds like your contributions were valued. Let’s try to replace those negative thoughts with more positive ones. What would a supportive thought look like in those moments?

User: Maybe I could think, “My ideas are worth sharing, and my classmates might benefit from them.”

Consultant: That’s a great alternative! How does it feel to think that way instead?

User: It feels empowering! I like the idea of contributing to discussions.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! By focusing on the value you bring, you're setting a foundation for continued engagement. How do you envision applying this mindset moving forward?

User: I want to remind myself of this whenever I feel nervous about sharing in class. I also hope to try out more group projects.

Consultant: That's a solid plan! Setting intentions for yourself can significantly reinforce your confidence. Do you have any strategies in mind for approaching those group projects?

User: I think I might suggest topics I’m interested in and ask others for their input. 

Consultant: Collaborating by suggesting topics is a great approach! It fosters both your interests and teamwork. As you explore these strategies, how do you feel about your overall university experience?

User: I'm really excited! I feel like I’m only just beginning to tap into all the opportunities here.

Consultant: That's a wonderful perspective! Embracing opportunities can lead to enriching experiences. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ve learned about your progress and confidence. 

User: I’ve realized that I can change my mindset from worrying to welcoming new challenges. I feel more equipped to participate. 

Consultant: Absolutely! You've made significant strides in understanding and enhancing your self-confidence. What are some future goals you've set for yourself in terms of academics and social relationships? 

User: I want to keep participating actively in class and also explore different clubs to meet new people. 

Consultant: Those goals sound amazing! Engaging in various activities will broaden your experiences and enrich your university life. I believe you have the capability to achieve these goals. Remember, if you ever feel hesitant, just revisit those supportive thoughts. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate the support and guidance. I feel more optimistic about my journey ahead.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad you've gained clarity and confidence. Keep embracing new experiences, and remember, I'm here if you need assistance in the future. Good luck, and take care!

User: Thank you so much! I’ll remember everything we've talked about. Goodbye!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's wonderful to see you today. I'm excited to hear about your progress since our last session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good, actually. I joined a volunteer activity with some new friends, and it made me feel really fulfilled. I’m enjoying my university life more and more!

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like you're really embracing your new environment and building connections. Can you tell me more about how that experience has impacted your feelings towards your studies and social life?

User: Sure! Being part of a team made me feel more confident and motivated. It also helped me manage my time better between studies and activities, which was something I was struggling with before.

Consultant: It’s fantastic that you’ve found a balance between academics and social activities. How do you think this newfound confidence influences your expectations for the future?

User: I feel more hopeful now. I really want to excel in my studies and make meaningful friends. I think I can handle challenges better than before.

Consultant: That’s an inspiring shift in your mindset! Let’s take a moment to reflect on what specific strategies or thoughts helped you feel more confident. What would you say has contributed the most to this positive change?

User: I think practicing mindfulness and setting small, realistic goals helped a lot. When I achieve those, I feel a sense of accomplishment.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Mindfulness can really help in grounding yourself, and celebrating small successes is key to maintaining motivation. What future goals would you like to set to keep this momentum going?

User: I want to maintain this balance and perhaps take on more responsibilities, like leading a project in the volunteer group or getting involved in a student organization.

Consultant: Those sound like meaningful goals! Taking on leadership roles can greatly enhance your university experience. How do you plan to approach these responsibilities to ensure they don’t become overwhelming?

User: I think I need to keep track of my time better. Maybe I can use a planner to organize my tasks and not overcommit myself.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach! A planner can help you visualize your workload and avoid excessive stress. How do you feel about the possibility of facing challenges as you work toward these goals?

User: I’m a bit anxious about it, but I also feel excited. I guess I just need to remind myself of my progress when things get tough.

Consultant: Acknowledging your anxiety is perfectly normal, and it's great you have strategies in mind to counteract it. Let’s explore some ways to reinforce that self-encouragement when challenges arise. What are some positive affirmations or reminders you could use?

User: I could remind myself of past successes or say things like "I can handle this" or "I'm capable of achieving my goals."

Consultant: Those are empowering affirmations! It’s important to have those reminders handy when you're facing difficulties. How can you integrate these affirmations into your daily routine to keep them fresh?

User: Maybe I can write them down and place them on my desk or even set reminders on my phone to see during the day.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Having visible reminders can really reinforce those positive messages. Is there any other support you think you might need as you move forward with your goals?

User: I think just having someone to talk to whenever I'm feeling overwhelmed would be helpful, like a mentor or even checking in with you regularly.

Consultant: That's a healthy approach! Regular check-ins with someone supportive can provide guidance and reassurance. Remember, it’s okay to reach out when you need help. It sounds like you’ve made remarkable progress during our sessions. How are you feeling about our time together and your growth?

Consultant: Those are wonderful insights! As we conclude our time together, what strategies can you use to ensure you maintain your progress and handle any potential setbacks?

User: I’ll keep using my planner, remind myself of my achievements, and reach out for support when I feel overwhelmed.

User: Thank you so much! This has been incredibly helpful. I feel ready for the next steps now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of all your progress. Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself as you embark on this exciting new chapter.
