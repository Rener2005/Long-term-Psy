Consultant: Hello, Mengmeng! I'm glad to see you for this session. Let's start by talking about how you've been feeling lately, especially regarding your social interactions at university. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious since entering college. During our class gathering, I felt everyone was so confident and capable. I was overwhelmed by the feeling of not fitting in and that my presence didn’t matter.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience made you feel quite out of place and contributed to your feelings of social anxiety. Can you share more about what specific thoughts crossed your mind during the gathering?

User: I remember thinking that everyone was better than me and that no one would want to talk to me. It felt like I was invisible. 

Consultant: I can see how those thoughts would make you feel invisible and increase your anxiety. When you think that way, how does it affect your emotions and behavior in social situations?

User: I feel even more anxious, and then I tend to withdraw or stay silent, which just makes things worse. I want to engage but feel so scared of being judged.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. So, it seems like this fear of judgment makes you retreat when you actually want to participate. Let’s reflect on that thought that makes you feel judged. Is there any evidence that supports that everyone sees you negatively?

User: Well, I can’t think of any direct evidence, but it just feels like that’s the truth. It’s hard not to believe it when I feel isolated.

Consultant: I understand that feeling. It’s common to believe what we feel, especially when we’re anxious. If a friend expressed similar thoughts to you, how would you help them challenge those beliefs?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s not true! That just because they feel awkward doesn’t mean others see them that way. But I can’t seem to apply that to myself.

Consultant: That's a great insight! It seems like you can be compassionate toward a friend but struggle to extend that kindness to yourself. What if we tried to reframe that negative belief? Instead of seeing yourself as invisible, what if you viewed yourself as someone who is just learning to navigate these new social dynamics?

User: That’s an interesting way to look at it. I guess it's normal to feel unsure when I’m in a new place. 

Consultant: Exactly! It's perfectly okay to feel that way in a new environment. The more you engage, the more comfortable you’ll become. Can we think of small steps you could take to practice interacting with your classmates?

User: Maybe I could start by saying hello to someone in class or joining a study group. It feels intimidating, though.

Consultant: Those are excellent starting points! Remember, it doesn’t have to be perfect. Just a simple greeting can open doors. How would you feel about trying one of those steps this week?

User: I think I could manage saying hi. It feels a bit less daunting than doing something bigger.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! As you approach this, how can you remind yourself that it’s okay to feel anxious and that you’re still taking positive steps?

User: I could remind myself that everyone has their insecurities and that it’s okay not to be perfect.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! It’s all about progress rather than perfection. As we work together, remember that some anxiety is natural, and what matters is how you choose to respond. How does that shift in thinking make you feel?

User: A little more hopeful, I guess. I still feel nervous, but I think it’s more manageable.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It’s all about taking those small yet meaningful steps forward. As we continue, we can focus on strategies that strengthen your confidence in social situations. Do you have any particular scenarios in mind where you feel this anxiety most acutely?

User: Yes, I feel it most when I’m in groups where I don’t know anyone well, like during study sessions or clubs.

Consultant: Great! Let’s visualize one of those scenarios. When you think about participating in those group settings, what thoughts come to mind that amplify your anxiety?

User: I often think, "What if I say something stupid?" or “What if they don’t like me?”

Consultant: Those are common fears, and it's understandable. Let's try to challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that saying something “stupid” would completely ruin the interaction?

User: I guess there isn’t really any evidence. It just feels like a possibility.

Consultant: Exactly! We tend to overestimate how negatively our words may be perceived. What if we reframed that thought to something like, "I might say something that doesn't come out perfectly, but it's okay. Everyone makes mistakes.” How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds more forgiving. I like the idea that it’s okay to not be perfect.

Consultant: I'm glad you do! Embracing that mindset can relieve some pressure. As you go into these situations, repetition will help reinforce this new belief. Let’s make a plan for your next gathering.

User: I will try to focus on being friendly rather than worrying about being perfect.

Consultant: That's a solid strategy! You’re building a foundation for more confidence. Looking ahead, how can you remind yourself of this during moments of anxiety?

User: I could write myself a little note to carry that says it’s okay to just be myself.

Consultant: Absolutely, that’s a lovely idea! Having a tangible reminder can help shift your mindset in those moments. As we wrap up today, let's reflect on what you feel you’ve gained from our session and how you might apply it.

User: I feel like I have some useful tools now. Just thinking about reframing my thoughts helps, and I’m more determined to reach out to others.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! You’ve made great strides today. Remember, making connections takes time, and you’re already on the right path. If you ever feel uncertain, just come back to that note and the ideas we discussed. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Mengmeng! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. Keep practicing those small steps, and I believe you’ll see gradual improvement. I’m here to support you along the way.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Mengmeng! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! Honestly, I've been feeling really anxious. I participated in a club activity recently, and it was really tough. I felt like I couldn't communicate well and that everyone was ignoring me. It made my social anxiety even worse.

Consultant: I can see that this recent experience has affected your confidence even more. It sounds really frustrating to feel overlooked during an event. Can you share more about what thoughts were going through your mind at that moment?

User: I kept thinking that I was embarrassing myself, and I felt like I didn't belong there at all. I thought everyone else was better than me, and that they wouldn't want to talk to me.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really challenging. It seems like you’re feeling quite isolated when you’re in social situations. What emotions did those thoughts trigger for you?

User: I felt very anxious and sad. Sometimes I just want to disappear because I don't want to be judged or ignored. 

Consultant: It sounds like that fear of judgment is quite overwhelming for you. When you think about being judged or ignored, do you notice any specific patterns in your thinking? For example, do you tend to exaggerate how bad the situation could be?

User: Yes! I always think the worst. Like, if I mess up, everyone will think I'm stupid. I can't help but imagine all these negative outcomes.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me. It seems like you’re experiencing some cognitive distortions, such as catastrophizing—imagining the worst possible outcome. Let's explore this together. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that people would judge you so harshly?

User: I don’t have solid evidence, but it just feels true in the moment. It’s like I just assume others think badly of me.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It’s common to feel that way, especially in social situations. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them to think or do?

User: I would probably tell them to not worry too much about what others think and just be themselves.

Consultant: That’s a really compassionate perspective! It’s interesting that you can offer that support to someone else, but it’s harder for you to apply it to yourself. How might you begin to shift some of those thoughts when you’re in a social situation?

User: Maybe I should remind myself that everyone has their own insecurities and that they might not be thinking about me as much as I think they are.

Consultant: Exactly! That's a wonderful insight. Focusing on the fact that others are likely preoccupied with their own thoughts can help ease that pressure. Let's create a strategy for you to practice in future social situations. How about some role-playing exercises? 

User: Sure, that sounds helpful! 

Consultant: Great! Let's imagine a scenario where you're meeting new classmates. What might be a common interaction you would like to practice?

User: Maybe starting a small talk, like asking about homework or classes.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s role-play that interaction. I’ll be your classmate. Ready? 

User: Okay. 

Consultant: “Hi there! How’s it going? Have you started studying for our upcoming exam?”

User: Um… yeah, I have started a little bit. How about you? 

Consultant: “I have too, but I’m feeling kind of overwhelmed. Any tips?” 

User: I guess I’d say to break things down and… um… make a study schedule!

Consultant: That’s a good point! You did really well starting the conversation. How did it feel to engage in that interaction? 

User: It felt a bit nerve-wracking, but I think it was okay overall.

Consultant: That’s a positive step! Remember, it’s normal to feel nervous. Each time you practice, those feelings may become less intense. What strategies could you use if you feel nervous in a real situation?

User: Maybe I could take deep breaths or remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes?

Consultant: Yes! Deep breathing can help calm those nerves, and it’s perfectly fine to stumble in conversation. People are generally more understanding than we expect. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize a couple of things to focus on for our next session. 

User: Okay!

Consultant: I’d like you to practice starting small conversations using the techniques we discussed. Also, try to notice when you’re having those negative thoughts and remember to challenge them just like we practiced. 

User: I can do that.

Consultant: Excellent! How do you feel about our session today? 

User: I feel a bit more hopeful and less stressed about trying to connect with others. 

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! As always, it’s a process, but you’re making progress. If you feel anxious, just remember to use the strategies we discussed. Looking forward to our next session! 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re welcome, Mengmeng! Keep practicing, and I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Mengmeng! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling about your social interactions recently?

User: Hi! Honestly, I've been feeling quite anxious, especially with the upcoming class discussions. I worry I won't be able to express my thoughts clearly, which makes me hesitate to participate.

Consultant: I see that you're eager to participate but feeling anxious about expressing yourself. Let's start by exploring what specifically triggers this anxiety for you. Can you share your thoughts about these class discussions?

User: Well, I often think that everyone else is smarter and more confident than I am. When it’s my turn to speak, I feel my mind going blank, and I struggle to articulate my ideas. It’s embarrassing.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you're comparing yourself to others, which adds to your anxiety. Could you recall what thoughts go through your mind during those moments when you feel blank?

User: I usually think, "What if I say something stupid?" or "They won't take me seriously." 

Consultant: Those thoughts can indeed make it harder to speak up. How do those thoughts make you feel emotionally when you're in those situations?

User: They make me feel really anxious and insecure. It’s like my heart races, and I just want to disappear.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. Let’s talk about how we can challenge those negative thoughts. Do you think there’s any evidence that supports the idea that others might judge you harshly or think less of you?

User: I guess not really. Most of my classmates seem supportive. It's just my own feelings of insecurity that amplify my worries.

Consultant: Exactly! It seems your feelings might not reflect reality. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about those thoughts and feelings?

User: I would probably say they are doing great and that it’s okay to be nervous. Everyone has moments of doubt.

Consultant: That’s a kind and supportive perspective! Now, let's try applying that same thinking to yourself. Instead of criticizing your potential contributions, we can reframe it. Can you think of a positive way to view your participation in class discussions?

User: Maybe I could think of it as an opportunity to share my thoughts and learn from others. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful way to look at it! Focusing on sharing and learning can take some pressure off. Now, let's practice! Can you think of a small way to contribute in your next class discussion, perhaps by asking a question or making a simple comment?

User: I could try to ask a question if I get stuck. That feels less intimidating than trying to make a big statement.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Asking questions can foster engagement and alleviate pressure. How do you feel about trying that out next time?

User: I feel a bit hopeful about it! It seems manageable.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift in your mindset! Now, let’s consider some coping strategies for your anxiety during the discussion. What are some things you could do beforehand to feel calmer?

User: I could practice my points at home and perhaps even write them down to remind me during class.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Preparation can really help with confidence. Remember to take deep breaths right before you speak to calm those nerves. How do you think implementing this strategy will affect your performance?

User: I think it’ll help a lot. Just having a plan will make me feel more prepared and reduce my anxiety.

Consultant: That sounds promising, Mengmeng! As you prepare and practice, you'll likely start feeling more confident in your ability to participate. Let’s also work on recognizing small successes in your efforts. What does success look like for you in these discussions?

User: I think success would be just sharing my thoughts without overthinking it, even if it's just a few words.

Consultant: Absolutely! Every effort counts. Let’s set an intention for your next discussion. What can you commit to doing that gets you closer to this goal of sharing?

User: I’ll commit to asking at least one question and trying to share a thought, no matter how small.

Consultant: That's a fantastic commitment! Remember to be kind to yourself in this process too. You’re learning and growing. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel like I have a clearer plan and some new ideas. Thank you for helping me sort through my thoughts!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm proud of the progress you've made today. As we wrap up, let’s recap the key takeaways and what you’ll be focusing on moving forward.

User: I’ll practice asking questions and focus on sharing my thoughts in class. I’ll also remind myself to be more supportive to myself like I’d be to a friend.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent strategies! I'm confident you can apply these insights. Remember to keep celebrating your small victories. How do you feel about this approach moving forward?

User: I feel really motivated! I’ll definitely give it a try and see how it goes.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It's been great working with you today. Remember, I'm here for you whenever you want to continue this journey. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You're welcome, Mengmeng! I'm glad to support you, and I look forward to hearing how things go next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Mengmeng! I'm really glad to see you today. It sounds like you've had a recent success in your group discussion. How are you feeling about that experience?

User: Hi! Yes, I felt really proud of myself when I shared my thoughts and received positive feedback. But I’m still not sure if I can keep that up. 

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you felt proud and received positive feedback! That must have been an encouraging experience. What were some of the thoughts you had when you were sharing your ideas in the group?

User: I thought my points were worth sharing, but I also felt nervous that others might not agree with me or think I'm not smart enough. 

Consultant: It makes sense to feel a mix of excitement and nervousness in such situations. Those thoughts of doubt can often pop up. Can you tell me more about how those feelings affecting your ability to engage in the discussion? 

User: Well, I usually shy away from speaking up because I worry people will judge me. But during this discussion, I just pushed through those feelings and spoke anyway. It was scary but rewarding.

Consultant: That’s a significant step! It’s great that you were able to confront that fear and share your thoughts. What do you think helped you push through those feelings this time?

User: I think I was just tired of holding back and wanted to prove to myself that I could do it. 

Consultant: That’s such a powerful realization, Mengmeng! Recognizing your desire to challenge yourself can be really motivating. How did it feel afterwards, knowing you overcame that hesitation?

User: It felt amazing! I felt more confident and like I actually belong in those discussions. 

Consultant: It’s wonderful to feel like you belong, and your confidence is clearly growing. Let’s explore how you can build on this experience. How can you remind yourself of this success when you're faced with social situations in the future?

User: I could maybe keep a journal of my accomplishments. Writing it down might help me remember the good feelings.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Keeping a journal can serve as a powerful reminder of your successes. What specific accomplishments would you like to start writing about?

User: I think I would write about times I contributed in class or moments where I felt connected to others. 

Consultant: That sounds like an effective way to reinforce your positive experiences. As you write, how will you ensure that you're also reflecting on the feelings and thoughts associated with those moments?

User: I could write about my feelings before and after those experiences, like any doubts I had, and how they changed after I spoke up.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! It will help you see the shift in your emotions and reinforce your growth. Let’s think about setting some small goals for your social interactions moving forward. What would you like to aim for in terms of engagement in your classes or social settings?

User: I want to aim for speaking up once in every class discussion for the next couple of weeks. That feels manageable. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! It’s specific and achievable. How will you keep yourself accountable to this goal? 

User: I could track it in my journal. Maybe even ask a friend to remind me to participate when I feel hesitant.

Consultant: Involving a friend is a wonderful strategy for accountability! It’s great to have someone encourage you. How do you think this challenge will make you feel about yourself?

User: I think it will help me feel more brave and capable. I hope I’ll build up my confidence even more!

Consultant: Absolutely! Embracing these challenges can cultivate a stronger sense of confidence. As you work on this goal in the coming weeks, remember to celebrate every small win. What are some ways you might celebrate your achievements?

User: I could treat myself to something nice or spend time with friends! 

Consultant: Those sound like great ways to reward yourself! Celebrating your progress reinforces your efforts. Lastly, as we wrap up today’s session, what’s one key takeaway you’d like to remember from our conversation?

User: I want to remember that I can challenge myself, and when I do, it feels rewarding. 

Consultant: That’s an empowering takeaway, Mengmeng! Recognizing your courage will help you continue growing. I'm excited to see how your journey unfolds. Remember, this is just the beginning of your exploration into your social potential! If you ever need support, I'm here for you.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Mengmeng! I’m really glad you’re here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety. I took on a new role in a campus debate competition, which I think is a good challenge for me, but I'm also really nervous about it.

Consultant: It sounds like you're stepping out of your comfort zone, which is commendable! It's normal to feel nervous when trying something new. Can you share more about what makes you excited about this opportunity, and what specifically makes you feel anxious?

User: I'm excited because I want to improve my public speaking skills and connect with others. But I worry that I won’t perform well and that others will judge me harshly.

Consultant: I hear you. It’s great that you’re focusing on improving your skills and making connections. However, it sounds like the fear of judgment is contributing to your anxiety. What do you think is the worst that could happen if things don’t go as planned during the debate?

User: I guess I’m afraid I’ll embarrass myself or that my team will think I’m not contributing. 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, and it’s something many people worry about when they’re trying to challenge themselves. Let’s explore this fear a bit. If a friend were in a similar situation and worried about embarrassing themselves, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s more important to learn and grow from the experience.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic perspective! It reflects a growth mindset, which can be very beneficial in reducing anxiety. How can we apply that same mindset to your upcoming debate?

User: I suppose I could focus on the experience as a way to learn rather than just judging myself by the outcome.

Consultant: Exactly! Shifting your focus to learning can help decrease the pressure you place on yourself. What specific steps can you take to remind yourself of this mindset leading up to the debate?

User: Maybe I could write down my goals for the debate and remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes as long as I learn from them.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan, Mengmeng! Writing down your goals can help reinforce your commitment to growth. What would you want to write as your main goal for the debate?

User: I want to focus on expressing my ideas clearly and engaging with my teammates, instead of worrying about being perfect.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Engaging with your teammates and expressing your ideas will definitely help you feel more connected and less anxious. How do you plan to prepare for the debate to feel more confident?

User: I’ve thought about practicing my speeches with friends and maybe even attending a few workshops on public speaking to boost my skills.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Practicing with friends can provide you with support and constructive feedback, and workshops can enhance your skills further. How do you feel about including some relaxation techniques in your preparation to help manage anxiety?

User: I think that would be really helpful. I sometimes feel overwhelmed and don’t know how to calm myself down.

Consultant: Incorporating relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or mindfulness, can be very helpful. Would you be open to practicing a simple breathing exercise together right now?

User: Yes, I’d like that!

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment to sit comfortably, close your eyes if you feel comfortable, and take a deep breath in through your nose… hold it for a moment… and now release it slowly through your mouth. Let’s do this a few more times.

User: That actually feels nice. I feel a bit more relaxed.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, you can use this technique anytime you start feeling anxious. Let’s shift gears a little. What other aspects of your social interactions do you want to work on, outside of the debate?

User: I think I struggle with making new friends. I often feel awkward in social settings.

Consultant: That’s an important area to explore. Feeling awkward can make socializing difficult. What do you think contributes to that feeling of awkwardness?

User: I guess I worry a lot about how others perceive me. It makes me overthink my interactions.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Perhaps we can work on identifying some of those negative thoughts that pop up when you’re in social situations. What thoughts do you notice when you start to feel awkward or anxious?

User: I tend to think things like, “They probably don’t want to talk to me,” or “I’m going to embarrass myself.”

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite powerful! Let’s challenge them. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts those thoughts? 

User: Well, sometimes I do have good conversations, and people seem to enjoy talking to me. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It shows that you have the ability to connect with people. How might you reframe those negative thoughts based on this evidence?

User: Maybe I can tell myself, “I can have meaningful conversations,” or “It’s okay if things don’t go perfectly.”

Consultant: That’s a wonderful reframe! By focusing on your strengths and the possibility of positive interactions, you empower yourself to engage with others more freely. How would it feel to put this new thinking into practice during your upcoming social interactions?

User: I think it would make me less anxious and more willing to approach people. 

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you’re gearing up to make some positive changes. As we wrap up today’s session, what progress do you see in yourself since we started addressing these challenges?

User: I feel more equipped to handle my anxiety and a bit more confident about taking social risks. I’m excited about applying these techniques.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Mengmeng! You’ve made significant strides. Remember to keep reflecting on your experiences and apply the strategies we discussed. As you continue to grow, what further social goals do you think you'd like to set for yourself in the future?

User: I’d like to focus on making more connections and perhaps joining clubs to meet new people. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Engaging in clubs can provide you with opportunities to build connections in a supportive environment. Remember, every step you take towards social engagement counts. 

User: Thank you so much! This has been really helpful.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m so glad I could help. Remember, it’s a journey, and you’re already on the right path. If you need support along the way, don’t hesitate to reach out. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Mengmeng! I'm glad to see you today. It sounds like you're making progress with your social interactions. Can you tell me how you're feeling about your recent experiences in teamwork?

User: Hi! Yes, I'm feeling quite good about it. Working on the mid-term group project was fun, and I really enjoyed collaborating with my teammates. It felt nice to communicate and share ideas without too much anxiety.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're starting to embrace the team environment. What exactly felt enjoyable about that collaboration for you?

User: I think it was the sense of belonging and being able to contribute. I felt like my ideas mattered, and my teammates encouraged me, which made me feel more confident.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you felt valued and supported by your teammates. That should give you a real boost in confidence. How do you think this experience has influenced your views on social situations in general?

User: I used to avoid social interactions because I felt so anxious and unwanted. Now, I see that it can actually be rewarding and that I can connect with others if I allow myself to. But I still have moments of insecurity.

Consultant: Acknowledging those insecurities is a big step. It’s completely normal to have ups and downs in your confidence levels, especially in new situations. What specific situations still make you feel insecure?

User: When I'm in a large group or with people I don't know well, I still feel like I might say something silly or that no one would want to talk to me. I often stay quiet and just listen.

Consultant: It makes sense that larger groups can feel overwhelming. Let’s explore this: what thoughts go through your mind during those moments that might be contributing to your anxiety or insecurity?

User: I often think, "They won't care what I have to say," or "I’m not interesting enough." These thoughts make me hesitate to join the conversation.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy. It’s tough when we believe those kinds of things about ourselves. What if we looked at the evidence for those thoughts? How true do you think they really are?

User: I guess there are times when people engage with me and show interest, but I tend to overlook those moments. My brain just defaults to the negative.

Consultant: It’s common for our minds to latch onto the negatives, but those moments of connection you've experienced are important too! Can you think of a time when someone seemed engaged in your presence, even if you might not have noticed it at the time?

User: Yes, actually! During the project, one of my teammates asked for my opinion and really listened. I felt good about that, but I tend to forget it when I’m anxious.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Holding onto those positive experiences can help break the cycle of negative thinking. How about we come up with some strategies together to remind yourself of those moments when you feel insecure in the future?

User: I think that would be helpful. Maybe I could keep a small journal to jot down these positive experiences whenever they happen.

Consultant: A journal is a great idea! Writing down those moments can reinforce the positives and help you recall them in times of stress. Would you be comfortable starting that journal this week?

User: Yes, I’ll definitely try that! I think reviewing it could give me a boost when I feel anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Let’s also think about setting small social goals for you—what would you like to aim for in terms of social interactions moving forward?

User: I’d like to try initiating conversations more often, especially in classes where I see familiar faces.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! Initiating conversations can build your confidence over time. What’s one small step you could take to make initiating conversations easier for yourself?

User: Maybe I could start with simple compliments or questions about class material when I see someone I know. It feels manageable.

Consultant: That's very manageable and a great way to ease into it. Remember, even if it feels tough at first, each small interaction builds your skills. How does that make you feel thinking about these steps forward?

User: I feel more motivated! It’s comforting to have a plan and know that it’s okay to start small.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking small steps can lead to bigger changes over time. You’ve made significant progress so far, Mengmeng, and I believe you can continue moving forward. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?

User: I think we've covered a lot! I appreciate the advice and help with my goals.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let’s summarize what we’ve worked on today. You’re going to keep a journal for positive experiences and aim to initiate conversations in a manageable way. Remember to celebrate those little wins!

User: Yes, I will! Thank you so much for your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Keep practicing those skills, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need further guidance. Take care, Mengmeng!

User: Thank you! I feel more confident now. Goodbye!
