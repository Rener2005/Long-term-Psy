Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm really glad you're here today. Let's start by discussing how you've been feeling lately and any particular events you'd like to share.

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious and a bit depressed, especially with exams coming up. I feel overwhelmed and can't seem to focus on my studies. On top of that, I'm having a tough time with my friends and my boyfriend, which only adds to my stress.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a lot on your plate right now. You're juggling exam stress and some challenging relationships. Can you tell me more about how these issues have been affecting your daily life?

User: Well, I often find myself daydreaming at night, and I just can’t concentrate on anything. I feel like I'm always under pressure to perform academically, but I don't have anyone to talk to about this.

Consultant: I see. It seems like you're experiencing a lot of pressure from your studies, and the lack of a support system might be making it harder for you. What does this pressure to perform academically feel like for you?

User: It's like this constant fear of failing. I feel like if I don't do well, it's going to disappoint my family. I just can't shake off that thought.

Consultant: That sounds really daunting. Wanting to make your family proud is completely understandable, but it can create a lot of extra pressure on yourself. How do you think this fear affects your studying and relationships with others?

User: I struggle to even start studying because I feel so anxious about the outcome. And with my boyfriend, we fight a lot, and that just adds to my worries. I feel like I'm a burden to him.

Consultant: It sounds tough, navigating both your academic worries and your relationship difficulties. Feeling like a burden is a heavy feeling to carry. Can you recall any specific thoughts that come to your mind during these moments of anxiety, whether it's about studying or your boyfriend?

User: I keep thinking that I'm not good enough, and that I'm going to let everyone down. With my boyfriend, I worry that if I express how I feel, he might get frustrated with me.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very overwhelming, Liu. It's important to recognize that these thoughts might not fully reflect reality. Let's explore them a bit. When you think you're not good enough, what evidence do you have that supports or contradicts that belief?

User: Well, I usually get decent grades, but I still feel like it’s not enough. And as for my boyfriend, there are moments when he tells me I’m fine, but when we fight, I start doubting myself again.

Consultant: It's interesting that you have evidence of doing well academically yet still feel inadequate. It sounds like there's a disconnect between your achievements and how you view yourself. How would you advise a friend who felt the same way about their performance and self-worth?

User: I’d probably tell them to acknowledge their accomplishments and not compare themselves to others so much. That it’s okay to have ups and downs.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective! It shows you recognize the importance of self-acceptance. What if you applied that same advice to yourself? How might it feel to acknowledge your achievements instead of focusing on perceived shortcomings?

User: I guess it would feel a bit relieving, but I still find it hard to let go of the fear of failure.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way, especially when you have high expectations for yourself. To help with this fear of failure, we could explore some new coping strategies together. Would you be open to trying some techniques to handle these feelings when they arise?

User: Yes, I would definitely be interested in that.

Consultant: Great! One approach is to start small. Next time you feel anxious about studying, try to take a break and do something relaxing for a while. Afterward, we can discuss how you felt, and if those feelings still affected your ability to focus. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I tend to push myself too hard when I feel anxious. I’ll try that.

Consultant: That’s a positive step! Additionally, it could be helpful to talk about your feelings with your boyfriend in a calm space. Maybe you could explain your challenges and let him know you need his support. How do you think he might respond to that?

User: I think he would understand, but I'm worried about how he might react during a fight.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have concerns about this. Being proactive and communicating your feelings when things are calm can help reduce tension during difficult moments. It may also create space for more understanding between you two. Would you be willing to give that a try?

User: Yes, I think I could try to talk to him about it when things are okay.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear, Liu! Remember, it's about gradual progress. We can continue to build on these conversations in our future sessions. Let’s take a moment to reflect on what you’d like to carry forward: how will you manage your anxiety about studying and work on your communication with your boyfriend?

User: I’ll try to acknowledge my achievements instead of focusing on the fear of failing, plus I’ll talk to my boyfriend when things are calm to share how I feel.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent goals! As we conclude for today, I'd like to remind you that it’s okay to seek support when things get tough. You’ve already taken a significant step by coming here. In our next session, we can review how these strategies are working for you and explore any new challenges. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel hopeful! I’m looking forward to trying these strategies.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Liu! Remember, you are not alone in this, and I'm here to support you. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you for our session today. I understand you've been feeling anxious lately, especially with exams approaching. Can you share more about your feelings and what you've been experiencing since our last session?

User: Hi! Yes, I’ve been really anxious about my exams. I worry that I won’t get the grades I need, and it’s affecting how I study. Also, I feel more disconnected from my friends because I'm so focused on my worries about school.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like the pressure from your studies is not only causing you anxiety about your performance but also impacting your relationships. What specifically about your grades is causing you the most distress?

User: I think I’m just terrified of disappointing my parents. They have high expectations for me, and I feel like I have to meet those or else I’ve failed. It’s hard to enjoy studying because I’m always worrying about what might happen if I don’t do well.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that pressure, especially when it comes from caring about your parents' expectations. Let’s explore this a bit more—what thoughts come to mind when you think about potentially not meeting those expectations?

User: I feel like I would be letting everyone down. I also think that if I don't get good grades, my friends and classmates will look down on me or think I'm not smart enough. It makes me feel really isolated.

Consultant: I hear you. Those thoughts are very heavy to carry. It seems like you’re facing a lot of pressure from different angles. Can we take a moment to examine some of those thoughts? What evidence do you have that not achieving the grades you want would lead to those negative outcomes?

User: Well, I guess I don’t really have solid evidence. It’s just this fear in my mind. But sometimes I do see my friends celebrating their achievements, and I feel left out. 

Consultant: It’s common to compare ourselves with others, which can intensify feelings of anxiety. If a friend were in your position, struggling with those same thoughts, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them to be kinder to themselves and remind them that grades don’t define their worth. 

Consultant: That’s a beautiful perspective, Liu! It sounds like you understand that your value isn’t solely based on academic performance. How can you apply that same kindness to yourself when these anxious thoughts arise?

User: I suppose I could try to remind myself that doing my best is enough, and I don’t have to be perfect. But it’s really hard to shift my thinking when I’m in the moment.

Consultant: It can indeed be challenging! One technique that may help is to practice self-compassion, especially during stressful times. Would you like to discuss some practical strategies for cultivating that self-kindness when exam stress comes up?

User: Yes, I would like that. I think I need some help learning to be kinder to myself.

Consultant: Great! One method could involve taking a few deep breaths and reminding yourself of your strengths before studying. Another strategy is to write down any negative thoughts and challenge them. Would you be open to trying some of these approaches?

User: Yes, I think writing things down could help, especially if I can see my thoughts on paper.

Consultant: Absolutely! It helps to externalize those thoughts. When you write them down, you can critically assess whether they're true or if they are exaggerated fears. How do you feel about incorporating this practice into your routine?

User: I think it could be helpful. I’ll give it a try and see how it influences my anxiety levels.

Consultant: That’s a positive step forward! Along with this, it’s also essential to engage with your peers. You mentioned feeling disconnected from friends. What opportunities could you create to maintain those connections while you're studying?

User: I guess I can try to set up study groups or just check in with them more often, even if it’s just a simple message.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Staying connected can provide support and remind you that you're not alone in this journey. What is one way you can reach out to a friend this week?

User: I could invite a friend to study with me before the exams. It might ease the pressure a bit.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! Engaging with others during this period can help reduce feelings of isolation. As we work towards the next steps, how do you want to feel about your social interactions by our next session?

User: I hope I can feel more confident reaching out and maybe even enjoy studying with friends instead of feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s a great goal, Liu! Building those connections can definitely create a more positive atmosphere around your studies. Let’s also think about how to remind yourself of your worth beyond academic achievements. What affirmations or reminders could you carry with you in this journey?

User: I can remind myself that I have a lot to offer as a person, not just in academics but also in my friendships and my creativity.

Consultant: Beautiful! Affirming your strengths can be very empowering. Let’s summarize the strategies we've discussed today, and set a concrete plan for how you will practice them until we meet next. Would you like to do that?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful. I want to ensure I’m on the right track.

Consultant: Perfect! So, to summarize, you’ll practice self-compassion by challenging negative thoughts through writing, engage with friends during study sessions, and remind yourself of your diverse strengths. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I feel like I have a plan now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Liu! Remember, it’s a journey, and every small step counts. You’re learning valuable skills to manage your anxiety. Before we close today, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any lingering concerns?

User: I think I’ve shared what’s been on my mind. Thank you for helping me find a way to handle all of this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’ve enjoyed our conversation today. Keep practicing those strategies, and I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!

User: Thank you! I will. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Liu! Welcome to our session today. I'm glad you're here. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite lonely and a bit hopeless about my social skills. I recently tried to join a club, but I struggled to connect with others. It was really frustrating.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like your recent experience has left you feeling unsure about your ability to connect with people. Can you tell me more about how you felt during that experience?

User: I felt anxious and out of place when I tried to talk to people. I just couldn't find the right words to say, and I ended up feeling like a failure.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel anxious in those situations, especially when you want to connect with others. What thoughts were running through your mind at that moment?

User: I kept thinking that I must be really bad at socializing. Maybe I'm just not meant to be part of a group.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. Let's take a look at them more closely. How do you think these thoughts affect your feelings and actions when you try to socialize?

User: They make me feel really discouraged. I often find myself avoiding social situations altogether because I'm afraid of failing again.

Consultant: That sounds tough, Liu. Avoiding these situations can reinforce those negative thoughts. What if we tried to identify some alternative thoughts that might help lessen that discouragement? What would you tell a friend if they were feeling this way?

User: I guess I would tell them that it's okay to face challenges and that they shouldn't be too hard on themselves.

Consultant: That's a kind perspective! Now, how could you apply that same kindness to yourself? What might it look like if you approached your social interactions with a more forgiving attitude?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it's fine to be nervous and that I can simply focus on enjoying the interactions instead of worrying about how I come across.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on the experience rather than the outcome can be a powerful way to change your mindset. In our next meetings, would you be open to practicing some social skills through role-playing scenarios?

User: Yes, I think that would help me feel more comfortable in real situations.

Consultant: Great! We can create a safe space for you to practice. What specific social situations would you like to work on first?

User: I’d like to practice starting conversations with new people, maybe at a club or in class.

Consultant: Starting conversations can be tricky, but with practice, it will become easier. Let's brainstorm some conversation starters you could use in those situations. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I could use some help with what to say at the beginning.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can come up with a few phrases together. How about starting with some simple observations or asking a question about a shared experience? For example, "What do you think about the topic we're discussing in class?"

User: I like that! It feels less intimidating.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Another idea is to share a little about yourself after asking a question. That can create a back-and-forth dialogue. What might you share after the question?

User: Maybe I could mention a similar experience I've had related to the topic.

Consultant: Exactly! Sharing personal experiences can help build a connection. As we move forward, let’s also keep track of how these new interactions make you feel compared to before. 

User: I think that’s a good idea. Keeping track of my feelings will help.

Consultant: Wonderful! As we prepare for our next session, start practicing these ideas in low-pressure settings, if you can. Would you be open to that?

User: Yes, I will try. I really want to improve my social skills!

Consultant: That’s the spirit, Liu! Each small step you take will help build your confidence. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection.

User: Thanks! I’m feeling a bit better just talking about this.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Acknowledging your feelings is the first step to managing them. We'll continue to explore these strategies together.

User: I’m really looking forward to our next session and trying out these techniques!

Consultant: Me too, Liu! I believe you’ll do great. We’ll review your experiences and make adjustments as needed next time. 

User: Thank you for your support. It means a lot to me.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm here to help you through this journey. Remember, you're not alone in this. Take care until we meet again! 

User: I will! See you next time!

Consultant: Goodbye, Liu! Looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: Hello, Liu! Welcome to today's session. How have you been feeling lately, especially after exploring some self-help materials on emotional management?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit lost, to be honest. While I've found some of the materials interesting, I still struggle to apply those ideas to my daily life. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed, especially when I'm with groups.

Consultant: It's great that you're open to exploring emotional management. It sounds like you're experiencing some challenges in applying what you've learned. Can you tell me more about a specific situation where you felt overwhelmed in a group setting?

User: Sure, I was recently in a group activity for a project, and I wanted to share my ideas. But when it was my turn, I just froze. I felt like I couldn’t express myself, and that made me really frustrated afterward.

Consultant: I understand how that situation would be frustrating. It's tough to have ideas and not feel able to share them. What thoughts were going through your mind at that moment when you felt you couldn’t speak up?

User: I kept thinking that my ideas weren't good enough and that others would judge me. It was like my mind just blanked out, and I felt so anxious.

Consultant: It's common to have those self-critical thoughts, and it sounds like they added to your anxiety in that situation. Let's explore that thought: "My ideas aren't good enough." How true do you think that belief is?

User: Honestly, I can see that it's probably not true, but in the moment, it felt very real. I just… I don’t know, I doubt myself a lot.

Consultant: Doubting ourselves can be a powerful barrier. It's important to challenge those thoughts. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about their ideas?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone's ideas have value and that it’s okay to share them. But when it’s me, it feels completely different.

Consultant: That's an important realization. You see the value in others' contributions but find it difficult to see your own. Let's work on reframing that thought together. What if you considered your ideas as worth sharing, just like your friend's ideas?

User: I guess that makes sense. I need to practice reminding myself of that. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing positive self-talk can help. Would you be open to keeping an emotional journal where you can note when those negative thoughts come up, and then challenge them?

User: Yes, that sounds like a good idea. I think writing might help me see things more clearly.

Consultant: Great! In addition to journaling, we could also look into some mindfulness exercises. They can help you stay present during those moments and reduce anxiety. How does that sound?

User: I’m willing to try. I’ve heard mindfulness can be effective but didn’t know how to start.

Consultant: Simple breathing exercises can be a good start. For instance, taking a few deep breaths before speaking can help calm your nerves. Would you like to give it a try right now together?

User: Sure, I’d like that. 

Consultant: Let's take a moment. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold it for a moment, and exhale slowly through your mouth. Just focus on your breath for a few seconds… (pauses) How did that feel?

User: I feel a little more relaxed already. It’s nice to pause and breathe.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Practicing this regularly can really help you manage anxiety when you're in challenging situations. As we continue, we can build on these techniques. Today, what do you think will be the most helpful area to focus on?

User: I think definitely on how to express myself in group situations. That’s where I feel the most pressure.

Consultant: Absolutely. We can explore strategies specifically for communication in groups. Have you considered rehearsing what you want to say beforehand?

User: Yes, but I’m afraid I’ll forget or mess it up once I'm actually there.

Consultant: That’s a common fear. One way to handle this is to keep your key points written down. You could also practice them in front of a mirror or with a friend. It’s about building confidence gradually. What do you think about that approach?

User: I think that sounds doable. It might help me feel prepared.

Consultant: Exactly! Preparation can build confidence. Let's also think of some positive affirmations you can say to yourself before these situations. What would you like to tell yourself to feel more confident?

User: Maybe something like, "I have valuable ideas, and it’s okay to share them."

Consultant: That's a wonderful affirmation! Saying that to yourself can help shift your mindset. We can include these affirmations in your journal as well. How are you feeling about our progress today?

User: I feel hopeful. I like the idea of having a plan to manage my thoughts and anxiety.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It’s all about taking small steps towards progress. For our next session, let’s review how journaling and practicing your affirmations went. Remember, it’s okay to have setbacks too; just keep practicing.

User: Okay! I’ll try my best. 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! I’m here to support you through this journey. Until next time, take care of yourself, and remember to be kind to yourself as well. 

User: Thanks! I appreciate this session. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Liu! I look forward to seeing you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello Liu! I'm glad to see you here today. Last time we spoke, you mentioned feeling stressed and dissatisfied with your group project experience. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling really pressured. I still think about that group project a lot. I realized I didn’t express my thoughts clearly, and it frustrates me. I feel like I'm not being heard.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling quite overwhelmed with that experience. It’s tough when we feel like our voices aren’t acknowledged. What do you think makes it difficult for you to express your opinions in the group?

User: I guess I worry about how others will react. I don’t want to seem confrontational or upset anyone, but at the same time, I feel resentful because my ideas are often overlooked.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, Liu. Balancing your own needs with the dynamics of a group can be challenging. Can you recall a specific moment during the project where you felt you could have spoken up? What thoughts were going through your mind at that time?

User: There was a point when I noticed the workload wasn’t evenly distributed. I thought about suggesting we redistribute tasks, but I hesitated and remained silent because I feared it would cause a conflict.

Consultant: It’s understandable that conflict can be intimidating. Your hesitation shows you were considering the group's feelings. Let’s explore this a bit more. What emotions did you experience in that moment when you chose not to speak up?

User: I felt anxious and frustrated. I thought about what I wanted to say, but the fear of causing a disagreement stopped me. Instead, I just bottled it up.

Consultant: Those feelings of anxiety and frustration can be very heavy to carry. Let’s look at that situation from another angle. If a friend was in your position, how would you advise them to handle it? 

User: I would probably tell them to just express their thoughts honestly but calmly, and that it’s important to advocate for themselves. It might lead to a better outcome.

Consultant: That’s great advice! It seems you recognize the value in speaking up. What if we could apply that same perspective to your situation? How would it feel to give yourself permission to express your needs in the group?

User: It would feel liberating, I think. But I still find it hard to imagine doing it. Maybe I just need to practice?

Consultant: Practicing is an excellent idea! We could work on some role-playing exercises to help you feel more comfortable with expressing your thoughts. Would you be interested in trying that today?

User: Yes, I think that would help. I want to feel more confident in those situations.

Consultant: Fantastic! Let’s imagine a scenario where you address the group about the task distribution. I’ll play the role of your group members. What would you like to say to them about your concerns?

User: I’d say something like, “I’ve noticed that some of us have more tasks than others, and I think it would be fair to look at redistributing them to balance the workload.” 

Consultant: That’s a great starting point! You’re being direct yet considerate. How does saying that out loud make you feel? 

User: Saying it feels a bit scary, but I also feel a sense of relief. I think if I practice it, it could work.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember, the more you practice, the more natural it will feel. What strategies can we come up with to help you manage that anxiety when you’re about to speak up in front of the group?

User: I could take deep breaths beforehand and remind myself of the importance of sharing my thoughts. Maybe visualizing a positive outcome could help too.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies, Liu. Visualization can really reinforce your confidence. How about setting a small goal for the next group meeting—like having one clear point you want to share? 

User: That sounds doable. I can prepare one thing to say and practice my delivery before the meeting.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! Remember, it’s okay to start small. As you build confidence, you can gradually express more of your thoughts. How does this new goal make you feel overall?

User: I feel more hopeful and less burdened. I think I can handle the situation better now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It sounds like you’re really starting to embrace these changes. Before we wrap up today, what do you think you can do to maintain this positive shift going forward?

User: I can keep reminding myself of what I’ve learned here and practice these skills regularly. Also, I can reflect on my experiences to see how I improve.

Consultant: Excellent! Reflection and practice will support your growth. Remember, every little step counts. Today, you’ve taken significant strides towards better communication. 

User: Thank you! I feel much more equipped to handle things now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Liu! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. I look forward to seeing you implement these skills in the future. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need further support. 

User: I appreciate it! I’ll make sure to reach out. Thanks again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling much better, actually. My communication with my parents has improved a lot, and it feels like our family relationship is becoming warmer and more supportive.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like your family dynamics are positively changing. Can you share more about how these improvements have affected you?

User: I feel more relaxed and accepted. It's like I can express my feelings without fear of being judged. I think this has really helped me to accept my emotions better.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re feeling more comfortable expressing yourself. This acceptance can be a powerful factor in your emotional well-being. What specific feelings do you find yourself embracing more these days?

User: I think I’m more open to feeling both happy and sad. In the past, I used to suppress my sadness, but now I realize it’s okay to feel those emotions.

Consultant: That’s a significant step. Acknowledging all your feelings is part of healthy emotional processing. As we move forward today, I'd like to discuss some of your personal growth goals. What are some areas you would like to explore further?

User: I’d like to focus on personal growth, maybe setting some long-term goals. I want to figure out what I truly want for myself in the future.

Consultant: That’s an excellent focus for our session. Let’s start by reflecting on the progress you’ve made so far. What do you believe has been your biggest achievement since we began this journey together?

User: I think my biggest achievement has been improving my self-acceptance. I’m learning not to be so hard on myself about my studies or my social life.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. Self-acceptance can greatly influence your motivation and overall happiness. How do you see this acceptance affecting your studies and social interactions?

User: I think it helps me to be more patient with myself during my studies. I don’t panic as much when I don’t understand something right away. In terms of social life, I feel less anxious in interactions.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re applying that self-acceptance in practical ways! What would you like to achieve academically or socially in the next few months?

User: Academically, I want to maintain a consistent study schedule and balance my time better. Socially, I want to build more meaningful friendships.

Consultant: Those are fantastic goals! To maintain a consistent study schedule, we could explore some techniques that might help. Are there any strategies you’ve considered or tried before?

User: I’ve tried to create study plans, but I sometimes struggle to stick to them.

Consultant: That’s completely normal! Sticking to a study plan can be challenging. Let’s discuss potential adjustments to your plan that could make it more manageable. How about starting with smaller, achievable tasks?

User: That sounds good. I think smaller tasks might make it less overwhelming for me.

Consultant: Exactly! By breaking it down, you can experience a sense of accomplishment with each completed task. How do you feel about setting up a weekly study goal to begin with?

User: I like that idea! Setting weekly goals could help me stay on track and not feel so pressured.

Consultant: Great! Let’s also consider your social goals. Building meaningful friendships often requires some effort and vulnerability. What specific steps do you think you can take to foster those connections?

User: I guess I could join some clubs or activities I’m interested in. I think it would be easier to meet people with similar interests.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach! Engaging in activities you enjoy can naturally lead to forming connections with others. How do you feel about actively seeking out those opportunities?

User: I feel excited about it! I'm a bit nervous, but I think taking that step could really help me.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about stretching your comfort zone. Remember, those feelings are part of the process. Let’s think about how you can ease that anxiety before you engage in these new situations.

User: Maybe I could practice what I want to say or how to introduce myself before going to those places.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Visualization and practice can boost your confidence in those social situations. Do you have specific activities in mind that you’d like to pursue?

User: I’m thinking about joining the art club and possibly a study group. I love art, and I think working on projects together could be fun.

Consultant: Those sound like fantastic choices! Participating in something you’re passionate about will make it easier to connect with people. Please remember to be kind to yourself during this exploration. 

User: I will! I feel like I have a clearer path now, thanks to our talk.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Liu! Before we wrap up, let’s summarize what we've discussed today. You’re focusing on maintaining a consistent study schedule, building meaningful friendships, and practicing self-acceptance. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds perfect! I feel ready to take on these challenges.

Consultant: You’ve made significant strides, and I believe in your ability to continue this journey. Remember to set small, achievable goals and be kind to yourself along the way. 

User: Thank you so much! I truly appreciate your support.

Consultant: It’s been my pleasure! Thank you for sharing your progress with me. You’ve accomplished a lot already. If you ever feel the need to revisit our sessions, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care, Liu!

User: Thank you! I will. I feel empowered to keep moving forward!
