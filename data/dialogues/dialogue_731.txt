Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?  

User: Hi! Honestly, not much has changed. I still struggle with anxiety and feel really lonely in this new environment. It’s tough to connect with my classmates.  

Consultant: I’m really sorry to hear that you’re feeling this way. It sounds like these feelings of loneliness and anxiety have been quite overwhelming. Can you share more about what specific situations make you feel this way?  

User: Well, I often find it difficult to start conversations with my dormmates. They all seem to know each other already, and I feel like an outsider. It makes me anxious, and I end up isolating myself more.  

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel anxious when you’re in a new group. Building social connections can take time, especially in an environment where everyone seems familiar with each other. Have you thought about what makes it hard for you to approach them?  

User: I think it’s mainly my fear of being rejected or not knowing what to say. I get this voice in my head that tells me I’ll embarrass myself.  

Consultant: That’s a common struggle, Liu. Those negative thoughts can really hold you back. Can you try to identify what specific thoughts come to your mind in those moments?  

User: I often think things like, “They won’t want to talk to me” or “I’ll make a fool of myself.”  

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite overwhelming. Let’s explore them together. On a scale from 1 to 10, how much do you believe those thoughts when you think about talking to your dormmates?  

User: Probably around 8. I really struggle to push past those feelings.  

Consultant: That high level of belief in those thoughts indicates they’re quite powerful for you. Let’s work on challenging them. What evidence do you have that suggests they wouldn’t want to talk to you?  

User: Well, I don’t have any concrete evidence. I just feel this way based on past experiences.  

Consultant: That’s a crucial insight, Liu. Just because you feel that way doesn’t make it true. If a friend was experiencing similar thoughts, what might you tell them?  

User: I think I would tell them to give it a shot, that it’s okay to take the risk of talking to someone.  

Consultant: Exactly! You’re recognizing that there is a different perspective. Would you be willing to apply that advice to yourself? What might that look like in a practical way?  

User: Maybe I can start by saying hello to one dormmate. Just a simple greeting could break the ice.  

Consultant: That’s a great plan! It feels manageable and allows you to take a step forward. How do you feel about setting a goal to say hello to one person each day this week?  

User: That sounds doable. I’m a bit nervous, but I think I can try.  

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous about this. Remember, it’s about taking small steps. How do you think you will feel after you successfully greet someone?  

User: I guess I’d feel a bit more confident. Maybe it wouldn’t be as scary as I imagine.  

Consultant: Absolutely! That positive feeling after initiating conversation can build your confidence over time. How do you want to remind yourself of that feeling if anxiety starts to creep back in?  

User: Maybe I could keep a journal. I could write about my experiences and how I felt after each conversation.  

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent idea! Journaling can help you reflect on your progress and challenge those negative beliefs. Would you like to set a time to reflect on what you write?  

User: Yes, I think I could do it at the end of each day.  

Consultant: Perfect! This routine can create a space for you to process your emotions. Now, before we finish today’s session, what specific actions will you commit to for the coming week?  

User: I’ll greet at least one dormmate each day and write in my journal about my thoughts and feelings afterwards.  

Consultant: That’s a solid commitment, Liu! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. When we meet next time, we can discuss how it went and explore your feelings further.  

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful now.  

Consultant: It’s been great to see you reflecting on all of this, Liu. I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello Liu! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially regarding your academic concerns and social interactions?

User: Hi! I've had some slight improvements in my interactions with my roommate. We're participating in some dorm activities together now. But I still struggle with concentrating in class, and that worries me a lot.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've made some progress socially! Participating in dorm activities can be a big step. Regarding your concentration in class, can you tell me what kind of thoughts go through your mind during those times when you find it hard to focus?

User: Well, I often worry about whether I'll understand everything or if I’m falling behind in my studies. Sometimes, I feel like I might fail, and that really increases my anxiety.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts about failing are quite overwhelming and can distract you from really focusing on the class material. Let’s take a closer look—what does that feeling of failure bring up for you? 

User: It makes me feel inadequate. I just want to do well and earn respect from my peers and professors. When I think I might fail, it feels like I’m disappointing everyone.

Consultant: Those feelings of inadequacy can be really tough to manage, especially when you’re aiming for respect and validation from others. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you will fail? Are there perhaps alternative perspectives to consider?

User: I guess I don’t have any solid evidence. I’ve always done well before. It’s just that I have this fear of disappointing everyone, which makes me feel so anxious.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! Acknowledging that you’ve done well in the past suggests that you have the skills to succeed. Let’s explore some strategies to challenge those fears. If a friend were in your position, how would you encourage them to think differently about their exams and performance? 

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay to not be perfect. I’d remind them about their past successes and to focus on doing their best rather than worrying about failing.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! Now, let’s try applying that self-compassion to your own situation. Can you think of a positive affirmation or statement that you could say to yourself when you start feeling anxious about your performance?

User: Maybe something like "I have done well before, and I can succeed again if I give it my best effort"?

Consultant: That sounds like a strong affirmation to remind yourself of your capabilities. The next time you feel that anxiety creeping in, try repeating that to yourself. How does that make you feel thinking about using this affirmation?

User: It feels somewhat reassuring. I think it could help me refocus during class.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Liu! Now, let’s talk about practical steps. What small, manageable goal can you set for yourself in the upcoming week to improve your engagement in class?

User: I think I could try to participate in class discussions more often. Maybe I can aim to raise my hand at least once each class to answer a question.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! Actively engaging in discussions can enhance your focus and build your confidence. How do you think you’ll feel if you accomplish that?

User: I suppose I would feel more confident. It’s nice to think that I could contribute. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Confidence can grow through those small victories. Let’s also consider how we can address your sleep concerns that arise from this academic pressure. Have you noticed specific worries that keep you up at night?

User: Sometimes I lie awake thinking about my grades and what my parents will think if I don’t do well. It’s hard to quiet those thoughts.

Consultant: It’s understandable that those worries are interfering with your sleep. We can explore some relaxation techniques to help manage those thoughts before bed. Would you be open to trying some mindfulness exercises to unwind at night?

User: Yes, I think that might help. I need something to distract me from those anxious thoughts.

Consultant: Great! Mindfulness can be an effective way to create a sense of calm. I can guide you through a simple mindfulness exercise next time. But for now, how can you apply what we discussed today about managing your anxiety and enhancing your class participation?

User: I will remind myself of my past successes, set a goal to participate in class, and practice some relaxation techniques before bed. I hope that will help me feel better.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a solid plan! Just remember that progress takes time, and being patient with yourself is key. How was today's session for you?

User: It was really helpful! I feel like I have some tools to work with now. Thank you for guiding me through my concerns.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that, Liu! Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and it's perfectly okay to reach out when you need support. We can continue to build on these strategies in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I look forward to discussing my progress with you next time. 

Consultant: Looking forward to it as well! Take care, and remember to practice those affirmations and relaxation techniques. See you soon!

Consultant: Hello, Liu! Welcome to our session today. I’m really glad to see you. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling overwhelmed. With mid-term exams coming up, I can't stop worrying about not performing well. I can't focus to study, and it's affecting my sleep.

Consultant: It sounds like the pressure of the exams is weighing heavily on you. You’re feeling anxious and it's impacting your sleep and ability to study effectively. Can you tell me more about this anxiety? What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about the exams?

User: I keep thinking that if I don’t do well, I’ll disappoint myself and everyone around me. I just want to be respected and admired for my achievements, but now I'm scared that I won't meet those expectations.

Consultant: That pressure to meet expectations can be really intense. It seems like you're placing a lot of emphasis on how others perceive your success. How do you feel when you think about potentially disappointing yourself or others?

User: I feel really anxious and even a bit ashamed. I think people would see me as a failure. And that thought just spirals—I feel like I'm not good enough.

Consultant: Those feelings of inadequacy must be really tough to carry. Let’s try to explore that thought a bit. When you think, "If I fail, I will be a failure," can you consider the evidence for and against that thought? Is there any alternative way to perceive a potential setback?

User: I guess I haven’t thought about it that way. I mean, it’s just one exam. But I feel like it defines me, which is unreasonable, right?

Consultant: Exactly! One exam does not define your worth or who you are. It might be a good idea to challenge that thought when it comes up. If a friend were in your position, how would you encourage them to view the situation?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to mess up sometimes and that it doesn't take away from all the good things they’ve done before. 

Consultant: That’s a really compassionate perspective! You seem to have clarity on how to support others. Now, how about extending that kindness toward yourself? How can you reframe your expectations for this exam?

User: I think I could try to view it as a chance to learn rather than just a test of my worth. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic starting point! By focusing on the learning process rather than solely on the outcome, you may find that the pressure eases a bit. What steps could you take to prepare and make this learning experience more enjoyable?

User: Maybe I can create a study plan that breaks down topics into smaller, manageable parts. And I could set up study groups to make it more social and interactive.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Engaging with your peers can not only enhance your understanding of the material but also help ease some of that social anxiety. How do you feel about participating in group studies?

User: I’ve been hesitant because I’m worried about how they’ll perceive me. But I think it could really help me feel less alone in this.

Consultant: It's natural to feel that way, but remember, everyone has their own struggles. By joining a group, you might discover shared anxieties and support one another. What if you approach the group with an open mindset? 

User: That sounds reasonable. I could also practice sharing more about my thoughts and feelings in those situations instead of shutting down.

Consultant: Excellent! This practice of opening up could build your confidence, and it may also strengthen your social connections. As we continue to work on these skills, let’s also revisit how we can improve your sleep. What do you currently do to wind down at night?

User: I usually stay on my phone or watch videos. I think that makes it harder to fall asleep.

Consultant: That’s a common challenge. It might help to establish a calming bedtime routine—something like reading a book or practicing relaxation exercises. Would you be open to giving that a try?

User: Yes, I think that could work! Anything to help me sleep better would be great.

Consultant: Perfect! We can also incorporate mindfulness exercises to help you calm your mind before bed. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds really helpful. I’ve heard about mindfulness before but haven’t really tried it.

Consultant: It can be a powerful tool for reducing anxiety and promoting a sense of calm. Essentially, mindfulness helps you focus on the present moment without judgment. Would you like to explore some simple techniques that you can practice?

User: Sure! I’d like to learn about them.

Consultant: A good starting point is the breathing exercise. Find a quiet spot, close your eyes, and take deep, slow breaths. With each exhale, you can release tension. This practice can help ground you and calm racing thoughts. Ready to give it a go this week?

User: Yes, I’m willing to give it a try. I think it'll help me. 

Consultant: I’m really proud of you for being open to these changes. During our next session, we can review how everything is progressing—your studies, your sleep, and your social interactions. Remember, it’s all about the journey, not just the destination. 

User: That makes sense! Thanks, really. I feel a little lighter talking about this and have some things to work on. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Liu! It's been a pleasure talking with you today. Remember, it's okay to have ups and downs. I believe in your ability to manage these feelings and improve your situation. Looking forward to our next session—take care!

User: Thanks! I appreciate your support. Talk to you soon!

Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you again. I understand you've been making some progress in your social interactions recently. How are you feeling about that?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling a bit better. Participating in the school activities was a good experience. I enjoyed being part of a team, but I still worry a lot about my studies.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you enjoyed the team activities! Balancing social life and academic pressures can be challenging. Can you tell me more about your concerns regarding your studies?

User: I worry that I'm not studying effectively enough. I feel like I'm falling behind compared to my classmates. It's stressful, and I sometimes doubt my abilities.

Consultant: That sounds tough. It's understandable to feel stressed when you compare yourself to others. Let’s explore this a bit—what specific thoughts do you have when you think about your studies and how you measure up to your classmates?

User: I often think that if I don’t get good grades, people will judge me. Sometimes, I feel like I must be perfect otherwise I’ll disappoint my family or friends.

Consultant: It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to meet certain expectations. Let’s work on unpacking that thought. How realistic do you think it is to expect perfection in your academic performance?

User: I know that expecting perfection is unrealistic, but I can’t help feeling that I need to be the best to be respected.

Consultant: It’s important to recognize that while wanting to perform well is natural, it’s also valuable to allow yourself to be imperfect. If a friend were in your position, what would you say to them about handling these feelings?

User: I would probably tell them that it's okay to have ups and downs in their studies, and they don’t always have to be at the top.

Consultant: Exactly! You have the capacity to give that kindness and understanding to yourself too. Let’s consider ways to challenge that idea of needing to be the best. What if we set some realistic, achievable goals for your studies instead of aiming for perfection?

User: That sounds reasonable. I could start by setting small goals for each study session rather than looking at the overall grades.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Small, manageable goals can help build your confidence and create a sense of accomplishment. What’s one specific goal you could set for your next study session?

User: I think I could aim to finish a chapter of my textbook and focus on really understanding the material instead of just memorizing it.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Focusing on understanding helps make studying more meaningful. How about your social interactions? Would you like to set a related goal for that area as well?

User: Yes! I could try to engage more with classmates during study groups. Maybe I can help others with their questions too.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! Engaging with classmates not only reinforces your learning but also builds your confidence socially. How do you feel about stepping into that role?

User: I feel excited about it but a bit nervous too. I hope they don’t think I’m not knowledgeable enough.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel a bit nervous, especially when stepping into a new role. Remember, everyone brings their perspectives to a study group. Instead of focusing on what others might think, how can you remind yourself that your contributions are valuable?

User: I could remind myself that helping others is a way to learn better. Plus, everyone has gaps in their knowledge.

Consultant: Absolutely! Viewing it as a learning opportunity for yourself can shift the focus from pressure to growth. As we wrap up today, let's take a moment to summarize what you’ve planned. You’ll set small study goals and actively participate in study groups. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I feel more reassured about focusing on these small goals, and I’m looking forward to participating in the group.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Reflecting on your progress is key. When we meet next time, we can discuss how those goals went and any feelings that came up for you. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. 

User: Thank you! I feel more positive about things now. I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Liu! It’s wonderful to see you feeling positive. Always remember that you’re capable of managing both your studies and your social interactions. Looking forward to hearing about your progress next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello there! I'm glad to see you again. I’ve heard about your recent success in passing the mid-term exams. How are you feeling about that?

User: Hi! Yes, I did pass my mid-term exams, and it feels great. My anxiety has definitely lowered since the exams are over, but I still feel a bit unsure about socializing with my classmates.

Consultant: That sounds like a mixed bag of emotions—on one hand, you're feeling accomplished from your exams, but on the other hand, you're still facing some uncertainty in social situations. What do you think contributes to that uncertainty with your classmates?

User: I guess I just find it hard to connect with them. I want to be liked and respected, but I feel a bit out of place sometimes. 

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way, especially in a new environment like university. It can be tough to adapt socially. Can you tell me more about specific situations where you felt "out of place"?

User: Well, during group projects or social events, I find it hard to join conversations. I often feel like I have nothing interesting to say. 

Consultant: That can be really challenging. It's common to worry about not having something “interesting” to contribute. What thoughts go through your mind when you're in those situations?

User: I often think that I'll sound stupid or boring. So, I just end up staying quiet which makes me feel even more isolated.

Consultant: It's interesting that you mention that. It seems like these thoughts are creating a cycle that leads to more isolation. What if we looked at those thoughts together? 

User: Okay, I’d like that. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s examine one of those thoughts closely. When you think, "I'll sound stupid or boring," how does that make you feel in the moment?

User: It makes me feel anxious and kind of defeated, like I shouldn't even try.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like these thoughts really have a strong impact on your feelings and actions. What evidence do you have that supports this thought? Are there instances where you expressed your opinions and others responded positively?

User: Well, there was this one time I shared an idea during a project, and my classmates seemed to appreciate it. But I often forget about that. 

Consultant: That’s a great example! Remembering that positive feedback can help challenge the negative thoughts you have. If a friend faced similar thoughts, how would you advise them? 

User: I would probably tell them that everyone's voice matters and that we all have something unique to offer.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re able to see the value in others’ contributions. You can extend that same kindness to yourself. How about we set a small goal where you share one idea during your next group interaction?

User: That sounds doable. I think I can try to think of just one thing to share.

Consultant: That's a fantastic first step! Each small success can help build your confidence. How do you feel about focusing on this goal in our upcoming meetings?

User: I feel hopeful! It’s nice to have something specific to work on.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let's also talk about other activities you can engage in that might help build your social skills. Have you thought about joining any clubs or groups?

User: I’ve considered looking into a few clubs that align with my interests, but I haven't committed to anything yet.

Consultant: Joining a club is a wonderful way to meet new people with similar interests. It could provide a more comfortable environment for socializing. What kinds of clubs are you considering?

User: Maybe a study group or something related to hobbies, but I’m nervous about going alone.

Consultant: It's natural to feel nervous about stepping into something new. Would it help to set a goal to at least visit a club meeting just once? 

User: Yes, I could try that. Just to see what it's like.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! We can celebrate that effort, regardless of the outcome. It's all about taking steps forward. What do you think you might expect from that experience?

User: I suppose I’d hope to just feel less overwhelmed and maybe meet at least one new person.

Consultant: Those are great expectations. Trying new things often leads to unexpected opportunities. How can you remind yourself of these positive expectations when you feel those anxious thoughts creeping in?

User: Perhaps I could write them down and read them beforehand? 

Consultant: Writing them down is a great strategy! You could also practice some positive affirmations. What affirmations might you want to include?

User: Maybe something like, "I have valuable things to share" or "It's okay to be myself."

Consultant: Both of those affirmations are empowering. They reinforce your value and authenticity. How do you feel about using affirmations before social interactions?

User: It makes me feel more confident just thinking about it.

Consultant: Fantastic! Confidence often grows with practice and experience. I believe you’re capable of moving forward with this. As we wrap up today, let's take a moment to reflect. What would you say has been your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I think it’s about recognizing that my thoughts can sometimes be misleading, and that I do have the ability to connect with people. 

Consultant: That's a valuable insight! You’ve made significant progress in understanding yourself. I believe you’re well on your way to enjoying your university experience even more. 

User: Thank you! I feel motivated to embrace these changes.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Remember, it’s a journey, and every step counts. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! It's great to see you again. I hope you’ve been doing well since our last session. I’d love to hear about how you're feeling and any progress you've made.

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. After the outing with my roommates, I felt a lot more connected to them. It was such a refreshing experience, and I realized how much I enjoy being part of a team.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s fantastic to hear that you felt a stronger connection with your roommates. Teamwork can really enhance our sense of belonging. How has this experience influenced your thoughts about your university life moving forward?

User: I feel more positive about the future now. I used to worry a lot about making new friends and fitting in, but now I think I can manage better. I want to keep having fun and participating in more activities.

Consultant: That's a great mindset, Liu! It sounds like you're ready to embrace new experiences. Let’s explore how we can create a plan to maintain that positive momentum. What specific activities or goals would you like to pursue in the coming months?

User: I want to join a student club. I think it could be a good way to meet more people and learn something new. Maybe something related to my major, or even sports.

Consultant: Joining a student club is an excellent idea! It can definitely help you connect with others who share your interests. Which clubs have caught your attention, or what kind of activities do you think would excite you the most?

User: There’s a sports club and a debate club that I’m considering. I like sports, but I’m also curious about improving my public speaking skills. 

Consultant: Both options sound great and very beneficial. Engaging in sports could help you stay active and build friendships, while the debate club may boost your confidence and communication skills. How do you envision balancing these activities with your academic responsibilities?

User: I think I can manage my time better now. I've been getting into a routine, so if I plan ahead, I should be able to do both. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid approach. Creating a routine can help you stay organized. Let's think about how you can set specific goals within these clubs. Are there any particular milestones you want to achieve by the end of the semester?

User: For the sports club, I want to attend at least two practices a week. For the debate club, I’d like to participate in at least one debate by the end of the semester.

Consultant: Those are very achievable goals! Setting these targets can provide you with a sense of direction. How do you think reaching these goals might make you feel about yourself and your progress at university?

User: I think it will make me feel more accomplished and confident, like I’m really making the most of my time here. 

Consultant: That's a powerful perspective, Liu! Recognizing your achievements can significantly enhance your self-esteem. What strategies do you think you could use to stay motivated as you pursue these goals?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal to track my progress and feelings about joining these clubs. It could help me reflect on what I'm doing and staying focused.

Consultant: A journal sounds like a fantastic idea! Reflecting on your experiences can provide insight and motivation. Additionally, how about rewarding yourself when you reach these milestones? What kind of rewards do you think would be meaningful for you?

User: I could treat myself to a nice meal or maybe buy a book I've wanted to read. That would feel like a nice reward after achieving my goals.

Consultant: Those sound like lovely rewards! Treating yourself will reinforce your positive behaviors. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize your plan: joining either the sports or debate club, aiming for those specific goals, and using a journal to track your progress. Does that sound good to you?

User: Yes, that sounds perfect! I feel excited about everything we talked about today.

Consultant: That’s exactly what I wanted to hear! I truly believe you’re on a great path. Remember, it’s about enjoying the journey and learning along the way. If challenges come up, we can work through them together in future sessions. 

User: Thanks so much! I appreciate your support and am looking forward to putting this plan into action.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Liu. I’m excited for you, and I believe you’ll do great things. Remember, I'm here whenever you need support. Have a wonderful week ahead! 

User: Thanks! I will. See you next time. 

Consultant: See you, Liu! Take care.
