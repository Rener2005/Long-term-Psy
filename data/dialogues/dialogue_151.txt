Consultant: Hello, Xiaoya! I'm really glad you've come in for this session. I can see that there's been a lot on your mind lately. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi. Honestly, it’s been really tough. I feel so lost without my dad. It's like I can't focus on anything, especially in my classes. I keep thinking about him, and that just makes me more upset.

Consultant: That sounds really overwhelming, Xiaoya. The loss of a parent is incredibly difficult, and it's completely understandable to feel lost and unable to concentrate right now. Can you tell me more about what thoughts come to mind when you think about your dad?

User: I think about how he won’t be there for my graduation or to celebrate my accomplishments. I feel so empty, and I keep blaming myself for not being there for him more in his last moments.

Consultant: It's common to experience those kinds of thoughts after losing someone close. It’s important to acknowledge that guilt, but it’s also essential to understand that you did your best at that time. How does thinking about your dad affect your emotions day to day?

User: It makes me sad, like I just want to cry all the time. I feel like I’m in this fog. Sometimes, I find myself crying when I’m all alone because I just can't hold it in anymore.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that, Xiaoya. It's okay to cry and feel that sadness—it’s part of the healing process. Have you been able to talk to anyone else in your family about how you're feeling?

User: Not really. I’m worried about my mom and my brother. I feel like they are struggling too, and I don’t want to add to their pain by talking about my feelings.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re being very considerate of your family’s feelings. Support can work both ways; sharing how you're feeling might help you all feel a little less alone in this. Would you be open to trying to express your feelings to them, maybe even during a quiet moment together?

User: I guess that could help… but I’m still unsure about how to start that conversation. What if they can’t handle it?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, Xiaoya. Perhaps starting with something simple like, “I’ve been feeling a bit sad and wanted to share it with you.” It’s okay if the conversation doesn’t go perfectly, the important part is making that connection. How does that idea sound to you?

User: It sounds okay, but I still feel scared about it. I worry they might not understand or think I’m being dramatic.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel scared when opening up, especially in such a heavy situation. Remember, your feelings are valid, and expressing them is a brave step. What do you think might be some positive outcomes from having that conversation with them?

User: Maybe it could help us all feel a little closer? Like, if we share our feelings, we might support each other better.

Consultant: Absolutely! Opening that door can definitely create a sense of unity. It sounds like you have a strong caring instinct for your family, which is a beautiful quality. Let’s think a little about how you can manage those overwhelming feelings when they arise and possibly create a plan to share with your family. What’s something that helps you feel a little better during tough times?

User: Sometimes listening to music helps a bit, but I can never really concentrate on anything else. It’s hard to do much with my mind racing.

Consultant: Music can be a comforting escape. That’s a great tool to have. We can also explore some relaxation techniques together that might help calm your mind, making it easier to focus. Would you like to try a simple breathing exercise now?

User: I’d like to try that. I really need something to calm me down.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment to focus on your breath. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold it for a count of four, then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of four. Let's do this together a few times. 

User: (After the exercise) That actually helped a bit. I feel a little lighter.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Remember, it's perfectly okay to take little moments for yourself like this. It’s part of taking care of your emotional well-being. As we continue our sessions, we can build on these techniques. Do you feel ready to explore expressing your feelings to your family more?

User: I think so, but I still need time. It’s just all so new.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable, Xiaoya. Taking time is important. It’s also okay to take small steps at your own pace. Let’s plan to check in on this topic during our next session. How do you feel about that?

User: That sounds good. I think I need to process everything a bit more.

Consultant: Absolutely, and it’s perfectly fine to do that. We can work together to find ways to feel more comfortable and supported in your journey. Before we finish today, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any questions you have?

User: No, I think we covered a lot. I feel a tiny bit better after talking.

Consultant: I'm really happy to hear that! Remember, it's okay to reach out for support when it’s needed. You've shown a lot of strength today. I look forward to our next session, Xiaoya, and we can continue exploring these feelings together. Take care of yourself in the meantime.

User: Thank you! I appreciate this. See you next time.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoya! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately, especially after your father's passing?

User: Hi. Honestly, it's been really hard. I feel sad and lost most of the time. I try to talk to my mom more, but I often don’t know what to say.

Consultant: That sounds challenging, and it's understandable to feel that way after losing someone so important. What do you think you and your mom can talk about that would help you both?

User: I think we both need to share our feelings, but sometimes it feels awkward. I’m afraid of making her even sadder.

Consultant: It’s admirable that you’re considering her feelings. Could it help to share memories of your father during these conversations? It might allow both of you to express your feelings and honor his memory.

User: That might work. I have some nice memories, but it also makes me feel guilty when I think about being happy.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel guilty about happiness after a loss. Can you tell me more about those feelings of guilt? What specifically makes you feel that way?

User: I just feel like I shouldn't be having a good time or enjoying things while we’re grieving. Like, it feels wrong to smile.

Consultant: I hear you, and that’s a common feeling in grief. It’s like there’s a conflict between wanting to live your life and feeling like you should be sad. Would it help to discuss how you can find a balance between remembering your father and also allowing yourself to enjoy life?

User: Yes, I think so. I want to remember him but still live my life. I just don't know how.

Consultant: One approach could be to create a small ritual for remembrance. For example, you could dedicate a time each week to reflect on your father or do something he enjoyed. This may allow you to celebrate his life while also engaging in activities that bring you joy.

User: That sounds nice. I could find a way to remember him while still doing things I like.

Consultant: Exactly! And how do you feel about sharing this idea with your mom and brother? It might strengthen your family bond during this time.

User: I think I could share it with them. It might help us feel more connected.

Consultant: That sounds like a great step forward. Connecting with family can provide support and comfort. Could you also explore what activities might bring you joy or comfort right now?

User: I've been thinking about joining a club at school, but I’m nervous about it.

Consultant: Joining a club could be a wonderful way to meet new people and find joy while managing your feelings. What about the idea makes you nervous?

User: I just worry that I won’t fit in or that I’ll feel sad while being around others.

Consultant: Those worries are valid. Sometimes, taking small steps can help ease that anxiety. Perhaps you could attend a meeting as a visitor first before committing?

User: Yes, that sounds manageable. I could try just to see how it feels.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time. How do you feel about trying this out in the coming week?

User: I feel a bit excited about it! But I’m also still worried about the feelings that might come up.

Consultant: It’s normal to have mixed emotions. When you feel the anxiety or sadness, you could remind yourself that it’s okay to have emotions and that you can still have fun while processing your feelings.

User: That makes sense. I will try to remember that. I want to allow myself to feel both.

Consultant: That’s a strong mindset, Xiaoya! You are allowing space for both your grief and happiness. After you attend the club meeting, how about we discuss it in our next session?

User: Yes, I’d like that. It’ll be good to process how I feel afterward.

Consultant: Absolutely! I look forward to hearing about your experience. One last thing, as you explore this club, consider giving yourself permission to enjoy those moments without guilt.

User: I will try my best! Thank you for your support.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember, it's a journey, and taking small steps is important. I believe in you. Would you like to share anything more before we conclude today?

User: No, I think I shared enough for now. I just hope I can manage everything.

Consultant: I'm confident you will. You've taken some big steps today, and that’s important. If you encounter any challenges, remember, we can address them together. 

User: Thank you! I feel a little lighter after talking today.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiaoya! It's great to know our session has helped. Until next time, take care and be gentle with yourself.

User: Thank you! I appreciate it.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoya! I’m really glad you’re here for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I've been trying to keep myself busy with club activities, but I still feel guilty about being happy. It feels wrong, you know, especially so soon after my father's passing.

Consultant: It sounds like you're in a tough spot, wanting to engage in activities but also feeling a heavy weight of guilt. Can you share with me more about what specific activities you've been involved in and how they make you feel?

User: I've tried joining a few clubs, like the drama club and a volunteering group. Sometimes, I enjoy the activities, but in the back of my mind, I wonder if I'm betraying my father's memory by having fun.

Consultant: I hear you, and it’s understandable to feel that way. Balancing joy and grief can be very challenging. Can we explore what thoughts come to mind when you feel that guilt? What do you tell yourself in those moments?

User: I often think that my dad wouldn’t want me to be happy right now, or that I should be more sad. I feel like if I smile or laugh, it’s like I’m forgetting him.

Consultant: It’s really brave of you to express those thoughts, Xiaoya. It sounds like you have a strong belief that being happy means you’re not honoring your father's memory. Can we look at that belief together and see if there might be another way to interpret those feelings?

User: That sounds okay. I just feel like others might think the same way too.

Consultant: It's common to worry about what others might think. But let’s focus on your own feelings. What evidence do you have that enjoying life would mean forgetting your father? What would you say to a friend who felt this way?

User: I guess I’d tell them that it’s okay to feel happy and sad at the same time. But I struggle to apply that to myself.

Consultant: That’s a really insightful perspective! It’s perfectly normal to experience a mix of emotions. How about we challenge those negative thoughts? What if instead of forgetting your father, enjoying activities could honor his memory in a different way?

User: That makes sense. Maybe he would want me to live my life fully?

Consultant: Exactly! Your father likely loved you and wanted you to be happy. Embracing your life can be a way to honor him. How do you feel about that idea?

User: It feels a bit lighter, actually. Like it’s okay to smile again.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiaoya! Now, let’s think about how you can continue to participate in activities while allowing yourself to feel both happiness and sadness. How do you think you could integrate remembering your father into your daily life while still enjoying your interests?

User: Maybe I can set aside some time to reflect on him after the activities. It could help me feel connected while still having fun.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Creating that space for reflection can help you feel balanced. Let’s also explore how you can create some small goals for yourself. What are some things you’d like to achieve in the coming weeks?

User: I’d like to continue with the drama club and maybe help organize an event for the volunteering group. But I feel a bit overwhelmed thinking about it.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed. Let’s break it down into smaller steps. What’s one small action you could take this week that would get you closer to that goal without adding too much pressure?

User: Maybe I can reach out to the drama club leader and ask about how I can help. That feels doable.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent first step! Reaching out is a proactive move, and it won’t take too much on your plate. How does that make you feel?

User: I feel a bit more excited about it. I think I can do that and still allow myself to feel my emotions.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! Remember, it’s about finding that balance. As you move forward, keep practicing self-compassion. Allow yourself to feel what you need to feel in any moment. Is there anything else on your mind that you’d like to discuss today?

User: I think I’m good for now. I appreciate this! I feel more hopeful about everything.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Xiaoya! You’ve made some important insights today. As we wrap up, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed. You’re working on feeling okay with happiness and honoring your father’s memory, while also setting small, achievable goals. Does that feel accurate to you?

User: Yes, that sums it up perfectly.

Consultant: Excellent! You’ve made great progress. I encourage you to keep reflecting and practicing what we talked about. Remember, it’s okay to have both joy and sadness. If you start feeling overwhelmed again, we can always address it in our next session. 

User: Thank you so much. I feel like I have some tools to work with now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of you for taking these steps. Remember, healing is a journey, and you’re not alone. When you’re ready for our next session, I’d love to hear how things have been going for you. Take care, Xiaoya!

User: Thank you! I look forward to it as well.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoya! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better emotionally, but there are still moments of sadness. I sometimes struggle to concentrate in class. I’m trying to keep my focus on my studies, though.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you feel a bit better. Acknowledging those moments of sadness is important. Can you share what specifically helps you stay focused or what distractions you’ve encountered lately?

User: I’ve set small study goals for myself, which sometimes help me feel accomplished. But at times, I find my mind wandering, especially when I think about my dad.

Consultant: Setting small goals is a positive step! It’s understandable that thoughts of your father can be distracting. How does this wandering affect your feelings about your studies?

User: When my mind wanders, it makes me feel guilty for not being able to focus. I feel like I’m letting myself down.

Consultant: I hear that you’re feeling guilty, and it’s quite common to experience mixed emotions while dealing with loss. Let's explore those thoughts. When you find your mind wandering, what specific thoughts come to your mind?

User: I often think, "I should be over this by now," or, "Why can't I just concentrate?" It makes everything seem worse.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite heavy. It sounds like you might be applying pressure to yourself to move on too quickly. What evidence do you have that suggests you should be over this already?

User: I guess there isn’t any real evidence. I just feel like everyone expects me to get back to normal. 

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way when there's social pressure. But your healing process is unique to you. If a friend were in your situation, what would you tell them about their healing timeline?

User: I would tell them not to rush, that it's okay to take their time. 

Consultant: That’s kind advice! Let's flip that and apply it to yourself. What would it be like to allow yourself the same grace that you would offer to a friend?

User: I think it would relieve a lot of pressure. Maybe I should be kinder to myself during this time.

Consultant: Exactly! Being kind to yourself is essential. Now, let’s consider your study goals. What are some small, achievable tasks you could set for yourself in the next week?

User: I could start with reviewing my notes for one hour every day and maybe join a study group.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! They are manageable and can help create structure. How will you hold yourself accountable to these tasks?

User: I could set reminders on my phone and maybe share my goals with a friend. 

Consultant: Sharing your goals is a great strategy! It not only helps with accountability but also allows for support. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel optimistic. Having a plan makes me feel more in control. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As you work on these goals, remember to check in with your emotions. If you notice sadness creeping in, how might you address those feelings?

User: Perhaps I could take short breaks to process my feelings or write in a journal.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy approach. Reflective practices like journaling can help you process emotions and sharpen focus. How does that resonate with you?

User: I think that might help clear my mind. I’ll try to focus on my feelings and find a way to express them.

Consultant: Focusing on your feelings is key! As we prepare to wrap up today, what’s your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think I’ve realized that it’s okay to take my time and be kind to myself. I need to allow myself to grieve while also pursuing my goals.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization, Xiaoya! Remember, it's a balance between allowing yourself to grieve and moving forward. As you continue this journey, what strategies will you keep in mind to maintain your emotional well-being?

User: I’ll remember to be gentle with myself, keep setting small goals, and use journaling as an outlet.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! I’m proud of your progress today. Just know that it’s okay to reach out whenever you feel you need support again. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. It feels good to have a plan and some hope.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoya! Keep moving forward at your own pace, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello Xiao Ya! I'm really glad to see you again today. It's been about 20 days since your father's passing, and I want to check in with you on how you've been feeling. How are you doing with everything?

User: Hello! It’s been a tough time, but I’ve been managing. I have moments of sadness, but I’m trying to stay focused on my studies and my scholarship.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re trying to focus on your studies, especially with the scholarship being a positive boost for you. Can you share a bit more about what’s helped you maintain that focus?

User: Well, I’ve been trying to keep a routine and stay engaged with my friends. They’ve been really supportive, which helps. But sometimes I still feel overwhelmed by everything.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful strategy—sticking to a routine and leaning on supportive friends can really make a difference. When you say you feel overwhelmed, what specifically tends to trigger that feeling for you?

User: It usually happens when I’m alone or when I have time to think too much about my dad. I miss him a lot, and it feels heavy sometimes.

Consultant: Missing someone we’ve lost is completely natural and can be very heavy to carry. How do you usually cope with those feelings when they come up?

User: I try to distract myself with my studies or talk to friends, but it can be hard. Sometimes I just end up feeling sad and unable to concentrate.

Consultant: It’s understandable that balancing those feelings can be challenging. It's important to allow yourself to feel those emotions as they come. Have you noticed any activities or thoughts that help lift your mood?

User: Moments with friends really do help me feel lighter, especially when we go out or just hang out. It reminds me that life goes on.

Consultant: That’s really insightful, Xiao Ya. Engaging with friends can provide that sense of connection and joy. How do you feel when you reflect on those uplifting times? 

User: I feel grateful and a bit hopeful. It reminds me that there are still good things in life, even if I'm dealing with this loss.

Consultant: That hopefulness is a valuable feeling to hold on to. It sounds like you have a strong support system. As you think about your experiences since your father's passing, are there specific thoughts or beliefs you find yourself struggling with? 

User: I sometimes think about whether I could have done something differently or if I should have spent more time with him. It’s hard not to feel guilty.

Consultant: Guilt can be a heavy burden. Let's explore that a bit more—what evidence do you have that supports those thoughts? Would you say those thoughts are based on facts or more assumptions?

User: I guess they are more assumptions. I did spend a lot of time with him, especially recently. But I can’t help but think if I could have done more.

Consultant: It’s very normal to reflect on past situations, especially with loss. However, it's important to consider the positive contributions you made during your time together. If a friend were feeling guilty like you, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably tell them that they can’t blame themselves and that it’s okay to grieve. Everyone does their best in the moment.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re recognizing a compassionate perspective for others, and it’s important to extend that same kindness to yourself. Let’s build on that. What alternative thoughts could you try when those guilty thoughts arise?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that we shared good times and I did my best. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful alternative thought! It’s essential to celebrate the good moments you created together. As we move forward, what strategies can you think of that would help you to reinforce those positive thoughts during tough moments?

User: I could keep a journal, maybe writing down the memories and positive feelings when I think about him. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea. Journaling can be an effective way to process your feelings and to recognize the positive aspects of your relationship with your dad. How do you feel about creating a small action plan to integrate that into your routine?

User: I like that idea! I could set aside a little time each week to reflect and write.

Consultant: Excellent! Setting a dedicated time for reflection can help you feel more in control and keep those positive memories alive. As we summarize our session today, what do you feel was the most significant takeaway for you?

User: I think it’s about being kind to myself and being aware of my thoughts. Finding ways to celebrate my dad’s memory instead of feeling guilty.

Consultant: That’s a profound realization, Xiao Ya. Self-compassion is crucial during times of loss. As you continue to navigate this journey, remember that you have tools in place to help you. How do you feel moving forward into the next weeks?

User: I feel much more equipped to handle my emotions. I’m hopeful I can keep moving forward while honoring my dad.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember that it's okay to still feel whatever comes up, and expressing those feelings is a part of healing. It has been great working with you today, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help and support.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiao Ya. Take care of yourself, and remember to reach out if you need anything. Looking forward to our next meeting!
