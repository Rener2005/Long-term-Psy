Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. Before we start, I want to check in with you—how have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, not great. I've been really down since the job competition. It's been hard to get back into the right mindset at work, and I often feel frustrated and anxious.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like the outcome of the competition has really affected your motivation and overall feelings about work. What has been the most challenging part for you lately?

User: I think it's just the feeling of failure, you know? I used to be a manager, and now I'm just a regular employee. I can’t shake off this disappointment.

Consultant: It sounds very tough to adjust to this change in your role, and feeling disappointed is a completely natural response. Can you tell me more about what specifically has been bothering you about this situation?

User: I feel like I was passed over for the position because my contributions weren’t valued. It's like, why should I even try if it doesn’t matter?

Consultant: That sounds incredibly frustrating. It’s understandable to feel disheartened in a situation where your efforts feel unrecognized. How does this thought affect your motivation to work now?

User: I just don't feel like putting in the effort. I keep thinking about quitting because what's the point?

Consultant: I see. You're feeling a real lack of purpose in your work right now. It might help to delve into these thoughts—what are the beliefs driving your feelings about quitting?

User: I believe that if they didn’t want me in a higher role, then I must not be valuable to them at all. It makes me doubt my abilities.

Consultant: Those beliefs are certainly strong and can create quite a negative cycle for your self-esteem. Can we examine the evidence for this belief? What would you say are some of your strengths or past achievements?

User: I used to lead a team successfully, and I managed several projects. I know I have skills, but it just feels overshadowed by this failure.

Consultant: It's great that you can recognize your past strengths despite the current situation. What if we challenge that belief that your value is solely defined by your current position?

User: I guess I could remind myself that I’ve had successes before, and one setback doesn’t redefine who I am. 

Consultant: Exactly! Let's focus on reconstructing that thought. If you could reframe it positively, how would you describe your value beyond just your job title?

User: Maybe I could see myself as someone who has a lot to offer, regardless of my position. I have experience and skills that could still benefit the team.

Consultant: Yes! That's a fantastic reframe. Now, since we’ve seen how your skills and experience matter, how can you channel that into motivation for your work moving forward?

User: I could set new goals, maybe find projects that interest me more and focus on improving my skills instead of dwelling on what happened.

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive approach. What specific steps could you take to turn your focus towards those new goals?

User: I could talk to my supervisor about taking on new responsibilities or projects that align with my interests.

Consultant: Great idea! Communication can open up new opportunities for you. How does thinking about these next steps make you feel about your situation?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful, like I have something to work towards instead of just feeling stuck.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Focusing on actionable steps can often bring a sense of control back to your situation. As we approach the end of today’s session, what are some key takeaways you have regarding your feelings towards work?

User: I've realized I can redefine my value and that one setback doesn’t mean I’m not good enough. I also can take control by seeking new roles or responsibilities.

Consultant: That's a wonderful realization! Reflecting on that will help you build your confidence. As we conclude, how do you feel about implementing the strategies we discussed today?

User: I feel ready to give it a try! I want to shift my mindset and actively look for ways to engage with my work again.

Consultant: That's an excellent attitude! Remember, it takes time and practice, but you are taking important steps. If things get tough, remember the strengths we've discussed today. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!

User: Thank you! I'll see you next time.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for this session. Before we dive in, can you share how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty low since I didn't get the promotion, and I think it's affecting my relationship with my colleagues. I feel like I'm not valued anymore.

Consultant: I understand, it sounds like that recent experience has really shaken your confidence. Let’s explore what you’ve been thinking and feeling about your role and how it’s affecting you at work. What specific thoughts come to mind when you think about your position now?

User: I keep thinking that I must not be good enough. It seems like everyone is moving forward in their careers except me. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough. Those thoughts can be quite heavy. When you think that you’re not good enough, what kind of feelings does that bring up for you?

User: It makes me feel anxious and frustrated. I sometimes feel like I'm stuck, and I don’t know how to get back to where I was.

Consultant: Feeling stuck can be a very uncomfortable place to be. It seems like there's a strong connection between your thoughts about your abilities and how you're feeling. Have you noticed any specific situations at work that heighten these feelings?

User: Yes, like during team meetings when people share their successes. I feel like I don’t belong anymore, and I dread those moments. I just prefer to stay quiet.

Consultant: It makes sense that those moments would be difficult for you. It can be challenging to hear others’ successes when you’re feeling uncertain about your own. Can you remember any automatic thoughts that cross your mind during those meetings?

User: I usually think things like, “They will see how inadequate I am,” or “I’ll never catch up.” 

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite harsh. Let’s take a moment to consider how much evidence supports those thoughts. Is there any indication that your colleagues think negatively of your contributions?

User: Well, no. In fact, my colleagues have been supportive, but I feel disconnected. It’s like I’m always comparing myself to them.

Consultant: It’s good to hear your colleagues are supportive. It sounds like there might be a disconnect between their perspective and your self-perception. What do you think might change if you adjusted those thoughts to something more balanced about your contributions?

User: I suppose if I acknowledged their support instead of focusing on my shortcomings, it could change how I feel. 

Consultant: Exactly! Acknowledging their support and your strengths can help cultivate a more positive mindset. How do you think you might begin to challenge those automatic thoughts in real-time during meetings?

User: I could remind myself that everyone has ups and downs and that I have my own strengths too.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! It involves recognizing that your experience is part of a bigger picture. What activities or strengths do you believe you can focus on that will help you regain some confidence?

User: I used to enjoy training new employees. I think I could focus more on mentoring them to feel valued again.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful way to reconnect with your role and validate your skills! Mentoring can also renew your sense of purpose. How would you feel about starting that again?

User: I feel excited! It could help me feel more in control and valued. 

Consultant: That excitement is crucial! Let’s explore some small steps you could take to reconnect with mentoring. What’s the first step you could take this week?

User: Maybe I could offer to help a new hire with their onboarding process.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Helping a new hire can also bring fresh perspectives and even boost your confidence. It's also a meaningful contribution. How do you feel about setting that as your goal for this week?

User: I feel good about it! I think it will help me focus on something positive rather than dwelling on my feelings of inadequacy.

Consultant: That's a fantastic approach! As you work on this, remember to check in with those feelings and thoughts that arise. If negative thoughts pop up, reflect on them with the understanding that they may not represent the complete truth about you.

User: I will try to do that. I want to keep this positive momentum going.

Consultant: Absolutely! And as we wrap up today, let's summarize what you’ve gained from this session. What are the key takeaways for you?

User: I’ve realized I need to shift my focus from my perceived failures to the support I have and the value I can still offer. And I have a plan to start mentoring again!

Consultant: That's a wonderful insight! Keeping your focus on your contributions and support system will help in building both confidence and resilience. Remember, it’s normal to feel challenged, but there are ways to navigate those feelings. 

User: Thank you. I feel motivated to try these strategies. I appreciate your guidance!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to hear you feel motivated. Remember, it’s a process, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. If you ever feel overwhelmed, reach out for support again. Good luck with your mentoring this week!

User: Thank you! I look forward to our next session.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're joining me today. To start, I'd love to hear about how you're feeling recently, especially with the new challenges at work. 

User: Hi! Lately, I've been feeling really stressed. I thought I could handle the new responsibilities, but it seems like I can't keep up with everything. I feel so tight and anxious all the time, especially since I lost my managerial position. 

Consultant: It sounds like you've been undergoing a lot of pressure, particularly after the recent changes in your job. It's understandable to feel this way when facing new challenges. Can you share more about what specific aspects of your work are causing you the most stress?

User: Well, I've been struggling to meet deadlines and adapt to the new dynamics of my team. I often worry that I'm not performing well enough, which just adds to my tension. 

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. Struggling with deadlines and team dynamics can be quite challenging. How do those worries affect your daily work and your emotions during that time?

User: When I worry about my performance, I feel overwhelmed and sometimes even avoid certain tasks. I keep thinking that I’m falling behind, which makes me freeze instead of taking action. 

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. It seems like those thoughts and feelings lead to a cycle of avoidance, which ends up increasing your stress. What do you think when you find yourself feeling overwhelmed and wanting to avoid tasks?

User: I often think that I won’t succeed anyway, so why bother? It’s like I keep telling myself I’m not capable enough anymore. 

Consultant: It sounds like there are some very negative thoughts there. Let’s take a moment to challenge those thoughts. Can you think of any evidence countering the belief that you aren’t capable? 

User: Well, I did receive positive feedback from my colleagues about my contributions in past projects. 

Consultant: That’s a great point! It's crucial to recognize your achievements. If a friend were in your situation, what advice would you give them about their feelings of inadequacy? 

User: I would probably tell them to focus on their strengths and take things one step at a time. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful advice! Now, let's explore how you might apply that to your own situation. What small steps could you take to engage with your work more positively and reduce your stress?

User: Maybe I could set smaller, achievable goals each day, instead of overwhelming myself with everything at once. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic strategy! Setting smaller, achievable goals can help you feel more accomplished and reduce the pressure. How do you feel about incorporating that into your routine?

User: I think it would help! I can try setting daily tasks and celebrate small wins along the way. 

Consultant: Celebrating those small wins is so important! It can reinforce a positive mindset. As we continue, let’s discuss some time management techniques that could aid you in handling your workload better. Are you familiar with any time management strategies? 

User: I've heard of techniques like prioritizing tasks and breaking work into chunks, but I haven’t really applied any of them. 

Consultant: Great! Those are excellent strategies. Let's dive deeper into prioritization. Can you think of a way to categorize your tasks based on urgency and importance? 

User: I suppose I could use a simple list distinguishing between urgent tasks and those that can wait. 

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! By prioritizing tasks, you can reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed. Besides managing tasks, it’s also essential to include some relaxation techniques. Have you tried any stress-relief practices in the past? 

User: I’ve attempted deep breathing exercises and a little meditation, but I often forget to do them when I’m busy. 

Consultant: It's easy to forget self-care when we're caught up in our responsibilities. How about scheduling time for these practices as part of your daily routine? 

User: That could work! I could set reminders for myself to take short breaks and do some deep breathing. 

Consultant: Excellent idea! Those small breaks can provide a significant relief. I also want to highlight the importance of building a support network. Are there colleagues or friends you can talk to about what you’re experiencing? 

User: Yes, I have a couple of friends at work who I think would understand. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Having that support can really make a difference. Could you consider reaching out to them more often to share your experiences? 

User: I suppose I could! It would be nice to have someone to talk to about what I'm going through. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Talking about your experiences can help ease some of the burdens you’re feeling. Before we wrap this session up, let’s summarize the strategies you want to implement moving forward. What stands out to you the most? 

User: I want to set smaller, achievable goals each day, prioritize my tasks, practice relaxation techniques, and reach out to friends for support. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! You are making strides toward managing your stress and adapting to these changes. As you continue on this journey, remember to be kind to yourself and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today. I feel a bit lighter already. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You’ve taken important steps today, and I believe in your ability to adapt to these challenges. If you ever feel the need for support again, don’t hesitate to come back. Wishing you all the best on your journey ahead! 

User: Thank you! I will definitely keep that in mind.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you at today's session. It sounds like you've been navigating some changes in your work life. Could you share with me what you’ve been feeling lately?

User: Hi! Yes, I’ve been feeling a mix of emotions. After recently losing my managerial position, I was a bit disheartened, but participating in the training has helped me regain some confidence. I am eager to improve my situation.

Consultant: It's great to hear that the training has positively impacted your confidence. It seems like you're managing to adapt to changes. What specific thoughts or feelings do you have regarding your recent experiences in the workplace?

User: I often think about how I didn’t succeed in getting that promotion. It makes me question my abilities, but on the other hand, I'm also motivated to learn and grow from this situation.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel conflicted—questioning your abilities while also being motivated to improve. What kind of thoughts come to you when you dwell on the promotion that you didn’t get?

User: I find myself thinking that maybe I’m not cut out for leadership roles anymore. I worry I might not have what it takes to advance in my career.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound difficult to cope with. It's common to have doubts after a setback like that. What emotions do those thoughts bring about for you?

User: They make me feel anxious and a bit demoralized. I worry that I’m stuck and won’t be able to progress any further in my career.

Consultant: I hear you. Feeling anxious and demoralized can hinder your ability to see opportunities ahead. Can we try to explore these thoughts a little further? How much evidence do you believe supports the idea that you’re not suited for leadership?

User: When I think about it, there are some successful moments I’ve had in the past, but I just keep focusing on that recent failure.

Consultant: It seems like your mind is leaning towards the negative aspects, which is quite natural. How might you reframe that thought about the promotion into something a bit more constructive?

User: Maybe I could see it as a learning experience rather than just a failure. 

Consultant: That's an excellent perspective! Viewing it as a learning opportunity could open up a different way of thinking about your career. What other experiences or successes can you identify that highlight your capabilities?

User: I’ve successfully led some projects before, and my team has always appreciated my support. I guess I should acknowledge those moments.

Consultant: Absolutely! Those are valuable experiences. Acknowledging your strengths can bolster your self-confidence. How would you feel about setting some short-term goals based on those strengths?

User: That sounds good. I think I could set a goal to take on more project responsibilities. 

Consultant: Great idea! Setting goals can provide you with focus and direction. What specific responsibilities are you considering taking on?

User: I’d like to volunteer for leading a small project team. I think it’ll help me regain my confidence.

Consultant: Leading a project team is a wonderful step forward. What strategies could you implement to ensure you feel supported while taking on this leadership role?

User: I could reach out to colleagues for support and mentorship. Maybe having someone to guide me can help.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Having support from colleagues can make a significant difference. How does the thought of reaching out for mentorship make you feel?

User: It feels reassuring, actually. I think it could strengthen our workplace relationships too.

Consultant: That’s an important insight. Building those connections will not only help you grow professionally but also enhance your overall work satisfaction. What steps can you take to initiate those connections?

User: I could start by asking my previous manager for some advice, and maybe connect with colleagues from the training session.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid approach! By reaching out, you're taking proactive steps to reinforce your professional network. How do you feel about implementing these plans?

User: I feel more optimistic now. Having a plan makes me feel like I’m taking control of my career again.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear you're feeling optimistic! Remember, taking control is a crucial part of this journey. As we move toward the conclusion of our session, let’s reflect on the strategies you’ve identified today. What have you found most valuable?

User: The idea of reframing setbacks and acknowledging my past successes really stood out to me.

Consultant: That's a fantastic takeaway. Embracing your strengths and learning from experiences can guide your path forward. As you encounter challenges, what mindset will you adopt to ensure you stay motivated?

User: I’ll remind myself that setbacks are just part of the learning process. I’ll focus on seeking the support I need and taking actionable steps.

Consultant: That’s a powerful mindset! Implementing these strategies will undoubtedly lead to greater satisfaction in your work. Remember, as you navigate this path, you’re not alone. Is there anything you’d like to discuss or questions you have before we wrap up?

User: I think we’ve covered a lot! I feel ready to take these steps and look forward to our next session.

Consultant: I'm happy to hear that! You've made great progress today, and I believe you're on the right track. Take these strategies with you, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Thank you for coming today!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I guess I’ve been feeling a bit more stable emotionally, especially after connecting with my colleagues more. But I’m still reflecting on my career and how I fit into this new team dynamic.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that your emotional stability has improved and that you’re building those connections. Let’s explore your feelings about your career. What specific thoughts are you having about your role within the team?

User: I’ve been thinking a lot about my past as a manager and how that relates to my current position. Sometimes I feel a bit lost not being in charge anymore, even though I enjoy working with my colleagues.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a mix of nostalgia and a sense of adjustment to your current role. Can you share a specific situation where you felt this way recently?

User: Recently, during a team project, I took a step back to let others lead. I felt a bit uncomfortable, like I should be taking charge, but I also enjoyed contributing without the pressure of being in charge.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. You’ve been in a leadership position before, and adjusting to a different role can be challenging. What were your thoughts while you were contributing to the project as part of the team rather than leading it?

User: I felt useful, but then those thoughts crept in about not being a leader anymore. I sometimes worry if I’m still viewed as capable by my colleagues.

Consultant: Those feelings of insecurity are quite common when transitioning roles. Let’s challenge that thought for a moment. What evidence do you have that your colleagues do not view you as capable?

User: Well, during the project, they welcomed my input and seemed to rely on my previous experience. So, I guess that's a sign they respect what I bring to the table.

Consultant: Absolutely! It seems like your experience is valuable to them. Can we come up with a different perspective? If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about their contributions to the team?

User: I would tell them they’re making important contributions and that it’s okay to adjust their expectations about leadership.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight. It sounds like you have the ability to be supportive of others, even in your own career transition. How can you apply this perspective to yourself moving forward?

User: I think I need to recognize that contributing as a team member doesn’t diminish my capabilities. I can redefine what being effective looks like in my current role.

Consultant: Exactly! Redefining success can be empowering. As we move forward, let’s set some practical goals for enhancing your interpersonal skills within the team. What specific skills do you want to develop?

User: I want to improve my active listening and provide constructive feedback, which I think could help strengthen our team dynamics.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals. Developing active listening can enhance your relationships with your colleagues. How about we practice some role-playing scenarios where you can apply these skills?

User: That sounds helpful! I can see how practicing might build my confidence in these areas.

Consultant: Great! Let's start with a scenario where a colleague needs feedback on their work. Imagine they come to you for your thoughts. What would you say initially to create a supportive environment?

User: I would start by asking them how they feel about their work before I offer my thoughts.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach! By asking how they feel, you’re showing empathy and creating space for their input. How do you think that would make them feel?

User: I think they would feel more valued and open to listening to my feedback.

Consultant: Exactly! This creates a positive and collaborative atmosphere. Let’s continue with this scenario—what constructive feedback might you give them?

User: I would mention the strengths of their work first, then suggest a few areas where they could improve, along with my reasons.

Consultant: That’s a balanced approach! Starting with strengths can build rapport and make the feedback more receptive. How do you feel about practicing this role-play?

User: I feel excited but also a bit nervous, to be honest. But I think it’s a good step to take.

Consultant: It's perfectly natural to feel nervous! It shows that you care. Remember, practice is key to building confidence. Let’s simulate this role-play, and I’ll act as your colleague.

User: Okay! I’m ready to give it a try.

Consultant: Perfect! So, I come to you now. Let’s start the role play. “Hey, I’ve been working on this project, and I’d love to hear your thoughts on it.”

User: I appreciate you coming to me! How do you feel about the project so far?

Consultant: I feel a bit unsure, honestly. I’m not sure if I’m on the right track. 

User: It sounds like you might have some concerns. I really value your effort and have seen some great aspects in your work. What areas do you feel less confident about?

Consultant: Well, I’m not sure if my approach aligns with what the team expects.

Consultant: That’s a great start! You’re showing empathy and support. Now, let’s discuss further. How do you think it felt for me to have you ask those questions?

User: I guess it might have made you feel heard and understood. 

Consultant: Exactly! You did really well in that role-play. This practice can significantly enhance your interpersonal skills. How do you feel about these exercises so far?

User: I feel more optimistic about improving my skills! Practicing really helps me feel more prepared.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, let’s review what you’ve learned. What changes will you implement in your interactions with your colleagues moving forward?

User: I plan to apply active listening and focus on providing positive, constructive feedback. I also want to keep redefining my sense of success in this role.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! You’ve made great strides today. Remember, these skills will not only benefit you but also your team. I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. 

User: Thank you! I feel more equipped to handle my role. I appreciate your guidance and support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. I look forward to our next session. Take care!

User: See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling quite good, actually. I’ve taken some time to reflect on my career path, and I’m starting to feel more positive about my future.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re making progress in evaluating your career direction. Can you share a bit more about the insights you've gained during this reflection?

User: Sure! I realized that while I was disappointed about not getting the promotion, it was also an opportunity for me to step back and think about what I really want from my career. I’ve started to outline some goals and what steps I need to take to achieve them.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve turned a setback into a stepping stone! What specific goals have you set for yourself moving forward?

User: I want to develop my skills further, possibly take some additional courses to enhance my knowledge in areas that interest me, like financial analysis. I also want to network more with colleagues to learn from them and understand what opportunities are available.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! Skill development and networking can indeed open many doors. How do you feel about taking these steps? Do you have any concerns?

User: I feel excited about it, but I’m also a bit anxious. What if I put in the effort but don’t see the results I hope for? It’s hard not to think about past disappointments.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious about potential outcomes, especially after facing disappointment. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit further. What specific evidence do you have that taking these steps might not yield positive results?

User: I guess I don’t really have concrete evidence. I just keep worrying that I might fail again. I think it’s just my fear talking.

Consultant: Acknowledging that fear is a significant first step. It seems that your fear of failure is influencing your perception of the future. Can you think of a time when you took a risk and achieved a positive outcome?

User: Yes, when I initially took the manager role years ago, I was really nervous about it, but it turned out to be a great experience for me.

Consultant: Exactly! That experience shows that you can rise to the occasion when faced with challenges. What if we reframe your current situation? Instead of thinking about potential failure, could you look at these new goals as opportunities for growth and learning, regardless of the outcomes?

User: That makes sense. I suppose I could focus on the learning aspect rather than just the results. It’s just hard to shift my mindset completely.

Consultant: It is challenging, but practicing this reframing can help over time. Let's create a plan for how you can gradually shift your focus towards learning. What small steps can you take to start viewing your goals this way?

User: I could set smaller, achievable milestones for myself—maybe starting with one course and a few networking events to attend in the coming months. That way, I can celebrate the small wins along the way!

Consultant: Absolutely! Setting smaller milestones is a great strategy. Celebrating those wins can reinforce a positive mindset. How do you feel about this new plan?

User: I feel hopeful! It makes it less overwhelming to think about the future in smaller parts rather than one big goal.

Consultant: That's fantastic! Keeping your focus on manageable goals can make a significant difference. As we work together, remember to acknowledge and celebrate even the small achievements. Is there anything else you would like us to discuss regarding your career or personal growth plans?

User: I think I’ve covered most of what’s on my mind. I feel like I have a clearer direction now, which is reassuring.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we summarize our session today, can you identify what you've learned about yourself and your approach to your career?

User: I’ve learned that I’m capable of reflecting and setting realistic goals. I also need to work on managing my fears of failure by focusing on learning rather than just outcomes.

Consultant: Those are valuable insights! Learning to manage those fears will serve you well in your journey. As we wrap up today’s session, what strategies do you think will help you maintain this positive perspective moving forward?

User: I think regularly revisiting my goals and reflecting on my progress could help. Plus, talking to supportive colleagues can keep me motivated.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. I believe you’re on the right track, and I’m here to support you whenever needed. Remember, the journey is as important as the destination. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: I really appreciate that. Thank you for your support and guidance throughout this process.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Today marks a positive step forward for you. Best of luck, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!

User: Thank you! I’ll keep working on my plan and see you next time.
