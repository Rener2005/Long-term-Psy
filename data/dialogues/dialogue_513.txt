Consultant: Hello, Qianqian! I'm glad you're here for our session today. I'd like to start by checking in on how you've been feeling recently. Can you share a bit about what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious and overwhelmed with schoolwork. My dad is pushing me hard to perform well, and I just can't seem to handle the pressure anymore.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure from your studies and your father's expectations, which is understandably overwhelming. Can you tell me more about how this pressure affects you on a daily basis?

User: Well, during classes, I can't focus anymore. I just think about how I might disappoint my dad if I don’t get good grades. Sometimes, I feel so anxious that I don’t even want to go to school.

Consultant: That’s really tough, Qianqian. It seems like the fear of disappointing your father is creating an intense level of anxiety for you. What thoughts come to your mind when you think about your dad's expectations?

User: I keep thinking that he won't love me if I don't do well academically. It's like I have to prove myself all the time.

Consultant: That’s a heavy burden to carry for someone so young. It sounds like you feel that your worth is linked to your academic performance. Can we explore how you feel when you have these thoughts about your dad’s love?

User: I feel really sad and worthless. It’s like no matter what I do, I can never be good enough. Sometimes I just want to escape everything.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Qianqian. Feeling sad and worthless can be incredibly painful. Let's look at how these thoughts affect your daily emotions. When do you typically feel these feelings the most?

User: I feel it most during tests or when I get my grades back. It's like the moment I open my report card, my heart races, and I feel sick to my stomach.

Consultant: That sounds very distressing. It seems like the pressure to perform well really escalates your anxiety during those times. If we could think of those moments as situations you can prepare for emotionally, what do you think might help you feel a bit calmer?

User: Maybe if I could talk to my dad about how his pressure makes me feel? I don't know how to bring it up, though. I feel like he wouldn't understand.

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry about that. How about we role-play this conversation? We can practice expressing how you feel in a way that might help him understand better. Would you like to try that?

User: Yes, that might help! I’d like to know how to start.

Consultant: Great! Let’s begin by saying something like, "Dad, I feel stressed because I really want to do well in school, but sometimes it feels overwhelming." How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds okay. I think I could say that, but I’m still scared he might react badly.

Consultant: Fear of rejection can be tough to cope with. Let's explore this fear a bit more. What do you think might happen if your dad doesn’t respond the way you hope?

User: I guess I worry he might just push me harder or think I’m not trying enough. That's what usually happens.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, but let's consider the alternative. What if he actually listens and tries to understand your feelings? What would that mean for you?

User: That would be nice. It might make me feel less alone in this. But still, I’m not sure he’ll understand.

Consultant: It's okay to have those doubts. Remember, you are opening up and trying to communicate your emotions, which is already a step towards better understanding. I believe he would appreciate your honesty. What other ways can you express your emotions safely?

User: I often write in my journal, but sometimes I just feel so bottled up, like it’s not enough.

Consultant: Writing is a powerful tool. How about combining that with talking to someone you trust? Perhaps sharing your feelings with a friend or another family member could also help you feel more supported?

User: That might help. I do have a friend I can talk to, but I usually hold back. 

Consultant: It sounds like there’s some fear in sharing your feelings, which is completely valid. Would it help if we brainstorm some ways to ease into that conversation with your friend?

User: Yes, maybe if I just started with something small, like how stressed I am, that could be easier.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Starting small often makes it easier to open up. Remember, you’re not alone in facing these feelings, and it’s okay to seek support from those you trust. 

User: Thanks for that advice. It feels good to think about talking to someone.

Consultant: You're welcome! Gaining support from others can be really validating. How do you feel about your ability to handle these upcoming tests now that we’ve talked about these strategies?

User: I feel a little more hopeful. But I still worry about the grades.

Consultant: That's completely understandable, and it’s good to recognize these worries. Since we’ve discussed ways to express your emotions and prepare for the tests, how about we set a goal for how you’ll approach them this week?

User: I guess my goal could be to just try my best and remember it’s okay if I don’t get perfect scores.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, Qianqian! Focusing on your effort rather than just the outcome can help ease that pressure. What steps can you take to reinforce this mindset?

User: Maybe I can write that down and read it before my tests to remind myself.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Keeping reminders of your goals can really help you stay focused. Before we wrap up today, let's reflect on what we’ve covered. What do you think has been the most helpful thing we’ve talked about?

User: I think practicing talking to my dad and my friend about my feelings has been really helpful. I feel more prepared to try that.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You’ve taken important steps toward expressing your feelings and setting healthier boundaries. Remember, it’s a process, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. 

User: Thanks so much! I really appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Qianqian. I’m glad I could assist you. Remember, it’s okay to seek help whenever you need it, and I’m here for you. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Qianqian! I'm glad to see you today. Before we start, I want to check in on how you've been feeling since our last session. What's been on your mind lately?

User: Hi! I've been really anxious about the recent mid-term exam. I'm so worried about my grades. I dread the thought of having to show my exam paper to my dad for his signature.

Consultant: I can see how that's weighing heavily on you. It sounds like the pressure from the exam is making you feel quite anxious, especially when it comes to sharing your performance with your dad. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about showing him the exam?

User: I keep thinking that if I don’t do well, he’ll be disappointed in me. I don’t want to let him down or have him think I'm not trying hard enough.

Consultant: That's a very understandable concern. It seems like you really value your father's opinion, and the fear of disappointing him adds to your anxiety. What emotions do you feel when those thoughts come up?

User: I feel really nervous and kind of upset. It makes me want to avoid the whole situation altogether. 

Consultant: It sounds like avoiding the situation feels like a way to protect yourself from those uncomfortable emotions. Let's explore that a bit more. When you think about avoiding the conversation with your dad, what do you imagine might happen if you do show him your exam, regardless of the score?

User: I guess if I do show him, he might be disappointed, but he could also be understanding. I just don’t know how he would react if the result isn't great.

Consultant: You're right—he could respond in different ways. It sounds like there's a mix of fear and uncertainty. What would you say are the possible benefits of showing him, even if the grade isn't what you hoped for?

User: Maybe he could help me improve for next time? Or we could talk about it together? 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a very constructive way to think about it—he could offer support or guidance. It may be helpful to remind yourself that learning and growing often involves facing setbacks. How does that idea sit with you?

User: It makes sense, but I still feel anxious about it. I just wish I could feel more confident about my studies.

Consultant: Building confidence takes time, and it's natural to feel uncertain. Let's focus on how you can gradually build that confidence. What strategies do you think might help you prepare better in the future so you feel more at ease with your studies?

User: I guess I could start organizing my study time better. Right now, I just cram everything in, which panics me.

Consultant: Organizing your study time is a fantastic idea! We can work together on creating a study plan that feels manageable. How would you feel about setting specific times to study different subjects throughout the week?

User: That sounds helpful! It might make things easier and less stressful.

Consultant: Great! It's all about finding a rhythm that works for you. While we think about structuring your study time, let’s also incorporate some relaxation techniques to use when you start feeling anxious. Have you tried any techniques so far, like deep breathing or visualization?

User: I haven't really tried anything like that. I mostly just feel overwhelmed and don’t know where to start.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Let’s try a simple deep breathing exercise together right now. Taking a few deep breaths can help calm your mind. Ready? 

User: Okay, I’ll give it a try.

Consultant: Good! Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four... hold for a moment... and now exhale slowly through your mouth. Let’s do that a couple more times together. 

User: That actually feels nice. I can feel a bit more relaxed. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Practicing this technique regularly can help create a more calm state of mind. How do you think you might incorporate this into your routine, especially when exams are coming up?

User: I could try doing it before I start studying or whenever I begin feeling anxious. 

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! It will give you a little moment to reset before diving into your work. Now, as we wrap up our session, let’s reflect on what we’ve talked about today. What do you feel is your biggest takeaway from this discussion?

User: I think realizing that I can organize my studies and talk to my dad without fearing disappointment is really important. 

Consultant: Exactly! You've recognized some very valuable perspectives today. Remember that you're not alone in feeling anxious, and there are ways to navigate these emotions. Do you feel more equipped to face your exam situation now?

User: Yes, I feel a bit better about it. I just hope I can keep this mindset going.

Consultant: You can absolutely do that! Practice what we discussed, and remind yourself that it's okay to face challenges. In our next session, we can talk about how things went and any new strategies you might want to try. Does that sound good?

User: Yes, that sounds great! Thank you for your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Qianqian! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress. Remember, you can always reach out if you need more assistance before our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Qianqian! I'm glad to see you for today's session. I understand you've been dealing with some anxiety regarding your recent science test results. Would you like to share more about how you've been feeling?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling really down about my performance. No matter how much I study, it seems like I just can't get it right, and it makes me doubt my abilities.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-doubt and frustration. It's completely understandable to feel that way when results don't reflect your efforts. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about your test results?

User: I keep thinking that maybe I'm just not smart enough, or that I'll never be good at science. It's really discouraging.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very heavy to carry. Let's explore them a bit. When you think you're "not smart enough," how does that make you feel? And do you ever challenge that thought?

User: I feel really defeated and anxious. It's hard to challenge that thought because I feel like it's true sometimes.

Consultant: It can be tough, especially when emotions are strong. However, it might help to investigate this belief. What evidence do you have that you're not smart enough in science? Have there been any successes, no matter how small?

User: Well, I did manage to get a decent score on my last quiz, and my teacher said I have potential. But it feels like that doesn't matter when I fail the test.

Consultant: That's great information! Acknowledging that you have had successes, like your quiz score, is important. It's not uncommon to focus on perceived failures instead. Let's try to reframe this. If a friend came to you with similar feelings, what would you tell them?

User: I guess I would remind them of the things they did well and encourage them not to give up. 

Consultant: Exactly! You already possess the tools to support others. Now, it's time to apply that same compassion to yourself. How about starting a journal to record your small successes and things you do well in your studies? 

User: That sounds like a good idea. I haven't thought about keeping a journal before. 

Consultant: I think it could be beneficial for you. Reflecting on positive moments can help shift your focus away from negativity. Do you have any specific goals you’d like to set for your next study session?

User: Maybe I can aim to complete a certain number of practice problems and not worry too much about getting everything perfect.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Setting manageable goals like that can diminish the pressure. How do you think it would feel to focus on progress rather than perfection?

User: It might feel less stressful and make it easier to study.

Consultant: Absolutely! It can create more room for growth and learning. Let’s also talk about a specific activity you enjoy or found relaxing. Any ideas on how you might incorporate those into your study routine?

User: I love singing, but I've had to skip choir practice lately. Maybe I could use singing as a break after studying.

Consultant: That sounds delightful! Using singing as a reward is a great way to uplift your mood after studying. Taking breaks for activities you enjoy can really improve your motivation. How might you approach your father about wanting to balance your schoolwork with choir practice?

User: I’m not sure. He often wants me to focus only on studies. 

Consultant: I understand that can be challenging. It might help to express how singing makes you feel and how important it is for your well-being. You could share that it helps you recharge and return to your studies with a calm mind. What do you think about that approach?

User: I think that could work. I could explain that it's important to me, and I believe it could help my studying.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive conversation to have! Remember, it's about finding balance. How do you feel about our discussion today? 

User: I've felt more encouraged. I like the idea of focusing on my successes and talking to my dad. Thank you!

Consultant: I'm happy to hear that! It's great that you're feeling more encouraged. As we wrap up, what will be your first step after this session?

User: I’ll start my journal and maybe talk to my dad this weekend. 

Consultant: Those are excellent goals. I believe you can manage both your studies and your passions. Just remember to be kind to yourself along the way. If you need any more support, I'm here for you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate it. 

Consultant: You're welcome, Qianqian! I’m looking forward to hearing how things go in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Qianqian! I'm glad to see you today. I remember last time we talked about how losing the opportunity to join the choir has made you feel quite down. Can you share how you've been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I still feel a bit sad about it. I really miss singing and the energy of the choir. It was a big part of my routine, and now I feel kind of lost without it.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel lost when something important is taken away. Singing in a choir can be a powerful way to express yourself and connect with your emotions. Have you thought about any new activities that might help fill that gap?

User: Not really. I'm not sure what else I would enjoy as much as singing. I feel like I'm running out of options.

Consultant: Let's explore that together. Sometimes we can overlook activities that might bring us joy. What other hobbies or interests have you enjoyed in the past, even if they weren't as prominent as singing?

User: I used to like drawing a little, but I haven't done it in a while. I guess I could try that again, but it just doesn't feel the same.

Consultant: Drawing can be a wonderful outlet too. It might help you express yourself and cope with your feelings in a different way. Can you tell me about a time when drawing brought you joy?

User: There was a time in elementary school when I painted a picture for an art competition. I felt really proud of it. My teacher really liked it, and I remember feeling happy when I was working on it.

Consultant: That sounds like a great experience! It seems like drawing can evoke positive feelings for you. Would you be open to giving it another shot, maybe setting aside some time each week to express yourself creatively?

User: I suppose so. I could try drawing again. It might help. But I still feel frustrated about my dad not letting me sing.

Consultant: Those feelings of frustration are valid. It’s important to acknowledge both your interest in singing and the potential new avenues for expression like drawing. Have you had a chance to talk to your dad about how losing the choir has impacted you?

User: Not really. I don't think he understands how much it means to me. I just feel like he doesn’t care about my feelings.

Consultant: It sounds like there's a bit of disconnect in understanding each other's feelings. How about we think of ways you could communicate your feelings to your dad in a more effective way? What would you want him to know?

User: I want him to know that singing was something I really loved, and that I feel sad without it. But I'm not sure how to say it without him getting mad.

Consultant: It’s a strong desire to communicate your feelings. We can practice framing your thoughts in a way that emphasizes your emotions rather than coming across as confrontational. Maybe starting with “I feel...” could be helpful. Would you like to try that together?

User: Yeah, I can try that. Like, “I feel sad about not singing”? 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a great start. You could also express what singing meant to you. How about putting a few sentences together about how important the choir was and how you’re feeling now without it? 

User: Okay. “Dad, I feel sad about not being in the choir anymore because singing is really important to me and helps me feel good.” I think I could say something like that.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful way to express yourself, Qianqian! It’s honest and heartfelt. How does it feel to practice sharing that with your dad?

User: It feels a bit easier now that I’ve written it down. I really hope he understands.

Consultant: I hope so too. It’s a brave step to share your feelings. Remember, it’s also okay to take baby steps in these conversations. How do you feel about incorporating drawing into your week while you work on this communication with your dad?

User: I think that could help. Drawing might keep me occupied while I figure things out. 

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan! Engaging in drawing can also be a wonderful way to process your feelings. Can we set a small goal for how many times you want to draw this week?

User: Maybe I can set aside time to draw three times this week? 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Making time for yourself is important. How do you plan to fit that into your schedule?

User: I can draw after school, maybe for half an hour. That seems doable.

Consultant: Great! Setting aside that time for yourself is a lovely effort towards feeling better. As you draw and also prepare for that talk with your dad, how do you feel your mood is changing?

User: I think I’m starting to feel a little more hopeful. It helps to have a plan. 

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that! Seeing a path forward can bring hope. Remember, you’re taking positive steps by exploring new activities and communicating your needs. What other feelings do you have about balancing your emotions during this time?

User: I still feel unsure about my studies, though. Sometimes I think I'm not as good as others.

Consultant: It’s not uncommon to feel uncertain, especially in a new environment. What if we looked at your studies in tandem with your creative pursuits? How can you draw on your experiences in drawing or singing to aid your learning?

User: I could think of studying like I’m practicing for a performance, maybe approaching it with the same enthusiasm as I do with singing.

Consultant: That’s an excellent perspective! Viewing your studies as a performance can inject some excitement into them. Would you be willing to try that approach this week?

User: Yes, I think that could make studying feel less boring! I’ll try to be more enthusiastic about it.

Consultant: Wonderful! It seems like you’re integrating a lot of positive strategies. As we prepare to wrap up our session, could we review how you plan to move forward with drawing, communicating with your dad, and your studies?

User: Sure! I will draw three times this week, talk to my dad about how I feel regarding the choir, and approach my studies like a performance.

Consultant: That sounds like a comprehensive plan, Qianqian. Remember, it’s all about taking small steps and recognizing your achievements along the way. If challenges come up, we'll tackle them together. 

User: Thank you! I feel more confident about everything now.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! You've made significant progress today. Remember, I believe in you, and you can always return whenever you need guidance. Take care until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Qianqian! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I feel a bit better since I've been reflecting on that class activity we organized. It was nice to contribute to the group, but I still doubt my learning abilities.

Consultant: It's great to hear that reflecting on the activity has had a positive impact! Could you share more about what aspects of that experience brought you joy or a sense of accomplishment?

User: I enjoyed planning the event and seeing everyone work together. It felt good to lead and see the project come to life, but I still worry that I won't do well in my studies.

Consultant: You demonstrated leadership and teamwork, which are wonderful skills! Let's explore those feelings of doubt regarding your studies. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about your learning abilities?

User: I often think that I'm not as smart as my classmates. Sometimes I feel like I struggle to keep up with them, especially in subjects like math.

Consultant: It sounds like you're comparing yourself to others, which can be discouraging. What kind of thoughts do you notice when you struggle in math or other subjects?

User: I usually tell myself that I'm going to fail or that I should just give up. It makes me anxious about even trying.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It's common to have those negative thoughts, but we can work on challenging them together. How true do you think those thoughts are? Is there evidence that supports or contradicts them?

User: Well, I do manage to do well on some tests, but I forget about those moments and only think of my mistakes.

Consultant: That's insightful, Qianqian! It seems like you have had successes that you might be overlooking. Let's try to reframe your thinking. Instead of focusing only on mistakes, can you remember a time when you succeeded in a challenging subject?

User: I did well on our last science project. I worked hard and got good feedback from my teacher.

Consultant: Excellent! That shows you're capable of succeeding. How can we take that experience and use it to build your confidence in your studies, especially in math?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that I have succeeded before and try to see my mistakes as learning opportunities instead of just failures.

Consultant: Absolutely! Viewing mistakes as opportunities to learn is a powerful shift in mindset. What strategies do you think could help you focus more on this positive perspective in the future?

User: I could keep a journal to note down my successes and what I learn from my mistakes. That way, I can look back and remember my accomplishments.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Journaling can help reinforce your positive experiences. Besides that, are there any specific study strategies you'd like to develop for your math work?

User: I think I could benefit from practicing with a friend or writing out the steps to solve problems clearly.

Consultant: Both of those strategies sound helpful! Collaborating with a friend can make studying more enjoyable, and writing out steps will provide clarity. How do you feel about implementing these strategies into your routine?

User: I feel hopeful about it! It sounds like a good way to ease my stress and maybe even make studying more fun.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let's take a moment to reflect on the progress you've made. You've recognized your strengths in team settings and are shifting how you view challenges in your studies. That's significant!

User: It feels good to notice these changes. I can see how my team experience can boost my confidence in school.

Consultant: Definitely! Remember to carry that sense of achievement with you. As we wrap up today, what are some ways you can maintain this positive momentum moving forward?

User: I can set small goals in my studies and celebrate when I reach them, just like we did with the class activity.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Celebrating small victories can reinforce your sense of accomplishment. Before we conclude, how do you feel about returning for more sessions to continue your progress?

User: I would like that. I want to keep working on my mindset and feel more confident overall.

Consultant: I'm really looking forward to our future sessions, Qianqian. You've shown great insight today, and I believe you have a bright path ahead. Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and I'm here to support you!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and guidance. It really makes me feel understood.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care and keep reflecting on your achievements. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Qianqian! It's great to see you again. I'm looking forward to our session today. How have you been feeling since our last talk?

User: Hi! I've been doing well, actually. I've had some good conversations with my parents during the holidays. I feel less stressed about family and school now. I’m hopeful about the future.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Improving communication with your parents can really ease stress. Can you share more about what specifically has impacted your feelings positively?

User: Sure! We talked about my school subjects and my interests, and they supported my thoughts about wanting to focus more on my studies. It’s nice to feel heard.

Consultant: Feeling heard is very important. I'm glad your parents are supportive. How do you feel about your studies now? Any particular subjects that excite you?

User: I find my science subjects really interesting, especially biology. I enjoy learning about how living things work. But I sometimes worry about whether I'll really succeed in that area.

Consultant: It's great that you have a passion for biology! It's understandable to have worries about success. Let's explore what success means to you in this context. What are your thoughts on that?

User: I guess success to me means doing well on tests and understanding the material. I want to be able to discuss topics with my teachers confidently.

Consultant: That’s a clear goal! Achieving understanding and confidence in discussing biology can be very rewarding. What specific actions do you think you could take to help reach that goal?

User: I could start by studying a little every day and asking questions in class. I also think forming a study group with friends might help.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Daily study can build your understanding gradually, and a study group could provide support and accountability. What would you feel is a manageable first step you could take this week?

User: I could try to set aside about 30 minutes each day for biology. And I'll reach out to my friends to see if they want to form a study group.

Consultant: That sounds like a great action plan! Setting aside 30 minutes each day is very achievable. How do you feel about starting this soon? 

User: I feel good about it! It seems doable, and I'm excited to involve my friends.

Consultant: Fantastic! Engaging with friends can make studying more enjoyable. Now, besides academics, let’s touch on any other areas where you might like to set goals. Are there hobbies or future career interests that excite you?

User: I’ve been thinking about the possibility of a career in biology, maybe something like being a researcher or a doctor. I love the idea of exploring and discovering new things.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful aspiration! Research and medicine can be very fulfilling fields. What are some small steps you could take now to explore these options further?

User: Maybe I could read more books about biology, attend science-related events, or even talk to professionals in those fields to learn more about what they do.

Consultant: Those are excellent proactive steps. Exploring through reading and connecting with professionals can give you valuable insights. Is there anything you feel might hold you back from pursuing these interests?

User: Sometimes I worry that if I don’t get top grades, it might affect my chances. I can be quite hard on myself about grades.

Consultant: It’s common to feel pressure about grades, especially when you have ambitions. Let’s challenge that thought a bit—what evidence do you have that only top grades can lead to success in biology or a related career?

User: I guess I hear a lot about grades being important, but I’ve also seen people succeed in different ways, like through passion and hard work.

Consultant: Exactly! While grades do matter, passion and hard work are equally important. They can open doors to opportunities where grades alone might not. What could help you focus on enjoying your subjects rather than just the grades?

User: I could remind myself to appreciate the learning process and not just the outcomes. Maybe I could set enjoyable learning goals instead.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Setting learning goals can shift your focus from pressure to enjoyment. What’s a fun, learning-oriented goal you could set for yourself this month?

User: I’d like to explore a biology topic that interests me, like ecosystems, and maybe do a little project or presentation on it.

Consultant: I love that idea! Putting together a project can be both educational and fun. It sounds like a great way to deepen your understanding and spark more interest. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel really excited about it! It sounds like a fun way to learn.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Qianqian! I believe this project will enhance your learning experience. As we wrap up today’s session, let's summarize your goals one more time. 

User: Sure! I want to study biology for 30 minutes each day, form a study group, explore future career options by reading and networking, and work on a project about ecosystems.

Consultant: Those sound like great goals! You’ve made significant progress in setting a path for your future today. Remember, it's about enjoying your journey and being kind to yourself along the way. How do you feel about our time together today?

User: I feel really good! I have a clearer idea of what I want to do and how to get there. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m proud of your progress, and I look forward to hearing about how your plans unfold. Remember, I’m here whenever you need support. Take care, Qianqian!

User: Thank you! I’ll see you next time!
