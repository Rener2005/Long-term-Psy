Consultant: Hello, Xiao Jun! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling about everything that's been happening recently?

User: Hi. I still feel really angry about what happened with my classmates. They keep making fun of my height, and I just can't stand it. I don't know how to deal with them.

Consultant: It sounds like you've been holding onto a lot of anger, and the teasing about your height has really affected you. Can you tell me more about the situations that led to these feelings?

User: Well, whenever they say something, I feel this rage building up inside me. I want to shout at them or hit them, but I know that's not right. I just feel trapped.

Consultant: That's understandable, Xiao Jun. It's common to have strong emotions in situations like that. Let’s explore what those thoughts are when your classmates tease you. What goes through your mind at that moment?

User: I think they're just being stupid and mean, and I get really mad because I feel like I should fight back. I feel weak when I don't.

Consultant: I hear you. Feeling weak can be really frustrating, especially when you want to stand up for yourself. Let’s discuss how that anger feels in your body when it happens. Do you notice any physical signs?

User: Yeah, my heart races and I feel tense all over. I just want to explode.

Consultant: That’s an important insight. The physical sensations can often signal that we need to address our emotions. How do you react after feeling that way? Does it change your behavior towards your classmates?

User: Sometimes I yell at them, and sometimes I just hold it all inside. But I don’t think yelling helps.

Consultant: It seems like holding things in can create a lot of pressure for you. Have you been able to express your feelings to anyone else—like a friend or family member?

User: Not really. I don't want to burden anyone with my problems.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel that way, but sharing your feelings can sometimes lift the weight off your shoulders. Would you be open to trying some techniques today to help you express what you’re feeling more effectively?

User: I think I’d like that. But what should I do? 

Consultant: Great! One technique we can use is role-playing. We can act out a situation where your classmates tease you, and we’ll practice different ways to respond. Does that sound good?

User: Yes, I’d like to see how that works.

Consultant: Excellent! Imagine a scenario where one of your classmates makes a comment about your height. How would you feel in that moment?

User: I’d probably feel really angry and want to shout. 

Consultant: That's a natural reaction. Now, let’s try an approach where instead of shouting, you express how their comment makes you feel. How could you say that to them?

User: Maybe I could say, "That's not nice, and it really hurts my feelings?"

Consultant: That’s a great start! You’re expressing your feelings without being aggressive. How does it feel to think about saying that instead of yelling?

User: It feels a bit better, I guess. Like, I’d have some control.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re taking control of your feelings in that moment. If you do that, how might it change the situation with your classmates?

User: They might stop teasing me if I stand up for myself calmly.

Consultant: Yes, you're right! And even if they don’t stop, you’ll be taking a positive step for yourself. Let’s practice this some more. Picture your classmate making a comment again. Try out your new response.

User: Okay… "That’s not nice, and it really hurts my feelings."

Consultant: Very well done! How do you feel after saying that?

User: I feel a bit bold saying it. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful feeling, Xiao Jun! Remember, it’s okay to feel discomfort in these situations, but you are learning to manage it. Do you have any questions about what we talked about today?

User: Not really. I think I understand how to handle it better.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, let's reflect on some key takeaways. How can you practice expressing your feelings in future situations?

User: I can try saying how I feel instead of just getting angry. 

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve made great progress today, Xiao Jun. Remember, practicing these skills will take time, but you’re on the right path. If you feel overwhelmed, it's okay to reach out. 

User: Thanks, that really helps. I feel a little lighter now. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! It’s been good working with you today. I believe in your ability to handle these challenges. If you ever feel the need for more support, I'm here for you. Take care!

User: Thank you! I will. Goodbye!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaojun! I'm glad you could make it today. Let's start by discussing how you've been feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been really upset. We had a group project in class, and there were disagreements. I just lost control, and it was embarrassing.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like that situation was really tough for you. Can you tell me more about what happened during the project? What specifically upset you?

User: Well, some of my classmates didn’t agree with my ideas. I felt they didn’t respect my opinion, and that made me really angry.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Feeling disrespected can trigger strong emotions like anger. In those moments, what thoughts were running through your mind?

User: I was thinking that they were just being rude and didn’t care about my perspective at all. It felt like they were just ignoring me.

Consultant: Those thoughts can indeed intensify your feelings of frustration. It's important to recognize when these thoughts arise. Have you noticed when you start to feel this way, both physically and emotionally?

User: Yeah, my heart races, and I get really hot. I feel like I need to yell or shut everyone out.

Consultant: Those physical symptoms can be your body’s way of signaling that you're becoming overwhelmed. It’s great that you can identify them. What would you like to happen instead when you begin to feel those signs of anger?

User: I want to stay calm and not let it get escalated. But it’s hard when I’m in the moment.

Consultant: Staying calm can be challenging. Let’s think about some strategies together that could help you manage your emotions when you feel that anger building up. How does that sound?

User: That would be good. I really want to try anything that could help.

Consultant: A great start is to practice some relaxation techniques. For instance, when you notice that your heart is racing, try taking a deep breath. Inhale slowly through your nose, hold it, and then exhale through your mouth. Can you try that now?

User: *takes a deep breath* Okay, I did it. It feels a bit better, but I still feel nervous about the next situation like that.

Consultant: That’s a good first step! Practicing this can help you feel more equipped to handle those challenging moments. As we work together, I’ll help you build a toolbox of techniques you can use when disagreements arise. What’s something else that makes you nervous about those moments?

User: I guess I worry about what others will think of me if I lose control again.

Consultant: It’s natural to be concerned about how others perceive you, especially in social situations. Remember, everyone has moments where they lose their cool; it's part of being human. If you find yourself in that situation again, how might you reframe the way you view that?

User: I could think that it’s okay to feel upset but that I can also deal with it better next time.

Consultant: Exactly! Acknowledging your feelings without judging yourself can be powerful. When you remind yourself that it's okay to feel upset, you're less likely to spiral into anger. What do you think you can tell yourself next time you feel that pressure building?

User: Maybe I can say it's okay, and I’ll handle this without yelling.

Consultant: That sounds like a great mantra! It’s a positive reminder to keep yourself grounded. Alongside that, can you think of any activities that help relax you outside of classroom conflicts?

User: I like drawing, but I haven’t done it much lately. It usually calms me down.

Consultant: Drawing can be a fantastic outlet for emotions. How about setting aside some time each week to draw? That can help you process your feelings and reduce stress. Would that be something you'd consider?

User: Yeah, I could do that. I really miss drawing.

Consultant: Wonderful! Incorporating drawing can also serve as a tool for emotional expression. It gives you a way to externalize what you’re feeling. As we wrap up today, let’s think about one goal you can set for yourself before our next session.

User: I think I want to practice deep breathing when I start to feel angry.

Consultant: That's an excellent goal! Practicing deep breathing will help you manage those moments much more effectively. Next time, we can discuss how it went and any other strategies that worked for you. Remember, you’re not alone in this.

User: Thanks! I feel a bit more hopeful after talking about it.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! It's been a pleasure working with you today, Xiaojun. Remember, if you face challenges, just keep returning to those breathing techniques. Looking forward to our next session. Take care!

User: Thank you! I'm looking forward to it too.

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Jun! I'm glad you're here today. I understand you've been feeling misunderstood and frustrated lately. Can you tell me more about what happened with your teacher?

User: Hi. Well, I talked to my teacher about something that was bothering me, but I felt like she didn't really understand me. It made me feel really upset, like no one cares about what I think.

Consultant: It sounds like you were seeking support from your teacher, but the response didn't meet your expectations, which made you feel even more isolated. What specific feelings came up for you during that conversation?

User: I felt ignored, and it seemed like she didn't take my feelings seriously. I wanted to explain myself better, but I couldn't find the right words.

Consultant: I can imagine that must have been really frustrating for you. It's tough when you want to express yourself, but feel like you're not being heard. How do you usually feel when you can't express your thoughts and feelings?

User: I usually get really angry or upset. Sometimes, I just keep everything inside because I think it won't matter anyway. But it's hard to hold back.

Consultant: Holding back your feelings can create a lot more pressure inside. It’s important to find a safe way to express what you’re feeling. What do you think might help you communicate your thoughts more clearly in the future?

User: I wish I could just say what I really think without being worried about how the other person will react. Maybe if I practiced talking beforehand, it would help?

Consultant: Practicing sounds like a great idea! If you think about a situation where you want to express yourself, how about we role-play it together? This way, you can rehearse what you want to say and feel more comfortable when the time comes.

User: That could be helpful. I get nervous when I think about talking to teachers or classmates because I don't want them to think I'm weak or silly.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about sharing your thoughts, especially if you're worried about others' perceptions. Let’s work together on framing what you want to express. Can you describe a specific scenario where you want to communicate your feelings?

User: Well, there’s a classmate I want to talk to about a project we’re working on together. I feel like we’re not on the same page, and I want to tell him that without making it awkward.

Consultant: That's a perfect place to start! How about we outline what you’d like to say? You could start by expressing how you feel about the project and mentioning specific points where you think you might have different ideas. What do you think?

User: I could say something like, “I feel confused about our project because I think we have different ideas.” But I’m scared he might just brush me off or say I’m overreacting.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have that fear. Remember, sharing your feelings doesn't mean you’re overreacting—it shows that you care and want to collaborate effectively. Let’s think about how you can invite him into the conversation. How might you respond if he does brush you off?

User: I could ask him why he thinks that. If he doesn’t get it, maybe I could just explain my point again in a nicer way?

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach! It’s great that you're thinking about how to keep the conversation open and friendly. If things get tense, you can also take a moment to breathe and regroup. How does that sound to you?

User: That could really help! I always feel like I need to have the perfect response ready, but it’s okay to pause for a moment.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking a moment to breathe can give you the space to gather your thoughts. It’s okay if you don’t have the perfect words immediately. How do you feel about trying this strategy in your next conversation with your classmate?

User: I think I can do it! Practicing like this makes me feel more confident about expressing myself. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Xiao Jun! Building your confidence is an important part of improving your communication skills. What other situations do you think might benefit from this practice? 

User: I guess I also struggle with talking to my parents sometimes. They can be really hard to talk to, especially when I have different opinions.

Consultant: Talking to parents can definitely be challenging, especially if you feel there might be a clash in opinions. What do you think might help you approach a conversation with them?

User: Maybe I should think about what I want to say in advance, and also try to understand their perspective first? 

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Understanding their perspective can help you find common ground. We can brainstorm ways to approach those conversations just like we did with your classmate. Would you like to explore that?

User: Yeah, I would like that. I just want them to understand my side too. 

Consultant: Let's work together on that. You could start by finding a calm moment to share your thoughts, and maybe even ask them questions about their views. How might you start that conversation?

User: I could say something like, “Can we talk about something? I have some feelings I want to share, and I want to know what you think as well.”

Consultant: That's a wonderful opener! It’s inviting and shows that you value their opinions. With practice, it can become easier to express yourself. How are you feeling about all of this now, Xiao Jun?

User: I feel a lot better. I’m starting to realize that communicating isn't as scary as I thought. 

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! Remember, practicing those communication skills will only help you grow stronger. As we wrap up our session today, what will you take away from our conversation?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is that I can prepare for tough conversations and that practice really makes a difference. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight! You have a solid plan to improve your communication skills, and I'm confident you'll handle those situations better in the future. Please remember to be kind to yourself in the process. If you ever feel overwhelmed, you can always reach out for support. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiao Jun! I'm here for you whenever you need. Keep practicing, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Jun! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I've been trying to use the emotional regulation skills we talked about. But sometimes, I still feel a bit overwhelmed when leading a group.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're making progress, even if it still feels overwhelming at times. Can you share a specific situation where you felt these emotions while leading your group?

User: Well, last week during a group project, I felt a bit anxious when we disagreed on ideas. I wasn't sure how to handle it, and I got a little frustrated.

Consultant: It sounds like that situation was challenging for you. What thoughts were running through your mind when the disagreement happened? 

User: I thought that if I didn't manage it well, everyone would think I'm a bad leader. I also worried they might not want to work with me again.

Consultant: Those are some pretty tough thoughts to deal with. It's understandable to feel anxious in that moment. How did those feelings affect your behavior in the group?

User: I ended up staying quiet for a bit instead of addressing it. I just let them argue, and I didn’t know how to step in without causing more trouble.

Consultant: That’s a common reaction when feeling overwhelmed. Let's break this down a bit. What emotions did you experience when you decided to stay quiet?

User: I felt nervous and a bit embarrassed. I didn’t want to look foolish if I said something wrong.

Consultant: Those feelings are completely valid. It’s important to recognize them. What would you say to a friend who was in a similar situation, feeling nervous about stepping in?

User: I would tell them it’s okay to speak up and that it’s part of being a leader. And it’s likely that they’re unsure too.

Consultant: That's a wise perspective! It’s easier to see things that way for someone else, isn’t it? Now, how might you apply that same thought to your own situation?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that leading means helping the group find a solution together.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s an excellent way to reframe your thoughts. You’re evolving your understanding of leadership. What actions can you try next time there’s a disagreement in your group?

User: Maybe I could encourage everyone to share their thoughts first, and then I could help guide the discussion.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Engaging the group can help you feel more connected and in control. Would you like to set up a potential reward for yourself if you successfully lead the discussion next time?

User: Yes! I could treat myself to something small, like playing my favorite video game after the meeting.

Consultant: That’s a great incentive! Celebrating small successes can help reinforce your confidence and enjoyment. What do you think you'll do differently in your group next time with all we've talked about?

User: I think I'll try to be more assertive and encourage everyone to express their ideas. I feel a bit more confident about it now.

Consultant: I'm proud of your progress, Xiao Jun! Remember, it's all about practice and patience. How do you feel about leading your group after planning this out?

User: I feel more optimistic about it. Just talking about it helps, and I’m ready to try again!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Keeping that positive mindset will help a lot. When looking back at these encounters, how might you keep track of your feelings and responses during those moments?

User: Maybe I can write them down in a journal so I can reflect on them later.

Consultant: Journaling is an excellent idea! It allows you to process your experiences and see how much you’ve grown over time. As we wrap up today, what do you feel has been your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I feel like I’ve learned to challenge my negative thoughts about leadership and that it's okay to be imperfect. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Embracing imperfections can be empowering. You've made some significant strides. Do you feel equipped to tackle future group interactions with the skills you've honed?

User: Yes, I believe I am! I’m looking forward to applying what I’ve learned.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Keep nurturing that self-confidence. Remember, feedback from your peers can be constructive. You’ve got this! If you need any help in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I feel like I've come a long way.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiao Jun! You’ve done a great job today. Best of luck with your next group project, and I look forward to hearing about your successes in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaojun! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty good lately. I got some praise from my classmates during gym class for completing an activity together. It made me feel really good about myself!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like that experience boosted your confidence. Can you tell me more about how you felt receiving that praise?

User: I felt really proud, like maybe I actually do have some skills. It was nice to hear that from my classmates. I usually don't think I’m good at physical stuff.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognized your skills! This positive feedback can help reinforce your self-esteem. What do you think made that experience successful for you?

User: I think it was because we worked well together as a team. I felt like I contributed to something and that we all did it together.

Consultant: Teamwork is indeed important, and it seems like you played a meaningful role in that. How did that make you view yourself in terms of interacting with others?

User: I guess I started to feel like I could be part of a team. Before, I was always worried about not being good enough.

Consultant: It's a big step to feel part of a team. Since you experienced this positive interaction, how do you think you can carry this feeling into other situations, especially when facing challenges?

User: Maybe I can try to be more involved in group activities and not shy away from them, even if I feel nervous sometimes.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Stepping out of your comfort zone can help you build on this confidence. When feeling nervous, what could you remind yourself of to help you engage with others?

User: I could tell myself that it’s okay to be nervous and that I’ve succeeded before, so I can do it again.

Consultant: Absolutely! Positive self-talk can be very powerful. Let’s try to create a few self-affirmations together that you can use in those moments. What’s one positive statement you could say to yourself?

User: I could say, “I am a valuable team player and I can handle new experiences.”

Consultant: That’s a fantastic affirmation, Xiaojun! Let’s continue to remind you of your potential to contribute positively. How do you feel about practicing this affirmation regularly?

User: I think it could help a lot! I like the idea of having something to say to myself.

Consultant: Great! It can be a helpful tool in boosting your confidence. Now, thinking about future interactions with peers, can you identify any scenarios where you would like to apply these skills and affirmations?

User: Maybe during group projects at school. I always feel unsure, but I want to try my best.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent opportunity! How can we strategize to make you feel more comfortable when those situations arise?

User: I guess I can prepare a bit before the project starts, like thinking of questions or ideas to share.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! Preparing ahead can definitely ease the pressure. How do you feel about reaching out to your classmates for help or to share ideas?

User: I think I could do that, especially since I now feel more confident after what happened in gym class.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! It’s amazing how one positive experience can influence your confidence to approach others. Can you think of a time when you might want to reach out to your classmates?

User: Maybe next week when we start a new project. I’ll try to speak up more.

Consultant: Perfect! Setting that intention can really help. Would you like to set a small goal for yourself regarding this project collaboration?

User: Yes! I want to share at least one idea in the first meeting.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, Xiaojun! Sharing an idea can help you feel engaged and may inspire others as well. Are there any potential challenges you anticipate in doing this?

User: I might feel nervous speaking up, but I’ll remember my affirmation.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Remember that it’s a normal feeling and using your affirmation can help you manage that anxiety. As we wrap up today, what do you think is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I feel like I have tools to handle my feelings better and that I can be more confident in group situations.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve made great progress. It’s important to keep building on this confidence. As you practice your affirmations and engage more with your peers, you’re likely to feel even more comfortable.

User: Thanks, I really appreciate the support!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaojun! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Remember to use those affirmations and know that you’re capable of great things. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time.

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Jun! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially with your interactions with classmates?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good, actually! I've been playing games with my classmates after school, and it feels nice to talk with them more.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It's great to see you taking the initiative to engage with your peers. How has this increased communication affected your feelings, especially in moments of conflict?

User: I feel like I'm handling things better now. When there are disagreements, I can communicate without getting too angry or upset.

Consultant: That’s an impressive change, Xiao Jun! Being able to manage conflicts calmly is a big step. Can you share an example of a recent situation where you applied these new skills?

User: Well, just last week, my friend wanted to play a different game than I did. At first, I was annoyed, but then I talked to him about it instead of getting upset. We compromised and played both games.

User: I felt relieved and happy! It was nice to work it out without any fighting. I even felt proud of myself for staying calm.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that you felt proud! Recognizing your achievements is important. What do you think helped you react differently this time compared to before?

User: I think practicing how to talk things out in our sessions helped a lot. I also remembered not to take things too personally.

User: I want to keep getting better at talking to people and managing my feelings, especially when I feel annoyed or sad.

Consultant: That's a great goal! How about we come up with some strategies you can use next time you feel those strong emotions? Would that be helpful?

User: Yes, I would like that! 

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s brainstorm some coping strategies together. When you feel annoyed, what could be a helpful way to pause and regroup your thoughts?

User: I could take a deep breath and count to ten before reacting. That might help me think first.

Consultant: That’s an excellent technique! Deep breathing can really calm your mind. Would you like to practice that together now?

User: Sure, I’d like to try!

Consultant: Alright, let’s take a deep breath in... and slowly exhale. Good job! How do you feel after doing that?

User: I feel a little more relaxed. It really does help!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s great that you’re discovering what helps you. Now, what about when you feel sad? Do you have any thoughts on how you might cope with those feelings?

User: I think I could talk to someone about it, maybe my mom or a friend.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Talking about your feelings can really help lighten the load. Do you feel comfortable reaching out to them when you're struggling?

User: I think so. I just need to remember it's okay to ask for help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember, asking for help is a sign of strength. You’ve made significant progress in understanding your emotions and how to communicate better. What do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our sessions so far?

User: I feel like I’ve learned a lot about managing my feelings and talking to people. It’s really changed how I relate to my friends.

User: I want to keep practicing my communication skills and not let my temper get the better of me.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Keeping those practices at the forefront will be beneficial. Before we finish, what strategies do you think will help you remember to stay calm and communicate effectively?

User: I’ll write them down and maybe share them with a friend. Having reminders can help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Writing down your strategies and sharing them with a friend can reinforce your learning. You've done a fantastic job today, Xiao Jun. I'm really proud of what you’ve accomplished.

User: Thank you! I feel proud too!

Consultant: You should be! If you ever need support in the future, remember that you have the tools to navigate tough situations. I believe in you. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out when you need to chat again!
