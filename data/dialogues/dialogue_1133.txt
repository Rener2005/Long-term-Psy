Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling recently with your new environment at university?

User: Hi, I've been feeling really lost and anxious since I moved to the dorms. I can't seem to adapt to the collective living situation and I constantly find myself feeling lonely.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. Moving to a new place and sharing space with others can definitely be overwhelming. Can you tell me more about what's specifically bothering you in the dorm?

User: Well, I just can't get used to the noise and the constant presence of others. It's like I have no privacy anymore, and I miss my own space. Plus, I don't feel like I fit in.

Consultant: It’s understandable to miss your own space and feel out of place. It’s a significant change. How do you think this situation is affecting your feelings about your studies and your time at university?

User: Honestly, it’s affecting everything. I can’t focus on my studies at all. I feel so frustrated and it makes me question if this is the right place for me.

Consultant: It sounds like the stress of adapting to the dorm life is really impacting your motivation to study. You mentioned questioning if this is the right place for you; what thoughts come up when you feel that way?

User: I think maybe I should have stayed home or chosen to go to a different school. Everything feels overwhelming, and I wonder if I’ll ever truly fit in here.

Consultant: That feeling of wanting to retreat back to what feels familiar is something many new students experience. Let’s explore that thought: what kind of evidence do you have that staying at home or going to another school would be better for you?

User: I guess I don't really have concrete evidence. I just feel like I had more control and comfort at home. Here, it feels chaotic and I’m not happy.

Consultant: It's important to recognize that your feelings are valid, but it may not be helpful to jump to the conclusion that home is the only solution. Can we try to look at some specific aspects of your experience here? What are some small things you might enjoy in this environment, despite its challenges?

User: I do like some of my classes and meeting people from different backgrounds. It’s just hard to balance that positivity with the overwhelming feelings.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Finding enjoyment in your classes can be a positive anchor during this transition. How about we focus on setting small, achievable goals related to those classes or social interactions?

User: Okay, that sounds doable. I guess I could aim to participate in one group study session this week.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Engaging with your peers can help ease feelings of isolation and maybe even lead to friendships. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I’m a bit nervous, but I think it could help. I just worry about making the initial move.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous about initiating social interactions. Let’s talk about ways to ease that anxiety. Could you think of some strategies you could use to feel more confident when reaching out?

User: Maybe I could prepare a few conversation starters in advance? Or I could remind myself that everyone else might feel just as nervous.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Preparing conversation starters can often make you feel more at ease. Furthermore, remembering that others share similar feelings can foster a connection. Have you thought about how you might remind yourself of those facts during the week?

User: I could write them down on a sticky note and put them in my notebook as a reminder before class or study sessions.

Consultant: That’s a clever idea! Visual reminders can be very effective. As you think about this upcoming week, what would it mean for you to take that step and participate in a group study session?

User: It would mean that I’m trying to take control of my situation, rather than letting my anxiety rule me. I think it would feel empowering.

Consultant: Absolutely, taking control can be very empowering. As we wrap up today, let's reflect on what we've discussed. What do you think are the main takeaways, and how do you feel about your path forward?

User: I think I’ve realized that it’s okay to feel overwhelmed, but I can also take steps to adapt. I’m going to try to engage more with my classes and start participating in group studies.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway! Remember, it’s a process, and taking small steps can lead to significant changes. I believe you’ll gain confidence as you move forward. If you encounter challenges, don’t hesitate to reach out for support.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance. I’ll try to implement these strategies this week.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care and believe in yourself—you’re on the right path!

Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you today. I understand that you've been feeling a bit frustrated and anxious lately regarding your adaptation to your new environment. Can we start by discussing what's been going on?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been struggling to communicate with my roommate because of the language barrier. It's really been bothering me, and I find myself doubting whether I can adapt to this new life.

Consultant: It sounds like the language barrier is really challenging for you, and it's understandable to feel anxious about adapting. What specific situations have triggered these feelings for you?

User: Well, whenever I try to talk to my roommate, I freeze up because I worry about making mistakes or not understanding her responses. It creates this cycle of anxiety that makes me want to avoid those conversations altogether.

Consultant: That's a common response when faced with a communication barrier. It's okay to feel that way. Let's explore this a bit more—what thoughts run through your mind when you're about to have a conversation with her?

User: I often think, "What if I say something wrong?" or "What if she doesn't understand me?" It's like I can already picture the conversation going badly in my head.

Consultant: I see. So, it sounds like those thoughts are putting a lot of pressure on you before even starting the conversation. Can we try to challenge one of those thoughts? For example, how likely do you think it is that your roommate would react negatively to a mistake?

User: I guess it’s not very likely. She seems nice, and she’s also a foreign student. But I still can’t shake that fear.

Consultant: That makes sense. Sometimes we are harder on ourselves than on others. If you were to advise a friend in a similar situation, what would you tell her?

User: I would tell her that it’s okay to make mistakes and that it’s better to try than not to talk at all. 

Consultant: Exactly! So, why not apply that same advice to yourself? Perhaps we can also set some small, achievable goals for your communication with your roommate. What do you think would feel manageable for you?

User: Maybe I could try saying a simple greeting or asking her how her day was. That seems doable.

Consultant: Great! Starting with a simple greeting is a fantastic way to ease into communication. How would you feel after doing that?

User: I think it would make me feel a little more relaxed, knowing that I took a step forward.

Consultant: That’s a positive outlook! Taking small steps can really help build your confidence. What additional resources or support do you think might help you improve your language skills?

User: I could look into language exchange programs or maybe some apps that help with language practice. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful ideas! Language exchange programs can provide you with a supportive environment to practice without the fear of judgment. How do you feel about setting a goal to try one of those resources?

User: That sounds good! I could commit to signing up for a language exchange this week.

Consultant: I love that commitment! This small action could lead to more practice and help you feel more comfortable. As we progress, let's also reflect on how it feels to achieve these small successes. How do you think that will impact your anxiety over time?

User: I hope it will help me see that I can actually connect with others, which might reduce my anxiety.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing your ability to connect can definitely help ease that anxiety. We can explore how to create a habit of reflection on these achievements moving forward. How would you rate your current motivation to pursue these goals?

User: I'm feeling more motivated now, especially after talking through it with you!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Li! Let's keep this momentum going. As you engage in these activities, remember to be kind to yourself and celebrate every small victory. What else is on your mind regarding your new environment?

User: I'm still worried about my interest in my studies. Sometimes I feel lost in my major and wonder if it's right for me.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel uncertain about your studies, especially during such a big transition. Let’s explore this further. What specifically makes you feel lost in your major?

User: I’m not sure if I’m passionate about it. I just chose this path because it seemed expected.

Consultant: That’s an important insight. Sometimes we choose paths based on expectations rather than our interests. What subjects or topics have you enjoyed in the past, either academically or personally?

User: I used to enjoy literature a lot, but I haven’t engaged with it outside of class lately.

Consultant: There’s a great starting point! It might be helpful to reconnect with your love for literature outside of your course. How can you incorporate more of that into your routine?

User: Maybe I could set aside some time each week to read a book of my choice. It could help rekindle my interest.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Reading something you enjoy can help reignite your passion for learning in your field. Let’s set that as a goal. How do you envision feeling after you’ve incorporated reading back into your life?

User: I think I’d feel more engaged and might even find ways to relate it to my studies. 

Consultant: Exactly! Finding connections can enhance your learning experience. As we conclude today’s session, what key takeaway do you want to remember as you pursue these goals?

User: I want to remember that taking small steps in communication and reconnecting with my interests can help me feel more confident and engaged.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway! Remember, every small effort counts. I'm proud of the steps you’re taking, and I encourage you to lean into those strategies. Whenever you feel overwhelmed, just remind yourself of these goals. Looking forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello Li! Welcome to our session today. It’s good to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I’ve been okay, but I still struggle with my interest in my major. I’m worried that my lack of motivation is going to affect my learning. 

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like you're quite concerned about your academic performance and motivation. Could you tell me more about what specifically is causing you to feel this way?

User: Well, my classes aren’t really capturing my interest, and I find it hard to engage with the material. I keep thinking that maybe I chose the wrong major, and that adds to my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It can be difficult when you feel disconnected from what you’re studying. Let's explore this further—what aspects of your major do you think you could potentially find interesting, if any?

User: I think some topics are intriguing, but I feel overwhelmed by the required courses that don’t connect with my interests. I wish I could see how they relate to my future.

Consultant: It makes sense to feel overwhelmed when the coursework doesn't seem relevant. Finding those connections can be very helpful in reigniting your interest. Can you identify any specific subjects or themes that you do find engaging, even if they are unrelated to your current courses?

User: I’ve always had a passion for literature and writing, and I find that I enjoy discussing ideas related to storytelling and character development.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Knowing that you enjoy literature and writing can help us connect those passions with your current studies. How might we incorporate those interests into your learning experience?

User: Maybe I could look for opportunities that relate to writing or storytelling within my classes? But I don’t know how to do that effectively.

Consultant: That's a proactive approach! Let’s brainstorm some ideas. How about researching your current courses to see if any assignments or projects allow you to infuse your love for literature and writing? 

User: That sounds doable, but I’m still worried about whether it will really help me stay motivated in the long run.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those concerns, especially when you're in a transitional phase like this. Let’s explore how we can set some achievable learning goals that align with your interests. What would be a small goal you could set for yourself in the next week?

User: I think I could start by reading one book that relates to my major and writing a short reflection on how it connects to what we’re studying.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful goal! It combines your interests with your coursework. How do you feel about that plan, and what might help you stay committed to it?

User: It feels manageable, and I think setting a specific time to read each day would help. I’ll also share my thoughts with a friend to keep me accountable.

Consultant: Excellent strategy! Sharing your process with a friend can be very motivating. Let’s also consider the possibility of attending any workshops or clubs related to writing or literature that might enrich your experience. How does that sound to you?

User: I’d love that! I just haven’t looked into any of those opportunities yet.

Consultant: That’s perfectly okay. It’s a great step to start exploring these options. Let’s aim for you to research at least one club or event this week. How would you feel about setting this as a goal for our next session?

User: I can do that! I’ll look for clubs that might focus on writing or creative expression.

Consultant: Awesome! I'm excited to hear what you discover. As we continue to explore your interests, remember to be kind to yourself. Finding your niche might take time, but you’re making progress. How are you feeling about everything we discussed today?

User: I feel a bit of relief, like I have a direction to go in. But I still have doubts about whether I’ll find my passion in this field.

Consultant: It's great to hear you feel some relief! Your doubts are normal, especially while navigating your interests. Would you like to discuss ways to manage those uncertainties as you continue this journey?

User: Yes, I’d appreciate that! I want to feel more secure about these decisions.

Consultant: We can explore ways to cope with those uncertainties. For now, try to focus on what you like and build from there. Remember, it’s about small steps toward building your confidence in your decisions. Let’s work on that in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I feel like I have some actionable things to work on and I’m looking forward to our next meeting.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li! I’m looking forward to hearing about your discoveries as well. Keep being curious and open to possibilities. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a little more reassured about my studies and my social life since I started joining more clubs at school. But I’m still a bit confused about my future direction.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling more at ease with your studies and social interactions! It's completely normal to have some confusion about the future, especially when you’re exploring new interests. Can you tell me more about what activities you’ve been involved in and how they've made you feel?

User: I've joined a few clubs, like the debate team and a creative writing group. I find them exciting, but I still can't figure out what I really want to do or how these interests fit into my plans.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve taken some wonderful steps to explore your interests! Engaging in activities like debate and creative writing can provide valuable skills. How do you feel these activities connect or don’t connect with your ideas for your future?

User: I enjoy them, but I often wonder if they will actually help me with my career later on. I think I love writing, but I’m not sure if I can make a career out of it. 

Consultant: That's a valid concern, and it’s good that you’re thinking about how your interests can translate into future opportunities. What aspects of writing do you enjoy the most? And what thoughts come up when you think about pursuing it as a career?

User: I love expressing myself and creating stories, but I worry that it’s too risky. It doesn’t seem very stable compared to other careers my friends are considering.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have concerns about stability, especially when comparing yourself to your peers. Let’s take a moment to reflect—what do you believe is the most important value for you when it comes to a career path? Stability, fulfillment, creativity…?

User: I think fulfillment is very important to me. I want to feel happy about what I do, but I’m scared of pursuing something that might not work out.

Consultant: Finding fulfillment is a powerful driver, and I admire your self-awareness! It seems like you are caught between your passion for writing and the fear of uncertainty. What if we explored ways for you to assess the risks versus the rewards of pursuing writing more seriously?

User: That sounds like a good idea. I guess I might have some misconceptions about what a writing career looks like.

Consultant: It could be beneficial to challenge those misconceptions! What specific beliefs do you have about a career in writing that might feel limiting or negative?

User: I suppose I believe that writers don’t make much money and that it’s challenging to get published. I’ve heard many success stories, but they also seem rare.

Consultant: These beliefs are common among aspiring writers. Can we question these thoughts together? What evidence do you have that supports these beliefs? And conversely, what evidence might refute them?

User: I don’t know... I guess some writers do achieve success, but it’s easy to focus on the negatives. There are so many artists out there who struggle.

Consultant: That’s very insightful! It’s crucial to recognize the complexity of any career path. If a friend were in your position thinking about pursuing writing, how would you encourage her to view the situation?

User: I’d tell her that she should follow her passion but also have a backup plan. It’s all about balancing dreams and reality.

Consultant: That's excellent advice! It includes both pursuing what she loves and maintaining a practical perspective. How might you apply this same advice to your own situation? 

User: Maybe I need to consider what a backup plan could look like while I explore writing further. Perhaps I could also look into writing-related fields that might provide more stability.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Exploring writing-related fields can help you follow your passion while ensuring some level of security. Are there specific areas you’ve thought about that could combine both your interests and career stability?

User: I think about journalism or content writing. These seem more practical but still allow me to write creatively.

Consultant: Those are great options! They involve writing while providing clearer career pathways. How do you feel about pursuing opportunities in those areas while continuing your exploration of creative writing?

User: I feel more optimistic about it! It feels good to have some options lined up.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s outline some potential next steps for you. Would it be useful to seek internships or volunteer opportunities in journalism or content writing, or maybe attend workshops?

User: Yes! I think getting some hands-on experience could really help clarify my feelings about these paths.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Let’s also take a moment to consider what you'll do if you feel unsure again during this exploration phase. How can you remind yourself of your strengths and all the progress you’ve made so far?

User: I guess I could write about my experiences and feelings. Keeping a journal might help when doubts arise.

Consultant: That's an excellent strategy! Journaling can provide clarity and help you process your thoughts. As we conclude today, let's summarize what you feel you’ve gained from our session so far.

User: I feel more hopeful about my career options now. I realize I can pursue writing while exploring practical paths like journalism, and I have some steps to take.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s okay to have uncertainties along the way. You’ve done great work today, and I encourage you to embrace both your passions and practicality. If you ever need support, don't hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and understanding. I look forward to our next session!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li! I’m glad to have been able to help. Take care, and we’ll continue this journey together next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Li! I’m glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing a bit better, I think. I've been getting involved with clubs and trying to meet new people. But I still feel quite unsure about my academic and career goals.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re getting more involved and improving your social skills! Let’s explore those feelings of uncertainty. What specific thoughts or concerns do you have about your academic and career plans?

User: I’m worried that I’m not sure what I want to study or how it connects to my future job. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed thinking about it all.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Many students feel overwhelmed when planning their future. What do you think helps you feel more clear or confident when thinking about your studies or potential careers?

User: I guess when I get positive feedback from my peers or when I enjoy what I’m doing in my classes. It reassures me a bit.

Consultant: Positive feedback and engagement during classes can definitely boost your confidence! Let's take a moment to reflect on instances where you've received that feedback. Can you recall a specific moment that made you feel good about your academic path?

User: Last week, I presented a project in class, and my professor praised my effort. It felt really nice and made me think maybe I can do well in this field.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Recognizing moments of success is so important. How did that praise affect your thoughts about your academic capabilities?

User: It made me feel like I might be on the right track, but the uncertainty still lingers. I just don’t want to make the wrong choice regarding my major.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel unsure about making such significant decisions. To address this uncertainty, let’s work on identifying your interests and how they align with potential majors. What subjects or activities do you feel most passionate about?

User: I really enjoy literature and writing, but I also like psychology. I’m torn between those fields.

Consultant: It sounds like you have some strong interests there! Let's explore how these subjects could lead to various career paths. What kind of jobs do you envision for yourself in either literature or psychology?

User: I could see myself as a writer or maybe working in mental health support, like counseling, but I’m not sure if I’m qualified for that.

Consultant: Those are both rewarding paths! Remember, pursuing a field doesn’t mean you need to have everything figured out right now. How would it feel to consider taking introductory classes in both areas to see which resonates with you more?

User: That sounds like a less pressured way to explore my options. I like that idea!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Exploring different fields through classes can provide clarity. As we discuss this, what steps can you take to enroll in those classes this coming semester?

User: I’ll review the course catalog and maybe talk to my academic advisor about it. That seems manageable.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Discussing your options with an advisor can also give you a chance to ask questions about prerequisites or potential career paths. How does thinking about these next steps make you feel?

User: It feels reassuring. Having a plan gives me more confidence to move forward.

Consultant: Fantastic! Feeling more assured is a significant step forward. Now, let’s think about how you’ll keep track of your thoughts and plans as you explore these options. Would you be open to journaling or creating a checklist?

User: I love journaling! It’ll help me clarify my thoughts in writing.

Consultant: That’s a perfect strategy! Journaling not only helps in reflecting but can also provide insight into your evolving interests. How often do you think you would like to journal moving forward?

User: I think a couple of times a week would be good, especially after classes.

Consultant: That sounds like a helpful routine. Remember to write about not only your academics but also your feelings and any feedback you receive. This can help reinforce your confidence. Do you have any concerns or hesitations about starting this journaling practice?

User: I’m just worried I might forget to do it.

Consultant: That’s a common worry. Maybe setting a reminder on your phone or choosing a specific day each week to revisit your journal could help? What do you think?

User: Yeah, I can set reminders. I’ll try that!

Consultant: Great! It sounds like you’re finding ways to hold yourself accountable, which is wonderful. Before we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed and settled on for your next steps.

User: Sure! So, I’ll explore introductory classes in literature and psychology, set reminders to journal a few times a week, and talk to my advisor.

Consultant: Yes, that’s it! Remember to celebrate the small victories along the way. Reflecting on your progress can enhance your confidence. How are you feeling about everything we talked about today?

User: I feel much more hopeful and motivated now! I can see a clearer path ahead.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Li! You’ve made significant progress in clarifying your goals. This is our last session, but know that you can always reach out if you need further support. You’ve got this!

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate all your help.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you again for our session today. How have you been feeling lately with your transition to university life?

User: Hi! I feel like I've been doing really well. After a challenging adjustment period, I’m more confident expressing my opinions in class and participating in activities. It feels rewarding!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Building that confidence in your new environment is a significant achievement. Can you share what specific changes you've noticed in your daily routine or mindset since we last spoke?

User: Sure! I’ve started to believe in my opinions more, and I’m not as worried about what others think. I also make a point to engage with my classmates more, which helps me feel connected.

Consultant: That's a great shift in mindset! Engaging with classmates can really help you feel part of the community. How does it make you feel when you connect with others in those settings?

User: It feels fulfilling and makes me feel less lonely. I used to hesitate a lot before speaking up, but now I feel like my voice matters.

Consultant: It sounds like you are cultivating a sense of belonging and value in your contributions! Have there been any challenges or moments of doubt since you've started this journey?

User: Sometimes I still feel a bit anxious before speaking in larger groups. I worry about how I’ll come across or if I'll lose my train of thought.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious in those situations, especially when there’s pressure to perform. Let’s explore those feelings a bit more—what specific thoughts run through your mind in those moments of anxiety?

User: I often think, “What if I mess up?” or “What will they think of me?” Those thoughts definitely make me second-guess myself.

Consultant: Those thoughts can create a lot of pressure. Let’s challenge those ideas together. What evidence do you have that failing to express yourself perfectly would lead to negative outcomes?

User: I guess I don't have strong evidence. Usually, even if I don’t articulate perfectly, people are supportive or give me feedback that helps.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! It seems like there’s a discrepancy between your fears and the reality of your interactions. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them to do?

User: I’d probably tell them to be themselves and not worry too much about being perfect. Everyone makes mistakes, right?

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve acknowledged that everyone makes mistakes. It sounds like you already have the tools to be more compassionate towards yourself. Would you be willing to try reminding yourself of this perspective the next time you feel anxious?

User: Yes, I think that could help me approach those situations with less fear.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Now, moving forward, are there any specific actions you'd like to take to continue building on your confidence? 

User: I'd like to set small goals for myself, like speaking up at least once in every class. I think that could help gradually lessen my anxiety.

Consultant: That's an excellent plan! Setting small, achievable goals can build your confidence over time. How will you track your progress?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal to note down moments I felt proud of speaking up, along with how I felt afterward.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach. Journaling can help you reflect on your experiences and see your growth over time. Are there other areas you want to strengthen during this phase of your university life?

User: I’d like to work on managing my time better, especially with balancing social life and studies. Sometimes I’m just overwhelmed with assignments.

Consultant: Time management can be tricky, especially during your first year. What strategies have you considered to help you balance both aspects?

User: I’ve heard of methods like the Pomodoro Technique, but I haven’t tried them yet. I might give that a go.

Consultant: The Pomodoro Technique could be beneficial for you! It helps maintain focus while also in allowing breaks, which can improve productivity. Would you like to commit to trying it out this week?

User: Yes, I’ll give it a shot. I think breaking my study sessions into manageable chunks will help me not feel so stressed.

Consultant: That's the spirit! Taking actionable steps towards your goals can empower you. After our session, how do you feel about your progress?

User: I feel encouraged and more equipped to face what’s ahead. This session has been really helpful!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s great to acknowledge your progress and the positive changes you've made. As we wrap up, what will you take away from our discussion today?

User: I’ll focus on my small goals and practice being more self-compassionate when I feel anxious. 

Consultant: Those are excellent takeaways! Keep reminding yourself of your strengths, and embrace the journey. Remember, it’s okay to ask for support when needed. You've done amazing work thus far! Let's touch base again soon.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: You're very welcome! Looking forward to hearing about your progress. Take care!
