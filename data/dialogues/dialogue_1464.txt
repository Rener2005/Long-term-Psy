Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're here today, A. To start off, I'd love to hear more about what you've been feeling lately, especially regarding your new role as class president. 

User: Hi! Well, I guess I've been feeling really anxious. Taking on this responsibility feels overwhelming, and sometimes I doubt if I'm really cut out for this role. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling quite the weight of this new role and that it's accompanied by self-doubt. Could you share some specific moments when you've felt this pressure or doubt the most?

User: Sure. There have been times in meetings when I feel like I should be making important decisions, but I just freeze up. I worry that my classmates are expecting too much from me, and I don't want to disappoint them. 

Consultant: I can see how that would create a lot of pressure. It seems like you're worried about not meeting the expectations of your classmates. What thoughts pass through your mind in those moments when you feel like you're freezing up?

User: I keep thinking that maybe I’m not good enough to lead. I feel like everyone else is doing better than me, and that makes me anxious and tired. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough, A. You're comparing yourself to others and finding it hard to measure up. When those thoughts arise, what kinds of feelings do you experience?

User: I feel anxious and a little sad. Sometimes I even feel like I want to quit being the class president, but I don’t want to let anyone down. 

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way when you're under so much pressure. It seems like you’re caught in a cycle of anxiety and feeling trapped by your responsibilities. Have you noticed any patterns in your thoughts or feelings that might be contributing to this anxiety?

User: Yes, I often think I have to be perfect. If I make a mistake or let something slip, I feel like I’m failing, which only adds to my anxiety.

Consultant: Perfectionism can indeed create a lot of pressure. It sounds like you're holding yourself to very high standards. If a friend were in your situation, what advice do you think you would give them?

User: I’d probably tell them that it's alright to make mistakes and that no one is perfect. I’d encourage them to just do their best and not to be too hard on themselves. 

Consultant: That’s really compassionate advice. It sounds like you have a good understanding of what others might need, but you’re struggling to apply that to yourself. What do you think is preventing you from being as kind to yourself?

User: I think it's just that I want people to see me as capable. I put a lot of pressure on myself to be that person. 

Consultant: It makes sense that you want to be seen as capable, especially in a leadership role. How about we explore some ways to challenge those perfectionist thoughts? What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you must be perfect in your role?

User: I guess I don’t actually have that evidence. I mean, I’ve done some things well, like organizing the last class event. 

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you've had successes already. How might you reframe those high expectations into something more realistic and supportive for yourself?

User: Maybe I could focus on doing my best instead of aiming for perfection. I could remind myself that learning comes with mistakes. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great shift in thinking, A. Focusing on doing your best and allowing space for learning can really alleviate some of that pressure. How can you remind yourself of this new approach when you start feeling anxious again?

User: I could write down my successes and maybe set smaller, achievable goals for myself. 

Consultant: That’s a wise plan! Keeping track of your successes and setting smaller goals can help you build confidence. How do you feel about incorporating these strategies into your daily routine?

User: I think it could really help. If I remind myself about my past successes regularly, I might feel less anxious.

Consultant: Absolutely! Regular reinforcement can help shift your mindset over time. As we wrap up today, I’d love to reflect on what we’ve discussed and your takeaways. What do you think is the biggest insight you’ll carry with you?

User: Understanding that it's okay to make mistakes and that I can manage my expectations better. I feel like I at least have a plan moving forward!

Consultant: That's excellent, A! Awareness of your thoughts and a plan for progress are key steps in managing your anxiety. As you encounter new challenges, remember you have the tools to navigate them. If these feelings come back, you can always return to what we've talked about today. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You're very welcome. I'm so glad we had this discussion. Remember, be kind to yourself as you continue to grow in your role. Goodbye for now, A, and take care!

Consultant: Hello, A! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling about everything that’s been happening lately?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed. Being the class monitor and part of the student council has added so much pressure, and I'm struggling to keep up with my studies. I often doubt my abilities and it's frustrating.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of responsibility right now, and it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about how these responsibilities are affecting you academically?

User: Well, I find it hard to focus on my studies. I feel like I should be excelling, but I can't seem to keep up. I’m constantly anxious about not meeting my own expectations.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, A. You have set high standards for yourself, and it’s tough when you feel you’re not hitting those marks. What specific thoughts do you have when you feel this way about your performance?

User: I keep thinking that if I can’t handle everything, it means I’m not good enough. It makes me anxious and sometimes I just want to give up.

Consultant: It seems like you’re feeling pressure to be perfect. What you’re experiencing can be seen as automatic negative thoughts. When you have those thoughts about not being good enough, how does that make you feel in the moment?

User: It makes me feel really anxious and disappointed in myself. Sometimes I can't concentrate on studying because I'm so caught up in those thoughts.

Consultant: It’s important to recognize that these thoughts might not reflect reality. Let’s explore this a bit more. Can you think of any evidence that might support or contradict the idea that you’re not good enough, especially regarding your abilities?

User: I mean, I did get decent grades last term and my teachers say I’m doing well, but I just don’t feel it right now because I’m so stressed.

Consultant: That's a great observation, A. It sounds like there's a conflict between how you're performing and how you feel about yourself. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about their feelings of inadequacy?

User: I would tell them that it’s okay to struggle and that they shouldn't be too hard on themselves. Everyone has moments like this.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to allow yourself that same kindness. Let’s try to challenge those negative thoughts you’re having. What would you say if you could replace those thoughts with something more positive or realistic?

User: Maybe something like “It's okay to not be perfect, and I’m doing my best.” 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start! Remembering that doing your best is what matters can really help reduce the pressure. Let’s also talk about balancing your responsibilities. What can you do to manage your time better between your commitments and studies?

User: I’m not sure. I usually just try to cram everything in, but that’s not working well.

Consultant: Cramming can be really stressful. How about we come up with a plan to prioritize your tasks? You could list what’s urgent versus what can wait, and allocate specific times for studying. How does that sound to you?

User: That makes sense! I think I’d feel less chaotic if I had a plan. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Creating a plan can help you regain a sense of control. Would you feel comfortable trying out a simple weekly schedule to manage your study time along with your responsibilities?

User: Yes, I’d love to try that! I think it could really help.

Consultant: Great! Let’s also reflect on how you can include breaks to recharge during your study sessions. Taking short breaks can boost your focus. Have you thought about some activities that relax you?

User: I enjoy playing basketball and hanging out with friends. I should probably do more of that when I have a bit of free time.

Consultant: Engaging in activities you enjoy is very important for your well-being. Balancing your responsibilities with leisure can actually enhance your focus when studying. Let’s make sure to include that in your plan. 

User: That sounds good. I guess having fun can help me feel better overall.

Consultant: Absolutely! Enjoyment can be a great stress reliever. As we wrap up, let’s revisit what we’ve talked about. What do you think is your biggest takeaway from today’s session?

User: I think I need to be more forgiving with myself and create a realistic plan for my time management to reduce my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a great realization, A. Being kinder to yourself is a significant step. You’ve got this! If you ever feel overwhelmed again, remember the strategies we discussed today, and feel free to reach out. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're welcome! I'm glad to have been here with you. I wish you all the best moving forward, and remember, you're not alone in this journey.
###################
Consultant: Hello, XIAO A! I'm glad you're here for our session today. I’d like to start by hearing how you’ve been feeling lately, especially with the upcoming exams on your mind.

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious about the mid-term exams. Sometimes I worry that I won't do well, and it's hard to concentrate on my studies. I just want to do my best, but the pressure feels overwhelming.

Consultant: I understand how tough that can be. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to perform well, which is completely normal. Can you tell me more about what thoughts go through your mind when you think about the exams?

User: I keep thinking that if I don't do well, I'll let everyone down, especially my family. My dad works hard, and my mom runs that little restaurant; I just feel like I can't fail them.

Consultant: That’s a lot of pressure you're putting on yourself. It’s understandable to want to make your family proud, but it sounds like these thoughts might be adding to your anxiety. How do these thoughts make you feel right before you study or during an exam?

User: They make me feel really nervous and unable to focus. It's like I freeze up. I sometimes even doubt my ability to study effectively, which just makes it worse.

Consultant: I hear you. It seems like these negative thoughts are creating a cycle of anxiety and self-doubt. Let’s take a moment to challenge some of these thoughts. What evidence do you have that you will not perform well on your exams?

User: Well, I guess I don't have solid evidence. I did okay in my previous tests, but this time feels different—maybe it’s just the fear of not meeting my expectations.

Consultant: It's great that you recognize you’ve performed well before. Expectations can be tricky, especially when they come from ourselves. What if you treated this upcoming exam as another opportunity to grow instead of just a test of your abilities?

User: That sounds nice, but it’s hard to shift my mindset. I feel the weight of wanting to impress everyone.

Consultant: I understand that, and it's completely normal to feel that way. Let’s explore ways to relieve some of that pressure. Can you think of any activities that help you relax or that you've enjoyed doing recently?

User: I like playing basketball with my friends. It helps me feel better, but I haven't been doing it much lately.

Consultant: Playing basketball sounds like a great way to release some tension! How about we incorporate that back into your routine to help balance the stress of studying?

User: That could work. I used to feel more confident when I played regularly.

Consultant: That's a wonderful insight. Physical activity can really boost your mood and help clear your mind. How about scheduling some time for basketball during your study week? 

User: I could try that. Maybe once or twice a week. I hope it helps.

Consultant: Absolutely, it's all about creating a balance. Alongside that, let’s also practice some relaxation techniques that you can do before studying or during times of stress. Would you be willing to try deep breathing exercises?

User: Sure, I've heard about deep breathing but haven't really tried it.

Consultant: It's a simple yet effective technique. You just take a deep breath in, hold it for a few seconds, then slowly exhale. We can do a quick practice together. Want to try it now?

User: Okay, let's do it.

Consultant: Great! Let's take a deep breath in... (inhale)... and now hold it... (hold)... and slowly exhale... (exhale). How did that feel?

User: It was nice. I felt a little bit of the tension release.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Practicing this regularly can help you calm your mind before exams or studying. How do you think you can remind yourself to do this when the anxiety kicks in?

User: Maybe by setting reminders on my phone or writing it in my planner.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Creating reminders can help reinforce this calming technique. Now, let’s shift focus a bit. You mentioned self-doubt earlier. What would you say to a friend who was feeling the same way about their exams?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay to feel nervous and that they’ve got this, just to believe in themselves.

Consultant: That’s such a caring perspective! Now, what if you started treating yourself with that same kindness? What would change for you if you encouraged yourself like you would a friend?

User: I think I’d feel less pressure. I’d allow myself to just take it one step at a time instead of stressing about everything at once.

Consultant: That’s a valuable shift to make! Remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time. In our next sessions, we can work on ways to reinforce that mindset and recognize your achievements as you prepare for your exams.

User: I’m looking forward to that. I think it might help me embrace my progress rather than just fixate on the outcome.

Consultant: I believe it will! As we wrap up today’s session, let’s take a moment to reflect on what we covered. What strategies do you feel would be most helpful for you moving forward?

User: I think incorporating basketball and practicing deep breathing will definitely help. I also want to start being kinder to myself.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent strategies! Remember, they’re all part of your journey to managing stress and building confidence. I’m proud of the insights you've shared today. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I feel a little more hopeful now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been great to talk with you about your feelings and strategies. In our next session, we can continue to explore these techniques and see how they’re working for you. Take care until then!

User: I will! See you next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit off, even though I managed to organize a successful class activity recently. I just can't seem to recognize my own accomplishments.

Consultant: It sounds like despite your external successes, there's a part of you that struggles to appreciate your achievements. Can you share more about what you're feeling?

User: I guess I feel like I didn't do it on my own or that it was just luck. I don't know, I just keep doubting myself, especially when I think about my abilities compared to others.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when you are in a new environment. You mentioned self-doubt and comparing yourself to others. What specific thoughts go through your mind when you doubt yourself?

User: I often think that maybe I'm not as capable as my peers, or that they're more talented than me. I tend to feel like an imposter, even in situations where I've done well.

Consultant: These feelings seem strong for you, and it's common to have such thoughts, especially when experiencing new challenges. Can you recall a time when you felt proud of something you accomplished? 

User: Well, when I organized the class activity, everyone seemed happy and impressed. But even then, I brushed it off, like it didn't matter much.

Consultant: It seems like you achieved something great but didn't allow yourself to enjoy that success. Why do you think you brushed it off?

User: Maybe I just feel I need to keep proving myself and that one good event isn't enough to show my worth.

Consultant: That sounds like a tough standard to hold yourself to. Let's explore this belief together. What evidence do you have that one success isn’t enough to prove your worth?

User: I guess I don't have solid evidence. It just feels like I need to consistently perform well to be valued.

Consultant: It's interesting that you recognize the lack of evidence behind that thought. If a friend were in a similar situation, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably remind them that one success does count and they should be proud of it.

Consultant: Exactly! So, what if you treated yourself with the same kindness and understanding? What would that look like for you?

User: I should probably acknowledge my achievements more instead of downplaying them. It feels weird, but maybe it would help.

Consultant: It might feel unusual at first, but acknowledging what you’ve done is key. Let’s try a small exercise: can you think of a positive affirmation related to this recent success?

User: Hmm, maybe something like “I organized a successful event, and I’m capable of more”?

Consultant: That sounds great! How does it feel to say that affirmation out loud?

User: It feels... a bit uplifting, I guess. But I still worry about my next steps.

Consultant: It's normal to worry about future performance. Let’s focus on what you can control. What’s one small goal you can set for your next activity that incorporates what you’ve learned about your capabilities?

User: Maybe I could set a goal to enjoy the process more and not just focus on the outcome?

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! Focusing on the process can reduce pressure. How can you remind yourself to enjoy the experience during your next activity?

User: I could remind myself to take breaks and reflect on what I’m learning instead of just the end result.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy approach. How do you think this new focus on enjoyment might shift your feelings towards successes in the future?

User: Hopefully, I will feel less pressure and more proud of what I accomplish, even if it’s small.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! It’s also essential to talk about these feelings with your family. How has your communication with them been lately?

User: I haven’t really opened up much about how I’ve been feeling. I guess I keep most things to myself.

Consultant: Opening up can help strengthen those connections. Would you be willing to share how you’re feeling with them next time you talk?

User: I think I could try. It would be nice to share my experiences, even if it feels a bit vulnerable.

Consultant: It’s very brave to express your feelings. What would you like to say to them during that conversation?

User: I might say, “I’m trying to deal with my self-doubt and appreciate what I accomplish more.”

Consultant: That sounds very clear and honest. Remember, vulnerability is a strength, and sharing can often lead to deeper connections with your family.

User: Yeah, I guess that makes sense. I’ll try to keep that in mind.

Consultant: Before we conclude today’s session, let's summarize what we've discussed. You've identified self-doubt and learned to recognize your achievements. You’ve set a goal to enjoy the process and plan to communicate more openly with your family.

User: Yes, I feel it’s been helpful to outline all that.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Acknowledging and celebrating your progress is vital. When we meet again, we can check in on how these strategies are working for you. 

User: Yes, I’d like that. Thank you for your help today. 

Consultant: You're welcome! Remember to be kind to yourself, and I'm looking forward to our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you today! How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! Honestly, I've been struggling a bit. I've been feeling really homesick. It’s hard being away from my family, and I can't seem to share much about my life here with them.

Consultant: I see, it sounds challenging to feel lonely and unable to connect with your family. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel homesick or what you wish you could share with them?

User: I miss my family a lot, especially my mom. I want to tell her about my school life and things I've done, but it feels awkward. I worry she won't understand.

Consultant: That makes sense. It's common to feel that way when you're far from home. It can be tough to bridge that gap in communication. What do you think would help you express your experiences more comfortably?

User: Maybe if I could find a way to show them what life is like here, it might help. But I’m not sure how to do that.

Consultant: That's a great thought! Sharing your experiences could help them feel more connected to you. Have you considered using video calls or perhaps even starting a journal to share later?

User: I haven’t really thought about journal writing, but video calls could be easier. I guess I just haven’t felt motivated to do that lately.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel unmotivated, especially when you're dealing with homesickness. Let’s take a moment to explore your feelings about video calls. What thoughts come up for you when you think about doing them?

User: I guess I’m worried I won’t have much to say or that it will just make me feel more sad. Sometimes I feel like my life here is boring compared to what I remember back home.

Consultant: That's a valid concern. It’s common to compare experiences, especially when you're missing home. Can we try to challenge that thought? What evidence do you have that your life here is boring? Are there things you enjoy that you could share instead?

User: Well, there are some things I like. I’ve joined the student council, and being the class monitor is interesting. I just don’t feel like those things would matter to them.

Consultant: They definitely matter! Those achievements reflect your growth and adaptation to your new environment. Sharing those experiences could help your family feel more connected to your life now. How do you think they would react hearing about your role in the student council?

User: I think they’d be proud of me. Maybe I should focus on the positive things instead of only the negatives.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy way to approach it! Reflecting on the positive aspects can help improve your mood and strengthen your communication with your family. Would you be willing to set a small goal for our next session, like talking to them about one positive experience?

User: Yes, I think I can do that! I’ll try to prepare something to share.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Remember, it’s also okay to express your feelings of homesickness during those calls. It's natural to miss your family. Balancing both the positive experiences and your feelings can create a more authentic connection. 

User: Right, I can be honest about my feelings but still share good things too. 

Consultant: Exactly! You’re understanding the importance of sharing both sides. Let's also discuss how you can prepare for the next call. Would writing down a few points or topics help you feel more confident?

User: Yes, I think jotting down points would help me. It would give me something to refer to, so I don’t feel lost.

Consultant: Great idea! It can serve as a helpful guide to keep the conversation flowing. Alongside that, how do you feel about starting a journal of your experiences each week to share later?

User: That sounds interesting! I could write down fun things that happen, and then I could show it to them later. 

Consultant: Absolutely! A journal is a fantastic way to reflect on your experiences and may provide a sense of accomplishment. You can also use it to document how you're feeling over time. Would you like to set a specific time each week to write in it?

User: Yes, I think I could make that a routine over the weekend when I have time to think.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Establishing a routine will help you stay connected to your experiences and emotions. Lastly, how do you feel about the support from your friends or school environment while you navigate these feelings?

User: I haven't reached out much, but I do have some friends here that I like. I guess I could talk to them more.

Consultant: Connecting with friends is a good step. They can be a great support system when you’re feeling homesick. Perhaps consider sharing your experiences or feelings with them. How do you think they would respond?

User: I think they’d get it; maybe it would help to talk about it with someone who knows what it’s like.

Consultant: Definitely! Sharing with someone who understands can ease your feelings of loneliness. I'm really proud of you for exploring these ideas. Let's recap what you've learned today and how we can build on this in our next session. 

User: Yeah, I think I learned I can be honest and share good things. I'll try to prepare for the video call and start a journal.

Consultant: You're making significant progress! I'm excited to hear how it goes when we meet next. Remember, your experiences matter, and there are people around you who care. Keep reaching out for support, and we’ll continue to work on strengthening those connections.

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about communicating with my family now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and I look forward to our next session. You’re not alone in this journey. See you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really pleased to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been thinking a lot about what we discussed. I've become more aware of my need for social support and how important it is for my emotional well-being.

Consultant: That's a great insight, and I'm glad to hear you're reflecting on it. Can you share more about any specific thoughts or experiences you've had regarding social support since we last met?

User: Well, after attending that psychology lecture, I realized that I need to connect more with my classmates and teachers. I feel like forming those connections could really help me.

Consultant: Absolutely, connection can provide a strong support system. What steps have you considered taking to build these connections within your school community?

User: I was thinking of joining more clubs or activities. Since I'm already the class monitor, maybe I could use that role to reach out more.

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive approach! Being a class monitor gives you a unique opportunity to connect with your classmates. How do you feel about initiating conversations with them?

User: I feel a bit nervous about it, to be honest. What if they don't want to talk or they're not interested?

Consultant: It's natural to feel nervous when reaching out, especially in new social situations. Let's explore this a bit. What evidence do you have that they might not be interested?

User: I guess I don’t have much evidence. Sometimes I just assume they’re too busy or wouldn’t care.

Consultant: That’s an interesting point. It seems like you might be worrying about what others think. How about we challenge that thought? If a friend came to you for support, how would you respond to them?

User: I would be supportive! I’d try to listen and help them feel more comfortable.

Consultant: Exactly! Most people appreciate when others reach out. So, what if we reframe your thought? Instead of thinking, "They might not be interested," you could think, "They might appreciate my effort to connect." How does that sound to you?

User: That does sound better! I hadn’t thought of it that way.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Now, focusing on your role as class monitor, what specific actions could you take to connect with your classmates and foster a supportive atmosphere?

User: Maybe I could organize a casual get-together after school and invite everyone to hang out. It sounds fun!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Organizing a casual meet-up can help break the ice and create a sense of community. How do you envision running that gathering?

User: I guess I would find a good place and maybe plan some activities to keep it engaging. It could be a game night or something like that!

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Activities can certainly help people feel more comfortable. Is there anyone specific you can ask for help in organizing this event?

User: I could ask my friend from the student council. She’s really good at planning events.

Consultant: Collaborating with a friend can make the planning process easier and more fun! How do you feel about reaching out to her for support?

User: I think I can do that. It feels less daunting when I have someone to share the responsibility with.

Consultant: That's a positive mindset! Remember, it’s okay to share tasks and ask for help. How do you feel about these plans as a whole? 

User: I'm feeling more excited about it and less anxious. I think this could really help me connect with everyone.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Building connections can definitely enhance your support system. As you move forward, what steps will you take to maintain these relationships over time?

User: I’ll make an effort to check in with my classmates regularly, maybe have little chats whenever I see them.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Regular interactions can help strengthen those bonds. How can you remind yourself to keep this up, even when it gets busy?

User: I could set reminders or even jot down notes about who I should reach out to. That way, I won’t forget!

Consultant: That's an excellent approach! Keeping track will help you stay proactive. As we wrap up today, what takeaway do you think will be most valuable for you moving forward?

User: I think it’s recognizing that reaching out is important and that people will likely respond positively. It feels empowering.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking the initiative is a strength, and recognizing the potential positive outcomes can be very encouraging. As you step into this new phase of building connections, I believe you have the skills to foster that support system effectively.

User: Thank you! I feel much more confident about my plans now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, you can always revisit any concerns you have in the future. I'm here to support you. Good luck, and I look forward to hearing how everything goes in our next session!
