Consultant: Hello, Xiaojia! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really down lately. My good friend left school, and I just can't shake off this sadness. It's been hard to focus on anything else, especially with exams coming up.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like the departure of your friend has created a significant emotional impact on you. Can you tell me more about how that situation is affecting your mood and focus?

User: Well, I keep thinking about the unresolved issues we had. I can't stop feeling like I should have said something to him before he left. Now, it just feels like a missed opportunity.

Consultant: That sounds really heavy. It's normal to feel regret in situations like this. What thoughts come to your mind when you think about that missed opportunity? How does that make you feel?

User: I keep thinking that maybe he didn’t care about our friendship as much as I did. That thought makes me feel really lonely and maybe even a bit worthless.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel hurt by those thoughts. It seems like you might be judging both yourself and the situation quite harshly. Have you been able to explore any different perspectives on this friendship or the way you've felt?

User: Not really. I just get stuck in my head. I start to think that if I wasn’t so sensitive, I could have done something to keep him around. It just makes me feel worse.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re being really hard on yourself. You mentioned feeling sensitive; can you tell me how that sensitivity affects your relationships with others at school now?

User: I feel like no one really understands me. Sometimes they make comments about how I'm always overthinking things, which just makes me feel more isolated and anxious.

Consultant: It can be quite tough when you feel misunderstood. What do you think might help you express your feelings to others? Or how might you address their comments?

User: I guess I could try to explain to them how I feel. But I worry they wouldn’t really get it or that they’d just tell me to toughen up.

Consultant: Those concerns make sense. It’s difficult to be vulnerable when you fear rejection. What if you approached them with a simple statement about what you’re going through? It might give them a better understanding of your feelings.

User: That could work, I suppose. But it’s still intimidating to open up. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone.

Consultant: It's important to remember that sharing your feelings can actually strengthen your connections. It's not a burden; it's a way to seek support. How do you think practicing this could help reduce your feelings of isolation?

User: Maybe it would make me feel less alone in all of this. I mean, I want to connect with others, but I just don’t know how.

Consultant: Building connections can be challenging, especially when you're feeling vulnerable. Let's focus on one small step—perhaps you could start by sharing a little of what you've shared with me with someone you trust. How does that sound?

User: I think I could try that. Maybe it would help me feel better when I talk about it instead of keeping it all inside. 

Consultant: That’s a great step! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. You’re learning how to express your feelings, which takes courage. Let’s talk about how you can manage your focus while preparing for exams. What have you been doing so far?

User: Honestly, I'm just panicking a lot. I can't seem to study effectively. My mind keeps wandering.

Consultant: Panic can definitely interfere with your ability to focus. Let's identify together what thoughts enter your mind when you try to study. What are you usually thinking about?

User: I think about how I need to do well to make my parents proud and not let them down. But then it feels overwhelming.

Consultant: That’s a heavy expectation. It sounds like the fear of disappointing your parents leads to stress while studying. What might it look like to break that pressure down into smaller, more manageable expectations?

User: I suppose I could focus on studying one subject at a time without thinking about the overall pressure to succeed.

Consultant: That sounds like a very practical approach! Starting small with one subject can make the task less intimidating. How can you set up your study environment to help you stick to this plan?

User: I could create a schedule and set a timer for each subject. That way, I won’t feel like I have to study everything at once.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Time management can really help reduce anxiety. Would you feel comfortable setting that up for yourself before our next session?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. It feels like a good step forward.

Consultant: I’m really proud of you for taking this step! We can also check-in on how you’re feeling emotionally about studying in our next session. It sounds like you’re learning valuable ways to cope with it all. 

User: Thanks! I really want to feel better, so I’ll try my best to have an open heart.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful mindset, Xiaojia. Remember, it's okay to feel both scared and hopeful at the same time. You’re not alone in this journey. We can continue building on your progress together.

User: I appreciate that. I do feel a bit more hopeful now. I’ll work on expressing my feelings and managing my studying.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! We’ll keep exploring these feelings and skills together. Take care of yourself until we meet again, alright?

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Jia! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately? 

User: Hi! I've been really stressed out, especially with the upcoming exams. I can't seem to focus on my studies, and I feel so lonely since I haven't talked to my family much. 

Consultant: I hear you, and it sounds like you're feeling quite overwhelmed with both the pressure from your exams and the lack of connection with your family. Can you tell me a bit more about what specific thoughts are running through your mind during this time?

User: I keep thinking about how much my parents expect from me, and I can’t help but feel like I'm going to disappoint them if I don’t do well. It's really weighing me down.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling the weight of those expectations. When you think about disappointing your parents, what emotions come up for you?

User: I feel anxious and sad, like I'm not good enough. I just want to make them proud, but it feels impossible.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way when you're under such pressure. Those thoughts can create a cycle of anxiety. Can you remember a specific situation where you felt this pressure particularly strongly?

User: Yes, just the other day, I was studying, and I couldn't absorb anything. I thought, "What if I fail this exam?" It made me want to give up studying altogether.

Consultant: I see. That automatic thought of "What if I fail?" can definitely make it hard to concentrate. What emotion did that thought bring up for you in that moment?

User: It made me feel defeated and hopeless. I really don’t want to fail.

Consultant: That feeling of defeat can be heavy. Let’s explore that thought further. What evidence do you have that failing is the only outcome? 

User: I guess I don't have solid proof, but it just feels like there's no room for error. 

Consultant: It’s common to feel like failure is the only outcome, especially under pressure, but let’s challenge that thought. If a friend came to you with the same fears, what might you tell them?

User: I would probably say that they are capable and that failing doesn't define who they are. 

Consultant: That’s a lovely perspective! You see, you’re capable, and it’s important to remind yourself of that too. Can we think of some smaller, more manageable steps you can take towards your studies rather than feeling overwhelmed?

User: Maybe breaking my study sessions into smaller parts might help, like studying for just 30 minutes and then taking a break. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Implementing shorter study sessions can help reduce feeling overwhelmed. How can you incorporate breaks to recharge during those study sessions?

User: I could take a short walk or listen to music between study sessions to take my mind off things for a bit.

Consultant: Those are great ways to reset your focus! Let's also consider your sleep. Have you been getting enough rest, or is anxiety impacting your ability to sleep? 

User: I haven’t slept well lately. I keep thinking about my schoolwork, and it's hard to relax.

Consultant: Sleep is vital for your mental clarity and concentration. Would you be open to discussing some relaxation techniques to help improve your sleep routine? 

User: Yes, I think that would help a lot. I need to find a way to unwind before bed.

Consultant: One technique can be to establish a calming pre-sleep routine, like reading a book or practicing deep breathing exercises. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I've heard about deep breathing but never actually tried it!

Consultant: It’s very effective! It helps calm your mind and reduces anxiety. We can practice a simple breathing technique together to see how it feels. Would you like to try?

User: Sure, I’d love to try!

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a second, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Repeat this a few times, focusing on each breath. 

User: Okay, I’m trying it now. It's actually calming!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Regular practice of this technique can help you feel more relaxed, especially before exams. Moving forward, let’s have you share these techniques with someone at home. Would you feel comfortable doing that?

User: Yeah, I think sharing this with my mom might help her too. She’s been really stressed about work.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea. Supporting each other can strengthen your connection, too. As we wrap up today, what do you think would be the next best step for you regarding your studies and well-being? 

User: I think I’m going to implement shorter study breaks and practice deep breathing before sleep. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan to begin with! Remember, progress is a journey, and it’s okay to take small steps. How are you feeling about today’s session overall?

User: I feel a bit lighter, and more hopeful. I'm excited to try these new techniques.

Consultant: That’s great to hear, Xiao Jia! It’s important to recognize your progress. For our next meeting, we can discuss how these strategies worked for you and address any new feelings that may arise. 

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: You're welcome! I'm here to support you. Until next time, take care!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaojia! Welcome to today’s session. I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. I’ve still been having those unsettling dreams, and they leave me feeling exhausted during the day. I really want to overcome this, but sometimes I doubt my ability to handle it.

Consultant: I can see that those dreams are quite challenging for you and that it's affecting your energy. It’s understandable to feel uncertain when facing difficulties. Let’s talk about what specifically has been bothering you about these dreams. Can you share a bit more about them?

User: They often feel really vivid and stressful, like I'm failing at exams or disappointing my family. I wake up feeling anxious, and it makes it hard to focus on my studies.

Consultant: That sounds very overwhelming, and it's not surprising that it impacts your focus. It seems like these dreams are linking back to some of your worries about your future and family expectations. Let’s explore this. When you have those dreams, what thoughts run through your mind when you wake up?

User: I often think that I’m not going to make it into the high school program, which feels like it would let everyone down. I hope to help my family, but I’m scared I won’t be enough.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way given the pressure you’re experiencing. Right now, those thoughts might be really magnifying your anxiety. Would you be open to trying a technique that could help you ground yourself when those negative thoughts arise?

User: Yes, I’d really like to learn something that could help.

Consultant: Great! One technique we can try is called deep breathing. It’s a simple yet effective way to calm your mind and body, especially when you start feeling overwhelmed. Would you like to practice it together now?

User: Sure, I’m willing to give it a try.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s take a moment to sit comfortably. We'll breathe in slowly through our nose for a count of four, hold for four, and then exhale through our mouth for a count of six. Ready? Let's start... (consultant guides the user through the breathing exercise). How did that feel for you?

User: It felt nice to focus on my breathing. I felt a little calmer afterward.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Deep breathing can be a powerful tool. Let’s connect this to your dreams. When you wake up from a troubling dream, you can use this method to help center yourself before the day begins. How do you feel about integrating this into your morning routine?

User: I think if I remember to do it, it could be helpful. Maybe it can give me a better start to the day.

Consultant: Absolutely! Starting your day with a sense of calm can help shift your mindset. Additionally, let’s talk about how you can challenge those negative thoughts related to your dreams. For example, when you think, "I won't make it into the high school program," we can transform that. What would be a more positive or realistic perspective?

User: I guess I could think about how I've been improving my study habits and that I do have support from my family and friends.

Consultant: That's an excellent reframing! Remembering your progress and support can create a more balanced outlook. Each time those anxious thoughts come up, try reminding yourself of that growth and support. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds encouraging. I like the idea of focusing on what I’ve accomplished rather than just my worries.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Progress takes time, and recognizing your achievements is essential. As we continue, let’s also explore ways to enhance your self-confidence, particularly in social situations. Are there any recent interactions you've had that made you feel good about yourself?

User: I talked more with a friend after class the other day, and it was nice. I didn’t feel as shy as I usually do.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Engaging with friends can definitely build confidence. It’s a healthy step towards improving your social skills. Let’s think about planning more opportunities like that. How about setting a goal to reach out to a friend or join a group activity that interests you?

User: That could work. I might feel anxious at first, but maybe if I prepare a little, I can do it.

Consultant: Preparation can make a big difference! It’s like building a cushion for yourself. You might even practice what you’d like to say to help ease your nerves. What kind of group activity sounds interesting to you?

User: There’s a study group for math that my friend invited me to. I think joining it could be beneficial.

Consultant: That sounds like a great opportunity! It’s a supportive environment where you can learn and connect with others. How about making a plan to attend that study group next week? It could be a fulfilling step forward.

User: I think I’ll try that. I’ll aim to go and see how it feels.

Consultant: Excellent mindset! This step could really reinforce your confidence and help improve your connection with others. Before we wrap up today, let's take a moment to reflect on what we've discussed. What do you feel has been the most helpful part of our conversation today?

User: Learning the deep breathing technique definitely helps, and I feel more hopeful about challenging my negative thoughts.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Xiaojia! Remember, implementing these techniques takes practice. What are two things you want to focus on practicing before our next session?

User: I’ll practice deep breathing, and I’ll try to reach out to friends more.

Consultant: Wonderful goals! You’re making significant progress. I'm proud of you for taking these steps. Remember, managing emotions and building confidence is a journey, and I'm here to support you along the way. I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session. 

User: Thank you so much. I appreciate your help!

Consultant: You’re welcome! Take care, Xiaojia, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaojia! I’m glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better. I’ve been trying to recognize my strengths, like my teacher suggested. It’s nice to think positively about myself for a change, but I still feel a bit anxious about talking with my classmates.

Consultant: That’s a great step forward, Xiaojia! It sounds like you’re starting to appreciate your qualities more. Can you share how you felt when you recognized those strengths? 

User: It felt really good! I realized I’m actually quite creative, and I even helped my friend with an art project. But then I also grew worried about whether others would see those strengths too, and that made me hesitate to speak up sometimes.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you were able to help your friend and feel creative! It’s normal to worry about how others perceive us. What do you think holds you back from speaking up?

User: I think I might be afraid of saying something silly or being judged. I often think about what could go wrong, and then I just stay quiet.

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like those thoughts are creating a barrier for you. Can you remember a specific situation where you felt this anxiety when thinking about speaking up?

User: Yes, just last week during group discussions. I had an idea but didn't say anything because I was worried it would be a dumb suggestion.

Consultant: That’s a relatable experience. What thoughts were running through your mind in that moment? How did those thoughts make you feel?

User: I just kept thinking about how everyone would react. I felt embarrassed even before I spoke, so I just stayed quiet. I felt like I was missing out.

Consultant: It’s tough when those thoughts take over and prevent you from sharing. Let’s dig a bit deeper: on a scale from 1 to 10, how much evidence do you have that others would judge you harshly for sharing your ideas?

User: Honestly, I’d say it’s more like a 3. I’ve had supportive friends, but my anxiety just makes me doubt it.

Consultant: That’s insightful, Xiaojia. It sounds like there’s a significant gap between your fears and the reality. What do you think would happen if you tried sharing your idea next time, even just a small one?

User: I guess it wouldn’t be as bad as I imagine. Maybe my friends would appreciate it. They’ve been encouraging lately.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like your friends are supportive, which is encouraging. What changes can you make to remind yourself of this support when you feel anxious about speaking up?

User: I could try to focus on their positive reactions instead of my worries. Maybe even tell myself that they want to hear what I think.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Shifting your focus to their support could help reduce your anxiety. How about we practice some potential phrases you could use to share your thoughts next time?

User: Sure! I think practicing would help. Maybe I could start with “I have an idea about…” That sounds safe.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Using a phrase like that could help ease you into the conversation. How do you feel about setting a small goal to try this out in your next group discussion?

User: I think I could do that. Maybe if I remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes, I can give it a try.

Consultant: That's an excellent mindset! Mistakes are part of learning and growing. Before our next session, let’s focus on this goal of sharing at least one idea. How do you feel about that plan?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited! It seems doable. I really want to improve.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel nervous when trying something new, but your excitement is a sign of your willingness to grow. Remember, you have already shown great progress! 

User: Thank you! I wouldn’t have started recognizing my strengths without your help. 

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xiaojia! It’s all about building on your strengths. Just a quick reminder: stay compassionate with yourself. It takes time to develop these skills.

User: I will! I really appreciate the support. I feel more confident now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, could you share what you feel your biggest takeaway is from our session?

User: I think it’s that I can challenge my fears and remember the support around me. Sharing my ideas might not be so scary after all.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a powerful realization. You’ve made wonderful progress today. Remember, you have the tools to manage those feelings and improve your communication. 

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to our next session and will keep practicing.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive plan, Xiaojia! Keep believing in yourself. I look forward to hearing how it goes. If you feel anxious, just remind yourself how much you’ve grown. 

User: I will! Thanks for your encouragement. See you next time!

Consultant: Take care, Xiaojia! I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hi there, Xiao Jia! It’s great to see you again. I’m really looking forward to hearing how you’ve been since our last session. How have you been feeling about your recent experiences at school?

User: Hi! I feel quite good, actually. I participated in some recent school activities and collaborated with my classmates. It really boosted my confidence, and I felt appreciated for my contributions.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It seems like those activities had a positive impact on your self-esteem. Can you tell me more about how you felt during those collaborations? 

User: I felt like I belonged and was part of something. It was nice to see my ideas valued by others. I think it made me realize that I can work well with people.

Consultant: It’s fantastic that you’re feeling a sense of belonging and teamwork. How has this newfound confidence influenced your daily life or studies?

User: I’ve been trying to communicate more with my classmates and join in on discussions. I feel less isolated now, and it’s easier to ask for help when I need it.

Consultant: That’s a significant step! It’s great to hear you’re reaching out more. Have you noticed any changes in how you approach your studies with this new level of confidence?

User: Yes! I find it less daunting to tackle my assignments. I think I’m less worried about not measuring up, and I’m focusing more on enjoying the learning process.

Consultant: That’s really important. Enjoying the learning process can help ease some of that study-related anxiety. Are there any specific subjects or activities that you’re enjoying more now?

User: I’ve been enjoying group projects in science class. Collaborating with others makes it so much more engaging, and I feel more motivated.

Consultant: Collaborating in group projects can be so enriching! It sounds like you’ve found a way to connect your social experiences to your academic interests. What’s your plan for continuing this positive trend?

User: I want to keep working with my classmates and maybe even start a study group. I think that could keep me motivated and make studying more fun.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! A study group can not only enhance your learning but also strengthen those connections. What steps do you think you can take to initiate this study group?

User: I could talk to a few friends and see who’s interested. It might help to plan some fun activities around studying to make it less stressful.

Consultant: Involving fun activities is a wonderful approach to keep it light-hearted and engaging. How do you feel about reaching out to your friends for this?

User: I feel pretty excited about it! I think they’ll be on board, and it sounds like a great way to bond too.

Consultant: It’s great to see your enthusiasm! Keeping those connections strong will support both your academic goals and emotional well-being. Have you had any concerns or worries lately, even with these positive changes?

User: Occasionally, I still feel a bit anxious about the upcoming exams, but I’m trying to remind myself of the progress I’ve made.

Consultant: Acknowledging that anxiety is a healthy step. Let’s explore how you can manage those anxious feelings as exams approach. What does the anxiety feel like for you?

User: It feels like a tightness in my chest, and I sometimes doubt if my preparation is enough.

Consultant: That’s a common experience before exams. Let’s challenge those doubts. What evidence do you have that your preparation isn’t enough?

User: I guess I don’t have concrete evidence; it’s just a feeling. I have been studying more than before.

Consultant: It’s important to differentiate between feelings and facts. Let’s focus on the efforts you’ve put in. What strategies have worked for you so far in your studies?

User: I’ve been using a planner to organize my time better and sticking to a study schedule. It really helps me feel more in control.

Consultant: That’s an effective strategy! Staying organized can significantly reduce anxiety. How can we build on this to further reinforce your preparation for the exams?

User: Maybe I can stick to a stricter schedule in the weeks leading up to the exams, and include time for relaxation and fun activities too.

Consultant: Balancing study with relaxation is essential. It helps maintain your mental health while being productive. What fun activities do you think you can include?

User: I can schedule some time for sports or maybe even some movie nights with friends to unwind.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent ways to keep your balance! As we approach the end of our session today, how satisfied do you feel with the progress you’re making in managing your anxiety and building your confidence?

User: I feel really satisfied! I’ve learned a lot about being proactive and connecting with others. I’m excited to see where this goes!

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! You’ve made wonderful strides, and I believe you'll continue this positive journey. How can you maintain this momentum moving forward?

User: I’ll keep reminding myself of the progress I’ve made and stay connected with my friends for support.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’ll do my best to keep moving forward. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and see you at our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jia! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good actually. I think I've been managing my anxieties better, especially with school. I don't feel overwhelmed by exams anymore.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Jia! It sounds like you've made significant progress in managing your anxiety about exams. Can you share what changes you've noticed in your feelings or thoughts regarding school?

User: Well, I used to dread my exams and felt like I couldn't study at all. Now, I actually enjoy participating in school activities and feel more engaged in my classes.

Consultant: It’s fantastic that you’re enjoying school activities! What do you think contributed to this positive change in your mindset?

User: I believe it’s because I've started to focus more on my daily progress instead of just fixating on big exams. Setting smaller goals has really helped.

Consultant: That sounds like a very effective strategy! How do you feel when you achieve these smaller goals? 

User: I feel accomplished and more confident in my studies. It also takes some of the pressure off.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re experiencing that sense of accomplishment. What would you say are some of the longer-term goals you envision for yourself, especially regarding your studies and personal development?

User: I want to do well enough in school to get into a good high school. I also want to keep improving my study habits and maybe even help my brother with his studies.

Consultant: Those are admirable goals, Jia! Helping your brother is such a kind intention. Have you thought about how you can maintain your emotional health while pursuing these goals?

User: I think I need to keep reminding myself not to put too much pressure on myself. Sometimes I still feel anxious about the future.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious about the future. What strategies do you currently use when those anxious feelings arise?

User: I try to practice deep breathing and remind myself that I can only do my best. It helps a bit.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a great technique to manage anxiety. Let’s build on that—would you be open to exploring other coping strategies together that could further support your emotional health?

User: Yes, I’d love that! I want to have more tools to deal with my feelings.

Consultant: Excellent! We could discuss some activities or techniques you can incorporate into your routine to help you stay grounded. Do you have any hobbies or interests that you find relaxing?

User: I enjoy drawing and listening to music. They both help me unwind.

Consultant: Those are wonderful outlets! Incorporating your drawing or music into your study breaks could be a great strategy. How do you think this integration could benefit you during your study sessions?

User: I think taking breaks to draw or listen to music will help me recharge and feel less overwhelmed.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s important to give yourself those breaks. Let’s make a plan—how about we schedule specific times for these activities during your study sessions?

User: That sounds like a good idea! I can set a timer for 25 minutes of studying followed by a 5-minute break for drawing.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! How do you feel about taking that approach? Do you think you might be able to stick with it?

User: Yes, I think I can! I like the idea of timed breaks. It sounds manageable.

Consultant: Great to hear, Jia! I believe this structured approach will help maintain your focus while allowing for relaxation. As we wrap this session up, let’s reflect on what you’ve learned today. What stands out to you?

User: I feel more confident in knowing my progress and the importance of taking breaks for my mental health. 

Consultant: That's a significant takeaway! Remember, maintaining balance between work and relaxation is key for your emotional well-being. What strategies can you employ if you start to feel overwhelmed again in the future?

User: I can remind myself to take breaks and practice my deep breathing techniques. 

Consultant: Yes! You have a plan in place. As we conclude our sessions for now, can you think of anything else you might need to keep this progress going?

User: I think just reminding myself of what I've learned has been helpful. And knowing I can always come back if I need help!

Consultant: Exactly, Jia! You’ve learned some valuable skills during our time together. If you ever need support, you’re welcome to return anytime. You've made great strides, and I believe in your ability to manage your emotions and achieve your goals.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate this support and the strategies you’ve shared with me.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of your progress. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to hearing about your achievements in the future!
