Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm glad to see you today. I understand that you’ve been facing some challenges lately. Can you share a bit about how you've been feeling recently?

User: Hi. I've been really struggling since my breakup last year. I feel so down and lost. School is tough right now, and I’m worried about failing.

Consultant: It sounds like you're dealing with some heavy emotions related to your breakup and the pressure from school. Can you tell me more about what specifically is making you feel lost in your studies?

User: Well, after the breakup, I just lost all motivation. I used to be a good student, but now I spend most of my time playing games instead of studying. It feels like the only thing that makes me feel better.

Consultant: I can imagine how hard it must be to experience such a shift from being a high achiever to feeling unmotivated. It’s understandable to seek comfort in gaming during such difficult times. Can you describe how gaming helps you cope with your feelings?

User: When I play games, I can escape reality for a while. I forget about my problems and the pressure of school. But I know it's not a real solution.

Consultant: It seems like gaming provides a temporary relief from the overwhelming emotions you’re experiencing. However, it might also be contributing to your stress about school. What do you think about that?

User: Yes, I can see that. My grades are slipping because I'm not studying. I feel stuck between wanting to stop gaming and not knowing how to get motivated.

Consultant: That feeling of being stuck can be incredibly frustrating. Let’s explore this further. What do you think would help you feel more motivated to study again?

User: I guess if I could find a way to enjoy studying or feel a sense of accomplishment, it would help. But right now, all I want to do is game.

Consultant: Achieving a sense of accomplishment is important. We could explore some strategies to help you find enjoyment in studying again. What do you think your ideal study session would look like?

User: I think if I had a clear plan and maybe some rewards for completing tasks, it could make things less overwhelming. But it feels so hard to even start right now.

Consultant: Setting a clear plan sounds like a great idea. It could help break down your tasks into manageable pieces. Can we think of some small, achievable goals for your study plan together?

User: Sure. Maybe I could start with just an hour of study a day? That doesn't sound too bad.

Consultant: That's a fantastic start! Focusing on just one hour can help create a sense of routine. How would you feel about setting a specific time for that study session?

User: I think setting a time could help. Maybe in the evening after dinner when I’m more relaxed?

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Having a specific time in mind makes it easier to commit. How can we ensure you stick to that study time?

User: I could set a reminder on my phone. And maybe I could reward myself with some game time after I finish studying.

Consultant: Great idea! Using reminders and rewards can create a positive reinforcement cycle. It can also help you gradually reduce the time spent on gaming. How do you feel about approaching your study time that way?

User: I feel a little more hopeful about it. It still seems overwhelming, but breaking it down into smaller steps makes it feel more manageable.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! It’s great to hear you feel hopeful. As you begin this new routine, what concerns do you have about balancing study time with gaming?

User: I just worry that once I start gaming, I won’t stop. It’s hard to control myself sometimes.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those concerns. We can explore ways to create limits for your gaming sessions. What kind of boundaries do you think would work for you?

User: Maybe I could limit my gaming to a few hours in the evening after studying? But I’m not sure I can stick to it.

Consultant: Establishing a set limit can help. It's important to be flexible with yourself as you adjust. We can talk about some strategies to help you manage those impulses, like setting timers. How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful. I think having timers would remind me when to stop. It’s just the start that’s hard.

Consultant: Starting is often the hardest part. Once you begin to see progress, it may motivate you to keep going. Let’s focus on how you can feel more ready to start today. What support do you think you need to get going?

User: I think just knowing that I have a plan could help. It’s reassuring to talk about this, and having someone to share my progress with makes a difference.

Consultant: I'm here to support you, and it’s great to hear that our conversation is helpful. As you work on these plans, would it help to keep a journal of your study sessions and feelings?

User: Yes, I’d like that. Writing things down could help me reflect and keep track of my progress.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Journaling can help you process your feelings and monitor your achievements. For our next session, let’s discuss how implementing these strategies worked for you. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I’ll do my best to follow through with the plan. Thank you for your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Chen! It’s been a productive session, and I look forward to hearing about your progress. Remember, it’s okay to take this one step at a time. Take care, and I’ll see you next time!

User: See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Chen! It's great to see you again today. Let's start by discussing how you've been feeling since our last session.

User: Hi! I've been feeling more anxious than ever, especially with my exams right around the corner. I've tried to cut back on gaming, but I still find myself playing a lot to escape from the stress.

Consultant: I see. So, the pressure from exams is intensifying your anxiety, and gaming serves as a way to cope with those feelings. Can you tell me what specifically about the exams makes you feel anxious?

User: I worry about failing. I used to do so well, and now it feels like I'm facing this huge risk of having to drop out of university. It just overwhelms me.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Chen. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when there’s a lot at stake. Let’s take a minute to unpack that—what do you think would happen if you were to fail just one exam?

User: I guess I feel like everyone would be disappointed in me, and I would let myself down. It just spirals out of control in my head.

Consultant: It sounds like there are a lot of expectations weighing on you, both from yourself and others. When you think about these thoughts of disappointment, how do they make you feel in the moment?

User: It makes me feel even more anxious and powerless. I want to do well, but I can’t seem to focus on studying.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. When anxiety takes over, it can make focus really difficult. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that pop up when you sit down to study?

User: I often think things like "What if I don’t understand anything?" or "I’m going to fail anyway," which just leads me back to gaming.

Consultant: Those negative thoughts can be quite powerful. Let’s explore that a bit. How much evidence do you have that those thoughts are true? Is there a possibility that there are different perspectives to consider?

User: I don’t really have solid evidence, I guess. But they just feel so real when I’m stressed.

Consultant: It’s common for those thoughts to feel very believable during stressful times. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about those thoughts?

User: I’d probably say they’re being too hard on themselves and should focus on what they can control.

Consultant: That's a great perspective! Now, how might you start applying that same advice to yourself? What could you do to focus on what you can control right now?

User: Maybe I could break my study sessions into smaller chunks and reward myself after each one instead of thinking about the overall outcome?

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Breaking things down can make the task feel less daunting. What kind of rewards do you think would motivate you?

User: I could allow myself some game time after completing a study session. It would feel more earned and less like I’m just running away from stress.

Consultant: That sounds fair! You’re creating a balance between responsibilities and self-care. Have you thought about implementing any relaxation techniques to help manage your anxiety?

User: I’ve heard of mindfulness but never really tried it. I’m not sure how it would help.

Consultant: Mindfulness can be a great tool for managing anxiety. It involves staying present and observing your thoughts without judgment. Would you be open to trying some simple mindfulness exercises together?

User: Yeah, I’d be willing to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let's start with a brief exercise. Focus on your breath; inhale deeply for four counts. Hold it for four, then slowly exhale for six. Let’s do this a few times. How are you feeling after that?

User: It feels a bit calming. I didn’t realize how tense I was until I focused on my breath.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, practicing mindfulness regularly can help reduce anxiety over time. How likely do you think you could incorporate that into your daily routine alongside your studies?

User: I’d like to try doing it for a few minutes before I study. It might help me start off with a clearer mind.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea, Chen. Starting with just a few minutes can make a difference. Let’s touch on your gaming. How do you feel about your current gaming habits? Do you see a possibility to change them gradually?

User: I see I’ve been using gaming as an escape, but I do want to cut back on it. I think setting limits could help.

Consultant: Yes, that feels like a healthy boundary to set. What kind of limits do you think would work for you? 

User: Maybe I could restrict myself to an hour of gaming after I've completed my study goals for the day.

Consultant: That sounds very reasonable! Setting those boundaries can help you avoid falling into endless gaming sessions. What do you think will be the biggest challenge in implementing this plan?

User: I think it might be tough to stick to the limit, especially when I want to play more. I guess adjusting that could be hard.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to face challenges with limits. If you find yourself struggling, we can always brainstorm alternative activities or coping strategies. How do you feel about trusting yourself to follow through?

User: I want to believe I can do it, but I worry I might fall back into old habits.

Consultant: It’s natural to have that worry, but remember that change is a process. You’re already taking significant steps by identifying these issues—allow yourself grace as you try to implement these changes. Let’s keep checking in on this, okay?

User: Yes! I appreciate that. I guess I just want to make sure I’m improving and not stuck in this cycle.

Consultant: Absolutely, and it’s great that you’re motivated for change. What would you like your next steps to be for our upcoming sessions? 

User: I’d like to focus on setting those study goals and maybe go deeper into mindfulness if that’s possible.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid next step! We’ll continue to work on setting those goals and explore mindfulness further. Remember, this journey takes time, and I’m here to support you. Thank you for sharing so openly today, Chen.

User: Thank you for listening and guiding me. I feel a bit more hopeful after talking today.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s keep building on this progress. I look forward to seeing you next time. Take care!

User: You too! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. I know you've been feeling a bit lost lately, especially with your studies and the feelings of loneliness. Let's start by discussing how you’re doing right now. What’s on your mind?

User: Hi. I've really been struggling. I want to study more and reduce my gaming time, but I just can't seem to stay motivated. Sometimes I feel like I’m just not good enough. It’s lonely, and that just makes everything harder.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling trapped between wanting to change and the feelings of loneliness and self-doubt that are holding you back. Can you share more about what motivates you when you do manage to study? 

User: I guess I feel motivated when I think about my future and what I can achieve. But lately, it feels so difficult to remember those goals. I keep falling back into old habits, and I feel really frustrated with myself.

Consultant: That frustration is completely understandable. It’s hard when you want to change but feel stuck. Let’s explore those goals together. What would achieving them look like for you?

User: I imagine being able to study without distractions, feeling confident with my coursework, and not constantly checking my phone or thinking about games. I just want to feel productive again.

Consultant: Feeling productive can bring real satisfaction, especially when you’re able to follow through on those study sessions. Can you recall a time when you felt productive like that? What was different then?

User: Back in the first year, I was really focused on my classes. I would set small goals each week, and I felt really accomplished as I met them. But now, it feels overwhelming.

Consultant: It seems like setting smaller goals really helped you in the past. Perhaps we could explore how to break down your current objectives into manageable pieces. What small step could you take this week to help you feel more in control?

User: Maybe I could start with studying for just one hour a day. That seems doable. I could definitely try that.

Consultant: One hour sounds like a wonderful start! It's great that you’re willing to take that step. As you work on this, how do you think you might feel after accomplishing those one-hour study sessions?

User: I think I would likely feel more accomplished. Maybe it would help build up my confidence again. But I’m still worried about feeling lonely when I’m studying.

Consultant: Loneliness can definitely make things tougher, especially when you’re trying to focus on your studies. Are there ways we can incorporate some social interaction into your study routine? You might not have to study alone all the time.

User: I could ask some classmates if they want to study together. I think that might motivate me more than studying alone. I’ve just been hesitant to reach out because I don’t know if they’ll be interested.

Consultant: Reaching out can feel daunting, but it could lead to valuable connections. Remember, they might be feeling the same way too. You could suggest a study group or a study session over coffee. How does that sound to you?

User: That actually sounds like a good idea. It might help me feel less alone and more accountable.

Consultant: Absolutely! Accountability can play a significant role in motivation. Plus, building those connections can really help alleviate loneliness. Have you thought about how you might ask them?

User: I guess I could just send a message in our class chat and see who’s interested. It sounds simple but effective.

Consultant: That’s a perfect approach! Keeping it informal helps to ease the pressure, too. How do you think you would feel after sending that message?

User: I think I would feel relieved. Even if no one wants to join, I’ll at least have taken the step to reach out.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective. It’s about taking action and opening the door, regardless of the outcome. Let's also talk about how you can reward yourself after each study session. What would make you feel good when you complete that hour?

User: Maybe I could allow myself some time to play games after I study. It would motivate me to get through it. 

Consultant: That sounds like a balanced reward! This way, you’re still able to enjoy gaming but also making progress in your studies. It’s all about finding that balance. Do you think this could help improve your motivation?

User: I really think so. Having that reward waiting for me might make me push through the study time. I’m feeling a bit more hopeful about it now.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Feeling hopeful is a great sign. As we work together, it’s important to keep track of those small victories, too. How about we set a plan for the week where you can write down your progress and feelings after each study session?

User: That’s a good idea. I can use a journal to reflect on how I felt after studying. It might help me see my progress better.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Journaling can help you connect with your feelings and recognize your progress. Let’s check in at our next session to see how it goes. How does that sound?

User: Sounds great! I’m looking forward to it. I feel like I finally have a plan.

Consultant: Wonderful! I'm excited for you, too. Remember to reach out to those classmates and give yourself credit for each step you take. You’re making progress! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate the support. I feel more motivated to take action now.

Consultant: You’re most welcome! You've shown such a willingness to change, and that’s a huge first step. Let’s continue this path together. I’ll see you next week!

User: See you next week!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm really glad to see you today. It seems like you’ve been making some positive changes recently. How are you feeling about your progress?

User: Hi, I feel a bit hopeful. Trying out new activities has been interesting, and it's nice to start building new friendships. But I still struggle with the urge to play games too much.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you’re feeling hopeful and enjoying new connections. It’s completely normal to have that urge to retreat into gaming, especially when it’s been a comfort in the past. Can you tell me more about what activities you've tried and how they've impacted your feelings?

User: I joined a book club and a sports group at school. The book club discussions have been fun, and the sports group helps me get some exercise. I feel lighter after those meetings, but I still find it hard to not go back to gaming afterward.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful step! Engaging in these activities can really help in boosting your mood and improving your social skills. It’s understandable to feel tempted to return to gaming, as it offers an immediate escape. What are some thoughts you have when you feel the urge to play games instead of participating in these activities?

User: Sometimes I think it’s just easier to play games, and I feel like I can control it better than social interactions. I worry that I won't be good enough or that I won't fit in.

Consultant: Those thoughts are quite common when stepping out of your comfort zone. It’s easy to default to what feels safe and familiar. Let's explore that a bit. What evidence do you have that supports those thoughts about not fitting in or not being good enough in social settings?

User: I guess I don’t have strong evidence—it's more of a fear. In the past, I've felt awkward in groups. I often hesitate to share my opinions or join in discussions.

Consultant: It sounds like you may be dealing with some negative thoughts that have built up from past experiences. What if we try to challenge those thoughts together? If a friend were in your position, how would you encourage them to view their own potential in social situations?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone feels awkward sometimes and that it's okay to just try and not be perfect. It's the effort that counts.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s all about the effort and the experience of connecting with others. Now, let’s think about some small, realistic goals you could set for your next social activity. What might be something you could practice to feel more comfortable?

User: Maybe I could try to share at least one thought during the next book club meeting. That feels manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic goal! Sharing even a small thought can help you build confidence. How do you think you might feel after accomplishing that goal?

User: I think I’d feel proud of myself. If I can do that, maybe it will help me feel more confident for the next time.

Consultant: Definitely! Each small success can build on the last. It’s about creating a positive feedback loop for yourself. Now, let’s also think about strategies to manage your gaming time. What could help you balance your gaming with the new activities you're enjoying?

User: I could set specific times to play games, maybe keeping it to just the weekends so during the week I focus on other things.

Consultant: That sounds like a reasonable plan. Setting boundaries can help create the space you need for those new activities. What might you do during the week instead of gaming to keep you engaged?

User: I could go to the gym on weekdays or spend more time reading. I also want to explore some new hobbies like painting or cooking.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful alternatives! Exploring new hobbies not only keeps you engaged but also allows you to discover more about yourself. How can you start integrating these new activities into your daily routine?

User: I could set aside specific times each day to try new hobbies or go to the gym. Maybe an hour for painting after classes?

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Structuring your time can help you transition smoothly into those positive activities. You might also want to reflect on how you felt after engaging in those activities compared to when you play games. What do you think that impact will look like?

User: I think I’ll feel more fulfilled and less anxious after being productive and creative rather than just zoning out in front of a screen.

Consultant: Absolutely! Feeling fulfilled and engaged in meaningful activities can significantly improve your overall well-being. Let’s make this a part of our routine; you can start by journaling your thoughts and feelings after trying each new activity. How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful! I’ve never really considered keeping a journal, but it might help me see my progress clearly.

Consultant: It can be a powerful tool to reflect on your journey and monitor your behavior patterns. Would you like to set a mini-goal for journaling this week, perhaps writing down your feelings after trying a new activity?

User: Yes, I’ll try to write after every new thing I do this week. I think that would keep me motivated.

Consultant: Perfect! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time we meet. Remember, it’s all about taking small steps to reinforce your confidence and sense of accomplishment. 

User: Thank you! I feel more excited about this week already. 

Consultant: You’re making great strides, Chen. Keep that momentum going! Remember that you have the capability to create positive changes in your life, and I’m here to support you. See you next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello Chen! I'm really glad to see you again today. It sounds like you’ve had some positive experiences since our last session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel like a weight has been lifted a bit. Participating in the volunteer activity really helped me see that I can contribute and feel good about it. But I'm still worried about my studies and the risk of dropping out.

Consultant: It's great to hear that volunteering has had such a positive impact on your mood! You mentioned concerns about your studies. Can you tell me more about what’s been on your mind regarding that?

User: Well, I used to be a top student, but with everything that happened after my breakup, I’ve lost my motivation. I’m worried I won’t be able to get back on track in time.

Consultant: That sounds challenging, especially given how much pressure you might be feeling. You’ve experienced a significant change in your motivation. What do you think has changed in how you approach your studies since then?

User: I guess I tend to avoid studying because it reminds me of how I used to excel. Now, just thinking about picking up my books makes me anxious, and I put it off until the last minute.

Consultant: Avoiding studying seems to be a coping mechanism for your anxiety. Let’s explore this a bit. When you think about studying, what specific thoughts come to mind that make you feel this way?

User: I often think, “What’s the point? I'm just going to fail anyway.” It feels overwhelming, and I can't shake the notion that I won’t be able to catch up.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re grappling with some very negative thoughts about your abilities. Can we take a moment to challenge those thoughts? What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you will fail?

User: I don’t have much evidence apart from my current feelings. It's more like a fear than anything concrete.

Consultant: That's a valid point. Often, our feelings can amplify our fears, leading us to believe things that aren't necessarily true. If a friend were in your situation, what advice do you think you would give them?

User: I’d probably tell them to take it one step at a time and that it’s okay to ask for help.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate response! It’s important to allow yourself the same kindness. Let's consider creating a structured plan for your studies. What small steps could you take to get started?

User: Maybe I could start with short study sessions, just 20 minutes a day, and then gradually increase that time.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea, Chen! Starting small can help rebuild your confidence. What specific subject or topic do you think you could begin with?

User: I think I’ll start with my math assignments. I find them the most daunting, so tackling them first might relieve some tension.

Consultant: That sounds like a good strategy. Tackling math first could provide you with a sense of accomplishment. How about setting a goal for this week where you aim for those short study sessions?

User: That makes sense. I’ll aim for four days this week. 

Consultant: Excellent! It’s important to celebrate those small achievements. How will you manage your time to fit these study sessions into your schedule?

User: I think I could set reminders on my phone. I can also reduce some leisure time, maybe limit my gaming for this week.

Consultant: Adjusting your leisure time sounds like a responsible approach. Remember, balance is key. How do you feel about your decision to prioritize your studying this week?

User: I feel a bit more in control, actually. It feels good to have a plan.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Chen! It seems like you’re starting to regain some control over your situation. Let’s discuss how you can reward yourself after completing those study sessions to keep up the motivation.

User: I could treat myself to some time with friends or a nice meal afterward. That sounds like a good incentive.

Consultant: I love that idea! Rewards can be a great way to reinforce positive behaviors. How does thinking about spending time with friends or enjoying a treat make you feel in terms of motivation?

User: It makes me excited. I think having something to look forward to will help keep me on track.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset to have! As we look ahead, let's ensure we also address how you can maintain the momentum you've built. What strategies can you think of to keep your motivation strong moving forward?

User: I could keep a journal to reflect on what I’ve accomplished each week. That might help me see my progress.

Consultant: Keeping a journal is a fantastic strategy. It allows you to visualize your growth over time. How do you feel about the idea of tracking your feelings and experiences along with your academic progress?

User: I think it will really help. I can see patterns and understand how I’m feeling about my studies week by week.

Consultant: Absolutely! This can be a powerful tool for self-reflection. As we near the end of our session, let’s recap what you’ve committed to for this week.

User: I’ll have short study sessions four days this week, focus on math, and reward myself afterward. I’ll also start a journal to track everything.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Chen! It’s important to recognize your efforts. Remember that it’s okay to reach out for support at any time. How do you feel about everything we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel positive and more confident now. I really appreciate your help!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’ve made incredible progress, and I believe you can continue on this path. Remember, you have the tools to manage your feelings and keep moving forward. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to come back to talk. 

User: Thank you so much. I think I can do this now!

Consultant: You absolutely can, Chen! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hi there! It's great to see you again. I'm really looking forward to hearing about your progress since our last session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I actually feel pretty good. I've been working on my studies and trying to maintain my new lifestyle. I’ve also made a clear distinction between that and my past gaming addiction.

Consultant: That sounds really positive! It's great to hear you've been able to move forward and focus on your studies. Can you tell me more about what specific changes you've noticed in your study habits or daily life?

User: I've started sticking to a study schedule and I've found that I can concentrate better. I no longer feel the urge to play games all night. I think having a routine has really helped.

Consultant: It seems like establishing a routine is making a significant difference for you. That's a huge step! How do you feel about your motivation to study now compared to before?

User: My motivation has definitely improved. Now, I actually look forward to studying instead of dreading it. It's a relief to feel that way again.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Looking forward to studying can be a powerful motivator. Have there been any challenges or distractions that you've faced recently while trying to maintain this new routine?

User: Well, sometimes I feel overwhelmed with assignments or I get distracted by social media. But I usually manage to get back on track.

Consultant: It's normal to face some distractions and feelings of overwhelm, especially with a busy schedule. What strategies have you found helpful when distractions arise?

User: I try to set specific time blocks for studying without my phone nearby. And if I start to feel really overwhelmed, I take short breaks to clear my head.

Consultant: Those sound like effective strategies! Taking breaks can be very beneficial in maintaining focus. Have you noticed any patterns in what triggers those feelings of being overwhelmed?

User: I think it's when I have too many assignments due at once. I start to panic and feel like I can't keep up.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed with a lot on your plate. How do you typically manage that panic when it sets in?

User: I used to just avoid studying altogether, but now I try to break the assignments into smaller tasks and tackle them one at a time.

Consultant: That's a smart approach! By breaking tasks down, you make them more manageable. It helps reduce that feeling of being overwhelmed. How do you feel about your ability to handle challenges like this now compared to before our sessions began?

User: I feel more equipped to deal with them. I have strategies now, and I trust myself to be able to get through difficult times.

Consultant: It's amazing to see how far you’ve come! Building that self-trust is crucial. Have you thought about what you might do to keep these positive changes in place moving forward?

User: I think maintaining my routine is key. And maybe I can check in with a study group or friends to stay accountable.

Consultant: Great thoughts! Accountability can really support your progress. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on your journey. What would you say has been your biggest achievement so far?

User: Honestly, just gaining back my interest in my studies and the motivation to keep going. It feels good to be in control again.

Consultant: That is a significant achievement! You’ve worked hard to overcome obstacles, and it’s wonderful to see your positive outlook. Remember to lean on those strategies and the support of friends as you continue this journey. Is there anything specific you’d like to explore in future sessions, or do you feel confident moving forward on your own for now?

User: I feel pretty confident moving forward. But I’d like to have a check-in in a few weeks just to see how things are going.

Consultant: Absolutely! Regular check-ins can be a great way to maintain your progress. I’m here for you whenever you need support. For now, it sounds like you’re in a great place! Thank you for sharing your experiences today. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I will definitely keep in touch if I need anything further.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Wishing you continued success and happiness in your studies and life. Take care!
