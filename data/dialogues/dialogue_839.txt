Consultant: Hello Liu! I’m glad you could join me today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious and down. My concentration has been terrible at school, and I just don’t feel like myself anymore. It’s getting frustrating.

Consultant: I’m sorry to hear that, it sounds really challenging. Can you share more about what’s been happening at school that's affecting your concentration?

User: Well, I keep getting distracted during classes, and I can't focus on my studies. I feel like everyone can see that something's wrong with me, which makes me want to hide more.

Consultant: That sounds tough, feeling that others notice your struggles can increase the pressure. When you say you want to hide, what thoughts are coming up for you in those moments?

User: I just feel like I'm not good enough. If I can't keep up, then I don't belong there. It's embarrassing.

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like you're being really hard on yourself. You feel that if you can't keep up, it means you don't belong. Let's explore this belief a bit—what evidence do you see that supports that thought?

User: I don’t know... it just feels true. I see classmates who seem so competent and confident, and then there's me.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way when comparing ourselves to others. But are there instances where you have succeeded or felt capable in your studies or interactions?

User: Sometimes I do well in certain subjects, but I rarely feel like I can communicate with my classmates. It feels more comfortable to just keep to myself.

Consultant: It’s great that you can recognize your strengths in some subjects. Staying to yourself might provide comfort, but it seems like it might also contribute to that feeling of isolation you mentioned. How do you feel about trying to connect with classmates, even in small ways?

User: I guess I'm afraid they won’t want to talk to me or that I won’t know what to say. 

Consultant: That fear of being rejected or not fitting in is quite common. Let’s challenge that thought. If a friend expressed similar fears, what would you say to them?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to try and that not everyone will judge them. 

Consultant: Exactly! Maybe we can turn that compassionate attitude toward yourself as well. What if you allowed yourself to take small steps toward connecting with others without the pressure of having to be perfect?

User: That sounds less intimidating. Perhaps I could start by smiling at someone or saying hello.

Consultant: Those are wonderful steps! Simple gestures can open up avenues for connection. Let's discuss some strategies to help you practice this. In the upcoming week, could you plan to greet one person each day?

User: I think I could do that. It might help to make me feel a little less anxious about it.

Consultant: Absolutely! And remember, each small step counts. How do you think you might feel after trying this for a week?

User: I hope I’ll feel more comfortable. Even if it's just a little boost, I think it could help.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! As you take these steps, keep in mind that feelings of anxiety may still pop up, but it’s about gradually building your confidence. How do you plan to handle any anxieties that come up?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that it’s okay to feel anxious but that I’m still trying.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy—acknowledging your feelings while also recognizing your effort. Let’s reflect a bit. How do you feel about the insights you've gained today regarding your avoidance behavior and your desire to connect?

User: I feel a bit motivated. I realize that my avoidance might be creating more problems, and I want to change that, even if it feels scary.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear you say that! Understanding the relationship between avoidance and feelings of isolation is a big step. Before we end today’s session, let’s establish a few affirmations you can remind yourself of when you feel unsure.

User: Okay, maybe something like “I am capable of taking small steps” or “It’s okay to feel anxious, but I can still try.”

Consultant: Those are fantastic affirmations! Using those can really help reinforce your self-worth. Remember, progress might take time, but you've already taken steps in the right direction. I believe in your ability to make these changes.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I think I’m ready to give it a try.

Consultant: I'm proud of you for the effort you're willing to put in. Let's summarize your goals for next week: greet one person each day, and remind yourself of your affirmations when anxiety arises. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I feel like I can do this.

Consultant: I have full faith in you, Liu. We’ll continue to work together on this. I look forward to seeing how your experiences unfold in our next session. If you need support in between, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: Thanks again! I feel more hopeful now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, change takes time and effort, and you’re doing great by just wanting to move forward. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Liu! Welcome back to our session. I'm glad to see you. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. I've been okay, but I still feel anxious about interacting with my classmates, especially after that encounter with the male classmate. I thought it would be a good experience, but instead, it made me even more anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like that encounter brought up some feelings of unease rather than relief. You mentioned wanting to understand your avoidance behavior better. Can you share what you were thinking and feeling during that encounter?

User: I felt nervous when he approached me. Even though he was friendly, I started thinking about what I might say and how I might come across. I worried I would say something silly and that he would judge me.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way in social situations, especially if you're already feeling anxious. Those thoughts can sometimes create a cycle that makes it harder to interact. What emotions did you notice when those thoughts came up?

User: I felt overwhelmed and wanted to just walk away. I felt embarrassed about how I reacted and that made me even more hesitant to approach him next time.

Consultant: That feeling of wanting to retreat is quite common when faced with anxiety-provoking situations. Have you noticed any patterns when you interact with others, particularly with guys?

User: Yes, I tend to avoid talking to them. I feel like I freeze up and can’t think of anything to say. I wish I could just be more comfortable around them.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really aware of your avoidance, which is a great first step. What do you think might happen if you tried to approach these interactions a bit differently next time?

User: I guess I would hope to feel less scared. Maybe if I could just say "hi" or ask a question, it wouldn’t feel so daunting.

Consultant: That’s a positive intention! We can work on small steps to help you feel more confident in approaching these situations. How about setting a goal of saying "hi" to a classmate the next time you see them? 

User: That actually sounds manageable. Just saying "hi" feels less intimidating than a full conversation.

Consultant: Absolutely! Starting small is a great approach. It might help to think about how you can remind yourself of this goal beforehand. What strategies could you use to prepare for this?

User: Maybe I could practice what I want to say beforehand, like a quick greeting or a simple question?

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Practicing can help reduce anxiety. Additionally, maintaining some notes on how you feel after each interaction might also provide valuable insights. How does that sound to you?

User: I think that could help! I could write down my thoughts and feelings afterward to see if there’s any change over time.

Consultant: Perfect! Tracking your thoughts and feelings can help reveal patterns and progress. Let’s also discuss how to cope with the anxiety itself. What do you think you could do in the moment if you start feeling anxious during these interactions?

User: I could take a deep breath and remind myself that it's okay to be nervous. It's just a conversation.

Consultant: That sounds like a helpful technique! Breathing and reminding yourself that it's normal to feel nervous can create space for you to engage despite your feelings. Is there anything else you feel would assist you in these moments?

User: I think having a friendly face nearby could help me feel more at ease. Maybe I could ask a friend to join me in social situations.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Having a friend with you can make interactions feel less intimidating. As you work on these small goals, remember to be patient with yourself. How do you feel about this plan we've laid out?

User: I feel pretty good about it! It seems achievable, and I'm excited to try it out.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we move forward, it’s important to keep reflecting on these experiences and how they make you feel. Let’s plan to check in about your progress in our next session. 

User: Okay, I will try my best and write down my experiences. Thank you for your guidance!

Consultant: You're welcome, Liu! I'm proud of your willingness to challenge yourself. Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. I’m here to support you. See you next time!

User: See you!
