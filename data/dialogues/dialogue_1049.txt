Consultant: Hello, Xiao Lan! I'm glad you've come in for a session today. To get started, could you share how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really low. Since entering this new class, I have a lot of pressure when it comes to interacting with my classmates. I often feel insecure about my family background and it makes it harder to connect with others.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Xiao Lan. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of stress from both the new environment and your feelings about your family. Can you tell me more about what specific situations make you feel especially anxious or uncomfortable?

User: I get really nervous when we have group projects. I feel like I don’t fit in and my classmates might judge me for my background. It makes me want to avoid those situations altogether.

Consultant: Avoiding situations that cause discomfort is quite common. It's understandable that you're worried about judgment. What thoughts run through your mind when you think about participating in those group projects?

User: I often think that they won’t want me in their group, or that I’ll mess everything up. It feels like everyone is looking down on me.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite powerful and troubling. It’s important to recognize them. Can you think of how these thoughts make you feel emotionally? 

User: They make me feel even more anxious. Sometimes, I just want to cry or laugh uncontrollably, which makes me feel really embarrassed when I’m in front of others.

Consultant: That sounds really overwhelming, especially feeling like you need to cry or laugh at inopportune moments. Let’s try to identify what triggers those emotions in you. Are there specific events or feelings that lead to those reactions?

User: I think it usually happens when I’m reminded of my family’s situation or when I feel excluded in class activities. It all seems to pile up and becomes too much to handle.

Consultant: It’s helpful to recognize those triggers. Since you mentioned feeling excluded, what kind of thoughts do you have about yourself in those moments? 

User: I often feel like I’m not good enough or that I don't deserve to be part of the group.

Consultant: That’s a tough thought to carry, feeling undeserving. Let’s consider a different perspective—if a friend were in your situation, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has their own struggles and they should believe in themselves, that they are good enough.

Consultant: Exactly! You already have the capacity for empathy and support toward others. Now let’s explore how you might apply that same kindness toward yourself. How does that make you feel to think about this?

User: It feels a bit comforting, but it’s hard to believe that for myself.

Consultant: I understand—it can be challenging to shift our inner dialogue. Let’s practice recognizing and challenging those negative thoughts. For example, instead of thinking “I’m not good enough,” what could be an alternative thought that feels more balanced?

User: Maybe “I have my own strengths and it's okay to be different.” 

Consultant: That’s a great reframe, Xiao Lan! By acknowledging your strengths and accepting differences, you’re permitting yourself to be part of the group. In moments of anxiety, would you be open to reminding yourself of this new thought?

User: Yes, I think that could help, but I might forget to do it when I’m overwhelmed.

Consultant: That's a valid concern. We can create a small reminder system together. Would it help if you wrote this new thought down and kept it with you, maybe on a sticky note?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful! I like the idea of having it visible.

Consultant: Wonderful! Alongside that, let’s also think about small steps to engage with classmates. Is there a safe way you might initiate a conversation or participate in a group project that feels manageable for you?

User: Maybe I could try to ask someone about the project during lunch. It feels a little less intimidating.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic first step! It allows you to build connections in a lower-pressure environment. How do you feel about setting that as a goal for yourself this week?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also hopeful that I can do it.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about new situations, but I believe in your ability to take this step. Remember, every small action is progress. Let’s set a plan to discuss how it goes during our next session. 

User: That sounds good. I’ll try to remember to be kinder to myself too.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s all part of the journey. Before we end today, let’s reflect briefly on what we’ve discussed and your goals for managing your feelings this week.

User: I’ve learned to challenge my negative thoughts and will try to talk to my classmates more. I hope that it helps me feel less isolated.

Consultant: That’s an excellent realization! Keep practicing that self-compassion, and I look forward to hearing how things go next time. You’re making significant progress!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help in understanding my feelings better.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiao Lan! Remember, it’s okay to take your time with this process. If you ever need to talk again, I’m here to support you.  

User: I will! Thank you again and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Lan! I'm glad to see you today. I know we've talked about your feelings and experiences before. How are you feeling now, particularly after the incident in class?

User: Hi. I feel really embarrassed about crying in front of my classmates. I think they don't understand what I'm going through, and it's making me feel even more isolated.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling quite vulnerable after that moment. Isolation can be really tough. Can you tell me more about what thoughts were going through your mind at that time?

User: I just felt overwhelmed, like no one could relate to me. I thought they must think I'm weak or that I’m just looking for attention.

Consultant: That’s a heavy burden to carry, thinking others perceive you that way. How did those thoughts make you feel emotionally in that moment?

User: I felt really ashamed and frustrated. I just wanted to hide away and not face them.

Consultant: Shame and frustration can be really strong emotions, especially in social situations. Do you think those thoughts are always true, or could there be other explanations for their reactions?

User: I guess I don't really know. I just feel like I'm different, especially since my family situation isn't normal. It's hard not to feel judged.

Consultant: Feeling different can definitely create a sense of judgment from others. Let's explore this a bit; can you think of any times when classmates were supportive or understanding, even if it wasn't about this specific situation?

User: There were a few times when I shared my art with them, and they seemed to appreciate it. But then, when I'm feeling down, it feels like they forget I’m also a person with feelings.

Consultant: It’s promising that they appreciated your art! That shows they can see the positive side of you. What if we worked together to challenge the idea that they only see you in a negative light? How might that change the way you interact with them?

User: I suppose if I believed they could see both sides of me, I might feel less anxious about being around them. I just don't want to be a burden.

Consultant: That’s a valuable shift in perspective, seeing that you are multifaceted! Can we think of some small steps you might take to open up to them about how you're feeling without worrying about being a burden?

User: Maybe I could try sharing something about my family in a casual way? Like, talking about my brother or mom, but I’m scared they won’t get it.

Consultant: Sharing about your experiences could indeed help them understand you better. How about we create a plan for how you’d bring it up? You could start with something light-hearted and gauge their reaction first.

User: That sounds okay. I could maybe say something funny about my brother sometimes. It might show them a bit of what I deal with.

Consultant: That’s a great starting point! Humor can often be a good bridge to deeper conversations. What’s one small thing you can share about him that you think might make them smile?

User: I could tell them about how he always takes my art supplies and uses them for his projects. It’s annoying but kind of funny.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely story to share! It humanizes your experience and gives them a glimpse into your life. When do you think you could try sharing this with them?

User: Maybe tomorrow during lunch. I’ll see how it goes. 

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! Let’s also think about how you can remind yourself that it’s okay to be vulnerable and that it’s a part of connecting with others. What do you think might help you feel more confident?

User: I think if I remind myself that everyone has their issues, maybe it would help. I just need to stop fearing their judgment sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, recognizing that everyone has their struggles. What positive affirmation or reminder could you use when you start to feel that fear creeping in?

User: I could say to myself, “It’s okay to be me. I’m allowed to feel.” That might help during those moments.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful reminder! Having that affirmation can really empower you in social situations. Over the next week, try to practice that when you feel uncertain. How do you feel about that?

User: I feel hopeful, I guess. It’s scary but also exciting to think about opening up.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a mix of emotions! Trying to connect with others is a brave step forward. Remember, this is a process, and it’s okay to take it slowly. 

User: Thanks for helping me see things differently. I didn’t realize I could approach it this way.

Consultant: Of course, Lan! I’m glad we could explore these thoughts together. How do you feel about our session today? 

User: I feel lighter and more prepared to face tomorrow. I just hope it goes well.

Consultant: You’re taking positive steps, and I believe you’ll do great! Let’s check in next time about how it went and what you learned. Until then, keep that affirmation close to your heart. 

User: I will! Thank you so much for today. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here for you. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Lan! I'm glad you're here today. I know you’ve been feeling worried about fitting in with your classmates. Can you tell me more about how you’re feeling right now?

User: Hi. Yeah, I'm really anxious. I keep worrying that my classmates will reject me for not wanting to hang out. I don’t know how to start conversations or join in, and it just makes me feel more isolated.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to connect with your classmates but struggling with how to do it. You mentioned wanting to learn social skills—what specific situations feel the most challenging for you?

User: I think it’s when everyone else is grouped together, and I’m alone. I want to talk to them, but I don’t know what to say. Sometimes, I just end up feeling frozen.

Consultant: That feeling of being frozen is very common when you're anxious about social situations. Let’s break it down a bit more. What thoughts go through your mind when you’re about to approach someone?

User: I usually think they'll think I'm weird for talking to them or that they won’t want to talk to me. It makes me want to avoid them altogether.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy. It’s understandable to feel that way, but let’s start questioning them. Do you have any evidence that they would think you’re weird? Have there been times when they seemed open to talking?

User: Sometimes they do seem nice, but I always focus on the negative thoughts that tell me they won’t be interested in me.

Consultant: I see. It seems that these negative thoughts might be blocking your opportunity to connect. What if we approached this differently? If you saw a friend struggling with the same thoughts, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably tell them that people aren’t always judging and that it’s okay to talk, even if it feels scary.

Consultant: That’s a helpful perspective! How about we try to apply that same advice to your situation? What’s a small step you could take to initiate a conversation with a classmate without feeling too pressured?

User: Maybe I could start by saying hi when I see someone in class. It’s a small step, right?

Consultant: Absolutely! Saying hi is a great starting point. It’s simple and lets you gradually ease into conversations. How might you feel after trying that?

User: I think it might feel a bit relieving, but I’ll probably still be nervous.

Consultant: That’s completely normal! The nerves may always be there somewhat. The important thing is taking that step, regardless of the level of anxiety. Would you like to set a goal for how many times you want to say hi this week?

User: I think I could try to say hi to at least three different classmates this week.

Consultant: That sounds like a realistic goal! After you complete this task, we can discuss how it went and what you felt. Let’s check in next time to see how those interactions unfold. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I’m a bit excited but also scared at the same time.

Consultant: It’s great to feel a mix of emotions! That shows you’re ready to step outside your comfort zone. Remember, even small successes are important. Is there anything else about your social experiences that you’d like to talk about today?

User: I think that’s mostly it. I just really want to feel like I belong.

Consultant: Wanting to belong is a very natural feeling. We’ll keep working on these skills together. Each step you take will bring you closer to feeling that sense of belonging. Is there a particular area beyond greetings that you’d like to explore in future sessions?

User: I think maybe learning more about how to keep those conversations going would be helpful.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Keeping conversations going is an essential part of building connections. We can also explore some common topics or questions you can ask to continue the conversation. How does that sound for our next session?

User: That sounds really helpful! I feel hopeful about it.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Lan. Hope is a powerful feeling! As we wrap up today, I want you to remember how brave you’re being by facing these challenges. You’re already making progress just by coming here and sharing.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to hearing how your week goes with those hellos. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. See you next time!

User: Bye! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaolan! I'm glad to see you today. Last time, we talked about some positive experiences you had in your class activities. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better. I enjoyed interacting with my classmates during the recent activities, and it made me realize that I can have fun socializing.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear that you had some positive interactions. Can you tell me more about those experiences? What did you enjoy the most?

User: I really liked working together on a project. It felt nice to share ideas, and I felt liked by my classmates. It was different from how I usually feel.

Consultant: It’s fantastic that you found enjoyment in collaborating with others. Sharing ideas and feeling accepted can be incredibly affirming. Have you noticed any changes in how you approach social situations since those activities?

User: I think I’m starting to feel a little more comfortable around my classmates. I used to hesitate before joining conversations, but now I feel a slight urge to participate.

Consultant: That’s a significant step forward, Xiaolan! Feeling more comfortable is a positive sign. How do you think you can encourage yourself to participate even more in these group settings?

User: I guess I could try to speak up more and share my opinions, even if I'm scared. Maybe I could focus on the fun aspect of it.

Consultant: Focusing on the fun is a great approach! Remember, it’s okay to feel a bit scared initially. What specific ways can you remind yourself to enjoy the moment while participating?

User: Maybe I could set small goals for each activity, like asking at least one question or making one comment during discussions.

Consultant: Setting small goals is an excellent idea! Each small step you take can build your confidence. How do you feel about these goals? Do they seem achievable for you?

User: Yes, they feel achievable. I like the idea of just making one comment; it doesn’t seem overwhelming.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Taking it one step at a time can really help ease any pressure. Have you thought about any upcoming activities where you can practice these goals?

User: There’s a group assignment coming up next week. I think I’ll have a chance to contribute more.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! How can you remind yourself to engage during that assignment? Perhaps there’s a mantra or thought you could keep in mind?

User: I could remind myself that everyone is there to learn and have fun, just like me. Maybe saying something like, "It's okay to be myself" could help.

Consultant: I love that thought! Reminding yourself that everyone is there for the same reasons can really help lighten the atmosphere. What else do you think could support you in feeling more connected during these activities?

User: I could also try to practice some ice-breakers or light topics to relieve the tension before diving into the main discussions.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Ice-breakers can set a positive tone. What types of light topics do you feel comfortable bringing up?

User: I could talk about recent movies or music. It’s something I enjoy, and I think others might too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Discussing shared interests like movies or music can create a great bond. How would you feel about starting conversations with those topics in the upcoming group assignment?

User: I feel excited about it! It makes me think I might enjoy the group work even more.

Consultant: That excitement is wonderful to hear, Xiaolan! It sounds like you are developing a more open attitude towards your social environment. What do you think this shift in your mindset will bring for you?

User: I think it will help me feel like I belong more, and that could make me more confident in myself during these activities.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful realization! Feeling like you belong is crucial for building confidence and security in social situations. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about what we’ve discussed and your plan to engage more?

User: I feel encouraged! I have a clearer plan on how to approach my participation, and I’m optimistic about the upcoming activity.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. Embracing these small steps can lead to bigger changes over time. I'm here to support you whenever you need it. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’ll keep you updated on how it goes!

Consultant: Please do! I look forward to hearing about your progress. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaolan! I'm glad to see you here today. How has the past week been for you, especially with the new extracurricular group you joined?

User: Hi! I actually feel pretty good about it. I was a bit nervous at first, but I’ve started to connect with some of the other members. I really hope to find a sense of belonging there.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like you’re open to forming connections. What parts of the group experience have you enjoyed the most so far?

User: I liked the activities we did together. They were fun, and it felt nice to work as a team. I felt included, which is something I’ve been missing for a while.

Consultant: It sounds like the teamwork aspect is really resonating with you. Feeling included is so important. Can you share more about what activities you participated in and how they made you feel?

User: We had a project where we had to collaborate on a presentation. Working together brought up some worries about my contribution, but it also felt rewarding to share my ideas and have them appreciated.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you had the opportunity to share your ideas! It’s natural to have worries about contributing, especially in new environments. What specific thoughts or feelings came up when you were worried about your contribution?

User: I think I was worried people might think I don't know what I'm doing. Sometimes I feel insecure because of my past experiences and health issues. I don't want that to hold me back.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to have those feelings. Acknowledging insecurities can be tough. Can we explore some of those thoughts a bit more? What evidence do you have that supports or challenges this belief that others might think less of you?

User: Well, I guess I don't have any specific evidence. Most people have been nice and supportive. It's just hard to shake off that feeling of self-doubt.

Consultant: Self-doubt can be really persistent. It’s encouraging that you’ve experienced support from others. Can you think of a time when someone appreciated your contributions? How did that make you feel?

User: Yes, during the presentation, one person complimented my design ideas. It made me feel proud and a little more confident. 

Consultant: That’s a significant moment! It shows that your contributions are valued. How might you remind yourself of that positive feedback when those self-doubts creep up again?

User: I could write it down somewhere, or maybe remind myself about it when I'm feeling low. That actually sounds like a good idea.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Keeping reminders of positive feedback can really help reinforce your self-confidence. What other steps do you think you could take to further build your confidence in this group?

User: I could try to participate more actively in discussions and perhaps offer to lead a small group next time. It might feel scary, but I think it would help.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea, Xiaolan! Taking small steps like leading a discussion can greatly enhance your sense of belonging. How do you feel about setting that as a goal for the next group meeting?

User: I feel a bit anxious just thinking about it, but also excited. It’s a big step for me, but I think it could help me grow.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious about such a big step, but it’s also important to recognize your excitement. Together, those emotions can lead to meaningful growth. How can we prepare you for that leadership role so it feels a bit more manageable?

User: Maybe we could brainstorm some ideas or topics I could discuss. Having a plan might ease my anxiety.

Consultant: Creating a plan sounds like a great strategy! Let’s take some time to identify a few topics you feel passionate about. What comes to mind that you’d enjoy discussing with the group?

User: I really enjoy art, so maybe I could talk about different art styles or even organize a small activity where we create something together. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Art can be a wonderful way to connect with others. How would you feel about sharing that concept with the group and inviting their input?

User: I think I would feel good about that! It’s something I’m passionate about, and it could help me connect more with them.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing something you love can foster connections. As we work towards this goal, what potential challenges do you foresee, and how might you address them?

User: I might feel nervous if they don’t engage or if they don’t like my ideas. I guess reminding myself that it’s okay to have different opinions could help.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective. Embracing diverse opinions in a group environment can lead to richer discussions. Would you be open to practicing some ways to respond to different reactions, positive or negative, both to build confidence and prepare for those moments?

User: Yes, I’d like that. Practicing responses could definitely help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Great! We can role-play some scenarios, focusing on both supportive responses and how to handle criticism constructively. This can help you feel more equipped for your group participation. How does that sound?

User: That sounds really helpful! I think practicing will give me more courage to approach the situation.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! With practice, you will gain the skills and confidence you need. Let’s summarize what we’ve talked about and outline a few steps to keep progressing together.

User: Okay! So, I’ll remind myself of the positive feedback, prepare a plan for the next meeting, and practice responses for different reactions.

Consultant: Exactly! Those are some actionable steps that will guide you towards your goal. Remember to be kind to yourself in the process, as growth takes time. 

User: Thank you! I feel more ready to take on this challenge now. 

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You've made great strides today. Let’s keep building on this progress in our future sessions. I'm here to support you. 

User: I appreciate it! I look forward to our next session. 

Consultant: Thank you, Xiaolan. I'm looking forward to hearing all about your experiences and progress. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaolan! It's great to see you for today's session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite good, actually. The mid-term exams went well, and I received some nice feedback from my classmates and teachers. It feels nice to be recognized for my efforts.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some progress and are enjoying the learning experience. How does this recognition make you feel about yourself?

User: It definitely boosts my confidence. I used to doubt my abilities, especially after everything I've been through, but now I feel like I can actually succeed.

Consultant: That's a significant shift in your mindset! Recognizing your achievements can play a crucial role in building self-esteem. What specific actions or habits do you think contributed to your success this time?

User: I started organizing my study schedule better. I also tried to stay positive and remind myself that I can do it whenever I felt anxious about the exams.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Planning your study schedule can help manage anxiety and create a sense of accomplishment. What do you think has been the most enjoyable part of studying lately?

User: I really enjoy drawing, and I’ve been able to incorporate that into my study breaks. It helps me relax and recharge, allowing me to focus better afterward.

Consultant: That's a great way to balance work and leisure! Art can be such a therapeutic outlet. How do you feel when you engage in drawing during your breaks?

User: It makes me feel free and creative. I can express myself without any pressure, and it helps clear my mind.

Consultant: That sounds very refreshing! Creativity can be a wonderful tool for managing stress. With your successes and newfound focus, what goals do you want to set for your studies and social interactions moving forward?

User: I want to continue improving my grades, but I also want to make more friends. Sometimes, I find it hard to start conversations, even if I want to connect with others.

Consultant: It's great that you want to expand your social circle as well. Building connections can be as important as academic success. What do you think holds you back from initiating conversations?

User: I think I often worry about saying the wrong thing or being judged. It makes me anxious, so I end up staying quiet.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way. Many people experience similar fears. How would you feel about trying to challenge those thoughts when they arise? For instance, when you think about saying the wrong thing, what evidence do you have that supports that belief?

User: I guess I don't have much evidence. Most of the time, people are friendly, and I often share my ideas without anyone reacting negatively.

Consultant: That's an excellent observation! It appears your fears may not align with reality. How might you reframe those thoughts to be more positive when you’re feeling anxious about talking to someone?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that the other person is probably just as nervous or that we are both just trying to connect. 

Consultant: Exactly! Reframing your thoughts can help reduce anxiety. If a friend came to you with similar worries, what advice would you give them?

User: I think I would tell them to just be themselves and not overthink things. Everyone has their own insecurities.

Consultant: That’s very wise advice! You can use that same encouragement for yourself. As we look ahead, what specific steps can you take to start those conversations with your classmates?

User: I think I could start by asking simple questions, like about their hobbies or classes. Maybe I could also share a bit about my drawing since it's something I enjoy.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful starting points! Engaging in topics you’re passionate about can make conversations feel more natural. How do you feel about practicing this strategy in the coming week?

User: I feel excited but also a bit nervous. I really want to try it, though!

Consultant: That’s a healthy mix of excitement and nerves, which is perfectly normal! It shows you're stepping out of your comfort zone. Remember, it's all about practice. How will you celebrate your efforts, no matter the outcome?

User: I think I’ll treat myself to some drawing time or maybe even share my works with the friends I connect with.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely way to reward yourself! Acknowledging your efforts is vital in reinforcing positive behavior. As we conclude our session, how do you feel about your progress and the strategies we discussed today?

User: I feel really good. It’s nice to see things clearly and have steps to work on my social skills. I believe I can build on my progress.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've made great strides, and it's exciting to see your confidence grow. Remember, it's about taking small steps each day. If you ever feel stuck, I'm here to help you navigate those feelings.

User: Thank you for your support! It really makes a difference.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaolan! I'm proud of your progress and look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. If you need anything in between, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care and happy drawing!

User: Thanks! I will. See you next time!
