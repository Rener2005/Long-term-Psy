Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today, Y. I know you've been dealing with quite a bit lately. Let's start by talking about how you've been feeling recently.

User: Hi. I've just felt really lonely and anxious since switching to this new class. I keep imagining ways to resolve things with my classmates, but I just can’t make myself do it.

Consultant: It sounds like the transition to the new class has been quite tough for you. You mentioned feelings of loneliness and anxiety. Can you share more about what specifically has been challenging about it?

User: I feel like I don’t fit in with my new classmates. They all seem to have their close friends, and I just feel left out. And then there’s the pressure to perform, especially since my mom has such high expectations.

Consultant: That sounds really overwhelming, Y. The pressure of expectations combined with feeling isolated in class can create a lot of anxiety. What kind of thoughts do you have when you find yourself feeling left out?

User: I often think that nobody likes me or that I’m not good enough. That thought keeps running through my mind, especially when I see them laughing or hanging out together.

Consultant: Those thoughts can really have a powerful impact on how you feel. It seems like there’s a pattern where feeling excluded leads you to think you’re not liked or not good enough. How does that make you feel emotionally?

User: It makes me feel really sad and sometimes even angry, but mostly just sad. I want to be part of the group, but it’s so hard.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel this way, especially when you desire connection and acceptance from your peers. Let's explore further. In those moments of feeling sad, do you notice any other thoughts or feelings that come up for you?

User: I guess sometimes I also feel really anxious about speaking up in class or joining conversations. I worry that I'll embarrass myself.

Consultant: That’s a common fear, Y. You might be worried about how others will perceive you. Can you think of a specific situation where this anxiety has made it hard for you to connect with your classmates?

User: Yes, during group projects. I wanted to share my ideas, but I just froze up and didn’t say anything. I felt really embarrassed afterward.

Consultant: It can be tough to speak up, especially when you feel anxious. Reflecting on that situation, what thoughts were swirling in your mind at that moment when you wanted to contribute?

User: I kept thinking, “What if they think my idea is stupid?” or “What if they don’t want to hear from me?”

Consultant: Those thoughts can really impact your willingness to speak up. Let’s challenge those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that your ideas might be seen as "stupid" by your classmates?

User: I really don’t know. Maybe it’s just my fear talking. I mean, they seem nice enough, and I’ve heard them share ideas that aren’t perfect either. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight. It sounds like there may be a little evidence that could point towards a more balanced view. If a classmate shared an idea and it wasn’t perfect, how would you react to them?

User: I’d probably think it was brave of them to share and I wouldn’t judge them too harshly.

Consultant: Exactly! So, it might be helpful to apply that same understanding to yourself. What would it look like for you to share your ideas with that kind of self-compassion in mind?

User: I guess I could remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay to not be perfect. That sharing is more important than being perfect.

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping that perspective can really help reduce some of the anxiety around participation. Let’s think about small steps. What’s a possible small step you could take in your next group situation that feels manageable?

User: Perhaps I could try to share at least one idea, even if I think it’s not the best. Just to practice.

Consultant: That sounds like a very achievable plan! Practicing that small step can build your confidence over time. How do you feel about setting that as a goal for yourself?

User: I feel nervous, but also a bit hopeful. It seems less scary when I think about it like that.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous about this, but hope is a great sign that you’re open to change! As you prepare to implement this goal, remember to be kind to yourself along the way. 

User: I think I will! I need to keep reminding myself about being kind to myself.

Consultant: That's a wonderful realization, Y. Self-compassion is so important in this journey. What do you think would help you remember to be kind to yourself when you're feeling anxious?

User: Maybe I could write myself a note or something positive to read when I’m feeling bad.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Writing a note to yourself with positive affirmations can be a wonderful way to stay grounded. What kind of message would you want to include in that note?

User: Maybe “It’s okay to make mistakes and sharing is what matters” or “You are enough as you are.”

Consultant: Those are beautiful affirmations! Keeping those reminders close can empower you moving forward. As we wrap up today, what do you feel has been the most helpful part of our session?

User: Talking about my feelings and realizing that I can challenge my negative thoughts. I feel like I have some tools now to work with.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Y! You’ve identified some actionable steps and I believe in your ability to implement them. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. When we meet again, we can check in on how your goals are progressing.

User: Thank you. I feel more positive and ready to tackle this now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep those tools in mind, and I look forward to hearing how things go for you in our next session. Take care!

User: Bye!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Y! It's great to see you again. I understand you've been feeling quite overwhelmed with social interactions lately. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I still feel like I don't belong in my class. The other day during a group activity, I just couldn't get myself to participate. It felt like no one was paying attention to me, and I left feeling really lonely.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that you felt ignored during the activity. It sounds frustrating to feel disconnected from your classmates. What thoughts were going through your mind at that moment?

User: I thought maybe they just don’t like me, or they think I'm not good enough. It makes me feel even more anxious, like I'm stuck in this cycle of feeling lonely.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing some very tough feelings and thoughts. Let's explore this cycle a bit further. When you think that your classmates might not like you, what emotion does that bring up for you?

User: It makes me feel disappointed in myself and really insecure. I just want to be accepted, but I feel so unsure of myself.

Consultant: I can imagine how tough that must feel, Y. It’s completely normal to want acceptance, especially at your age. Do you notice any specific scenarios where these thoughts seem to intensify, or does it happen in general?

User: It happens mostly during group activities or when I'm trying to join conversations. I just freeze up and don't know what to say.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. It seems these situations trigger feelings of anxiety and insecurity for you. Have you noticed any particular thoughts that pop up in those moments of freezing up?

User: I think, "What if I say something stupid?" or "What if they laugh at me?" It makes me want to just disappear.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy—it's no wonder you feel the urge to avoid those situations. Can we try to challenge those thoughts a bit? What evidence do you have that saying something "stupid" would lead to being laughed at?

User: I don't really know. I guess I've been embarrassed in the past, but not every time. 

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Y. While it can feel scary to imagine making a mistake, it doesn’t mean it will always happen. What might you say to a friend if they were feeling the same way in a group situation?

User: I would tell them that everyone makes mistakes and it's part of learning. They shouldn’t worry too much about what others think.

Consultant: Exactly! You have a compassionate perspective for others—maybe you can extend that kindness to yourself as well. How could you remind yourself of that during your next group interaction?

User: I guess I could try to tell myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that I should just focus on joining in.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! You could also set a small goal for your next activity—maybe just to share one thought or idea, regardless of how perfect it feels. Would that be manageable for you?

User: Yes, I think I could try that. It sounds less overwhelming.

Consultant: Great! Let's also think about some positive affirmations you could tell yourself before joining a conversation. Would you be open to brainstorming a few together?

User: Sure! Maybe something like, "I have valuable things to say" or "It's okay to express myself."

Consultant: Those are wonderful affirmations, Y! Saying those to yourself could help create a more positive mindset. How do you feel about using them in your next social engagement?

User: I feel a bit hopeful, actually! It would be nice to have reminders like that.

Consultant: That's a positive shift! Now, as we head toward our next session, how about we check in on how you felt after trying your small goal? It could help reinforce the progress you're making.

User: Yes, I’ll definitely keep track of how it goes and what I'm feeling.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’re taking proactive steps to change your situation, and I’m here to support you. Remember, it’s alright to feel anxious, and you're not alone in this.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I hope I can manage my anxiety better going forward.

Consultant: You absolutely can! You're already showing great insight into your feelings. Just remember to take it step by step. It's about progress, not perfection. 

User: I know it's a process, but I want to make a change before the upcoming activity.

Consultant: That's a great motivation! Let’s make sure you have a plan in place. We can also discuss ways to cope if things don’t go as you hope during that event. 

User: I would like that. I want to be prepared for any outcome.

Consultant: That's a strong mindset, Y. Preparing for various outcomes can help you feel more grounded. You'll build confidence with each small step you take, no matter the result.

User: I really hope so. Thanks for believing in me.

Consultant: Of course! I truly believe in your potential. Remember, all feelings are valid, and it’s perfectly okay to have ups and downs. Let’s review what we discussed today to reinforce your plan.

User: Sure, that sounds good.

Consultant: First, you’ll try to participate in the next group activity with the goal of sharing at least one idea. Remember those affirmations we came up with! And keep track of your feelings throughout the process.

User: Yes, I’ll write it down!

Consultant: Great! I'm excited to hear how it goes next time. As we close today's session, just remember: practice self-compassion and give yourself credit for putting in the effort.

User: Thank you! I feel a bit lighter after talking about this.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Y. Keep working on those positive thoughts, and I’ll be here to support you in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Y! I'm really glad you could come today. How have you been feeling about the upcoming art festival? 

User: Hi. I've been really anxious, to be honest. I didn’t feel prepared at all, and I worry that if I perform badly, my classmates will think less of me. 

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling a lot of pressure regarding this performance. Can you share more about what specific thoughts are running through your mind when you think about performing?

User: I keep thinking that I might forget my lines or mess up the dance, and if I do, everyone will laugh at me. It’s hard to shake off those thoughts.

Consultant: I can understand why you’d feel anxious with those thoughts. They seem to create a strong fear of failure. Let’s try to explore those thoughts—what evidence do you have that you will forget your lines or mess up?

User: Well, I’m not really good at dancing, and I feel like I didn’t practice enough. So, it just feels like I'm setting myself up to fail.

Consultant: It’s okay to acknowledge that practicing can help. However, can you think of moments in the past when things didn’t go as badly as you expected? 

User: I guess in my last performance, I was also nervous, but I did okay in the end. People even said they liked my part.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It seems like there is evidence that you can perform well. How might that experience change the way you think about this upcoming performance?

User: Maybe I shouldn’t be so hard on myself and that I have the potential to do well too. 

Consultant: Exactly, that’s a positive shift in your thinking. Let’s also consider how you can prepare for the performance and boost your confidence leading up to it. What can you do in the next few days to feel more prepared?

User: I could practice more, and maybe I could even rehearse in front of my family to get their feedback.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Getting feedback can help you feel more confident. How do you think practicing in front of them will make you feel?

User: I think it would make me feel less anxious since I would get used to performing in front of people.

Consultant: That’s a good insight! Getting comfortable with your audience can help reduce anxiety. Let’s talk about how you’ll handle any anxiety that arises while rehearsing or performing. What strategies have you considered for managing those feelings? 

User: I usually just try to avoid thinking about it when I feel anxious, which doesn’t really help.

Consultant: Avoidance can sometimes increase anxiety in the long run. Instead, let’s try approaching it. How about practicing some deep breathing or positive affirmations before you perform?

User: I’ve heard of deep breathing, but I’ve never really tried it. Positive affirmations sound interesting too. 

Consultant: Deep breathing can be very grounding. I can guide you through a simple technique, and we can come up with affirmations that resonate with you. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start with a deep breathing exercise. Find a comfortable position, take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a count of four, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. 

User: *pauses* Okay, I felt a bit better after that.

Consultant: Excellent! Now, let’s develop a few positive affirmations together. What are some phrases that would make you feel more empowered about your performance?

User: Maybe “I am capable and I can do this.” 

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation! You can repeat that to yourself before you perform. As you approach the day, how do you plan to remind yourself of these affirmations and breathing techniques?

User: I’ll write them down and keep them with me. I’ll also remind myself to breathe whenever I start to feel anxious.

Consultant: Wonderful! Having a plan will help reinforce positive thinking. Remember, it’s a process, and you’re already taking significant steps forward. How do you feel about the progress you’re making?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I can see that I’m trying to change how I perceive the situation.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! Fostering that sense of hope is significant. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on what you've learned. What do you feel is the most valuable takeaway from our time together today?

User: I think being kinder to myself and preparing in a positive way will really help me through this experience. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember, affirming your strengths and preparing ahead are vital parts of overcoming anxiety. Next time, we can check in on your rehearsals and see how you felt about the performance. You’ve got this, Y!

User: Thank you! I feel like I’ve got a plan now, and I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Y! I’m here to support you. Looking forward to hearing about your progress next session.

Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you again today, Xiao Y. I’d like to start by hearing about how you’ve been feeling since our last session. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling a bit better, actually. I’ve started to notice some little improvements in my attitude, but I still struggle with feeling accepted by my classmates. Sometimes, I question if they really like me or just tolerate me.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re recognizing your progress, which is wonderful! However, those feelings of doubt about your acceptance still linger. What specific thoughts come to mind when you feel this way about your classmates?

User: I often think that even though I got some recognition in a recent activity, it doesn’t mean they genuinely like me. I keep worrying that any moment they might just forget about me.

Consultant: That must feel really tough. It’s great that you received recognition, but it seems like it’s hard for you to fully embrace that positive moment. Can you share how these thoughts affect your feelings or behaviors when you’re around your classmates?

User: When I think they may not actually like me, I feel anxious and awkward. Sometimes, I just avoid talking to them because I don’t want to be rejected again. 

Consultant: Avoiding those interactions can be a way to protect yourself from feeling hurt, but it might also reinforce those negative beliefs about acceptance. How do you think it would feel to challenge those thoughts? What evidence do you have that your classmates might actually appreciate you?

User: I guess I don't have concrete evidence—like, they did congratulate me on my performance, which means something. But then I wonder if they were just being polite.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those doubts. Let’s try to look at this from a different angle. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about their achievements and how others perceive them?

User: I would probably say that they should be proud of their achievements and that people typically recognize good efforts. They shouldn’t just assume the worst about themselves.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective! Now, how can you apply that same understanding to your own situation? Can you think of a way to remind yourself of your achievements and the positive feedback you’ve received? 

User: Maybe I could write down the positive things my classmates have said instead of only focusing on the negatives. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Keeping a record of positive feedback can really help shift your focus. How do you feel about starting a journal to write down these moments and your feelings about them?

User: I think I could do that. It might help me reflect on my progress. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Journaling can be a powerful tool for self-reflection. As you write, try to focus on your feelings of achievement and any praise you received. It could help you build a more positive self-view. 

User: I’ll give it a try. But I am still worried about what my mom thinks. She always seems disappointed with me.

Consultant: It sounds like your mother’s expectations weigh heavily on you. Can we talk about how her feedback impacts your feelings? What kind of thoughts come up when you think about her expectations?

User: I feel pressured to perform well, and it leads to anxiety. There’s a part of me that just wants to please her and make her proud.

Consultant: Wanting to make your mom proud is understandable, yet it’s important to find a balance between her expectations and your own needs. What would it mean for you to assert your feelings or needs with her?

User: I suppose it would mean being honest about my struggles and expressing when I need support rather than just pressure.

Consultant: That’s a healthy approach! Open communication can help bridge the gap between your feelings and her expectations. How do you think she might react if you share your feelings with her?

User: I hope she’d listen, but I worry she might get upset or not understand.

Consultant: That concern is definitely valid. However, expressing your feelings is a big step towards improving your relationship with her. Would you feel comfortable discussing your feelings with her or perhaps practice what you'd say?

User: I could practice it with you. 

Consultant: Great idea! Let’s role-play a bit. What would be the first thing you’d want to say to her? 

User: I might say something like, “Mom, I’ve been feeling a lot of pressure and it’s hard for me to manage my studies and my feelings.” 

Consultant: That sounds like a very heartfelt opening. How do you think she might respond to that?

User: I think she might be surprised, but hopefully, she’d want to help me once she understands.

Consultant: Exactly! By sharing your feelings, you’re inviting her to support you rather than pressure you. How does it feel to envision that kind of conversation?

User: It feels a bit less scary now that I’ve thought about it. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, sharing your feelings can open the door to more understanding. As you practice your journaling and prepare to talk to your mom, keep reflecting on your own strengths and progress. 

User: I will try my best! I think I can start feeling better about myself, even if it takes time.

Consultant: Absolutely, progress doesn’t happen overnight. Celebrating your achievements, big or small, and learning to express your feelings to those you care about is a powerful way to build self-acceptance. 

User: Thank you for the encouragement! I really appreciate it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Y. I believe in you and all the progress you’re making. I look forward to hearing how your journaling and discussions go in our next session! 

User: Me too! Thank you. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Y! I'm really glad to see you today. Last time, we talked about your feelings regarding school and your family. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, especially after talking more openly with my mom. But I still struggle with my classmates. I feel like I don’t fit in and it makes me anxious.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’ve had a positive conversation with your mom! It sounds like you're still feeling some apprehension about fitting in with your classmates. Can you tell me more about those feelings?

User: Yeah, it’s like whenever I try to join a conversation, I feel like I'm just awkward. Sometimes, I think they don't really like me. I overthink everything.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, Y. Overthinking can definitely make social situations more difficult. What specific thoughts go through your mind when you’re in those situations?

User: I think things like, "They must be judging me," or "I’ll just embarrass myself." 

Consultant: Those are very common thoughts in social settings. Let’s explore that a bit deeper. When you think, “They must be judging me,” how does that make you feel in the moment?

User: It makes me feel really anxious and self-conscious. I just want to disappear.

Consultant: I completely understand. That feeling of wanting to disappear can be overwhelming. Let’s assess that thought you mentioned: “They must be judging me.” How do you know that’s true? Is there concrete evidence? 

User: I don’t really know. Sometimes it just feels like that’s what people think because I don’t get invited to hang out.

Consultant: It sounds like there might be a connection between not being invited and those anxious thoughts. But lack of invitations doesn’t necessarily mean you are being judged. Can you think of any evidence that suggests your classmates might actually like you?

User: Well... there have been times when they talked to me, but it’s usually superficial. I guess I don’t really know them well enough to say for sure.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight, Y. Building deeper relationships takes time. Can we try to shift that thought to something more supportive? For example, you might consider, "I can take my time to get to know them." How does that feel to you?

User: That sounds better! It makes me feel less pressured.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Now, let’s think about how you can take small steps towards engaging more with your classmates. What might be a comfortable way for you to start interacting?

User: Maybe I could ask someone a question about a class assignment. That seems less daunting than trying to make small talk.

Consultant: That’s a perfect idea! Asking about a class assignment is a great way to connect over common ground. How do you think they would respond?

User: I think they would probably be happy to help since it’s about school.

Consultant: Great observation! Now, let’s work on how you could phrase that question so it feels natural. What would you want to ask?

User: I could say something like, "Hey, did you understand the math homework?”

Consultant: That sounds like a great opener! Simple and to the point. How do you feel about practicing that approach this week?

User: I think I can try it. It feels less scary than I thought it would be.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Additionally, let’s talk about how you can share your thoughts and feelings with your family. You mentioned feeling more supported by your mom. Would you want to share your feelings about school with her?

User: Yeah, I think I could. It might help to let her know when I’m feeling anxious.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your feelings can help improve your connection with her. Maybe you could set aside a time to chat? What do you think?

User: I could ask her when we have dinner together. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great time! You'll both be relaxed and might have a better conversation. How do you feel about that plan?

User: I feel good about it. I think it could really help.

Consultant: Fantastic! Remember, Y, progress takes time, but you’re already taking real steps forward. What do you think will be the biggest challenge for you this week?

User: Probably overcoming that initial anxiety to start talking with my classmates.

Consultant: Acknowledging that challenge is a strong first step. Remember to take deep breaths and give yourself grace if it feels tough. You’re human, and everyone has their ups and downs. 

User: Thanks! That really helps. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Let’s summarize what you’ve planned for this week: you will practice asking a question about math homework and have an open conversation with your mom during dinner. Does that sound right?

User: Yes, that’s right! 

Consultant: Great job! I believe these small actions can lead to meaningful changes. Next time, we can discuss how those conversations went and what you learned from them. 

User: I’m excited to share my progress! Thank you!

Consultant: Me too, Y! I'm really looking forward to hearing about your experiences. Remember, you’re making strides, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. Until next time!

User: See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoy! It’s great to see you again. I’m really glad to hear about the improvements in your studies and your relationships with classmates. How are you feeling about everything now?

User: Hi! Thank you! I feel much more confident lately. I've been able to talk to a few classmates and study together, which is nice. But sometimes I worry if I will be able to maintain this.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you’re feeling more confident and making connections with your classmates. It’s completely normal to have those worries about maintaining your progress. What specific thoughts do you have when you start to feel uncertain?

User: I often think that maybe I’m just lucky now and that I’ll eventually mess things up again. I guess I have a fear of returning to how I was before.

Consultant: I see. That fear of falling back into old patterns can be quite overwhelming. Let’s explore this thought a bit more—what evidence do you have to support the idea that you will mess things up again?

User: Well, I struggled for a long time and it was hard to connect with others. I sometimes feel like I don't belong, even now.

Consultant: It sounds like past experiences are influencing how you view your current situation. However, you've made significant strides recently. Can you think of moments where you felt you truly belonged or connected with your classmates?

User: Yes! Just the other day, we had a group study session, and I felt really included. They were supportive and engaged. It felt good.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic example! It shows that you are creating new, positive experiences with your classmates. How do you think you can remind yourself of these moments when those negative thoughts creep in?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal to write down those good experiences and feelings. It might help me see the progress I’ve made.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful strategy! A journal can be a powerful way to track your positive experiences and reinforce your growth. How do you feel about implementing this in your routine?

User: I think I can start doing that! It will remind me of my achievements, which will help with my confidence.

Consultant: Exactly! Reflecting on your accomplishments is a great way to combat negative thinking. Moreover, if you ever feel like you're slipping back into old patterns, how might you reassure yourself that it’s okay to have ups and downs?

User: I could remind myself that everyone has challenges and that it’s part of growing. Plus, I have strategies now that can help me cope.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing that setbacks are a normal part of growth is so important. And having those coping strategies will make a big difference. Can we also talk about how to maintain your relationships with your classmates over time?

User: Yes, I would like that. I want to make sure I don’t lose the connections I've made.

Consultant: To keep those connections strong, consider planning regular study sessions or social activities. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I could invite them for lunch or set up a study group every week.

Consultant: Fantastic idea! Engaging in regular activities is a great approach to strengthen friendships. What other ways do you think you can enhance these connections?

User: I could reach out more often and check in with them, maybe ask how they are doing. I sometimes wait for them to contact me.

Consultant: That’s a meaningful insight, Xiaoy! Taking the initiative to reach out can foster a sense of belonging and support. How do you feel about stepping into that role?

User: I feel hopeful! I think by being proactive, I can build a supportive network.

Consultant: That hopefulness is key! Remember, building relationships takes time and effort, and your initiative is a great step forward. Before we conclude today, do you feel there’s anything holding you back from taking those steps?

User: Not really, I think I just need to remind myself that it's okay to reach out. I often hesitate because of my past experiences.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Acknowledging your past can be empowering if you let it guide you positively. Let's recap what you’ve learned today and how you’ll apply it moving forward.

User: Sure! I’ll start a journal to track positive experiences, reach out to classmates more, and plan regular catch-ups. I also feel that taking these steps can help me stay grounded.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! It sounds like you’ve developed some solid strategies to maintain your progress. As we wrap up today, how would you summarize the key takeaways from our session?

User: I learned that maintaining connections and looking back at my achievements can help me cope better with my worries. I feel more confident in managing my relationships.

Consultant: That's a great summary, Xiaoy! You've made impressive strides, and I’m proud of your progress. Remember, setbacks are normal, but you now have the tools to deal with them. If you ever feel the need for more support, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate all your help. I feel much better about everything now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s been a pleasure working with you, and I believe in your ability to continue making strides. Take care, and I hope to hear more about your journey next time!
