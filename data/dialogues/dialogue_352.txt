Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you're here for today's session. I understand you may be feeling a bit uncomfortable about being here. Could you share what’s on your mind?

User: Hi. Well, I really don’t think I have a problem. My family is just overreacting. I’m here because they made me come.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling some pressure from your family. It's understandable to feel defensive when others are concerned about us. Can you tell me more about what they’ve said that makes you feel this way?

User: They always bring up my drinking. Just because I enjoy a few drinks doesn’t mean I have a problem! They don’t trust me at all.

Consultant: I can see how frustrating that must be for you. When your family expresses worry about your drinking, it might feel like they don't see you clearly. What do you think motivates them to talk to you about this?

User: They just think I'm not responsible. They even called the police on me once. It’s humiliating! 

Consultant: That seems very difficult and overwhelming. It’s really tough when you feel like your actions are being judged by others, especially family. How did you feel after that incident with the police?

User: I felt ashamed and angry. I can't believe they went that far. 

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel angry and ashamed in such situations. Anger can often arise when we feel our integrity is challenged. How do these feelings about your family’s concerns impact your daily life?

User: I guess it makes me more stressed. I try to keep my distance from them. 

Consultant: Maintaining distance can be a way to cope with that stress. However, it might also make you feel more isolated. Do you think keeping your distance helps with the stress, or does it create more issues?

User: It’s mixed. Sometimes I want space, but I also feel lonely. 

Consultant: That’s a tough balance to strike. Loneliness can often follow distancing ourselves from loved ones. Have you talked to your family about how their concerns make you feel?

User: Not really. I don't want to give them any more reasons to worry. 

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like you're trying to protect them from more concern, but it also means not sharing your feelings. What do you think would happen if you opened up to them about how their worries affect you?

User: Maybe they’d listen, but I doubt it. They’re set on thinking I have a problem.

Consultant: That skepticism is valid. Sometimes, sharing our thoughts can lead to unexpected understanding. What would it feel like to express your perspective to them, even if it doesn’t change their mind?

User: I guess it could be relieving to get it off my chest, but I don’t want to fight.

Consultant: It's understandable to want to avoid conflict, especially when emotions run high. What if there was a way to express your feelings calmly and constructively?

User: I don’t know. It just seems so tricky. 

Consultant: It can be tricky. Perhaps we could explore some strategies together for expressing your feelings without igniting a fight. Would that be helpful for you?

User: That might help, but I still feel like they just won’t understand.

Consultant: I hear you. It’s hard when we feel like others won’t empathize. Let’s focus on how you can communicate your thoughts clearly. What do you think might resonate with them?

User: Maybe if I explain that I handle my life just fine... but then they wouldn’t see it that way.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a valid point of view to share. You could potentially express how your life is balanced while asking for their understanding. What do you think you could say to initiate that conversation?

User: I could start by acknowledging their concern and then say I appreciate their worries but that I feel capable.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid approach. Acknowledging their concerns first could set a more open tone for the conversation. How might you feel about trying that in the future?

User: I’d feel nervous, but it seems like it could be worth a shot.

Consultant: Nervousness is completely natural. It indicates that you care about the outcome. Would it help to role-play how that conversation might go?

User: Sure, I think that could help me prepare.

Consultant: Great! Let's imagine you’re sitting down with them. You could start by saying, “I know you’re worried about me, and I appreciate your care. I feel like I manage my drinking responsibly.” How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds okay, but I still worry about how they will react.

Consultant: That's understandable to be concerned about their reaction. What if you remind yourself that their feelings are not a reflection of your worth? 

User: That could help me stay grounded. I don’t want their opinions to affect how I see myself.

Consultant: Exactly. It’s important to separate their concerns from your self-view. You are clearly capable, as you mentioned. How else can you remind yourself of that when facing these conversations?

User: Maybe I could think of my accomplishments or write down positive affirmations.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Keeping a list of accomplishments can remind you of your strengths and reinforce your self-esteem. Is there anything specific you’d like to add to that list now?

User: Well, I’ve been doing well at work, and my projects have received positive feedback.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Recognizing your achievements can bolster your confidence. Keep that in mind when navigating your family dynamics. 

User: Thanks, I appreciate this. I still have a long way to go, but it feels good to talk about it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Li. You’ve taken a meaningful step today by exploring these feelings. Just remember, it’s okay to feel how you feel and to keep working on these issues. 

User: Yeah, I see that now. Thanks for listening and helping me think this through.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been great to talk with you. Remember, take things one step at a time. I’m here to support you whenever you need.
###################
Consultant: Hello, welcome back! It's good to see you. Before we begin, I'd like to hear about how you've been feeling since our last session. How have things been for you?

User: Hi. Well, I've been thinking a lot about what we discussed. I still feel a bit defensive when my family brings up my drinking habits. It makes me uneasy and frustrated.

Consultant: I can understand how that would feel. It sounds like family discussions about drinking still trigger some uncomfortable emotions for you. Can you share more about what feelings come up during those conversations?

User: Mostly shame and frustration. I know they are concerned, but it feels like they are judging me. I sometimes just want to shut it all down and avoid the topic.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It's understandable to want to protect yourself from judgment. When you experience those feelings of shame and frustration, what thoughts run through your mind?

User: I often think things like, "I'm not a problem drinker," or "They don't understand my situation." It feels like I'm under attack whenever they mention it.

Consultant: It sounds like you might be defending yourself against their perceptions. Let's explore those thoughts a bit. How do these thoughts make you feel when you think them during those conversations?

User: They make me feel more anxious and defensive, which leads me to just shut down. It doesn't help the situation, and I feel worse afterward.

Consultant: It's interesting how those thoughts may be intensifying your feelings of anxiety. Can you recall a specific instance where you felt particularly defensive? What went through your mind in that moment?

User: At the last family gathering, one of my uncles said something like, "You really should cut down." It made me feel angry and embarrassed. I just wanted to leave the room.

Consultant: That sounds like a deeply uncomfortable moment. It seems like that comment struck a chord with you. If you were to challenge your immediate reaction of wanting to shut down, what do you think might happen?

User: I suppose I could try to explain that I’m aware of their concerns and that I’m working on my relationship with drinking. But it’s hard when I’m feeling so defensive.

Consultant: That’s a brave thought. Being able to express your awareness can shift the conversation. What evidence do you have that you are working on this relationship with drinking? 

User: Well, I have thought about reducing how much I drink during family gatherings and being more honest when they ask me. But I still feel nervous about it.

Consultant: It's great that you're considering changes. Let's break it down further. What fears come up when you think about being honest with your family about your drinking?

User: I'm afraid they won't believe me or that they'll think I'm just making excuses. I worry about disappointing them.

Consultant: Those fears are valid, and it's natural to worry about others' perceptions. However, what if they do believe you? What would that look like for you?

User: If they believe me, then maybe we could have more understanding discussions without all the judgment. That could feel better.

Consultant: Absolutely! Having that understanding could foster a more supportive environment. Let’s think about ways to prepare for those discussions. Could you share what you could say to express your feelings without feeling defensive?

User: I could say something like, "I understand your concerns, but I’m trying to find a healthier balance with drinking." 

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach. How would that make you feel, saying those words instead of retreating?

User: It would probably make me feel more empowered, like I’m taking control of my own narrative rather than just hiding.

Consultant: That’s powerful. Feeling empowered can help you approach the situation with more confidence. How can we practice this feeling of empowerment together?

User: Maybe by role-playing the conversation? I want to feel more ready for it when the time comes.

Consultant: Role-playing is an excellent idea! Let’s simulate that conversation. I can be your uncle. How about you start by expressing your awareness of their concerns?

User: Okay. *breathes deeply* "I understand you are worried about my drinking habits."

Consultant: Great start! How would you like to continue from there?

User: "I want you to know I’m working on finding a healthier balance." 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic continuation! How did it feel to say that?

User: A bit nerve-wracking, but also relieving. It feels good to express my awareness instead of just shutting down.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that. Practicing this can really help build your confidence. As we wrap up, how are you feeling about your approach to these family discussions now?

User: I feel a bit more prepared and less anxious. I really like the idea of being proactive instead of defensive.

Consultant: That's a significant shift! As you continue to practice your assertiveness, remember that it’s okay to feel a range of emotions. Would you like to share one takeaway from today’s session?

User: My takeaway is that I can voice my feelings and concerns calmly, and it might lead to healthier conversations with my family.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway! You’ve made good progress in thinking about how to approach those conversations. Remember, I’m here to support you whenever you need it, and we can continue to build on these skills in our next session. Would you like to schedule that?

User: Yes, I’d like that. Thank you for all your help today!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! It's nice to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been struggling. Since I got detained for the DUI, I've realized I need to change, but I still feel lost. I just don’t have much confidence in myself.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. It sounds like you’re facing quite a challenge, but it’s good to hear that you recognize the need for change. Can you tell me more about the events leading up to the DUI and how you felt during that time?

User: Well, work has been really stressful lately. I felt overwhelmed and turned to drinking more often to cope. It seemed like an escape, but now I see it's created more problems, especially with my family.

Consultant: It sounds like you were using drinking as a way to manage your stress and escape from those overwhelming feelings. How did that drinking behavior affect your mood and your relationships at home?

User: I thought it was helping, but it only made things worse. My wife is upset, and I’m also feeling this guilt. We argue a lot now, and I feel even more alone.

Consultant: It seems like there’s a pattern here—drinking to alleviate stress, but then creating more tension at home and feelings of guilt. Let’s explore this connection between your drinking and your emotions. What do you think drinking has done for you when you felt stressed?

User: I guess it made me forget my problems for a while, or at least I thought it would. But then I just ended up feeling worse afterward. 

Consultant: That’s an important insight. The temporary relief you felt didn’t last, did it? Instead, you ended up with additional emotional burdens. Can you remember the thoughts or feelings you had during those times of drinking?

User: I usually felt overwhelmed by work, and drinking numbed that. But I also had this nagging feeling that I was failing. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way under such stress. Those negative thoughts—like feeling like a failure—can be really powerful. Can we look at those thoughts together? How realistic do you think they are, and are there other ways to view your situation?

User: Maybe they’re not entirely realistic. I've done well in my job before. I guess I'm just focused on the failures right now.

Consultant: Shifting your focus can be really helpful. If a friend were in your position, how would you encourage them to view their situation? 

User: I’d tell them to remember their successes and not to be so hard on themselves, to look for ways to improve instead of just blaming themselves. 

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective. It sounds like you’ve recognized the importance of self-compassion. Moving forward, how can we start to create a plan that helps you handle stress without reverting to drinking?

User: I think maybe finding healthier ways to cope would be good. I’ve thought about exercising or talking more with my wife.

Consultant: Those sound like great alternatives! Exercise can help release stress and improve your mood, and open communication with your wife might help to mend your relationship. How do you envision starting this process?

User: I could set aside some time every day for a workout. As for talking to my wife, I think setting a time to discuss things openly would be helpful. 

Consultant: Those are concrete steps! Creating a routine for exercise and scheduling time to communicate with your wife shows commitment to change. How do you feel about committing to these actions moving forward?

User: I feel nervous but also hopeful. I guess taking those small steps might make a difference.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous when starting something new. What’s one small step you can take this week that feels achievable, perhaps regarding exercise or talking with your wife?

User: I think I’ll try to go for a walk three times this week and ask my wife if we can have a conversation over dinner one night.

Consultant: That sounds like a very balanced approach! Walking can be a great way to clear your mind, and a dinner conversation is a lovely way to reconnect. Remember, it’s okay to go slowly. What are some possible barriers you might face in following through with these plans?

User: I could easily get busy with work, or I might feel too tired to walk after a long day.

Consultant: Those are common barriers. Let’s think of strategies to overcome them. How could you remind yourself to prioritize these walks or that dinner conversation, even on busy days?

User: I could set reminders on my phone or maybe even schedule it in my calendar like an important meeting.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Scheduling it makes it more likely to happen. Let’s also discuss a plan for when you feel overwhelmed again. What could you do instead of turning to drink?

User: Maybe I can use those walks as a way to clear my head instead of reaching for a drink. 

Consultant: That’s a very proactive approach! Finding an alternative like walking can help you process your feelings without that urge to drink. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the steps we've discussed for moving forward?

User: I feel a lot better about things. I’m ready to try walking and communicating more with my wife. I hope it helps.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re heading in a positive direction. Remember, change takes time, and it’s normal to encounter challenges. What you've shared today shows that you're beginning to take ownership of your choices. If challenges arise, we can tackle them together in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I'm starting to believe that I can make these changes.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li! I appreciate your willingness to share and work on these issues. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. You’ve got this!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I’m glad you could make it today. It sounds like there have been some positive changes in your life recently. Can you tell me how you’ve been feeling about those changes?

User: Hi. Yes, I've noticed some improvements. I’ve cut down on my drinking and started exercising more. It feels good to be doing something healthier, but I sometimes worry about maintaining this change.

Consultant: That's great to hear that you've reduced your drinking and embraced exercise as a healthier outlet! It's normal to have concerns about sustaining these changes. What steps have you taken to support this new lifestyle?

User: I’ve been going to the gym regularly and trying new activities, which helps distract me. I also try to communicate more with my family, but it’s still difficult sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like you're making some strong efforts at the gym and trying to connect with your family. It's understandable that communication can be challenging. What specific difficulties are you encountering when speaking with your family?

User: I feel like they don’t always understand the changes I’m trying to make. There are still some unresolved issues that come up, which makes it hard to have a good conversation.

Consultant: That must be frustrating for you. It's important to recognize that change can take time, both for you and your family. How do you think you could approach these conversations to help them understand where you're coming from?

User: I guess I haven’t been very clear about my intentions. Maybe if I explained my reasons for reducing drinking, they'd see it’s for the better.

Consultant: That's a valuable insight! Clarifying your intentions can help them understand your journey better. How do you feel about preparing a specific time to talk to them about this?

User: I think that could work. I just hope they listen and understand me.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel apprehensive. Perhaps you could start with expressing your feelings about wanting to improve your life and relationships. What might you say to set a positive tone for that conversation?

User: I could say something like, “I’ve been working hard to change some habits for a better life, and I really want to share that with you so we can be closer.”

Consultant: That’s a wonderful way to express your intentions, focusing on improvement and connection. How do you think they’d respond to that approach?

User: I hope they’d be supportive, but I'm worried they might bring up past conflicts instead. 

Consultant: It's understandable to have those worries. Remember, you can guide the conversation back to your positive changes if it starts drifting. You could also acknowledge their concerns but gently redirect to your current goals. Does that sound manageable to you?

User: Yes, it does. I just need to stay prepared for that shift in conversation.

Consultant: Exactly! Preparing yourself can help you feel more confident during the discussion. In addition to the conversation, what other activities do you think could help strengthen your bond with your family?

User: Maybe we could try doing some activities together, like going for walks or cooking meals. It might lighten the mood.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea. Engaging in shared activities can create a positive atmosphere and pave the way for better communication. What activity would you like to try first?

User: I think cooking a meal together could be fun and a good way to bond.

Consultant: Cooking together will not only be a rewarding experience but also a chance to engage in informal conversation. It might help ease the tensions. How do you feel about starting this week?

User: I feel motivated to try that. If we can have fun cooking, it might lead to more open discussions afterward.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Remember, focusing on enjoying the moment can help foster a more relaxed environment for discussions. After you’ve had the experience, how do you plan to reflect on it?

User: I think I’ll note how it went and how everyone felt afterward. It'd be good to check if it encourages us to talk more openly.

Consultant: Keeping track of those reflections can be quite helpful in recognizing any progress. Having insights from your experiences will inform your future conversations. Are there any strategies you might use to manage any lingering anxiety you feel?

User: I could remind myself that change takes time and be patient with myself. Maybe some deep breathing before the conversation would help too.

Consultant: Those are excellent coping strategies. Remembering to be patient with yourself is key, and deep breathing can be very calming. How does it feel to have these tools at your disposal?

User: It feels reassuring. Knowing I have ways to cope makes me a bit more confident.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Confidence plays a significant role in facing challenges. As we wrap up today, what do you feel is the most important takeaway from our session?

User: I think the importance of communication with my family and having a plan to engage them positively stands out the most.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve gained valuable insights on communicating your intentions. As you move forward, take the time to reflect on both your actions and feelings, and remember that every step, no matter how small, contributes to your progress. 

User: Thank you! This has really helped me feel more prepared for the future.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. Remember, it’s all about building those healthy habits. I believe in you and look forward to hearing how everything goes in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. I'm looking forward to our session. Last time, we discussed your journey towards a non-drinking lifestyle and how it's positively affected your health and your family relationships. How are you feeling about it all now?

User: Hi! I'm feeling pretty good, actually. Since I stopped drinking, I’ve noticed that I have more energy, and my mood has improved. Plus, my family seems to be more relaxed around me now. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful change! It’s great to hear that you’re experiencing more energy and a better mood. I’d love to explore how these positive changes have impacted you further. Could you share any specific situations where you felt the benefits of not drinking?

User: Well, there was a recent family outing that we went on together. I really enjoyed it, and I felt more connected to my family. It was nice to be present and participate fully without alcohol clouding my judgment.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Participating fully and feeling connected with your family during that outing shows the positive impact of your commitment. How did that experience make you feel about your decision to stay sober?

User: It made me feel really proud of myself. I realized that I have more fun without alcohol, and I can also be a better family member. It's like I’ve awakened a part of myself that I had ignored for a while.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! Being proud of your decision and recognizing a fuller version of yourself is significant. What other benefits have you noticed since you made this change?

User: I think I'm also handling stress better. There were times I used to rely on drinking to cope, but now I find healthier ways to deal with it. I feel more in control, and it’s liberating.

Consultant: It's excellent to hear that you’re finding healthier coping strategies and feeling more in control. Reflecting on your journey, have there been any challenges that you faced in maintaining this lifestyle?

User: Occasionally, I feel the temptation to drink, especially during social events. Sometimes I worry about how others might react when I decline a drink. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to face temptations, especially in social situations. It's important to acknowledge these feelings. When you feel tempted, what thoughts or worries come to your mind about declining a drink?

User: I often think about how others might judge me or if they'll pressure me to drink. I fear standing out or being the odd one out.

Consultant: That fear of judgment is common. I appreciate your openness in sharing that. Let’s consider how much evidence supports these worries. Have you noticed people reacting negatively when you’ve declined a drink in the past?

User: No, I haven't really had negative feedback when I've turned down drinks. Most just move on or offer me something non-alcoholic.

Consultant: That’s interesting to note! It seems the fear of judgment may not align with the reality of your experiences. How might you challenge this thought next time you find yourself in a similar situation?

User: I could remind myself that my decision to stay sober is valid and that I’m focusing on my health. Plus, I could think about how others have responded positively.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reminding yourself of your valid decision and the positive responses you’ve received can help reinforce your choice. How do you think this shift in thinking could influence your behavior in future social situations?

User: I believe it could make me more confident in saying no to alcohol. If I approach it with a positive mindset, I think I’ll feel more comfortable.

Consultant: Yes, that confidence can make a huge difference! As you continue to reinforce your sober lifestyle, it might be helpful to focus on the aspects of these gatherings that you enjoy. What enjoyable activities can you think of that do not involve alcohol?

User: I really like playing games and engaging in conversations with friends. Those things make me happy, and I can enjoy them without the need for drinking.

Consultant: Those activities sound wonderful! They can definitely enhance the social experience while keeping you aligned with your goals. Moving forward, how can you incorporate these enjoyable activities into your social life more regularly?

User: I could suggest game nights or other activities that keep everyone engaged. Maybe I could even host gatherings at my place that focus on fun without alcohol.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant strategy! Creating a space for fun and connection without alcohol will not only benefit you but also encourage others to enjoy time together in a healthy way. As we wrap up, how do you feel about your progress and the plans you've made today?

User: I feel encouraged. I’ve recognized the benefits I gain from not drinking. I believe I have the right mindset and tools to continue this path.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Your confidence and commitment to maintaining a healthy lifestyle are evident. Remember, you can always refer back to these insights and strategies whenever you feel challenged. If there’s anything more you’d like to explore or reinforce in our next session, let me know.

User: Thank you, I appreciate your support. I’ll definitely reflect on this conversation and work on the plan we discussed.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing how things progress. Keep reminding yourself of the positive changes, and remember that you’re not alone on this journey. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you again! How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite good overall. I've managed to handle the pressures at work and home better, and I've even attended a couple of social events without undue stress.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's encouraging to hear that you've been able to manage pressure more effectively. Can you share more about how you're feeling in your interactions with your family and colleagues?

User: With my colleagues, I feel confident. We have been collaborating well, and I don't feel the need to rely on alcohol to socialize anymore. However, things are still a bit tense at home with my wife. 

Consultant: It seems like you've made significant progress at work and socially. However, the tension at home sounds challenging. What do you think is contributing to that tension with your wife?

User: I think there are unresolved issues we haven't addressed. It's hard for me to express my feelings sometimes, and I fear how she will react.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way. Opening up about feelings can be intimidating. Have you tried discussing some of these feelings with her, or does it feel too daunting right now?

User: I haven't really tried. I think I’m worried about her response, and I don't want to make things worse.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. It can indeed be difficult to initiate these conversations. What would you hope to achieve if you did share your feelings with her?

User: Ideally, I want her to understand where I'm coming from and for us to connect better. I just want us to be on the same page.

Consultant: That’s a great goal. If you could envision a successful conversation, what would it look like? How would you feel after expressing your thoughts?

User: I imagine feeling relieved and understood. I hope it would lead to more communication and less tension between us.

Consultant: That sounds like a very positive outcome. One approach could be to start with small conversations to build trust gradually. Would you be open to trying that?

User: Yes, I think starting small could work. Maybe I can pick a casual moment and just bring up how I've been feeling lately.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! It might help to frame it as sharing your thoughts rather than confronting an issue. How do you think your wife might respond to that?

User: I hope she would listen and be open to discussing things. I know she cares about me, so maybe she’ll appreciate my efforts to communicate.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize her caring nature. Preparing yourself mentally for the conversation could be beneficial, too. How do you feel about using some strategies we've discussed in previous sessions to help you manage any anxiety that may come up?

User: Yes, I could use those techniques, especially breathing exercises to keep myself calm.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember to give yourself grace during this process. Each small step can help build toward the larger goal of improved communication. Have you thought about what specific situation you might use to initiate this conversation?

User: I was thinking perhaps during dinner this weekend when we’re just relaxing together.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! A relaxed setting can help facilitate a more open conversation. How do you feel about approaching it this way?

User: I feel more confident now. I think having a calm environment will help both of us.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we conclude our session today, let’s summarize your goals for the coming week. What will you focus on?

User: My main goal is to have that conversation with my wife during dinner and to use the breathing exercises beforehand to keep calm.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan. Remember that it’s okay if it doesn’t go perfectly the first time. You’re making progress, and every effort counts. I believe in your ability to navigate this.

User: Thank you! I appreciate the support and guidance.

Consultant: You're very welcome! You've made great strides, and I look forward to hearing how it goes next time. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need to talk before then. 

User: I will, thank you again for everything!

Consultant: Take care, and best of luck with your conversation! I’ll see you next time.
