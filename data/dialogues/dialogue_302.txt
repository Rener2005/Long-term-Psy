Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you could make it today. How have you been feeling recently since we last spoke?

User: Hi. I've still been feeling pretty anxious about my job situation. The new environment is challenging, and I find it hard to keep myself motivated.

Consultant: I see. It's understandable to feel that way after a work transition. Can you tell me more about what specifically feels overwhelming in this new environment for you?

User: It just feels so different from what I'm used to. I worry I won't be able to perform well and that affects my motivation even more. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Li. It's common to feel uncertain when faced with change. What kind of thoughts come to mind when you think about your performance in this new role?

User: I often think I’ll fail or that I’m not good enough. Those thoughts make me want to avoid facing challenges.

Consultant: It sounds like these thoughts are quite heavy for you. Let's explore this a bit. When those thoughts arise, what emotions do they trigger in you?

User: I feel anxious and a bit defeated. It makes it hard to concentrate on tasks.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It can be so impactful when our thoughts create such strong feelings. Have you noticed any situations where you successfully managed to push through those thoughts and feelings?

User: Not really. I often just choose to avoid tasks altogether when I feel that way.

Consultant: Avoidance can seem like a quick solution, but it often prevents us from overcoming challenges. What do you think would happen if you tried to face those tasks instead of avoiding them?

User: I guess I would feel even more anxious, but maybe I would also have a sense of accomplishment if I completed them.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Li! Facing tasks might feel scary, but the potential for accomplishment can be quite motivating. Let's think about setting some small, achievable goals to help you get started. What would be a small step you could take this week?

User: Maybe I could tackle a small project at work that I’ve been putting off?

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic start! What specifically about this project feels manageable for you to begin with?

User: I could start by making a list of what needs to be done. That feels doable.

Consultant: Excellent choice! Creating a list can help you break it down into more manageable parts. How do you feel about this plan right now?

User: I feel a bit of relief. It seems less daunting when I think of it in smaller steps.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Smaller steps can make a big difference. Let's also think about how you can support yourself emotionally as you take these steps. What can you remind yourself when anxiety creeps in?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it's okay to take baby steps and that I'm capable of handling new challenges.

Consultant: That's a wonderful affirmation! It's so important to encourage yourself with positive reminders. How about we practice that affirmation together? 

User: Sure. I could say, “I'm capable of handling new challenges, and it's okay to take my time.”

Consultant: Perfect! Let's make that a part of your daily routine. I'm really proud of the progress you've made today, Li. As we approach the end of our session, what do you think you've learned about setting your goals more clearly?

User: I’ve realized that I need to break down my fears and tasks into smaller pieces and be kinder to myself during the process.

Consultant: That's a valuable lesson to carry forward! Recognizing that it's a journey is crucial. As we wrap up today, what strategies can you use if you find yourself feeling overwhelmed again in the future?

User: I can refer back to my list of smaller tasks and use my affirmation to calm myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Remember, it's all about gradual progress. You've done great work today, Li. If you find yourself needing support again, I'm here for you.

User: Thank you so much! I feel more positive about facing my challenges now.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Take care, and I look forward to our next session together.

User: Hi! I've been okay, but I still feel uncertain about my career path. I want to find a direction that feels right for me, but I have doubts about my abilities.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable, Li. It sounds like you’re grappling with some career uncertainty. Can you share a bit more about what specifically feels confusing for you at this moment?

User: I’m just not sure if I’m good enough to succeed in this new role. There are days when I think I might want to try something different, but I fear I won’t be able to make that shift.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-doubt. When those doubts pop up, how do they affect your emotions and motivation?

User: I feel anxious a lot, and that anxiety makes me just want to avoid dealing with my work altogether. It’s like I spiral into a cycle of negative thinking.

Consultant: I hear you, Li. It can be tough when those feelings overwhelm you. Have you been able to identify any specific thoughts you have about your abilities during these times?

User: I often think things like “I’ll never be good enough,” or “What if I mess everything up?” Those thoughts just bring me down further.

Consultant: Those thoughts can create a heavy load to carry. Let’s try to challenge those beliefs a bit. Can you think of any evidence or experiences that might contradict those thoughts?

User: Well, I’ve completed projects successfully in the past, and my manager has mentioned that I have potential. But I guess I tend to forget those moments when I’m feeling low.

Consultant: That's an important realization, Li! It's easy to overlook past successes when we're caught up in negative thinking. How might you remind yourself of those achievements when self-doubt creeps in?

User: Maybe I could keep a list of positive feedback I've received or things I’ve accomplished. That might help me remember my capabilities.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic strategy! Having tangible reminders can help combat those negative thoughts. As we move forward, let’s think about identifying a small goal related to exploring your career options. What’s a manageable first step you could take to help clarify what you want?

User: I could research potential roles that align with my interests and values this week. That feels like a good start.

Consultant: Excellent choice! Researching can provide you with insights and clarity. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: Honestly, I feel a bit excited and less overwhelmed. It gives me something direct to work on.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that excitement! Setting actionable steps can create momentum. As you approach this research, remind yourself of your past successes. Is there a phrase or affirmation you could say to encourage yourself through this process?

User: I could remind myself, “I am capable of exploring new opportunities, and I have succeeded before.”

Consultant: That's a powerful affirmation! Integrating that kind of self-talk can make a significant difference. How do you feel about incorporating this affirmation as you move forward with your research?

User: That sounds good! I think it would help boost my confidence when I start to feel anxious about the unknown.

Consultant: Absolutely! Confidence building is key in navigating your career. As we wrap up this session, let’s reflect on your progress. What’s the most important takeaway for you today?

User: I realized that I have strengths I can lean on, and taking small steps to explore my interests might lead to clearer opportunities.

Consultant: That makes perfect sense, Li. Career uncertainty can be really challenging to navigate. Can you share more about what specifically feels confusing for you at the moment?

Consultant: Hello, Li! It’s great to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing okay overall, but my anxiety about social situations is still there. I did try to engage with my colleagues, but I still feel uncertain about my social skills.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way, Li. Trying to connect with colleagues is a step in the right direction. Can you share more about how those interactions went for you?

User: I managed to organize a small team lunch, and a few colleagues came. It felt slightly better than before, but afterwards, I still felt anxious and worried about whether I had said the right things.

Consultant: That’s a commendable effort, Li! You’re taking steps to engage with your colleagues, which is great. However, it seems that the worries are still lingering. What thoughts were going through your mind during and after the lunch?

User: I kept thinking, “Did I talk too much?” or “What if they found me boring?” Those thoughts really lingered and made me doubt myself.

Consultant: Those types of thoughts can certainly weigh heavily on you. When you think thoughts like that, how do they impact the way you feel about yourself and the situation?

User: I feel anxious and a bit embarrassed. It makes me hesitant to try socializing again, even though I know I want to.

Consultant: I understand how those feelings can create a barrier. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit further, okay? What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts those negative thoughts?

User: I suppose some colleagues did seem to enjoy the lunch, and they said they had a nice time. But I always focus on my own worries instead of those positive signals.

Consultant: That’s an important observation, Li! It’s easy to focus on the negatives and ignore the positives. How could you remind yourself of the enjoyable moments when self-doubt tries to creep back in?

User: Maybe I could keep a positive feedback journal where I write down compliments or positive interactions I have with colleagues.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Keeping a record of positive experiences can help reinforce your confidence. Now, let’s set a small, achievable goal for you regarding social interactions. What feels manageable for you this week?

User: I could aim to invite a colleague for coffee or have a one-on-one chat with someone. That feels more comfortable than a large group setting.

Consultant: Excellent choice! A one-on-one setting is a great way to build connections. How do you feel about taking that step this week?

User: Honestly, I feel a bit nervous but also excited. It seems more doable than larger gatherings.

Consultant: That excitement is a positive sign! Remember to use your feedback journal to remind yourself that you are capable. What affirmations or positive self-talk could help you as you prepare for these interactions?

User: I could remind myself, “I am learning and improving my social skills, and it's okay to feel a little anxious.”

Consultant: That’s a wonderful affirmation! Incorporating that self-talk can ease your anxiety. How comfortable do you feel using this affirmation during your social interactions?

User: I think it would help me a lot! It sounds reassuring to remember that it’s a process.
