Consultant: Hello, Xiao Kong! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious and lonely. I rejected my classmates' invitations to gatherings because I didn't want to go, and now I feel like they've isolated me. It's really bothering me and affecting my studies.

Consultant: I understand how difficult that must feel for you. You're experiencing anxiety and loneliness, especially with how your classmates have responded. Can you tell me more about the feelings you have when you think about those gatherings?

User: I feel really anxious at the thought of going. It's like there's a heavy weight on my chest, and I worry that I won't fit in or enjoy myself. But now that I rejected their invitations, I feel so lonely and left out.

Consultant: It sounds like you're caught in a tough situation—feeling anxious about social interactions while also feeling lonely because of the choices you've made. If you could imagine a way to reduce that anxiety and feel more connected with your classmates, what would that look like for you?

User: I wish I could feel confident and not so nervous. Maybe if I could just express myself better and not worry so much about what others think, I'd feel more comfortable.

Consultant: That's a great goal, Xiao Kong! Building your confidence and expressing yourself is definitely achievable. Let's explore together, what specific thoughts come to mind when you think about rejoining those social activities?

User: I keep thinking that they probably won’t want me there anymore. I feel like I've ruined my chances of fitting in.

Consultant: It sounds like you're worried about their perceptions of you. Can you identify any evidence that supports that thought? Or do you think there might be other perspectives to consider?

User: I don't really have any solid evidence, I just feel that way. I just keep assuming that they’re all talking about me and judging me for not wanting to go.

Consultant: That’s a common thought pattern called "mind reading," where we assume we know what others are thinking. If a friend was in your situation, how would you encourage them to view it?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to not go to every gathering, and that their friends would understand. But I don’t feel like I can apply that advice to myself.

Consultant: It’s tough to apply that kindness to ourselves. We can practice shifting your perspective. Let’s think about it: what if you reached out to a classmate and explained how you were feeling? How do you think they would respond?

User: I think they might be understanding. I’ve just been so afraid to reach out and look weak or needy.

Consultant: It's totally understandable to feel that way. Remember, reaching out can actually show strength and vulnerability. What could be a small first step to start that process?

User: Maybe I could send a casual message to one of them? It feels less intimidating than seeing them in person right now.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! A casual message can open up the lines of communication, and you won’t feel overwhelmed. What would you want to say in that message?

User: I could just say that I've been feeling a bit off and that I hope to join them next time. It feels a bit scary, though.

Consultant: It's okay to feel scared—it’s a step outside of your comfort zone. Remember, addressing how you feel may help you feel more connected. How about we discuss ways to cope with that anxiety before you send the message?

User: Sure, I think that would help. I don't want to feel so anxious about it when I do it.

Consultant: Let's try some relaxation techniques together. Deep breathing exercises can help calm your mind. We can practice a few breaths if you like. Ready to give it a try?

User: Okay, I’m willing to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four... hold it for a moment... and now slowly exhale through your mouth for a count of six. How did that feel?

User: It felt a bit calming. I think I could use this before I send the message.

Consultant: Absolutely! You can use that technique anytime you feel anxious. With practice, it can help manage those feelings. Remember, reconnecting with others takes time, and that’s okay. What do you feel is your next step after sending the message?

User: I guess I’ll try to relax and just see how they respond. I hope they’re friendly about it.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset. You’re actively trying to reengage which is a positive step! Just remember, no matter the response, it doesn't define your worth or ability to connect. How do you feel about the progress you've made today?

User: I feel a bit hopeful, actually. I’m still nervous, but discussing this and having a plan helps. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Acknowledging your feelings is an important part of this journey. As we conclude today, what’s one takeaway you’d like to remember from our session?

User: I think recognizing that it’s okay to reach out for support is important. I can also use breathing techniques to help when I feel anxious.

Consultant: Yes, that's a fantastic takeaway! Keep practicing those skills. Remember, you're not alone in this journey; I'm here to help. If you feel ready, we can continue to work together on building your confidence next time. I look forward to our next session!

User: Thanks, I appreciate your help. I feel more encouraged now.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiao Kong! I'm proud of the steps you’re taking. Take care, and I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaokong! I'm glad to see you again today. Last time, we discussed how you felt at the class gathering, and it sounds like you still have some concerns about social situations. Can you share how you've been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! Yes, I’ve been thinking a lot about what happened at the gathering. I felt really anxious, and it was difficult for me to express my thoughts even though I wanted to join in. I still worry about how I come across to others.

Consultant: I understand that feeling anxious about expressing yourself can be very challenging. You mentioned that you want to feel more confident in social settings. Could you describe what that confidence would look like for you?

User: I hope to speak up more easily and not overthink my words. I want to feel like I belong and that my opinions matter in the group.

Consultant: That's a valuable goal. Feeling like you belong and that your voice matters is important in social interactions. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel anxious in these situations?

User: I think it's mostly the fear of being judged or rejected. In the gathering, I kept worrying that my comments wouldn’t be received well or that people wouldn’t agree with me.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure from the fear of judgment. Let’s explore what thoughts go through your mind in those moments. What do you typically tell yourself when you feel this way?

User: I often think that if I say something wrong, everyone will laugh at me or think I'm stupid. It makes me want to just stay silent.

Consultant: That’s understandable; those thoughts can create a lot of pressure. Let’s challenge those negative thoughts. What evidence do you have that people would laugh at you or think negatively? Have you ever had an experience where someone reacted kindly to your contributions?

User: I can't really think of any specific incidents where that happened. Usually, my friends are supportive. It’s just my mind telling me the worst.

Consultant: It’s good to hear that your friends are supportive! Sometimes our minds can amplify our fears, causing us to imagine negative outcomes when they’re not likely to happen. How might it feel to challenge that thought, perhaps by reminding yourself of those supportive moments?

User: I guess if I reminded myself of those moments, it might help calm my nerves a bit. I could focus on the support rather than the fear.

Consultant: That’s a positive insight. Let’s try to create a self-affirmation or a statement you can use to counter those negative thoughts. What’s something you could say to yourself that reflects your ability to express your thoughts positively?

User: Maybe something like, "My thoughts are valid, and it's okay to share them." 

Consultant: That’s an excellent affirmation! Repeating that to yourself before and during social events could help build your confidence. Let’s practice how you might initiate sharing your thoughts in a group. What could you say to start a conversation?

User: I could say something like, "I’ve been thinking about this topic, and I’d love to share my perspective." 

Consultant: That’s a great way to express yourself! It invites others to listen while also showing that you value your thoughts. How do you feel about using this approach when you're in a social setting?

User: It sounds manageable! I think it might help me feel more in control during conversations. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It seems like you're starting to find ways to feel more in control in social settings. In our upcoming sessions, we can continue to practice and refine strategies like this. Are there any specific scenarios you anticipate encountering in future social situations where you could use these techniques?

User: I have a study group coming up, and I really want to try this there. It would be a good opportunity for me to speak up.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect situation to test out your new strategies! Before the study group, remind yourself of your affirmation and practice initiating conversations. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good. I feel a little more confident just thinking about it.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear, Xiaokong! Confidence can build with practice. Remember, it's okay to feel nervous; the goal is to acknowledge those feelings and still give yourself permission to participate. 

User: I need to remind myself that it’s okay to feel nervous and that I’m still allowed to contribute.

Consultant: Absolutely! Embracing those nerves while still pushing through can lead to growth. As you work on this, we can also discuss setting boundaries in social scenarios to help manage any discomfort. How does that idea resonate with you?

User: I think setting boundaries sounds helpful. Sometimes I feel pressured to contribute or agree with everything, which adds to my stress.

Consultant: Setting boundaries can definitely help relieve some of that pressure. You could practice saying no to things that overwhelm you or expressing your own opinions respectfully even when they differ from others. How do you feel about trying that?

User: I’d like to try that. It’s scary but maybe important for me to establish limits.

Consultant: It is an important step in building self-confidence and ensuring your needs are met. Over the next few sessions, we can continue to work on how to assert yourself in social situations while respecting your boundaries. 

User: I really appreciate this guidance. I feel like I’m starting to understand how to manage my feelings better.

Consultant: You're making great strides, and it's lovely to see you recognize your progress! As we move forward, let’s focus on reinforcing these skills. Is there anything specific you would like to address in our next session?

User: Maybe we can role-play a few scenarios for practice? I think it would help me to rehearse what to say.

Consultant: Role-playing sounds like a wonderful idea! We can simulate different situations and practice your affirmations and conversation starters. This will help you feel more prepared. I'm looking forward to our next session! 

User: Thank you so much! I feel more hopeful about the upcoming gathering now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaokong! I’m here to support you. Keep practicing those affirmations and remember that every small step counts. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today, Xiao Kong. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi there. I've been trying to engage more with my classmates, but I still feel this pressure when I think about possibly rejecting someone's request. It's quite conflicting for me.

Consultant: I see. You want to connect more with your peers, yet you're worried about how they might react if you turn them down. Can you share what specific interactions have caused you this pressure recently?

User: Well, I recently attended a club meeting and tried to talk to a few people. When they asked me to join them for coffee, I hesitated, fearing I might disappoint them if I said no. 

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, wanting to fit in but feeling nervous about potentially disappointing others. What thoughts went through your mind at that moment?

User: I thought about how they might feel rejected, or how they might not want to talk to me again. It made me feel guilty just thinking of saying no.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. It sounds like you have a lot of empathy for others, which is admirable, but it’s important to balance that with your own needs. How do you think you might respond differently in such situations?

User: I guess I could just politely decline without overthinking it. But I find it challenging to imagine myself doing that.

Consultant: You're on the right track. What if we explored some ways you could practice saying no without feeling overwhelming guilt? This could help you feel more confident.

User: That sounds helpful. I want to learn how to set these boundaries.

Consultant: Great! Let's start with some role-playing exercises. Imagine a classmate asks you to help with a project that you're not available for. How might you phrase your response?

User: I could say something like, "I really appreciate your offer, but I can't help this time." 

Consultant: Exactly! That's a clear yet kind way to decline. What's your initial reaction to saying that out loud?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but it sounds reasonable. 

Consultant: It is reasonable! It’s important to honor your own time and energy. What do you think might change for you if you practice using that phrase?

User: I think I might feel more in control, and maybe even more respected.

Consultant: Absolutely! Feeling in control can significantly reduce your anxiety. Let's try adding the concept of the "rubber band effect." When you feel the urge to say yes when you want to say no, imagine a rubber band stretching. How can this imagery help?

User: I guess it could remind me that I'm just trying to maintain my boundaries and that it's okay to feel stretched a little by saying no.

Consultant: Yes, that stretching can be uncomfortable but also necessary. This is a part of building healthier relationships. What do you think would happen if you actually tried it out during your next social situation?

User: I might feel uneasy at first, but hopefully, after a couple of times, it would become easier. 

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! It will take practice, but with time, you'll likely find it easier to uphold those boundaries. How does that align with your goals for this week?

User: I want to try to stick to my boundaries and not feel guilty about it, especially next time I'm asked to hang out.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Remember, it’s okay to prioritize your own comfort too. Let's check in on how this goes in our next session. 

User: Sure! I’m looking forward to it and feeling hopeful about using these strategies.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Before we wrap up today, do you have any final thoughts or concerns about applying what we discussed?

User: Not really, I just feel like I have a clearer action plan now, and I’m excited to try it out.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiao Kong! I'm proud of your willingness to take these steps. Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s okay to feel unsure sometimes. We’ll review your experiences next time to see what worked best for you. 

User: Thank you for your support! I appreciate it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here to help, and I’m looking forward to our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Kong! I'm glad you're here for this session. I understand you've been reflecting on your social connections and want to strengthen your relationships with your new classmates. Let's explore how you’re feeling about it. Can you share what you’re experiencing right now regarding these interactions?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling a bit more confident after catching up with some old friends. It felt nice to reconnect. But when it comes to making new friends and fitting in with my new classmates, I still feel a bit uncertain. I want to know how to take the next steps.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing some positive feelings from reconnecting with friends, which is great! However, the uncertainty with new classmates is still present. What specific aspects make you feel uncertain about building these new connections?

User: I think it's mainly about how to approach them. Sometimes I feel like they might not be interested in getting to know me, and that makes me hesitant to initiate conversations.

Consultant: That hesitation is quite common when meeting new people. It’s essential to recognize that many individuals feel similar insecurities. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think of approaching your new classmates? 

User: I often think, “What if they don’t want to talk to me?” or “What if I embarrass myself?” These thoughts make it hard for me to start a conversation.

Consultant: Those thoughts can indeed create a barrier. Let’s analyze them. How much evidence do you think supports those thoughts? Have there been times when your assumptions didn’t match reality?

User: Well, thinking back, I noticed a few times when I did start a conversation, and the other person seemed engaged. But I still get caught up in those negative thoughts. 

Consultant: It sounds like there are moments that contradict your current worries. Let’s replace those fears with more balanced thoughts. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them to think before approaching someone new?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone is looking to make connections and that it’s okay to just be yourself. They could find that others are more open than they expect.

Consultant: That’s a very constructive perspective! Incorporating that idea might help shift your mindset. Let’s explore some actionable steps. Can we brainstorm situations where you could initiate conversations with your classmates? 

User: Sure! I could try talking to them after class or during group projects. Maybe I could also join some clubs or activities they participate in.

Consultant: Those are fantastic ideas! Engaging in shared interests can definitely make interactions feel more natural. How do you feel about setting a goal for yourself to initiate a conversation with at least one new classmate this week?

User: That sounds doable! I think I could aim for at least one conversation. It makes me feel a bit nervous, but also excited.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear you feel a mix of nervousness and excitement. That means you’re stepping out of your comfort zone. How can you prepare for that conversation to feel more confident?

User: Maybe I could think of a few topics to discuss in advance, like asking about their studies or interests. That way, I wouldn’t feel so stuck.

Consultant: Preparing topics is an excellent strategy! It gives you a sense of direction. As you get ready for this, remember to also remind yourself of those positive experiences you’ve had in the past. How will you handle it if a conversation doesn’t go as planned?

User: I guess I would remind myself that not every conversation will go perfectly, and that’s okay. It doesn’t mean I should stop trying.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s all about learning from each experience. How do you feel about your social confidence and willingness to participate in group activities after discussing this?

User: I definitely feel more encouraged. I want to be proactive and try to engage more with my classmates and find my place in the group.

Consultant: That’s fantastic news! Focusing on these actionable steps will assist in building your connections. Before we wrap up today, is there any other concern you would like to address regarding your social interactions?

User: No, I think we covered a lot today. I’m feeling optimistic about the next steps. I appreciate your support!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Kong! Remember, every small step you take contributes to your overall progress. Reflecting on today, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from this session?

User: I think the importance of preparation and changing my mindset stands out to me. It’s okay to feel nervous, but I can use that to motivate myself rather than hold me back.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway! Being aware of your feelings and using them constructively can lead to personal growth. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Please keep practicing those social skills, and remember, you’re not alone in this journey. 

User: Thank you! I will do my best and keep you updated on how it goes.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Kong! I believe in your ability to build those connections. Enjoy your week, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need further support along the way. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaokong! I'm glad to see you for our session today. You’ve been working on enhancing your social confidence, and I would love to hear how things have been going since our last meeting.

User: Hi! I really appreciate your support. I've been feeling more confident lately when participating in group activities at school. Just the other day, I felt a real sense of joy from collaborating with my peers.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear that you’re enjoying teamwork. Can you share more about a specific moment during those activities that made you feel particularly confident or connected?

User: Sure! During our last meeting, I suggested an idea, and the group actually liked it! I felt good about contributing, and it made me want to participate even more.

Consultant: Contributing ideas and receiving positive feedback is a fantastic way to build confidence. How has that experience influenced your desire to engage in more such activities?

User: It definitely motivated me. I want to join more clubs or events where I can share my thoughts and ideas freely. I think it would help maintain the connections I've started to build.

Consultant: That’s a great goal! Building on those connections can really enhance your social experience. What specific types of clubs or activities are you considering joining?

User: I’ve been thinking about joining a debate club or a cultural exchange group. I feel they’ll give me opportunities to express myself and meet new people.

Consultant: Both sound like excellent choices! Engaging in debate could also help enhance your communication skills further. Do you have any concerns about stepping into these new environments?

User: A little bit, yes. I sometimes worry about not fitting in or not being able to express my opinions clearly.

Consultant: Those concerns are completely understandable. Remember, many people probably share similar feelings when entering new groups. If you were to approach a new group, what strategies might you use to help ease that discomfort?

User: I think I could prepare a bit in advance, maybe think of some topics I’m interested in discussing. Also, I could start by listening and then gradually share my thoughts.

Consultant: Preparing topics is a smart strategy! Starting by listening also allows you to familiarize yourself with the group's dynamics. How do you think you’d feel if you used that approach?

User: I believe it would make me feel more comfortable. I’d feel less pressure to jump in right away, and it could help me gauge the group's vibe before I share.

Consultant: Absolutely! By taking your time to observe, you might find it easier to contribute more comfortably. As you think about trying out these clubs, how else could you reinforce those newfound connections you’ve made already?

User: I could reach out to the friends I've made through these activities. Maybe organizing a small get-together or just checking in with them more often.

Consultant: That's a brilliant idea! Regular check-ins can help maintain those connections. What do you think might be the biggest challenge in keeping those connections alive?

User: I guess it's easy to get busy with schoolwork and forget to reach out sometimes. I want to make an effort not to let that happen.

Consultant: Acknowledging potential challenges is a big step. Would setting specific times or reminders to connect with friends help you stay engaged?

User: Yes, setting reminders could work! I could even plan monthly meet-ups to ensure we stay connected.

Consultant: That’s a healthy strategy! It gives you something to look forward to as well. As you move forward, how do you feel about your social abilities overall?

User: I feel more positive about them than before. I think I’ve grown and can handle social situations better now.

Consultant: That’s amazing to hear! Embracing your progress is key. Are there particular moments or interactions you believe showcase this growth?

User: I think just speaking up in meetings and not feeling too nervous about it has been a big one for me. I’d never have done that before!

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement, Xiaokong! Being able to voice your thoughts in a group setting reflects a boost in self-confidence. Looking ahead, what aspects of your social skills would you like to continue developing?

User: I’d like to work on being more assertive and confident when sharing my opinions without second-guessing myself.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic aim! Practicing assertiveness can enhance your interactions greatly. How would you feel about role-playing some scenarios to help build that assertiveness?

User: I think that could be really helpful! Practicing could prepare me for real situations and boost my confidence.

Consultant: Great! We can focus on some common scenarios you might encounter. As we wrap up today, let’s solidify a plan—how will you implement what we've discussed moving forward?

User: I’ll start by preparing topics for discussions, setting reminders for check-ins, and planning that monthly meetup with friends. I feel excited about these steps!

Consultant: Those are solid actions, and it sounds like you’re truly committed to strengthening those connections. Reflecting on our session, what do you believe your biggest takeaway is?

User: I think it’s that I’ve gained the confidence to step out more socially and that I have strategies to maintain and grow those connections.

Consultant: Absolutely! Confidence and effective strategies are key to your progress. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. You’re doing brilliantly, and I believe in your ability to keep growing. If you ever feel the need for support again, you know where to find me.

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help and guidance. I feel like I can take on these challenges now!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaokong! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. Keep it up, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Kong! Welcome back. I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. I'm more confident in my social skills and I'm starting to think more clearly about my future plans.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made some great progress. What specific experiences have contributed to your increased confidence?

User: I think talking with my classmates more openly has really helped. I've been actively participating in group discussions, and I feel like I belong more.

Consultant: Engaging more with your classmates is a great step. It’s good to hear that you feel a sense of belonging. How does that make you feel in terms of your personal growth?

User: I feel like I'm moving forward in my personal growth. It’s like I’m not just existing in my environment anymore; I’m actually part of it.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, Xiao Kong. Feeling like a part of your environment can enhance your sense of connection and purpose. What goals do you have for your personal and career development moving forward?

User: I want to develop better leadership skills and perhaps get involved in student organizations. I think that will help me grow even more.

Consultant: Getting involved in student organizations is a fantastic way to develop your leadership skills! Have you identified any specific organizations or roles you’re interested in?

User: Yes, I'm considering applying for a coordinator position in a student club that focuses on community service. I think it aligns with my values.

Consultant: That sounds like a meaningful opportunity! Coordinating a community service club could provide you with valuable experiences. What do you think might be some challenges you could face in this role?

User: I’m worried about managing my time effectively. Balancing studies and leading a club can be overwhelming, I think.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. Time management is a common concern when taking on new responsibilities. How do you currently manage your time with your studies?

User: I usually try to plan my week ahead, but sometimes I get sidetracked with distractions, which makes it hard to stick to my plan.

Consultant: Planning your week is a great start! To manage distractions, what strategies have you tried so far?

User: I’ve tried using apps to block social media while I study, but I find myself finding ways around them sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like you're aware of your distractions, which is a good first step. Would you be open to exploring additional strategies to help you stay focused during study sessions?

User: Yes, I would love some suggestions!

Consultant: Great! One strategy could be using the Pomodoro Technique, where you work for a set amount of time, say 25 minutes, and then take a short break. This can help maintain focus and reduce burnout. How does that sound to you?

User: I’ve heard of the Pomodoro Technique but haven’t tried it yet. I think giving it a go could be beneficial, especially for my upcoming exams.

Consultant: Definitely! It might help you find a rhythm that works for you. Let’s discuss how you can implement this technique into your study routine. How about setting specific times during the day dedicated to studying?

User: Yes, I can schedule specific study blocks in my calendar. That might help me stick to the plan better.

Consultant: Scheduling study blocks is a great idea! You could also incorporate the community service club meetings into your calendar. That way, you'll have a better overview of your commitments. How does that sound?

User: That sounds really helpful! I guess I just need to be more diligent about following my schedule.

Consultant: Yes, consistency will be key. Remember, it’s okay to adjust your schedule as needed. What will you do to ensure you stick to it?

User: I could use reminders on my phone, and maybe buddy up with someone from the class to keep each other accountable.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Having someone to support you can make a significant difference. Is there someone in particular you have in mind?

User: I have a study partner in my class; I think she would be up for it. 

Consultant: Fantastic! Connecting with your study partner for accountability can be really helpful. Now, as we wrap up today’s session, what are the key takeaways for you?

User: I’ve learned that implementing a schedule and using the Pomodoro Technique could really enhance my focus. Also, involving my study partner could keep me accountable.

Consultant: Those are valuable insights, Xiao Kong. It’s been great discussing your progress and future plans with you. I believe you're on the right track to maintain your growth. Before we end, how do you feel about your journey moving forward?

User: I feel optimistic and empowered. I’m excited to put my plans into action!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, you have the tools and support to keep moving forward. If you need any further guidance in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Take care, Xiao Kong! I'm looking forward to seeing you again.
