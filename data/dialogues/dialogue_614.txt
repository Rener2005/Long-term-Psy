Consultant: Hello, L! I'm really glad to have you here today. How have you been feeling about your new school and classmates since you moved to Tianjin?

User: Hi. It's been pretty tough. I feel a lot of pressure trying to fit in. I often don't want to join group activities because it makes me anxious. I really want to connect with others, but I just can't find a way to do it.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It's understandable to feel anxious in a new environment, especially when you want to connect with your peers. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel anxious about joining those activities?

User: I guess I worry that I won’t know what to say or do, and that everyone will think I'm weird or not want to be with me. Sometimes I just feel so different from everyone else.

Consultant: It's normal to have those fears when you’re in a new place. It seems like you really long for connection, but the fear of judgment is holding you back. Have you had any experiences in your new school that made you feel even more isolated?

User: Yeah, I remember during a group project, I just sat there silently while everyone else talked. I felt so out of place and just wanted to disappear.

Consultant: That must have been really frustrating for you. It’s tough to be in a situation where you want to participate but feel like you can’t. What do you think led to you feeling out of place during that project?

User: I think it's because I don’t know anyone very well, and I’m not as good at math as the others. I actually feel embarrassed about it.

Consultant: Feeling embarrassed is completely understandable, especially when you feel different academically. It's important to remember that everyone has strengths and weaknesses. What if we explored how these feelings of embarrassment affect your willingness to join in on activities?

User: I hesitate to join anything because I fear my classmates will judge me if I make mistakes. It makes me want to avoid interactions altogether.

Consultant: It seems like your fear of judgment is a big barrier for you. If you could reframe that thought—perhaps thinking that everyone makes mistakes—how might that change your feelings about joining those activities?

User: I guess if I thought about it that way, I wouldn’t feel so scared. But it's hard to remember that when I'm feeling pressured.

Consultant: It can be tough to shift your mindset in the moment. Let’s try to work on that together. What if we practiced some positive affirmations you can tell yourself before participating? 

User: That could be helpful! I think if I had a few encouraging reminders, it might ease my anxiety before joining in.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Perhaps something like, “I am learning, and making mistakes is part of the process,” could remind you that it’s okay to not be perfect. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I think I could use that.

Consultant: Awesome! Now, besides working on those affirmations, are there any activities or small group interactions you’ve felt comfortable with so far?

User: Well, I did a little talking in art class. I actually enjoy drawing and painting.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Art can be a wonderful way to connect with others. How did it feel to open up a bit in art class?

User: It felt nice. I found that some classmates liked my drawings, and we talked about our art. I didn’t feel as anxious then.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It sounds like you had a positive experience when you shared something you love. Maybe you can use that as a bridge to connect with classmates in other subjects. What do you think?

User: Yes, that might work! If I can talk about my artwork, I could maybe transition to talking about school subjects.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s all about finding common ground. When discussing learning subjects, think about how you can relate them to your interests. How does that idea resonate with you?

User: I like that idea, especially using art to explain things. It feels more natural for me.

Consultant: That's wonderful! Using your strengths in art can support your learning in other areas too. While we’re discussing this, let’s also think about your feelings toward math. What are some thoughts you have that might be holding you back?

User: I just keep thinking that I’ll never be as good as my classmates, and it makes me want to give up.

Consultant: That’s a common thought pattern—feeling overwhelmed by comparison. What if you were to challenge that thought? Is there evidence that can show you are capable of improvement?

User: Well, I did pass my last math test, even if it was just barely. So I guess there’s hope.

Consultant: Absolutely, L! Passing that test indicates you have the ability to learn and improve. Let's focus on building on your strength. What small, achievable goals can we set for you in math to regain confidence?

User: Maybe I could try to learn one new concept each week instead of trying to understand everything at once.

Consultant: That sounds like a smart and manageable approach! Breaking it down into smaller goals can make it feel less overwhelming. How will you keep track of your progress?

User: I could make a chart or diary to see how I improve each week!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Keeping a visual log can boost your motivation. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Let’s schedule follow-up discussions to check in on how these strategies are working for you.

User: Okay, that sounds good! Talking with you helps me feel more positive about all this.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! You’re taking important steps toward feeling better about your situation. Remember, it's okay to reach out whenever you need support. You've got this, L!

User: Thanks! I feel a bit lighter after talking. I'm looking forward to trying all these ideas.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Keep focusing on your strengths and don't hesitate to reach out if things feel tough again. You’re doing well, and I’m confident you'll find your way through this.

User: I appreciate that! I’ll work on what we've discussed. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! Let’s keep building on these positive experiences. I look forward to our next session, L. Take care!

Consultant: Hello L! I'm glad you're here today. I know that you've been feeling a bit confused about your math scores lately. Let's talk about how you’ve been feeling and what we can do to help you regain your confidence in learning.

User: Hi! Yeah, I've been really upset about my math grades. I thought I was good at math, but my scores are not reflecting that. It makes me feel like giving up.

Consultant: I completely understand your frustration. It sounds like you really want to do well but are feeling discouraged because of the gap between your expectations and your actual performance. Can you tell me more about how this situation affects your feelings towards studying?

User: Well, I used to enjoy math, but now it just seems pointless when I can't get the grades I want. I also feel anxious before tests and sometimes I don’t even want to study at all.

Consultant: It's really tough when something you used to enjoy becomes a source of anxiety. It seems like this experience is impacting your motivation to study. Let’s try to explore your thoughts—when you see your math scores, what kind of thoughts go through your mind?

User: I think maybe I'm not smart enough, or that I’ll never succeed at math. It's just really frustrating.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy to carry. What would it look like for you to think differently about your abilities in math? Is there a possibility that there might be other explanations for your scores? 

User: I guess I could be overthinking things. Maybe I haven’t been studying the right way, or I just need more practice?

Consultant: That's a great insight! By considering different factors, such as study techniques or practice, you're opening the door to new possibilities. How about we set some small, achievable goals for studying math? What could be a first step for you?

User: Maybe I could start by practicing a few problems each day instead of trying to do everything at once.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Setting smaller goals can make studying feel more manageable and less overwhelming. Can we also explore some specific math topics where you feel less confident? 

User: Yes, I struggle with fractions and word problems the most.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that! Focusing on fractions and word problems as your initial targets sounds effective. Why don't we aim to practice those a bit this week? After that, we can check in to see how you're feeling about your progress.

User: That sounds good! I think I'll feel more confident if I can improve on those areas.

Consultant: Absolutely! Progress in those specific areas can help you feel more capable. How about we also discuss strategies for dealing with the anxiety you feel before tests? 

User: I sometimes feel really nervous and don’t know how to handle it. 

Consultant: It’s normal to feel that way, especially during exams. We could explore some relaxation techniques together. Would you be interested in trying some breathing exercises or visualization techniques to help manage that anxiety?

User: Yes, I would like to try that!

Consultant: Great! Let's start with a simple breathing exercise. When you start to feel anxious, take a deep breath in for four seconds, hold it for four seconds, and then breathe out for four seconds. Let’s practice that together now.

User: Okay, I’m trying it.

Consultant: Perfect! How did that feel for you? 

User: I feel a little calmer already!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! This technique can be a great tool for you during tough moments. Along with your study goals, practicing this breathing can really help reduce your anxiety. 

User: I’ll definitely try using this before my next math test.

Consultant: I believe it will make a difference. Let’s keep working on your confidence and addressing those study habits you want to develop. Remember, setbacks are just a part of the learning process. 

User: Thanks, that really helps. 

Consultant: You’re making great strides already, L. Before our next session, reflect on your experiences with your new study plan and breathing exercises. 

User: I will! I’m excited to see how it goes.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! We’ll meet again soon to discuss your progress. You’re on the right track. 

User: Thank you for your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, it’s okay to reach out if you need support before our next session. Take care and keep practicing! 

User: I will! See you next time!

Consultant: See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, L! I'm glad you're here for our session today. I understand that you've been working on improving your interactions with classmates. How have you been feeling about those attempts recently?

User: Hi! Well, I've been trying to talk to my classmates, but I often feel frustrated when things don’t go well. I don’t know how to start a conversation, and sometimes I feel awkward.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you have a strong desire to connect with your classmates, but the difficulties in starting conversations can be discouraging. What are some specific situations that have made you feel this way?

User: There was one time during lunch when I wanted to join a group playing a game, but I just stood there for a while, and then I left because I felt too nervous to approach them.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable to feel nervous in those situations. Can you share what thoughts went through your mind when you were standing there, wanting to join the game?

User: I thought they wouldn’t want me there or that I would embarrass myself if I said something silly. 

Consultant: Those thoughts can definitely make it harder to approach others. It seems like you might be worrying about how they would react. If a friend were in your situation, what might you tell them about those thoughts?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to try, and even if it doesn’t go perfectly, it’s better than staying alone. 

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! It sounds like you recognize that trying is valuable, even if it feels scary. What do you think could help you feel more confident when taking that step to join in?

User: Maybe I could practice some conversation starters or think of a specific game I could ask to join in.

Consultant: Practicing conversation starters is an excellent idea! It can help ease some of the anxiety about the unknown. Let’s try coming up with a few examples together. What kind of games do your classmates enjoy that you could ask about?

User: They like playing soccer and some video games. I guess I could ask if I could play soccer with them.

Consultant: That's a fantastic start! You can say something simple like, “Hey, I saw you guys playing soccer. Can I join you?” How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good, but I still feel nervous thinking about it. 

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous! You’re taking a brave step by considering this. Why do you think it’s important for you to give it a try, despite those nerves?

User: I think it would help me make friends and enjoy school more. Plus, I want to learn how to talk to people better.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful motivation! Making friends and enjoying school are very important. You’re already recognizing the potential benefits. How do you feel about setting a small goal for yourself to try this out in the next few days?

User: I could try it during lunch this week. I think I’ll feel more prepared if I practice what to say before.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Practicing beforehand can really help you feel more ready. What do you think you could say to yourself before you approach them?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to be nervous and that I just want to have fun.

Consultant: That’s a positive affirmation! It can help shift your focus from the nervousness to the enjoyment. Let’s think about how you’ll feel after you give it a try. What do you imagine that might be like?

User: I hope I’ll feel proud of myself for trying, even if it’s a little awkward.

Consultant: I think you will! Taking that step, regardless of the outcome, is something to be proud of. As we wrap up today, what are some key takeaways for you to remember moving forward?

User: I will remember to practice my conversation starters and just try to join in. Also, to be okay with being nervous.

Consultant: That’s great to hear, L! You’re strengthening your ability to connect with others, and embracing those nerves is part of the process. Whenever you feel ready, those social opportunities will be waiting for you. I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes in our next session! 

User: Thanks! I’m feeling a bit more excited to give it a try now.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Enjoy your week, and feel free to reflect on your experiences. Remember, you can always reach out if you need more support. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, L! I'm glad you're here today. I’d love to hear about your experiences with team activities in school. How have you been feeling about participating in them lately?

User: Hi! I’m actually feeling pretty good about it! I recently joined a sports team, and it's been fun because everyone works together.

Consultant: That sounds exciting! It's great to hear you're enjoying being part of a team. What do you think makes teamwork enjoyable for you?

User: I like how we help each other out. It feels good when we all work together to achieve something, like scoring a goal in a game.

Consultant: Absolutely! Feeling that sense of support and achievement with others can be really rewarding. Have you noticed any changes in your feelings since you started participating in these activities?

User: Yes, I feel less nervous when I'm around my teammates. It’s like we’re all in it together, which makes it easier.

Consultant: That's a wonderful observation! It's fantastic that you're feeling more comfortable in social situations. What do you think contributes to that sense of comfort with your teammates?

User: I think it's because we talk and laugh a lot during practice. It helps to break the ice and makes me feel included.

Consultant: Connecting through laughter and communication can indeed create a strong bond within a team. Have you had any moments during your activities where you felt particularly proud of yourself?

User: Yes! In one of the practices, I managed to score a goal, and everyone cheered for me. That felt amazing!

Consultant: What an achievement! It's wonderful that your teammates celebrated your success. How did that make you feel about your abilities?

User: It made me feel more confident. I realized I can do well if I try hard enough.

Consultant: That’s a vital realization, L! Confidence can greatly enhance your performance in both sports and social interactions. Do you think this confidence could help you in other areas of your life, like in school or meeting new people?

User: Definitely! I feel like I could speak up more in class and make new friends more easily now.

Consultant: That's a fantastic mindset to have! Taking those steps to engage more with classmates can open new doors for you. Are there specific situations in school where you’d like to apply this newfound confidence?

User: I want to join a school club or maybe start talking to some students I don't know yet.

Consultant: Those are great goals! Joining a club is a wonderful way to meet new people who share your interests. How do you plan to approach this?

User: I think I’ll just go for it! Maybe I’ll ask a friend to come with me, so I feel less nervous.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Having a friend by your side can definitely make it easier. What do you think you could say to start a conversation with someone new?

User: I could ask them about what they like to do in their free time or join in on a group activity.

Consultant: Those are excellent conversation starters! Asking about someone’s interests shows you’re engaged and curious. How do you feel about approaching new people with those questions?

User: It seems easier when I think about it that way. I just have to remember to be friendly and open.

Consultant: Exactly, being friendly and open can create a welcoming atmosphere. Can you think of any strategies to help you remember to stay positive when trying to meet new people?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone is just as nervous as I am, and that it’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: That’s a powerful reminder! Understanding that others share similar feelings can help ease tension. As we wrap up today, what has been the most helpful takeaway for you?

User: I think realizing my ability to make connections is important. I feel more ready to try new things now.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, L! It sounds like you're on a great path to enhancing your social skills and enjoying your activities even more. Remember, you can always reflect on your strengths and focus on the positive moments in your experiences. 

User: Thank you! I feel more motivated and excited about participating in activities now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Keep embracing those opportunities. Our next session will be an excellent chance to check in on your progress. Remember, you’ve got this! 

User: I will! Thank you for your support. Can’t wait for our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, L! It's great to see you today. I’m excited to chat about how you've been feeling and the progress you've made recently. What’s on your mind today?

User: Hi! I feel pretty good because I did well in a recent group project at school. My classmates said I contributed a lot, and I felt really confident while working with them.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear that you’re feeling more confident in a group setting. How did that experience affect your thoughts about yourself and your social skills?

User: I think I started to believe that I can be a good team player, and it makes me feel really proud. I also want to talk more in class and make new friends, but sometimes I still feel a bit shy.

Consultant: It’s fantastic that you’re feeling proud of your contributions! Feeling shy is totally normal, especially when trying to make new friends. Can you tell me more about that shyness? What do you think is holding you back from speaking up more in class?

User: Sometimes, I worry that my ideas won't be good enough or that I’ll say something silly in front of everyone. I wish I could just speak up without worrying so much.

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry about how others might perceive you. Let’s explore that a bit—when you think, “my ideas won’t be good enough,” what feelings come up for you?

User: I feel nervous and sometimes even a little embarrassed. It makes me want to stay quiet instead of sharing my thoughts.

Consultant: Those feelings are very common, especially in social situations. Let’s try to challenge that thought a bit. Can you think of a time when you shared an idea and received a positive response from your classmates?

User: Yes! During the group project, I suggested a few ideas, and my classmates liked them. It felt good to hear them say that.

Consultant: That’s a great example! It shows that your ideas can be valuable. What if you tried reminding yourself of that positive experience next time you feel shy? How does that sound?

User: That sounds like a good idea! I think it might help me feel more confident.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Building on those positive experiences can really help reduce anxiety. Let’s also think about some small steps you can take to practice speaking up in a comfortable way. What do you think you could do next time you’re in class?

User: Maybe I could start by asking a question or making a comment during discussions. It feels less scary if I think of it as just adding to the conversation.

Consultant: Absolutely! Starting with a question is a perfect way to ease into speaking up. How do you feel about setting a small goal for yourself, like trying to speak once in your next class?

User: I think I can do that! I’ll try to speak up at least once.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal, L! Remember, it’s perfectly okay to feel a bit nervous. The important part is that you’re taking action. How would it feel if each time you succeeded, you acknowledged that accomplishment?

User: I’d feel really happy about it and more motivated to keep doing it!

Consultant: Yes, celebrating those small victories is key to building your confidence. What’s another positive behavior you’d like to focus on besides speaking up in class?

User: I’d like to work on making new friends. I’ve been thinking about inviting a classmate to hang out.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Making new friends can be very rewarding. What’s holding you back from inviting them?

User: I’m just not sure if they would want to hang out with me or if I’d know what to say.

Consultant: It’s common to feel that way. But you can approach it lightly! Perhaps start with a casual invitation, like asking if they’d like to join you for a game or a study session. How does that make you feel?

User: I feel a bit less worried. That way, it feels more casual and fun.

Consultant: Exactly! Making it casual can take the pressure off. Do you have someone specific in mind that you would like to invite?

User: Yes, there’s a classmate I’ve talked to a little, and I think we have some interests in common.

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! Connecting over shared interests can help strengthen those bonds. What’s a good way for you to ask them?

User: I could just mention an activity we both like and see if they’re interested. I can do it after class next time.

Consultant: Perfect! That sounds like a natural way to approach it. How would you feel about our session today, and do you have any other thoughts or feelings you’d like to share?

User: I feel really good about what we discussed! I have some ideas to work on now, and I feel more optimistic about my social skills.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, L! It sounds like you’re making great progress. As we wrap up today, remember to celebrate each small step you take. How do you plan to keep this positive momentum going?

User: I’ll keep reminding myself of the good things that happen and try to focus on enjoying the process of meeting new people.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! When you maintain that positive attitude, it can really help you thrive. Thank you for sharing with me today, L. I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello L! It's great to see you here today. I'm excited to chat about the positive changes you've experienced recently. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I feel really good, actually. My family has noticed my positive attitude, and they've been supportive of my efforts at school. I'm really grateful for that.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear that your family has recognized your efforts and is supporting you. Can you share a little more about what specifically has changed for you at school and at home?

User: Well, at school, I’ve been more engaged in my classes and even made some new friends. It's nice to feel like I belong. At home, we’ve been talking more, and it feels like my parents are really listening to me.

Consultant: It's fantastic that you're feeling more connected both at school and at home. Feeling like you belong and being heard can make such a difference. How do you think these positive changes have impacted your confidence and outlook for the future?

User: I feel much more confident! I'm excited about learning new things and even thinking about projects I can start. It feels like I can achieve my goals, and I want to keep this momentum going.

Consultant: That’s an amazing mindset to have, L! It’s clear you’re on the right track. Let’s think about how we can maintain this positive attitude. Have you set any specific goals or plans to keep this energy up?

User: I want to keep making progress in my studies, maybe even join some clubs at school. I've also thought about spending more quality time with my family.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! Joining clubs is a great way to meet new people and try new things. It's also commendable that you want to strengthen your family relationships. What challenges do you think you might face in reaching these goals?

User: I guess I worry about losing my focus, especially with schoolwork. Sometimes it feels like there’s a lot to juggle.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel that way, especially with various responsibilities. Let’s explore how you can stay focused. Have you thought about any strategies that might help you balance your schoolwork and other activities?

User: Maybe I could create a schedule to organize my time better. I think that could help me keep track of everything.

Consultant: Creating a schedule sounds like a great idea! It can help you visualize your tasks and manage your time effectively. How do you think you would feel about sticking to a schedule?

User: I think it would make me feel more in control and less anxious about what I have to do. 

Consultant: Exactly! Feeling in control can lead to reduced anxiety. Let’s make sure to establish some flexibility in your schedule too. If something comes up, it’s important to adjust and not feel overwhelmed. How do you feel about that?

User: That makes sense! I like the idea of being flexible. It might help me adapt better when things change.

Consultant: Great! Flexibility is key. As you work on your schedule, let’s also ensure we include some time for activities that bring you joy, like hobbies or spending time with friends. How does that sound?

User: Sounds good! I love playing soccer and doing art, so I’ll make sure to include those.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Balancing fun and responsibilities is essential. Let’s check in on your feelings with these plans in mind. What emotions do you think will come up as you try to stick to your schedule?

User: I might feel excited at first, but I could also feel stressed if I can’t keep up.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. When feeling stressed, it's important to remind yourself of the progress you've made. What calming techniques do you think could help you manage stress when it arises?

User: I sometimes breathe deeply and take breaks; maybe I should make it a habit when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Deep breathing and taking breaks are excellent techniques to incorporate! Regularly practicing these can help you stay grounded. Would you be open to using a simple reminder for yourself to take those breaks?

User: Yes! I could set alarms on my phone to remind me.

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a handy way to ensure you remember to pause and recharge. Before we wrap up today, let’s reinforce the positives you’ve discussed. What do you feel has been your biggest achievement so far?

User: I think acknowledging my progress and being able to share this with my family has been huge for me. 

Consultant: That is an important achievement! Acknowledging your progress and sharing that with your family can strengthen those connections. As we move forward, how do you plan to continue this journey of growth and positivity?

User: I’ll keep reflecting on my achievements and stay proactive about my goals. I want to maintain this positive energy.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy, L! Keeping a reflective approach along with being proactive will definitely help you sustain your growth. Remember, it's okay to seek support whenever you need it. You’re doing a remarkable job, and I’m proud of your progress.

User: Thank you! That really makes me feel good about what I’m doing.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure to hear about your journey. Remember, take one step at a time, and you have the tools to overcome any challenges. If you feel the need to check-in again, I’m here to help. 

User: I will! Thank you for everything today; I feel really positive now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, L! Keep embracing this positivity. Take care, and I'll look forward to our next session if you choose to come back.
