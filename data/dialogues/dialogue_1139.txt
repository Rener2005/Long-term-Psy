Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for this session. I understand from our last meeting that you’ve been feeling a lot of anxiety recently. How are you doing today?

User: Hi. Honestly, not great. I'm still struggling with the situation with my roommate. It’s been really hard for me to focus on anything else.

Consultant: I can imagine how challenging that must be for you. The conflict with your roommate seems to be weighing heavily on your mind. Can you tell me more about what specific feelings or thoughts come up when you think about this situation?

User: I feel really anxious and sometimes even confused about why it bothers me so much. I keep thinking there might be something wrong with me for feeling this way.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when personal relationships are in turmoil. It’s important to remember that feelings of anxiety can arise from conflicts when we care about the person involved. What kinds of thoughts specifically go through your mind when you reflect on your relationship with your roommate?

User: I often think that she doesn’t like me or that I did something wrong. This leads me to feel very isolated and I start avoiding her, which makes everything worse.

Consultant: It sounds like you might be experiencing automatic thoughts that are negative and potentially distorted. Have you noticed how these thoughts affect your emotions?

User: Yes, for sure. When I think she doesn’t like me or that I’m at fault, I feel embarrassed and anxious. It makes me want to avoid interactions with anyone, not just her.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It seems like these thoughts are creating a cycle of avoidance and anxiety for you. Let’s try to challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that she doesn’t like you?

User: Well, she stopped talking to me as much and seems distant. I interpreted that as her disliking me.

Consultant: It’s understandable to interpret her behavior that way, but is there a chance that there could be other explanations for her distance? For example, she might be dealing with her own issues?

User: That’s true. I hadn’t thought about it that way. It could be her own stress or something.

Consultant: Exactly. It might be beneficial to consider alternative explanations for her behavior instead of jumping to the conclusion that she dislikes you. What would you say to a friend who was feeling the same way?

User: I would probably tell them it might not be personal and encourage them to talk it out with their roommate.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective. Let’s apply that same understanding to your situation. It might help to reframe your thinking about your roommate’s actions. Next time you feel anxious about her, how can you remind yourself that there might be other reasons for her behavior?

User: I could remember that it may not be personal, and maybe reaching out to her could help clear things up, rather than avoiding her like I’ve been doing.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive plan. It could be useful for you to engage with her rather than pulling away. Have you thought about how you might approach her?

User: I’ve contemplated it, but I’m still so nervous. What if she reacts negatively?

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous. Facing the unknown can be frightening, but what if we look at it this way: What’s the worst that could happen? And what’s the best outcome you could imagine?

User: The worst would be that she gets upset and we argue again. But the best might be that we talk things out and clear the air.

Consultant: That’s a balanced view. It’s wise to acknowledge both possibilities. Focusing on the potential for resolution might help reduce some of your anxiety. When you think about it, would you be open to setting a goal to initiate that conversation?

User: I think so. Maybe I could try talking to her this week when I feel ready.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy step forward. Let’s also consider other strategies for managing the anxiety leading up to that conversation. What activities help you feel calmer or more grounded?

User: I usually like listening to music or going for walks. They help distract me from my thoughts.

Consultant: Those sound like effective coping strategies! Can we incorporate them into your routine before you approach your roommate? For instance, a calming walk before the conversation could help ease your nerves.

User: That’s a good idea. I’ll try to do that. I guess I just have to remind myself that it’s a conversation, not a confrontation.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reframing it in that way can be much more empowering. It’s all about open communication. How are you feeling about our discussion so far?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I appreciate having a different perspective on my situation.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a process, and you’re taking positive steps. When we meet next, we can discuss how the conversation with your roommate went and what you learned from it. 

User: Yes, I’d like that. I hope I can manage my feelings better by then.

Consultant: That’s the goal! Just focus on the steps we’ve talked about, and know that it’s okay to take things at your own pace. Is there anything else on your mind today that you’d like to explore?

User: I think we’ve covered a lot. I feel a bit better equipped to handle things now.

Consultant: I'm happy to hear you feel more prepared. Remember, the insights you've gained today can help create a foundation for continued progress. You’ve done really well in expressing your feelings and working through them.

User: Thanks! I’m looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: Me too! I'm here to support you through this. See you next time, and take care in the meantime!

Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad you decided to come for this consultation today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been trying some relaxation techniques after attending a few mental health seminars, and I think I’m making some progress, but I still feel really anxious in social situations, especially with my roommate.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you’ve put in some effort towards managing your anxiety, which is great! Could you tell me more about your relationship with your roommate and what specifically makes you anxious in those interactions?

User: Well, we used to get along well, but things have changed lately. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around her. I worry about saying the wrong thing, and this fear makes me avoid her even more.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It's understandable to feel anxious when you're worried about how your words might be received. What thoughts come to your mind when you're in those situations with her?

User: I often think that she must be judging me or that I’m annoying her. It's like I can't stop overthinking everything I say or do.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite distressing for you. Let’s explore that a bit more. How do these thoughts make you feel emotionally and physically?

User: They make me feel really tense and paranoid. I get headaches and just want to isolate myself. It’s hard to focus on anything else.

Consultant: That’s tough. It seems like your anxiety is affecting not just your interactions but also your overall well-being. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that lead to these feelings during your social interactions?

User: I think when other friends are around, I feel even more pressure to behave perfectly. It makes me worried about how I'm perceived.

Consultant: It's common to feel more pressure in group settings. What do you think would help you feel more comfortable and less anxious in those situations?

User: I wish I could just be myself without worrying so much! Maybe if I could remind myself that everyone has flaws, it could help.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Liu! Recognizing that everyone has imperfections can indeed lighten the pressure. How do you think you could practice this kind of thinking when you find yourself feeling anxious?

User: I could try to remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that other people probably aren’t judging me as harshly as I think.

Consultant: Absolutely! Challenging those negative thoughts is a key step. How do you feel about seeing if a small experiment might help? For example, the next time you interact with your roommate, you could consciously remind yourself of this during the conversation.

User: That sounds like it could be helpful. I’d like to try that. 

Consultant: Great! It’s about using those reminders to shift your focus. Let’s also think about some small steps you could take to engage more positively with your roommate. What are some activities you might do together that feel less pressured?

User: Maybe we could study together or watch a movie. I think that could help ease the tension.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful ideas! Shared activities could help create a more relaxed environment. How would you feel about initiating one of those and focusing on just enjoying the moment, rather than overthinking?

User: I’d feel a bit nervous about reaching out, but I think I could manage it if I remind myself that it’s just about having fun.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about initiating that. Remember to take it slow, and focus on the enjoyment rather than the outcome. How can we assist you in building the confidence to take this step?

User: Maybe if I write down my fears and the potential positive outcomes that could happen, it could help clear my mind.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Writing down your thoughts can help you gain clarity and perspective. I encourage you to make a list of both your worries and what you hope to achieve. 

User: I will definitely try that. It sounds like a productive way to channel my feelings.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Also, as you work through this, don’t forget to celebrate any small success along the way, even if it feels insignificant. How do you feel about keeping track of these moments?

User: I think that would help keep me motivated. I need reminders that I’m making progress.

Consultant: Absolutely. Recognizing your achievements, no matter how small, is key. Before we wrap up today, do you have any other worries you’d like to talk about that relate to this experience?

User: I guess I’m just worried about being stuck. I don’t want to keep feeling this way for too long.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but remember, you’re taking steps to address these feelings. We can continue working together, focusing on techniques that help you manage both your social anxiety and improve your interactions. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful now, knowing I can work on this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Liu! I'm here to support you. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. I look forward to our next session where we can build upon what we discussed today. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm really glad you came in today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I’ve been really stressed out with my increasing school workload. I find it hard to stay interested in my studies, and it just feels overwhelming. I also feel distant from some friends, which adds to my discomfort.

Consultant: That sounds quite challenging. It seems like you're caught in a cycle of stress and disinterest, especially with school responsibilities piling up. Let’s take a moment to explore what specific aspects of your studies are making you feel overwhelmed.

User: Well, I have multiple assignments and projects due soon, and I feel like I can't keep up. I also miss the days when studying felt enjoyable, and now it just feels like a heavy burden.

Consultant: I understand. It’s frustrating when something you once enjoyed becomes overwhelming. What do you think has changed about your study experience that contributes to this feeling?

User: I think it started when my relationship with a classmate soured. I used to study with her, and now I feel isolated, which makes everything worse. Plus, my workload increased, so it’s hard to manage it all alone.

Consultant: It sounds like the shift in that relationship has significantly impacted your motivation and support system. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that arise when you're feeling overwhelmed by your workload?

User: Yes, I often think, “I’m never going to finish this,” or “I’m just not capable of handling this.” Those thoughts really drain my motivation.

Consultant: Those automatic thoughts you’re experiencing can be very powerful. Let’s try to identify how they impact your feelings. How does thinking “I’m never going to finish this” make you feel emotionally?

User: It makes me feel hopeless and anxious. Sometimes I just want to escape from my desk and do nothing because it feels unbearable.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Feeling trapped can lead to avoidance behaviors, which may make it even harder to tackle your studies. Let’s challenge that thought together. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts the belief that you won't finish your work?

User: I mean, logically I know that I’ve completed assignments before. But in the moment, it just feels all-consuming.

Consultant: It’s great that you can recognize that. Perhaps we can focus on the evidence of your past successes instead. If you could reframe that thought to make it more constructive, what might it look like?

User: Maybe something like, “I’ve completed tough assignments before, and I can break this down into manageable parts.”

Consultant: That’s a productive shift! Breaking things down can make your workload seem less daunting. What steps can you take to break your current assignments into smaller, manageable tasks?

User: I could start by listing out each assignment and setting mini-deadlines for myself. I think I could at least tackle one task a day.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical plan! Setting mini-deadlines could help you build momentum and regain a sense of achievement. How would you feel about sharing this new plan with a friend or a family member for accountability?

User: I think that might help. It would make me feel less alone in this process, and I’d like to have someone check in on me.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea, Liu. Support can make a significant difference. Furthermore, would you like to discuss any specific strategies for managing your anxiety during this busy period?

User: Yes, I would like to know how to deal with the anxiety when it hits. It sometimes feels paralyzing.

Consultant: Absolutely. One effective technique is grounding yourself through deep breathing. When anxiety arises, taking a few moments to breathe deeply and focus on your breath can help alleviate immediate stress. Would you like to try a brief breathing exercise together?

User: Sure, I think that could be helpful.

Consultant: Let’s take a few deep breaths together. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold for a moment, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Ready? 

User: Yes, let’s do it.

(They practice deep breathing together.)

Consultant: How do you feel after that exercise?

User: I feel a bit calmer now. It’s nice to take a moment to just breathe.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Practicing this technique regularly can be a helpful tool when you start to feel overwhelmed again. What else do you think could help you maintain balance during this busy time?

User: I think I should also try to engage in activities that I enjoy, like drawing or going for walks. I used to do those things, but I’ve neglected them lately.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea, Liu! Incorporating activities that you love can really help boost your mood and motivation. How about setting specific times each week to engage in those activities?

User: That sounds good. I could plan for at least an hour each week to do something I love.

Consultant: Perfect! Planning time for enjoyment is just as important as planning for your studies. As we wrap up today, let's reflect on the progress you've made and how you can continue to apply these strategies. What are your thoughts?

User: I feel more organized now, and I have some practical steps to take. I’m hopeful that I can manage my stress better and improve my situation.

Consultant: You’ve gained some valuable insights today, Liu. Remember, it’s about taking small steps and being kind to yourself as you navigate your studies and emotions. I look forward to hearing how you progress in our next session.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance today. I’ll definitely start implementing these strategies.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Take care, and I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Liu! It's great to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better. I'm starting to regain some confidence in managing my stress. However, I still struggle with occasional anxiety, especially when thinking about social interactions.

Consultant: That's a positive sign! It sounds like you're making progress in managing your stress. Can you share more about the social interactions that make you feel anxious? What specific thoughts come to mind?

User: I think a lot about how people perceive me, and I often worry that they won't like me or that I might embarrass myself. This thought makes me want to avoid social situations altogether.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts create a lot of pressure for you. Let's explore that a bit more. When you think about how people perceive you, what feelings does that generate?

User: I usually feel anxious and sometimes even a bit helpless. I want people to like me, but my mind races with negative "what if" scenarios.

Consultant: It's understandable to want to be liked—many people feel that way. But let's challenge those "what if" thoughts. Can you consider if there's any evidence that supports those fears? Have you received feedback from people that validates your worries?

User: I guess most of the time, people are quite friendly and welcoming. I haven't had any clear signs that they don't like me. It’s mostly in my head.

Consultant: That's a significant realization! If most people have been friendly, perhaps those anxious thoughts might be more extreme than reality. What might happen if you tried to approach social interactions with that perspective? 

User: I think it would be less scary. Maybe I could just focus on enjoying the moment instead of worrying about what others think.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on enjoying the moment can shift your experience. What are some small steps you could take next time you're in a social situation to help remind yourself of that?

User: Maybe I could practice deep breathing to calm myself before starting a conversation. I could also remind myself that it’s okay to be myself and not worry too much.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent strategies! Breathing techniques can help ground you, and self-acceptance is key. How do you feel about implementing those approaches in your next social interaction?

User: I feel hopeful. Trying those out sounds manageable.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! As you prepare for your next interaction, are there any specific scenarios you're thinking of that you could apply these strategies?

User: I'm going to a gathering with classmates this weekend. I could use those breathing techniques before chatting with others.

Consultant: That’s a perfect opportunity! How do you envision yourself feeling after using your strategies at the gathering?

User: Less anxious and more relaxed, I hope. I want to enjoy talking to people without overthinking everything.

Consultant: That’s a great goal! Remember, it’s all about progress. After the gathering, we can reflect on your experiences and any challenges you encounter. What do you think would help you feel prepared for this gathering?

User: Maybe I should remind myself that it’s okay to have small conversations, and I don’t need to pressure myself to be the life of the party.

Consultant: Absolutely! Small conversations can be a great way to connect without overwhelming yourself. Engaging with one or two people can build your confidence gradually. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds more doable. I think I can start small and see where it goes.

Consultant: Yes, taking small steps is key. As you embark on this journey, let's also discuss your recent improvements in sleep quality. How has that change influenced your day-to-day activities?

User: I've been able to focus better on my studies. I even feel a bit more energetic, which helps me engage more with my coursework.

Consultant: That's fantastic! Improved sleep can make a significant difference in your energy and mood. Do you think your improved sleep has contributed positively to your social interactions as well?

User: Yes, I think so. I feel less irritable and more open to being around others when I'm well-rested.

Consultant: Great insight! This positive connection between your sleep and social interactions is empowering. To continue this progress, are there any habits you'd like to establish to maintain your improved sleep quality?

User: I think sticking to a regular bedtime would be helpful. I often stay up late when studying, which disrupts my sleep.

Consultant: A consistent sleep schedule can indeed make a big difference. How do you plan to balance your study time while ensuring you get enough rest?

User: I might set specific study hours and then stick to a wind-down routine before bed. 

Consultant: That sounds very effective! Creating a wind-down routine can signal to your body that it’s time to relax. Do you have any specific activities in mind for your routine?

User: I think I’d enjoy reading or listening to calming music before sleeping.

Consultant: Those are excellent choices! Both reading and calming music can help you transition into a restful state. As you implement these habits, I'm here to support you through the process. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm excited to see how you progress in both your social skills and self-management. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel positive and more motivated to tackle my social anxiety and improve my overall well-being.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! As we conclude today, let's set a goal to discuss your experiences at the gathering next time. I'm confident you’ll do great! You've got this!

User: Thank you! I'm looking forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a lot more stable emotionally, and I've been actively participating in school club activities. It feels good to be more open in social situations.

Consultant: That sounds fantastic! It's great to hear that you're feeling more stable and are engaging in school activities. What specific experiences in these activities have helped you feel like your social skills are improving?

User: I recently joined a few new groups, and I found it easier to approach people and chat. I used to worry about how I would be perceived, but now I just focus on enjoying the moment. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful shift in focus! Enjoying the moment can really ease anxiety. Can you tell me about a recent interaction where you felt particularly proud of your social skills?

User: There was this event where I had to introduce myself to new people. I was nervous at first, but I managed to speak clearly and even started a conversation with someone who seemed shy.

Consultant: That's an impressive achievement! It sounds like you took a positive step by initiating conversation. How did that experience impact your confidence afterwards?

User: It made me feel a lot more confident in social situations. I realized that I can actually connect with others, and it was a relief to see that I'm not as awkward as I thought.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Building connections can really change how we view ourselves. As you continue to practice these skills, how do you envision applying them during the upcoming exams or in stressful situations?

User: I think I need to remind myself of what I've learned about staying calm and engaging with my peers, even when I'm feeling stressed about exams. I want to ask for help if I need it.

Consultant: That's a very healthy approach! Recognizing the importance of reaching out for support is a crucial skill. What can you do now to prepare for the social interactions you anticipate during the exam period?

User: Maybe I can practice some conversation starters or scenarios with my friends. It might help to role-play how I would engage with others when we're all feeling pressured.

Consultant: Role-playing is a great strategy! It can help you feel more comfortable when the real situation arises. Would you like to try a quick role-playing exercise now?

User: Sure, I’d love to! What scenario should we use?

Consultant: Let’s imagine a situation where you bump into a classmate right before an exam. How would you introduce yourself and start a conversation?

User: Hi! I’m a little nervous about the exam. How about you? 

Consultant: That’s a solid start! You’re opening up about your feelings, which can create a connection. How do you think the classmate might respond to your greeting?

User: They might say something like, “Yeah, me too! I hope I studied enough.” 

Consultant: Exactly! And that might lead to a shared discussion on what topics you both are reviewing. It’s a great way to ease the tension. What do you think is something you can add to encourage further conversation?

User: I guess I could ask, “What do you find most challenging about this subject?” 

Consultant: Perfect! That shows interest and invites them to share their thoughts. How do you feel about using this approach in real-life situations?

User: It feels manageable! I think having these conversation starters can really help. 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Now, as we wrap up our session today, let’s reflect on your progress. What do you think has been your biggest gain since you started practicing your social skills?

User: I feel more at ease with myself and more confident when talking to others. It’s like I’ve broken through a barrier.

Consultant: That’s an incredible realization! Maintaining that confidence will serve you well in upcoming challenges, including exams. How can you ensure that you keep this positive momentum going?

User: I’ll practice more and remind myself of how much I’ve improved. I can even journal my experiences to keep track of my progress.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Journaling can help you reflect and reinforce your growth. As we conclude today’s session, remember that these skills will continue to serve you in many aspects of your life. If you encounter challenges, you’re always welcome to return for support.

User: Thank you! I appreciate the encouragement and strategies you've provided. I feel ready to face my upcoming challenges!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Liu! I believe in your ability to manage these situations effectively. Best of luck with your exams, and I look forward to hearing about your continued progress in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello Liu! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing okay, actually. I feel reasonably optimistic about my upcoming exams, and I've been managing my daily routine well. I think the last few sessions really helped.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some positive changes. What specific strategies or insights have you found most helpful in your day-to-day life and studies?

User: I think just recognizing my feelings and not letting them overwhelm me has made a difference. When I start to feel anxious, I remind myself to take a step back and breathe.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach, Liu. Breathing and self-awareness can really help in managing anxiety. As exams are approaching, do you have any concerns or challenges you’d like to discuss today?

User: Well, I'm a bit worried about my performance. I want to do well, but there's also this lingering fear of what if I don’t meet my expectations. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have such concerns, especially with upcoming exams. Let’s explore that fear a bit more. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about not meeting your expectations?

User: I keep thinking that if I don't do well, it would mean I'm not cut out for my major or that I'm disappointing my parents.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy and stress-inducing. It seems you’re tying your self-worth and your parents' expectations to your exam performance. Can you tell me how those thoughts affect your emotions in this situation?

User: When I think that way, I feel overwhelmed and kind of paralyzed. It's like I can't focus on studying because I'm too worried about failing.

Consultant: It makes sense; those thoughts can create a cycle of anxiety that affects your ability to concentrate. Let's challenge that thinking. Do you think there might be alternative ways to view your performance that aren't as harsh or judgmental?

User: Maybe I could see it as part of the learning process, and that even if I don't do as well as I want, it doesn't define my entire future.

Consultant: That's a much healthier perspective! Learning is indeed an ongoing process, and one exam doesn't determine your worth or future. Can you think of a time when you faced a challenge but turned it into a learning opportunity?

User: Yes! Last semester, I struggled with a project, and although I didn’t meet my original goals, I learned so much from that experience, and it helped me improve my skills.

Consultant: Great example, Liu! Reflecting on that experience can help remind you that challenges can bring growth. Moving forward, how can you apply that learning mindset to your upcoming exams?

User: I guess I could focus on doing my best and learning from the process, rather than stressing over the outcome.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on effort and learning rather than just results can alleviate some of that pressure. How do you plan to prepare for your exams while keeping this mindset in mind?

User: I think I’ll create a study schedule to break everything down into smaller, manageable pieces. This way, I can celebrate small wins along the way.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Breaking it down makes the workload feel less daunting. Along with your study schedule, is there anything else you feel you need to maintain this positive mindset?

User: Maybe having a few relaxation techniques on standby could help, like deep breathing or taking short breaks when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Those techniques can certainly help ground you during stressful moments! It’s essential to take breaks and recharge. Would you like to discuss any additional resources or support systems you could utilize in this period?

User: I think I could benefit from some study groups or talking to friends who are also preparing for exams. It would be good to have a support network.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Connecting with peers can provide support, different perspectives, and shared motivation. As we wrap up today, can we summarize what you’ve learned and how you plan to apply it?

User: Sure! I’ve learned to challenge my negative thoughts, focus on the learning process rather than just the results, break down my study plan, and lean on my support network.

Consultant: Excellent summary, Liu! You’ve made significant progress. Remember, it's about the journey and not solely the destination. As you face challenges in the future, you have the skills to manage your thoughts and emotions effectively. 

User: Thank you! I feel much more equipped to handle the upcoming exams now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! This will be our last session for now. If you ever feel the need for support again, don’t hesitate to reach out. You've developed great skills, and I believe you can continue to manage your emotions effectively.

User: Thank you for everything! I appreciate your help and guidance throughout this process.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Liu! Best of luck with your exams, and take care of yourself. Remember to celebrate your accomplishments along the way!
