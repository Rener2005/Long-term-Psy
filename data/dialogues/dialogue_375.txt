Consultant: Hello Hamid! I'm glad you're here today. I'd like to start by discussing what you've been feeling lately. Can you share what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. I’ve been really frustrated with how I’ve been handling things at school. My relationship with my classmates and teachers feels tense, and I often get angry for no reason. It’s exhausting.

Consultant: It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of anger and confusion, especially in your interactions at school. It’s understandable to feel that way when you're under pressure. Can you tell me more about what has been contributing to these feelings?

User: Well, I had a big argument with my mom recently, and it just escalated everything. I also feel a lot of pressure to do well in my classes, which makes me more irritable.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It's normal for conflicts at home and academic pressure to impact your emotional state. You mentioned feeling irritable—what kinds of situations tend to trigger your anger at school?

User: I get really annoyed when my classmates talk during lectures or when I feel like the teachers don’t understand us. It makes me want to shout at them sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like those situations can be very frustrating for you. When you feel that anger building up, what thoughts go through your mind? 

User: I think maybe they don’t care about our learning, or that they’re just not taking things seriously. I feel like I’m the only one trying, and it’s infuriating!

Consultant: It makes sense that you would feel frustrated when you perceive a lack of effort from others. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit more. Is there any evidence that your classmates or teachers truly don’t care about your learning?

User: I guess they do put in some effort, but it feels like they could do more. I just wish things were different.

Consultant: It’s understandable to wish for a different environment where you feel more supported. What might be a more balanced perspective to consider about your classmates and teachers?

User: Maybe they just have their own struggles too? I suppose they might not realize how their actions affect us.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight, Hamid. Recognizing that others may have their own difficulties can help in reducing frustration. How do you feel when thinking about it that way?

User: I feel a bit lighter, honestly. It’s just hard to remember that in the moment.

Consultant: I completely understand. It’s not easy to shift our thoughts, especially in high-pressure situations. What could you do to remind yourself of this perspective when you’re feeling angry?

User: Maybe I could take a deep breath or count to ten before reacting? That could help me gather my thoughts.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Taking a moment to breathe and collect your thoughts can help you respond instead of reacting in anger. Have you tried any similar techniques before?

User: Not really. I usually just let my frustration out. I can’t remember a time when I tried to control it.

Consultant: That’s okay. There’s always room to start fresh. Would you be willing to practice this breathing technique before responding when you feel angry at school this week?

User: Yes, I think I can try that. It feels a little strange, but I’m willing to give it a go.

Consultant: That’s a great attitude, Hamid! It’s all about trying new strategies to see what works best for you. How do you think your classmates would respond if you approached them with a more open mindset?

User: I guess they might be more open too... If I’m calmer, maybe they wouldn’t be defensive.

Consultant: Exactly! By modeling calmness, you could create a more positive atmosphere for everyone. If you practice this breathing technique and approach them differently, it may lead to better interactions. How does that feel to think about?

User: It feels promising, but I’m still worried I won’t be able to control my anger.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel apprehensive about change, especially when it involves emotions. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. You can take it one step at a time. We can also explore other strategies if needed. 

User: That makes sense. Sometimes I just feel overwhelmed and don’t know how to handle everything.

Consultant: Feeling overwhelmed can definitely add to your frustration. Are there specific situations where you feel this the most?

User: Mostly when I have a lot of homework and things piling up. It makes me feel like I’m failing.

Consultant: That’s common when you have too much on your plate. Let’s talk about breaking things down into smaller, more manageable tasks. What’s one thing you can do this week to lessen your load?

User: Maybe I can start prioritizing my assignments instead of trying to do everything at once.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Prioritization can really help make things feel less daunting. Do you have a system in mind for how you’ll prioritize your tasks?

User: I think I’ll make a list and focus on the most urgent ones first. I hope that helps!

Consultant: That’s an effective strategy! Writing things down can bring clarity and reduce anxiety. How do you feel about continuing to work on these skills in our next session?

User: I feel good about that. I think I can start trying these techniques. It gives me hope that I can improve my situation.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Hamid! It’s all about small steps leading to bigger changes. For this week, practicing your breathing technique and prioritizing tasks can be a great start. How do you feel about our progress today?

User: I feel a lot more optimistic. Thank you! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Remember, it’s perfectly okay to have ups and downs as you implement these strategies. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello Hamid! I'm glad to see you today. Before we dive in, I'd like to hear about how you’ve been feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really frustrated lately. I tried talking to my classmates during a club event, but I ended up feeling isolated and upset. It just seems like no one wants to connect with me.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Hamid. It's understandable to feel frustrated when you're trying to reach out and not getting the response you hoped for. Can you tell me more about how those experiences affected you?

User: Well, I felt really angry and rejected. I thought maybe I just wasn't good enough or that they didn't want to include me. It made me even more hesitant to try again.

Consultant: Those feelings of anger and rejection can be really overwhelming. It's important to recognize how they can affect your willingness to engage with others. When you think about those experiences, what thoughts come to your mind that contribute to those feelings?

User: I often think things like, "I'll probably embarrass myself again" or "They don't really want to be friends with me." It's like I just keep reinforcing my doubts.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing those thoughts, Hamid. What you’re experiencing are common negative thoughts that many people have. Let’s explore these thoughts a bit. How much evidence do you have that your classmates truly don't want to include you?

User: I’m not sure. I mean, there have been times when they've joked around and excluded me, but maybe they just didn’t realize I felt that way?

Consultant: That sounds like a possibility. It might be helpful to consider that there could be other explanations for their behavior. If a friend were in your situation, what advice do you think you would give them?

User: I suppose I might tell them to talk to those classmates and express how they feel. But that sounds really scary to me.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel scared about opening up like that. What if we approached this as an experiment? We can plan a way for you to express your feelings in a safe manner and see how they respond. How does that sound to you?

User: That could be helpful! I’d like to try that, but I’m worried about what they might say.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel anxious about that. Let's identify some steps you could take to prepare for that conversation. What would make you feel more confident going into it?

User: Maybe if I practiced what I wanted to say. I guess I could write it down first.

Consultant: Writing things down is a great idea. It can help you feel more organized and less anxious. After you write it down, maybe you could practice with someone you trust. Who do you think could support you with that?

User: I think my sister would help. She usually gives me good advice.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan, Hamid. Practicing with your sister can give you the reassurance you need. Let’s also think about how you can calm yourself before having this conversation. What techniques have you heard of or tried to manage your anxiety?

User: I’ve tried deep breathing before, and it helped a little. 

Consultant: Deep breathing can be very effective! It’s a simple yet powerful way to ground yourself in the moment. Would you be willing to practice it a bit before our next session or even before your conversation?

User: Yes, I can definitely try that. 

Consultant: Excellent! We can also explore other techniques together. As we wrap up today, what do you feel your next steps will be after our conversation?

User: I’ll write down how I feel and practice with my sister. I’ll also try deep breathing. 

Consultant: Those are fantastic steps, Hamid. Remember, it’s okay to feel a mix of emotions as you go through this process. Just by planning these actions, you're already making progress. How do you feel about what we've discussed today?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful, actually. Having a plan makes it feel less daunting.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Feeling hopeful is an important part of this journey. Next time, we can explore how the conversation went and any feelings that came up afterward. If things get tough, just remind yourself that you’re taking steps in the right direction.

User: Thanks! I’m looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: You're welcome, Hamid! I believe in your ability to navigate this, and I’m here to support you. Take care until we meet again!

Consultant: Hello Hamid! I'm glad you're here today. I understand you've been experiencing some challenges recently. Can you tell me more about what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really disappointed in myself after a conflict with a classmate. The situation made me realize how tense my relationships with both my classmates and teachers are. I want to improve things, but I feel stuck.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel stuck after a conflict, especially when it affects your relationships. You mentioned disappointment. Could you share what specifically you feel disappointed about?

User: I guess I feel disappointed that I let my anger get the best of me. I know I could have handled the situation better, but I just reacted without thinking.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re being really reflective about your actions. Recognizing that can be the first step toward change. What would you like to achieve in terms of your interactions with your classmates moving forward?

User: I want to learn how to handle conflicts better and not let my emotions take control. I hope to have a more positive relationship with my classmates and maybe even with my teachers, too.

Consultant: That’s a great goal, Hamid. Improving your emotional control can have a significant impact on your relationships. Let’s explore what steps you can take to manage conflicts when they arise. Have you thought about what triggers your feelings of anger or frustration in these situations?

User: Yeah, I think it’s when I feel misunderstood or when someone disrespects me. I tend to take it personally and react instead of taking a step back.

Consultant: It makes sense that feeling disrespected would trigger strong emotions. It can be really challenging to step back in those moments. What do you think could help you manage those triggers when they happen?

User: Maybe I could practice some breathing exercises or take a moment to walk away before I react. I’ve heard that taking a break can help.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Breathing exercises and taking a moment to walk away can create space for thoughtful responses instead of immediate reactions. How do you feel about trying these techniques during your next interaction?

User: I think I’d be willing to try that. I just hope it doesn’t feel awkward to pause in the middle of a conversation.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way at first, but pausing can actually demonstrate confidence. When you take a breath or step back, it shows that you’re in control of the situation. How might you communicate this pause to your classmate so they understand?

User: I could say something like, “Hold on, I need a moment to gather my thoughts.” That feels less awkward to me.

Consultant: That sounds like a great approach! It conveys your need for a moment without assuming an aggressive tone. It also gives the other person a chance to reflect, too. What do you think will change for you if you start using this strategy?

User: I think it might help me feel calmer, and I’ll be less likely to say something I’ll regret. I really want to improve my relationships.

Consultant: That sounds promising! Let's consider what else you can do to strengthen those relationships. Are there positive interactions you can think of that you could initiate with your classmates or teachers?

User: I guess I could try to join group activities or work together on school projects. I’ve been avoiding that because I don't feel confident.

Consultant: Joining group activities is a fantastic idea! Engaging in collaborative settings can help build trust and improve your relationships. What kinds of group activities do you think you’d enjoy?

User: I like sports, so maybe joining the basketball team or something similar could work. It might be easier to connect with them through a shared interest.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Sports can be a great way to bond with others. What steps do you think you could take to join those activities?

User: I could talk to the coach after school and ask about joining the team. It’s a bit intimidating, but I think it could really help.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel intimidated when trying something new, but that step could lead to meaningful connections. What if you practiced how you would approach the coach beforehand to feel more prepared?

User: That sounds useful. I could write down what I want to say or even rehearse it with a friend to build my confidence.

Consultant: Practicing with a friend is a smart move! It can make the conversation feel much less daunting. How would you feel once you’ve taken that first step?

User: I think I would feel proud of myself for facing my fears. It would be a good start towards making things better.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking that first step can boost your confidence and motivate you to keep improving. As we wrap up today, what’s one key takeaway you’ll remember moving forward?

User: I’d say to pause and take a breath before reacting, and to take action by joining activities to build relationships. 

Consultant: Those are powerful takeaways, Hamid. I’m proud of you for being open about your feelings and working toward change. Remember, it’s all about taking small, manageable steps. If you ever need support, don’t hesitate to reach out again. 

User: Thank you, I really appreciate your help! I will try to remember what we discussed today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I wish you all the best as you implement these strategies. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!

Consultant: Hello Hamid! It’s great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit more confident in social situations. I tried collaborating with classmates during a school activity, and it went well. I appreciated the positive feedback I received.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re making progress in building confidence in those interactions. Can you share more about what you enjoyed most about that experience?

User: Well, it felt good to communicate and work together. My classmates were really supportive, and I didn’t feel as nervous as I usually do.

Consultant: Connecting with supportive peers is a major step forward. It’s impressive that you were able to enjoy the collaboration. What do you think contributed to your reduced nervousness during that activity?

User: I think I was just focused on the task at hand, rather than worrying about what they would think of me. It felt freeing.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic insight! Staying focused on the task can definitely help diminish anxiety. How might you apply that same mindset to future interactions with your classmates?

User: I suppose I could try to stay focused on the conversation and what we’re doing instead of overthinking their responses.

Consultant: Exactly! By keeping your attention on the interaction, you may find it easier to engage without feeling overwhelmed. Are there specific situations where you’d like to practice this approach?

User: I’d like to try it during group projects or when I’m paired up with someone in class.

Consultant: Great! Group projects and pair work are excellent opportunities for practice. Let’s think about some strategies that could help you feel more comfortable in those contexts.

User: Maybe I could set small goals, like making sure I contribute at least one idea or asking one question.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Setting small, manageable goals can ease the pressure and give you a sense of accomplishment. How do you feel about tracking your progress with these goals?

User: I think it could be helpful to write down my experiences and reflect on them. That way, I’ll see how I’m improving.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflecting on your experiences will provide valuable insights into your growth and reinforce the positive interactions. How often do you think you could set aside time for this reflection?

User: I could try doing it weekly. Just a short journal entry about my interactions and feelings.

Consultant: A weekly journal sounds like an excellent idea! It’ll help you recognize your successes and any challenges you encounter. Would you be willing to share some of those reflections with me in our future sessions?

User: Yes, I’d be happy to share! I think it would also motivate me to keep working on my social skills.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Motivation is key to making lasting changes. How do you feel about the progress you’ve made so far?

User: I feel good about it. It’s nice to see that small changes can lead to positive feelings. I'm becoming more excited about socializing!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization, Hamid! Embracing that excitement about socializing can help further enhance your interactions. What steps do you think you could take to keep that excitement alive?

User: Maybe I could initiate conversations or suggest activities with classmates. That way, I can create more opportunities to connect.

Consultant: Initiating conversations and suggesting activities is a proactive approach! It not only helps you practice your skills but also encourages positive connections with others. How do you envision these experiences turning out?

User: I hope they will go well like the last activity. I want to build more relationships and feel more accepted.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! Building relationships takes time and effort, but it sounds like you’re on the right path. Do you feel prepared to face any potential challenges that may arise in these interactions?

User: I think so. If I start to feel anxious, I can remind myself of the positive feedback I’ve received and keep my focus on the conversation.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Reminding yourself of past successes can be a great way to combat anxiety. As we wrap up today, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is to focus on the experience and set small goals. Reflecting on them will definitely help me grow.

Consultant: That’s a great summary! Remember, each small step counts towards your overall improvement. I’m proud of your progress, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Keep up the great work, Hamid!

User: Thank you! I’m excited to continue this journey.

Consultant: Hello Hamid! I'm glad to see you again in this session. Last time, we talked about your recent success in the group presentation and how that made you feel recognized by your classmates and teachers. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better actually. It’s nice to feel acknowledged. But I still sometimes struggle with anger and focus, especially in class.

Consultant: I'm happy to hear you're feeling a bit better. It’s understandable to still experience some challenges, especially when you're trying to process new emotions. Let’s talk about those moments when you feel angry or find it hard to concentrate. What usually triggers those feelings for you?

User: I think it happens when I feel overwhelmed with the subjects. Sometimes, it’s like I’m trying to keep up with everything, but it just piles on and then I snap at people.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult, feeling overwhelmed can definitely lead to frustration. It might help to explore those initial feelings—what thoughts go through your mind when you feel overwhelmed or angry?

User: I often think that I’m not good enough, or that I’ll fall behind my classmates. Those thoughts make everything seem worse.

Consultant: That's a tough place to be in. It seems your thoughts are quite critical of yourself. Let's identify those thoughts more clearly. When you think you're not good enough, how does that make you feel emotionally in those moments?

User: It makes me feel anxious and sad, like I’m stuck. I just want to do well, but it feels heavy.

Consultant: I can see how that would be quite burdensome. What if we tried to challenge those negative thoughts? For instance, is there evidence that supports the idea that you’re not good enough, or might there be alternative ways to view yourself?

User: I guess I did do well on the presentation. And my teachers said they were proud of me. So maybe it’s not all bad. 

Consultant: Exactly, those are strong pieces of evidence that show you are capable and have received positive feedback. If a friend were in your situation, how might you encourage them to think differently about their abilities?

User: I would tell them to focus on their achievements and not just the mistakes. I think they should be kinder to themselves.

Consultant: That’s a very supportive perspective! Now, let's think about how you can apply that same kindness to yourself. What would it look like for you to acknowledge your achievements regularly and be more compassionate towards yourself?

User: Maybe I could write down positive feedback I receive and reflect on them when I feel down. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea, Hamid! Keeping a record of positive feedback can help reinforce those good feelings when you’re feeling low. How about we set a small goal for the upcoming weeks around this practice? 

User: Sure, I think I can start doing that after each assignment or class.

Consultant: Great! Let’s set a goal for you to do this at least once a week. Additionally, when you feel overwhelmed in class, can we brainstorm a few strategies to help you stay grounded and focused?

User: Yeah, I’m open to that. What do you think might help?

Consultant: One technique is deep breathing. Taking a few deep breaths can help calm your mind. Another strategy could be to break tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. How does that sound?

User: Breathing sounds doable. I sometimes forget to pause and take a breath when I’m anxious. 

Consultant: It’s quite easy to overlook! Let’s incorporate deep breathing whenever you start to feel anxious. Perhaps you can even set reminders for yourself. Would practicing that feel manageable for you?

User: Yes, I could set reminders on my phone. 

Consultant: Perfect! Setting reminders can help ease you into the habit. Now, we also mentioned at the start about reflecting on your progress. What positive changes have you noticed in yourself in the past few weeks?

User: I think I’m becoming more aware of my emotional responses and I’m trying not to react immediately when I feel angry. 

Consultant: That’s an impressive insight! Recognizing your emotional patterns is an important step. What benefits have you noticed from trying to pause before reacting?

User: I feel more in control. When I take a moment, it sometimes helps me respond more calmly.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Feeling in control is essential for your emotional well-being. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize your progress. You identified positive achievements, developed a practice to acknowledge feedback, and learned new coping mechanisms. How do you feel about that?

User: I feel good! I didn’t realize I had made so much progress, but it seems I’m learning to manage better.

Consultant: You should feel proud of yourself, Hamid. As you continue to implement these strategies, remember to be gentle with yourself. Is there anything specific you’d like to focus on for our next session?

User: I think I want to work on how to keep a positive mindset when things feel tough.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful focus. I look forward to exploring that with you next time. You’re doing so well, and I believe you can maintain this progress. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Thank you for sharing today, Hamid! I'm looking forward to our next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Hamid! I'm glad to see you again. It sounds like there have been some positive changes in your life recently. How are you feeling about everything at school and home?

User: Hi! I feel more stable emotionally, especially with the support from my family. Talking to my parents about my future studies has helped a lot. But I still get angry sometimes, especially during classes.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re feeling more stable and receiving support from your family. It’s completely normal to experience moments of anger, especially in stressful environments like school. Can you share a bit more about what triggers that anger in class?

User: Mostly when I feel misunderstood by my teachers or when the lessons are too boring. I try to focus, but sometimes it just feels impossible.

Consultant: I understand how frustrating that can be. Feeling misunderstood can lead to a lot of pressure. Let’s explore those thoughts more—when you feel that way in class, what kind of thoughts cross your mind? 

User: I often think that my teachers don't care about our opinions or what we’re struggling with. It makes me feel even more disconnected and angry.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Hamid. It seems like you might be feeling stuck between wanting to engage and feeling ignored. Recognizing these thoughts is the first step. Would you say some of these thoughts could be quite negative? 

User: Yes, definitely. I sometimes feel like I'm the only one who cares about understanding the material.

Consultant: That sense of isolation is really challenging. Let's try to challenge that thought. Is there any evidence that contradicts the idea that you're alone in your feelings about school?

User: Well, I do see that some of my friends feel the same way. But I still think the teachers don't help us as much as they should. 

Consultant: It’s helpful that you acknowledge your friends share similar feelings. That suggests you’re not entirely alone in this experience. What if we reframed the thought around your teachers? How might you approach it if you saw it from a different perspective? 

User: I guess I could think that maybe they are trying their best, even if it doesn’t seem like it sometimes. 

Consultant: That's a positive shift in mindset! Recognizing that teachers may be trying their best can help reduce feelings of anger. How do you feel about discussing strategies to make classes more engaging for you?

User: That would be good. I sometimes zone out because I don’t feel connected to the subject. 

Consultant: Let’s think of some ways to connect your interests with the subjects you are learning. Are there any subjects you're particularly passionate about that we could use as a starting point?

User: I really like science and technology. 

Consultant: Fantastic! We can work on ways to relate those interests to your current studies. For instance, can you think of a project or a topic in your science class that could incorporate technology? 

User: I suppose we could explore more about how technology impacts scientific discoveries. That could be interesting. 

Consultant: That sounds like a brilliant idea! Engaging with the class material through your interests might help you feel more connected. How do you think you could approach your teacher with this idea?

User: I could suggest it during class discussions or maybe after class. 

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Taking that initiative can also show your teachers that you're taking an active role in your education. How do you feel about setting that goal for yourself in the coming week?

User: I feel good about it! I think just voicing it might change a lot. 

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s empowering to express your thoughts and take action. Now, let's also think about the support at home. How can your family help you stay motivated with this new approach?

User: They could encourage me to keep working on my studies and to keep discussing my ideas with them. 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Engaging your family in your educational journey can give you an additional support system. Have you talked to them about your plans and how they can assist you?

User: Not yet, but I should! 

Consultant: Yes, I recommend that! It might feel nice to share your thoughts and goals with them. Before our session ends, let's recap your main takeaways. Can you summarize the steps you're planning to take?

User: Sure! I want to connect my interests in science and technology to my studies, try to communicate my ideas to my teachers, and ask my family for support in staying motivated.

Consultant: Perfect, Hamid! You’ve mapped out a clear strategy for yourself. Remember, you have support from both your family and friends. It's all about taking small steps forward. 

User: Thank you! I feel much clearer and more excited about my approach now. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've made significant progress in our sessions, and I believe you can continue on this positive path. If you need further assistance in the future, feel free to reach out. 

User: Will do! Thanks for your help. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Hamid. Take care and good luck with your new strategies!
