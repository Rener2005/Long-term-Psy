Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. Let's talk about what's been going on with you lately. How have you been feeling in school?

User: Hi. I feel really restless in class. I can't seem to sit still, and I get into trouble sometimes with my classmates and teachers.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're finding it hard to focus and sometimes your actions may upset those around you. Can you tell me more about what happens in class when you start feeling restless?

User: Well, I can’t pay attention, and then I start talking a lot or making noise. Sometimes my classmates get mad at me because I'm too loud.

Consultant: It must be frustrating to feel that way and to see others getting upset. What do you think makes it hard for you to stay focused in class?

User: I think my mind just goes everywhere. I feel like I can't control it, and then I do things without thinking.

Consultant: That's understandable. It seems like your impulsive actions might be linked to not being able to concentrate. Have you noticed if there are specific times in class when it happens more often?

User: Yes, usually when the teacher is talking for a long time. I get bored and just want to move around.

Consultant: That makes sense. It sounds like when things get a bit dull, it becomes harder for you to stay still. What do you think could help you to stay seated during those longer parts of the lesson?

User: Maybe if I had something to fidget with or a way to take a break? But I’m not sure how to ask for that.

Consultant: Those are great ideas! It's important to communicate your needs. We can work on some strategies together. Also, how about we talk about how your behavior affects others? What do you think happens when you’re loud in class?

User: I guess it annoys them, but I don’t mean to. I just can’t help it sometimes.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. It sounds like you’re aware that it bothers them, even if you don't intend to. Understanding this connection can help you make different choices. Let's try to focus on rewarding the times you manage to stay seated and quiet. How do you think that would feel?

User: I think that could be nice. It would be good to get a reward for staying quiet.

Consultant: Absolutely! Rewards can help encourage you to stay focused. We can set up a simple system where you earn points for each time you stay quiet in class. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I would like to try that.

Consultant: Great! We can also work on recognizing when you start to feel restless, so we can find quick ways to calm down. Can you think of any ways that helps you feel calmer?

User: Sometimes I take deep breaths or squeeze my stress ball. That helps a little.

Consultant: That’s an excellent technique! Deep breathing can be really helpful. When you start to feel restless, maybe you could use those methods as a reminder to calm down. Would you be willing to try those out during class?

User: Yes, I can try that. I’ll remember to squeeze my ball or breathe.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Remember, it's okay to take those little breaks as needed. How do you feel about telling your teacher that you might sometimes need a moment to regroup?

User: I feel a bit nervous about talking to the teacher, but I think I can try.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel nervous about it. Just remember, you’re communicating your needs, which is important. How about we practice what you might say to your teacher?

User: Okay. Maybe I could say, "Can I take a quick break if I start to feel restless?"

Consultant: That sounds like a great way to ask! It’s polite and clear. You’re doing really well. Now, let’s think about times when you’ve managed to stay focused. Can you remember a moment in class when you felt you did well?

User: I remember one time I stayed quiet for a whole lesson, and the teacher seemed happy!

Consultant: Fantastic! That’s a great success to build on. How did that make you feel, being able to stay focused?

User: I felt proud. It was nice not getting into trouble!

Consultant: That pride is essential! We can build on that feeling of success. Maybe try to recall that moment when you feel restless. How can you remind yourself of that pride during tough times?

User: I guess I can think, "I can do it again!" 

Consultant: Exactly! That positive reminder can really help. Lastly, as we wrap up today, what do you feel you can take away from our time together?

User: I think I learned some ways to help myself stay calm and that I can ask for help when I need it.

Consultant: Those are valuable lessons! I'm proud of you for being open to trying new strategies. Remember, it’s a process, and you’re making progress. I look forward to hearing how you do next time.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaonong! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling recently in school?

User: Hi! I've been okay, I think. I can sit still for a little while, but sometimes I still push my classmates. I don’t really understand why I do that, though.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing this with me. It's great that you can sit still for a bit longer now. When you find yourself pushing your classmates, what kind of feelings or thoughts go through your mind?

User: I guess I sometimes feel bored or excited, and I just act without thinking. I don't want to push them, but it just happens.

Consultant: It sounds like there might be some strong feelings that lead to those actions. Let's explore this together. Can you tell me about a specific time when you felt that way and pushed someone? What was happening?

User: There was a day in class when we were playing a game, and I was really excited. I just pushed a girl next to me because I wanted to get closer to the game.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that instance. It seems that excitement drove your actions. How did the girl react when you pushed her?

User: She looked really surprised and a little upset. I felt bad afterward, but it was like I couldn't control my body at that moment.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when emotions are high. Let’s think about some strategies to help you with that excitement. How do you feel about using a point system to reward yourself for sitting still and using your words instead of pushing?

User: That sounds interesting. How does the point system work?

Consultant: The point system would give you points for every time you sit quietly or use your words instead of pushing. Once you collect enough points, you could trade them for a small reward. What kind of rewards do you think would motivate you?

User: Maybe extra time on the computer or getting to play games with my friends!

Consultant: Those sound like great rewards! We can set a target for points each week. This way, you'll start to notice how your actions can change your feelings and your rewards. How does that sound to you?

User: I think I can try that! I want to get my points and play games.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Another thing we can work on is expressing your feelings. Sometimes, using words can help others understand how excited you are. Can you think of some phrases you might say instead of pushing?

User: Maybe I can say, "I'm really excited!" or "Can I play too?" 

Consultant: Those are fantastic phrases, Xiaonong! Practicing saying those words could help you share your excitement without using your hands. How do you feel about practicing that in our next session?

User: I think that sounds fun! I want to practice saying things.

Consultant: Excellent! I'm looking forward to hearing how you express yourself next time. Remember, it's about taking small steps, and you can always talk about how you feel. Is there anything else on your mind today?

User: Not really, just wondering if my grandma thinks I'm doing better in school.

Consultant: It's wonderful that you care about your grandma’s opinion. Let’s think of ways you can show her your progress, like sharing your point system and rewards with her. How do you think she would react?

User: I think she would be proud of me! She likes it when I try hard.

Consultant: That’s a great motivation! Sharing your achievements can strengthen your relationship with her too. Before we end today's session, what is one thing you want to focus on until we meet again?

User: I want to try sitting still longer and remember the phrases to say!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, Xiaonong. By focusing on sitting still and using your words, you’ll be making progress. Remember, it’s okay to feel excited. You’re learning to manage it. I'm proud of the effort you're putting in!

User: Thanks! I really want to do well.

Consultant: I believe in you, Xiaonong! Keep practicing, and I’m excited to see how far you’ve come next time. Have a great week ahead!

User: You too! See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Little Farmer! I'm glad you're here today. Let's talk about how you're feeling and what's been happening at school and home recently.

User: Hi. I’ve been trying to work with my classmates during some activities, but sometimes I say things that upset them, and I don’t mean to. It’s frustrating.

Consultant: I understand that it can be frustrating when your words unintentionally hurt others. How do you feel when those situations happen?

User: I feel embarrassed and sad. I just want to be accepted and have fun with them without making mistakes.

Consultant: It sounds like acceptance and enjoyment in your interactions with classmates are really important to you. What do you think makes it hard to control what you say at those moments?

User: I guess I get really excited, and then I forget to think before I speak. I just blurt things out sometimes.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. Your excitement can sometimes take over, making it challenging to filter your thoughts. Let’s explore how your feelings of excitement and impulse connect with what you say. Can you recall a specific moment when you felt that way?

User: Yes! During a group project, I wanted to share my idea, but I ended up interrupting a friend, and they got mad at me. 

Consultant: That sounds like a tough experience. How did that make you feel in that moment?

User: I felt bad because I didn’t want to hurt anyone. I just wanted to contribute.

Consultant: It's clear you have good intentions and want to contribute positively. Can we think about how you might express your desire to speak without interrupting? 

User: Maybe I can raise my hand or wait until it’s my turn to talk.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Raising your hand can help you manage those impulses. How about we practice together? Imagine you’re in class, and it’s your turn to speak—what would you say?

User: I would say, “Can I share my idea, please?” 

Consultant: Perfect! That shows respect for your classmates and gives you a moment to organize your thoughts. How does that make you feel compared to just blurting it out?

User: It feels better because I’m not rushing and I can think first.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s also consider how your feelings at home, where you might not always feel as supported, might impact your emotions at school. Do you think there’s a connection?

User: Yes, sometimes I feel like my parents care more about my brother. It makes me feel less valued.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Recognizing those feelings can be a crucial step. How do you think those feelings about home affect your interactions with your friends?

User: Sometimes, I feel angry and want to say something to get attention. I don’t want to feel ignored.

Consultant: That’s an important insight. It’s okay to want attention, but expressing it in a positive way can be more effective. We can work on ways to express those feelings without resorting to impulsive words. How does that sound?

User: Yes, I would like that. I want people to see me.

Consultant: Let’s think of some positive phrases or actions you can take when you feel that way. For example, if you feel ignored, you might say, “I’d love to share too!” instead of interrupting.

User: That makes sense! I can practice that.

Consultant: Excellent. Let’s also set up a little reward system—when you successfully wait your turn or use a phrase like that, you can give yourself a small treat. What do you think would motivate you?

User: Maybe I can earn stickers or get to pick a game time.

Consultant: Stickers and game time sound like great incentives! We can monitor your progress together. How do you feel about trying these out in the next week?

User: I feel hopeful! I want to try.

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember to be patient with yourself if it doesn’t go perfectly the first time. It’s all about trying and learning. Let’s check in next time on how things went. 

User: Okay! I will try my best.

Consultant: Before we finish today, let’s reflect briefly on what you’ve learned about controlling your impulses and expressing your feelings. What do you think will be your biggest takeaway?

User: I need to practice waiting to speak and be more aware of my feelings at home.

Consultant: That’s a valuable realization! It's essential to recognize your emotions and their impact on your behavior. We're making great progress here. 

User: Thank you for your help! It feels good to talk about this.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! Remember, it's okay to express how you feel, both with your friends and family. I'm here to support you along the way. 

User: I appreciate it. I’ll see you next time! 

Consultant: Yes, see you next time, Little Farmer! Keep practicing, and take care until then!

Consultant: Hello! I'm so glad you're here today. I’d like to start by checking in with you about how you’ve been feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I feel like my family treats me differently than my younger brother. It’s frustrating. My parents are always rushing and seem to care more about him than me. I’ve been talking a lot with my grandma about this.

Consultant: I can see how that might make you feel upset and confused. It’s tough to sense that kind of difference in treatment. Can you tell me more about how it makes you feel when you think about your brother and the attention he gets?

User: It just makes me feel sad and sometimes angry. I don’t understand why they act like that. I try to be good and do what I’m supposed to, but it feels like no one notices me.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult. Feeling sad and angry when you believe you’re not being noticed can be overwhelming. When you talked to your grandma about this, how did it help you to express those feelings?

User: Talking to my grandma makes me feel a bit better. She listens to me and tries to understand. But I don't think my parents would understand if I told them how I feel.

Consultant: It's great that your grandma is there to listen to you. It can be hard to open up to others, especially if you don’t think they would understand. What do you think might happen if you shared your feelings with your parents?

User: I think they might get mad or just tell me to stop complaining. I don’t want to upset them more.

Consultant: That’s understandable. You’re worried about their reaction, and it makes sense that you wouldn't want to add to their stress. Let’s explore some different ways to express how you feel, so it’s more constructive. What’s a small way you could start sharing your feelings with someone who might be more understanding?

User: Maybe I could write a letter to my parents. I could say how I feel without talking face-to-face.

Consultant: Writing a letter is a thoughtful idea! It gives you the space to express yourself without the pressure of a direct conversation. How do you think you’d feel after writing that letter?

User: I think it would help me feel like I’ve said what I needed to say, even if they don’t understand.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight. It sounds like expressing your feelings in writing could be a good step for you. What would you want to include in the letter about how you feel?

User: I would tell them that I notice they spend more time with my brother and that it makes me feel sad. I want them to know I love them too.

Consultant: That’s a heartfelt approach. You’re letting them know your feelings while also expressing love. How might that change the way you feel after you share it with them?

User: It might make me feel lighter, like I’ve shared what’s in my heart. Maybe they will understand better.

Consultant: Exactly! By sharing your feelings honestly, you’re giving them a chance to understand your perspective. After you write and share this letter, what are some ways you could encourage positive conversations with your parents about your emotions?

User: I could suggest setting up a family time where we can talk and connect. Maybe I could ask them questions about what they think, too.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Suggesting family time creates an opportunity for open conversation and connection. It might help everyone share their thoughts and feelings more comfortably. How do you feel about taking those steps?

User: I feel hopeful. Maybe I can help them understand me better and bring us closer.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic attitude! Feeling hopeful is a strong first step toward creating change in your family dynamic. Remember, it’s all about taking small steps that feel right for you. How can I support you in this process moving forward?

User: I think just talking about it like this helps me a lot. I need to remember that it's okay to feel upset and that I can express it.

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s completely okay to feel upset. Acknowledging those feelings is important. I’m here to support you as you practice expressing yourself in ways that feel comfortable for you. As we wrap up today, what’s one thing you’d like to carry with you until our next session?

User: I want to carry the idea of writing that letter. I think it will make me feel better.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Writing that letter can be a powerful tool for you. I believe in your ability to take this step, and I look forward to hearing how it goes next time. Remember, it's perfectly fine to take your time with this.

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to it too.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been great speaking with you today. Take care, and I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. You've been working hard on connecting with your classmates. How are you feeling about your recent efforts?

User: Hi! I've been trying to talk more with my classmates during activities, and it feels good, but sometimes I still worry that I might say something silly.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're making an effort to engage! Feeling nervous about saying something silly is completely normal. Can you tell me more about when these worries come up?

User: Well, when I'm in a group, I often think about what I want to say, but then I get scared that they won't understand me or that everyone will laugh at me.

Consultant: That sounds tough. It’s understandable to feel that way in a group setting. What do you think would help you feel more confident when you share your thoughts?

User: Maybe if I could practice what I want to say before I speak? I just don’t want to mess up.

Consultant: Practicing beforehand could be a helpful strategy! It sounds like you want to feel more prepared. Do you think it would help to role-play some conversations together?

User: Yes, I think that could work! I would like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine a scenario where you’re starting a conversation with a classmate about a game or favorite activity. How would you initiate that conversation?

User: I could say something like, “Hey, did you see the new game that came out?” But I’m not sure if that sounds okay.

Consultant: That's a solid start! It’s friendly and shows your interest. How do you feel about using that approach if you see someone in class?

User: I feel a bit nervous still, but I like that it gives me something to say. 

Consultant: It’s perfectly okay to feel nervous. It shows you care about connecting with others. Let’s try practicing that line a few times together. 

User: Okay, that sounds fun! I’ll give it a shot.

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s do it together—I'll be your classmate. You start the conversation.

User: Hey, did you see the new game that came out?

Consultant: Yes! I did! It looks really exciting. What did you like about it?

User: I liked the graphics! They seem really colorful.

Consultant: That’s a great point! Using adjectives like "colorful" makes the conversation engaging. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt nice! I like talking about things I'm interested in.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Focusing on your interests can make it easier to engage with others. Do you have other topics in mind you’d like to try discussing?

User: I also think I can talk about school events or sports. Those things interest me too!

Consultant: Wonderful! Engaging in those topics can help strengthen your connection with others. Let’s talk about another example. How would you bring up something about a school event?

User: I could say, “Are you going to the school fair next week?”

Consultant: Perfect! That’s another excellent opening. How do you feel about that approach?

User: It feels easier since it's about something we all will experience together.

Consultant: Exactly! You're making great connections. Building on shared experiences can really help. What do you think could be the next step after starting these conversations?

User: I guess I should listen to their answers and share my thoughts too.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Listening is just as important as speaking. It helps you create a two-way dialogue. How do you feel about practicing listening?

User: I think I can do that. I just need to remember to not get too anxious.

Consultant: Yes! It takes time and patience. One way to practice listening is to reflect back what you hear. Would you like to try that with me?

User: Sure! I’d like to try.

Consultant: Okay, I’ll share something, and you can reflect back what you hear. “I really enjoy playing soccer after school.” 

User: You enjoy... playing soccer after school?

Consultant: Exactly! You’re doing great. Reflecting back shows you’re engaged and care about their perspective. How does that feel?

User: It feels good! I can do that!

Consultant: Absolutely, you can! With these techniques, you're building a strong foundation for effective communication. Is there anything specific you’d like to work on before we wrap up today?

User: I think, just practice more about starting conversations and listening.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Remember, it’s all about gradual steps. You’ve made incredible progress today, and I believe in your ability to keep improving. It’s all about practice!

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more confident now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of how far you've come. Let’s keep reinforcing these skills in our future sessions. Until next time, stay positive!

User: Thank you! I will!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Nong! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately with your studies and interactions with your classmates?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better in class and with my friends. My teacher said I'm paying more attention now, which makes me happy. But sometimes I still feel a little nervous.

Consultant: That’s great to hear that you’re feeling better in class and more connected with your friends! It’s completely normal to feel nervous sometimes, especially when things are improving. Can you share what kind of situations make you feel nervous?

User: I get nervous when there are group activities or when I have to share my ideas in front of everyone. I worry that I might say something wrong or be laughed at.

Consultant: I understand. Sharing your thoughts in front of others can be challenging, especially when you're concerned about how they might react. Let’s talk about those feelings. What thoughts go through your mind when you start to feel nervous in those situations?

User: I think that everyone will think I'm silly or that I won't be able to express myself well. It feels like everyone is judging me.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really tough to handle, and they can create a lot of pressure. It's important to recognize when those thoughts come up. How do you feel physically when these thoughts occur?

User: I feel my heart racing and sometimes my hands get sweaty. I just want to disappear in those moments.

Consultant: That sounds very uncomfortable. It's a natural response to feeling anxious. Have you noticed any specific moments or activities where you felt that anxiety rise recently?

User: Yes! Last week, we had to present our projects in front of the class. I was so nervous that I nearly forgot what I wanted to say.

Consultant: Presenting to your class can definitely be intimidating. It’s a big step, and it sounds like it was a real challenge for you. What do you think made it particularly difficult for you during the presentation?

User: I was worried that my classmates wouldn't understand me or that they would laugh at me if I made a mistake.

Consultant: Your concerns about being misunderstood or laughed at are very valid. Sometimes our minds can amplify those fears. Do you think there are ways we could challenge those thoughts when they come up in the future?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that it’s okay to make mistakes? I mean, everyone makes mistakes sometimes, right?

Consultant: Absolutely! Reminding yourself that it's okay to make mistakes is a powerful strategy. Mistakes are a part of learning. What would be a positive alternative thought you could use when you start feeling nervous?

User: I could think that sharing my ideas is a good way to learn, and that my classmates are likely supportive, even if I do make a mistake.

Consultant: That sounds like a much healthier perspective! It shifts the focus from fear to growth. Let’s practice that thought together. How would you use it next time you feel nervous about sharing in class?

User: I would try to remember that it’s a chance to share what I think and that my friends are there to support me.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Xiao Nong. Practicing these alternative thoughts can help you feel more confident. Are there any activities or techniques you think could help you get more comfortable with speaking in front of others?

User: Maybe I could practice at home with my grandma. I feel more safe talking to her.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Practicing with someone you trust can really help boost your confidence. Plus, your grandma can give you feedback and support. How do you think you would feel after doing some practice sessions with her?

User: I think I’d feel less nervous because I would get used to speaking out loud. It would help me feel more ready for class.

Consultant: Definitely! Getting comfortable with speaking will help ease your nerves. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed. What are some key takeaways for you to continue working on?

User: I need to remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that sharing my ideas is important. Practicing with my grandma could help, too.

Consultant: Those are excellent takeaways! You’ve made incredible progress, Xiao Nong, and it sounds like you have a good plan moving forward. Keep practicing those thoughts and reaching out for support when you need it. How do you feel about your progress today?

User: I feel proud of myself for recognizing my feelings and coming up with ways to deal with them. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been really inspiring to see your growth. Remember, I’m here to help support you, so feel free to reach out anytime you need assistance. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!
