Consultant: Hello, Ma Xiaowu! It's great to meet you today. I understand you've been feeling quite disappointed and confused lately. Can you tell me more about what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. Yeah, I’ve been feeling really frustrated. I didn’t receive the “Three Good Student” title this year, and it feels like everyone, including my parents and teachers, has high expectations for me. I'm starting to wonder if my efforts even matter.

Consultant: I can see how that would be really frustrating for you. It sounds like there’s a lot of pressure from school and family. How did it feel for you to not receive that title? 

User: I feel let down, honestly. I worked hard all year, and it just feels like no one notices. I thought I was doing well, but now I’m questioning my worth.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. When we put in so much effort and don't get the recognition we hoped for, it’s easy to feel undervalued. Let’s explore those feelings of disappointment a bit more. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about not receiving the title?

User: I just keep thinking that maybe I’m not good enough or that I’m failing everyone’s expectations. It's like I’ve let everyone down, including myself.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy. You’re feeling as if you're not living up to standards, which can be emotionally exhausting. Can you identify any moments where you felt proud of your achievements, despite not getting that title?

User: There were times I did well in competitions and enjoyed studying subjects I love. But now, those feel overshadowed by this failure.

Consultant: It’s important to recognize those achievements too! They are part of your journey and worth celebrating. Can we talk about how this experience affects your view of yourself and the effort you put in?

User: I think I'm starting to believe that nothing I do will matter. Like, I’m just trying to meet everyone else's standards and forgetting why I wanted to study hard in the first place.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re beginning to question your motivations as well as your self-worth. What if we challenge those thoughts? Can you think of reasons why your efforts do matter, independent of others’ expectations?

User: Maybe I should think about how I enjoy learning and growing, but it’s hard to focus on that right now.

Consultant: Let’s take a moment to focus on that enjoyment of learning. How can embracing that passion help you find meaning in your efforts, regardless of outside recognition?

User: I guess if I focus on my interests, it might take some pressure off. But that's easier said than done.

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s much easier to talk about than to practice. Let’s explore some small actions you could take to reconnect with what truly motivates you. What are some activities or subjects that excite you?

User: I love science and doing projects. It felt great to create something and learn while doing it.

Consultant: Great! How about setting aside some time to work on a science project, without the pressure of grades or titles? This could be a way to reconnect with your passion.

User: That sounds good. It might help me relax.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Enjoying those activities can help alleviate some of the stress you’re feeling. Can you also think of ways to communicate with your parents or teachers about how you feel?

User: I haven’t thought about talking to them because I’m afraid they won’t understand. 

Consultant: Open communication can be intimidating, but sharing your feelings might help them understand your perspective better. What do you think might be a good way to start that conversation?

User: Maybe I could tell them how I feel about the pressure and see if they can understand where I’m coming from.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach! Expressing how you feel can sometimes create a better understanding. What are your thoughts about this next step?

User: I guess I want them to understand that I’m trying my best, but I’m still feeling hurt by all this.

Consultant: That’s valid, and expressing your hurt can help bridge the gap. As we reflect on our discussion, how would you summarize the main feelings or insights you’ve gained today?

User: I feel unhappy and frustrated because of the title situation, but I realize that I need to focus more on my love for learning, and I might help my parents see my perspective too.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight, Ma Xiaowu! Remember, it's okay to feel hurt, and finding joy in learning can be restorative. Before we end today’s session, can you identify one small action you'll take this week to move forward with these insights?

User: I’ll set time aside to work on a science project and consider how to talk to my parents about this.

Consultant: That sounds like a strong plan! As you work on these, be gentle with yourself. Remember, progress takes time. If you ever want to revisit these feelings, I'm here for you.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to seeing how these steps help you next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ma, I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling since our last discussion about the criticism you faced in class?

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty frustrated and angry about what happened. I still can’t shake off the feelings from the criticism. It just feels so unfair, and I can't help but doubt my abilities.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're really struggling with the feelings of injustice and doubt regarding your abilities. Let's explore this a bit more. Can you tell me what specifically about the criticism made you feel this way?

User: It was just my teacher saying that I wasn't trying hard enough, even though I've been putting in so much effort. I felt like my hard work didn’t matter at all.

Consultant: That sounds really disheartening. It seems like your hard work isn't being recognized, which can be really frustrating. How did that make you feel in the moment?

User: I felt embarrassed, and that anger just built up inside me. I wanted to shout or tell the teacher that it was unfair, but I didn’t. I just sat there.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way. Feeling embarrassed in front of others can be overwhelming, and your reaction of wanting to express your anger is natural. Let’s talk about the thoughts that went through your mind right after the criticism. What were you telling yourself in that moment?

User: I kept thinking that maybe I wasn't good enough, and that my parents and teachers were expecting too much from me. It made me want to give up.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy. Doubting your abilities and feeling overwhelmed by expectations can be tough to carry. Let’s take a moment and challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that counters the idea that you are not good enough?

User: Well, I did well in my last exams and my teachers have praised me before. It’s just this one incident that feels so huge.

Consultant: Exactly, it’s important to remember that one incident doesn’t define your worth or your abilities. Sometimes we can get trapped in the moment and forget about our achievements. If a friend was feeling the way you are right now, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that one bad comment doesn’t mean they're a failure. They should keep trying because they have done well before.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! You’re recognizing that even strong students like yourself can face criticism without it reflecting their entire journey. Let’s practice using that understanding for yourself. How could you reframe your thoughts about the criticism you received?

User: Maybe I could think that it’s just one teacher’s opinion and that I’m not defined by that. I guess it’s important to keep showing effort and not let one comment pull me down.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift in thinking! Recognizing that opinions can vary and not allowing one experience to overshadow your accomplishments is key. Now, let’s consider how to handle interactions with your teacher and classmates moving forward. What are some strategies you think could help you express your feelings constructively?

User: I think I could try talking to my teacher about how I felt or ask for feedback on how I can improve. Talking it out might help.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Communicating your feelings can help clarify misunderstandings. It also demonstrates your willingness to improve. Would you feel comfortable planning a conversation with your teacher?

User: I think I could prepare for it. Writing down what I want to say might help me feel less anxious about it.

Consultant: Preparing ahead is a great strategy! It can help you feel more in control during the conversation. Would you like to role-play how that conversation might go?

User: Sure, I could try that. It would help me think about what I want to say and how to say it.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s imagine starting the conversation. You can begin by expressing your feelings about the criticism and then ask for guidance on improving. How would you start?

User: I might say something like, "I felt really upset after you said I wasn’t trying hard enough, and I’d like to know how I can improve."

Consultant: That sounds like a thoughtful start. It conveys how you feel and opens the door for constructive feedback. With this approach, you’re likely to create a more positive atmosphere for discussion. How do you feel about trying this?

User: I feel a little more confident about it. I still think it might be hard, but practicing helps.

Consultant: It's normal to feel nervous, but practice makes it easier. Remember, you are taking steps towards better communication and understanding. As we wrap up today, what would you say is the most important takeaway from our session?

User: I think it’s that I need to challenge my negative thoughts and communicate better. I’ve realized that I can't let one bad comment ruin everything I’ve accomplished.

Consultant: Absolutely! You have a lot to be proud of, and it’s important to keep that in mind. As you work on these new skills, know that it’s okay to feel anger or frustration, but you also have the tools to address them positively. I look forward to hearing how your conversations go next time.

User: Thanks! I’ll definitely work on this and let you know how it goes. I'm feeling a bit better about everything now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Ma! Remember, it's okay to reach out whenever you need support. I'm here for you. Take care until our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ma Xiaowu! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling recently, especially after our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a mix of anger and frustration. I faced another situation in class that felt unfair, and it's really bothering me. I want to understand how to deal with it better.

Consultant: It sounds like that unfair situation in class has made you feel quite upset. I appreciate you sharing that with me. Can you tell me more about what happened and how it made you feel?

User: Well, during a group project, I felt like my ideas weren't taken seriously by my classmates. They dismissed my suggestions, and it made me really angry. I just want them to understand my perspective.

Consultant: I can see why that would be really frustrating for you. You put effort into your ideas, and it's natural to want them to be recognized. How do you typically react when you're feeling this anger towards your classmates?

User: I usually withdraw and stop participating. I feel like if they don't value my contributions, then there's no point in trying. But then I regret not speaking up!

Consultant: That sounds like a tough cycle to be in—wanting to speak up but then feeling shut down. What do you think would help you break that cycle and express yourself more effectively in those situations?

User: I guess I need to find a way to feel more confident in sharing my thoughts. Maybe I should practice saying things out loud before group discussions.

Consultant: Practicing what you want to say is a great strategy! It can help you feel more prepared and confident when the time comes. Would you like to role-play a scenario together where you could practice voicing your ideas in a group setting?

User: Yes, that could be helpful! I think practicing in a safe environment would ease my anxiety a bit.

Consultant: Perfect! Let's say we’re in a group discussion about a project topic. You can start by sharing your idea. Remember, there's no right or wrong here; it’s just practice.

User: Okay, we’re discussing the benefits of renewable energy. I would say, “I believe we should focus on solar energy because it is sustainable and has less impact on the environment.”

Consultant: That’s a great start! How did it feel to express your idea? 

User: It felt a bit nerve-wracking, but I also feel proud of myself for putting my thoughts out there.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful feeling! It's essential to acknowledge those small victories. How do you think you can build on this feeling in your actual group discussions?

User: Maybe I can remind myself of this practice and that it’s okay if not everyone agrees with me. I just need to be more assertive.

Consultant: Absolutely! Being assertive is key to expressing yourself. Let's explore how you can prepare for potential disagreements. How do you think you might respond if others push back against your ideas?

User: I could ask them why they disagree, so I can understand their perspective better. That might help keep the conversation productive.

Consultant: I like that approach! Asking questions can open up dialogue rather than shut it down. It also shows that you value their opinions. How do you feel about using this technique when you return to class?

User: I feel more equipped now. It seems like it would turn a frustrating situation into a chance for dialogue.

Consultant: Exactly! Engaging in constructive conversations can lead to better understanding. As you practice this in class, try to notice any positive shifts in your interactions.

User: I’ll definitely give it a try. Still, sometimes I find myself stuck on those past situations where I felt ignored.

Consultant: That’s completely natural. It’s important to acknowledge those feelings. Have you thought about ways to let go of past disappointments and focus more on the present?

User: I suppose I could journal about my experiences to process them better. Writing might help me release some of the burden I feel.

Consultant: Journaling is a fantastic tool! It allows you to reflect on your experiences while also clearing your mind. What else can you do to stay focused on the present?

User: Maybe I can practice mindfulness exercises. I’ve heard they can help with staying grounded.

Consultant: Absolutely! Mindfulness can help you connect with the present moment and reduce anxiety about past events. We can explore some techniques together if you’d like.

User: That sounds good! I think I'll benefit from learning those techniques.

Consultant: Great! Let’s try a simple breathing exercise. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable and take a deep breath in through your nose... hold it... and slowly exhale through your mouth. How does that feel?

User: It feels calming. I can see how practicing this could help when I’m feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Regularly practicing mindfulness can enhance your ability to handle stressful situations. As we wrap up today, what are your main takeaways from our session?

User: I learned some strategies to express myself better in class and how to cope with past feelings. I feel more prepared to take on my interactions.

Consultant: That’s wonderful progress! Remember, the skills you're building now will serve you well in the future. If you ever feel like you’re slipping back into old patterns, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you for your support! I appreciate your guidance and feel more confident about moving forward.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Ma Xiaowu! I'm proud of how far you've come. Until our next session, keep practicing these strategies and stay connected to your growth. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ma Xiaowu! I'm really glad you came in today. How have you been feeling lately, especially with your experiences in school activities?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better actually. Participating in school activities has helped me feel more engaged and recognized, but I still find myself thinking about some unfair experiences I've had in the past.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling more engaged! It sounds like those school activities have had a positive impact. Let's talk a bit more about those past experiences. What kind of memories come to mind when you think about them?

User: I remember times when I felt sidelined or treated unfairly in competitions. It still bothers me sometimes, even when I'm trying to enjoy the present.

Consultant: That makes sense—those experiences can leave a strong mark. It's like they're overshadowing the good things happening now. How do you think these memories affect your feelings about your current achievements?

User: I guess they make me doubt myself sometimes. I feel like no matter how well I do, there's still that lingering feeling of not being good enough because of what happened before.

Consultant: It’s understandable that those feelings of self-doubt arise. Let’s consider this together. Can you tell me about a recent achievement or praise you've received that felt particularly meaningful to you?

User: Well, I received some recognition in my club for my contributions. That felt good, but right after, those old memories crept back in, making me question if I truly deserved it.

Consultant: I'm proud to hear about your recognition! It seems like a positive affirmation of your hard work. Let's explore that feeling of deserving. What evidence do you see that supports your contributions in the present?

User: I worked hard on a project, and my peers seemed genuinely appreciative. But then, I still wonder if it was just luck or if I’m just fooling myself.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re grappling with some internal criticism. Let's try to challenge that thought. If a friend came to you feeling this way about their achievements, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably say they should trust their efforts and not discount their hard work. They earned that recognition just like everyone else.

Consultant: Exactly! You see, your accomplishments are valid and deserve celebration. Now, let’s think about how you can begin to trust in your own worth and not let those past experiences overshadow your present. How might you do that?

User: Maybe I could keep reminding myself of the positive feedback I've received and write down my accomplishments to look back on.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Keeping a record of your achievements can help reinforce your self-worth. How about setting a time each week to reflect on those experiences? 

User: That sounds like a good plan! I think it will help me focus on the present more.

Consultant: I'm glad you think so! As you embrace those positive thoughts, let’s consider how we can further enhance your engagement in current activities. Are there any new clubs or hobbies you’ve been thinking about trying?

User: I’ve thought about joining a photography club. I love capturing moments and expressing myself creatively.

Consultant: That sounds fantastic! Engaging in something you’re passionate about can help you build new connections and experiences. How would you feel about taking practical steps to join this club?

User: I think I would feel excited about it! It would be a nice distraction from overthinking.

Consultant: Perfect! Excitement is a great motivator. Let’s outline the steps you can take to sign up and get involved. This way, you can create new positive memories that overshadow the old ones.

User: I need to check when the meetings are scheduled and then talk to my parents about it.

Consultant: That’s a great start. Make sure to approach your parents with enthusiasm about what you might gain from the experience. It’s important to communicate your interests to them!

User: Yes, I can do that. I think they will support me.

Consultant: I’m sure they will! As you take these steps, remember to celebrate each small achievement along the way, no matter how minor it seems. How do you feel about the overall direction we're heading in?

User: I feel positive! I like the idea of focusing on what I can control now and embracing new opportunities.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Ma Xiaowu! As we wrap up today’s session, let’s think about how you’ll integrate this approach into your life. What’s one takeaway you’d like to remember?

User: I think I want to keep reminding myself that my current efforts and achievements are valid and that I deserve to enjoy them.

Consultant: Exactly, and you have every right to feel proud of who you are and what you accomplish. Remember, it's about being present and engaged. I believe you'll continue making progress. If you need support in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your experiences in the future. Take care, and until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ma Xiaowu! I'm glad you could make it to our session today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. I made a new friend through a recent extracurricular activity, and it feels nice to be understood by someone.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful, forming new friendships can really enhance our emotional support. Could you tell me more about this new experience and how it has impacted you?

User: It feels great to share interests and have someone to talk to. I really enjoy spending time with him, and it makes me feel less alone.

Consultant: That's really encouraging to hear. It seems like this friendship has provided you with a sense of belonging. What aspects of this new connection do you appreciate the most?

User: I appreciate that we both understand each other's struggles. It’s nice to have someone who doesn’t judge me and just listens.

Consultant: Having someone who listens can be incredibly nurturing, especially during times of stress. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or motivation since you made this connection?

User: Yes, definitely! I feel more motivated to participate in activities. I even started enjoying studying a bit more since I know I have someone to share my thoughts with.

Consultant: That’s a significant improvement! It sounds like this social interaction is boosting your motivation. How do you think you can maintain this positive momentum in your studies and social life?

User: I think I should keep engaging with my new friend and maybe even join more activities where I can meet others. It feels good to be in a supportive environment.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Engaging in more activities can not only bolster your social circle but also enhance your self-worth. Are there specific activities you’re considering?

User: I was thinking about joining a book club or some sports team. Those sound interesting and fun!

Consultant: Both of those options could provide a fantastic avenue for connection and enjoyment. What do you think might be the benefits of joining a book club or a sports team?

User: In a book club, I could talk about ideas and themes with others. Sports would be fun and help me stay active, plus I'd get to meet new people.

Consultant: Exactly! Both options bring unique benefits that can enrich your social experience. It also sounds like they can help reinforce your sense of self and belonging. What steps might you take to start with one of these activities soon?

User: I can look for local community centers or schools that have these clubs. I think I’ll try to find information this week.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Setting a timeline can help ensure you follow through. How do you feel about taking these steps? 

User: I feel excited! It's nice to think about being part of something bigger and meeting new friends.

Consultant: It truly is exciting! Engaging in activities that resonate with you can further your sense of connection. Reflecting on your experiences, are there any barriers you foresee that might challenge you in this process?

User: I guess I might worry about not fitting in or if I'll be good enough. Those thoughts sometimes creep in.

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel that way. Recognizing these thoughts is the first step in managing them. Let’s talk about how we could challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that might suggest you wouldn’t fit in?

User: I mean, I’ve had good experiences with friends before, so I guess there isn’t much proof... But I still feel that fear sometimes.

Consultant: You’ve just pointed out something quite important—a past positive experience! It can help to remind yourself of those moments when negativity arises. If a friend faced this situation, what advice would you give them?

User: I would tell them that it’s okay to be nervous and that it usually gets better once you’re there.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective! Adopting the same compassion for yourself could be very helpful. What strategies can you implement to remind yourself of this if those feelings resurface?

User: I could write it down and keep it in my notebook, or maybe discuss it with my friend when I'm feeling iffy.

Consultant: Those are effective strategies! Writing down your thoughts can help you focus on the positives, and discussing with your friend can provide support. How do you feel about adding these practices to your routine?

User: I feel good about it. It makes sense to have a solid plan in place for when I feel uncertain.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Ma Xiaowu. Embracing proactive measures is a strong step forward. Before we wrap up today, let’s summarize your key insights and the steps you plan to take. Can you share them with me?

User: Sure! I want to keep engaging with my new friend, look for clubs to join, write down positive affirmations, and talk to my friend when I'm feeling down.

User: I feel confident and hopeful. I’m excited about the new possibilities and proud of what I’ve learned.

Consultant: Science and technology are great fields to explore! Engaging in workshops or competitions can certainly expand your knowledge. How do you think being involved in such activities will impact your studies and personal development?

User: I believe it will help me apply what I learn in school to real-world scenarios, which can deepen my understanding. Plus, I enjoy working on projects and collaborating with others.

Consultant: That’s an excellent insight! Combining theoretical knowledge with practical experiences can really reinforce your learning. Have you considered how you might balance these new activities with your current studies?

User: Yes, I’ve thought about it. I plan to manage my time better by creating a schedule that allows me to dedicate time to both my studies and these new activities.

Consultant: Creating a schedule is a great strategy! It will help ensure you have enough time for both your academic responsibilities and your interests. How do you feel about the prospect of managing your time effectively?

User: I feel optimistic about it. I've learned some time management techniques in our previous sessions, and I think I can apply them.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling optimistic! Reflecting on what you’ve learned previously, which techniques do you think will be most beneficial for you in managing your time for both studies and extracurriculars?

User: I think prioritizing tasks and breaking down larger projects into smaller steps will help me stay organized. Also, setting specific goals for each study session can improve my focus.

Consultant: Those are great insights! Prioritizing tasks and setting specific goals will definitely aid in keeping your focus sharp. As you look ahead, what goals do you have for yourself in the next few months regarding your studies and activities?

User: I want to maintain my grades while also participating in at least two extracurricular activities. I hope to learn new skills and make connections with others who share my interests.

Consultant: That sounds like a balanced and achievable goal! Maintaining your academic performance while engaging in extracurricular activities can provide a well-rounded experience. How can I support you in achieving these goals?

User: I’d appreciate your advice on how to stay motivated when things get challenging. Sometimes I worry about managing everything at once.

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s normal to feel overwhelmed at times. We can focus on strategies for maintaining motivation, such as reminding yourself of your achievements, setting realistic expectations, and taking breaks when needed. Does that sound helpful to you?

User: Yes, it does! I think revisiting my achievements will help me stay grounded.

Consultant: That's a powerful strategy! Reflecting on your successes can boost your confidence and motivation. Would you like to elaborate on some of those recent achievements that you’re proud of?

User: Sure! Recently, I improved my grades in math, and I received praise from my teachers for my project in science class. I feel like my hard work is finally paying off.

Consultant: Those are remarkable accomplishments! It’s important to recognize and celebrate such successes. How do you plan to carry this positive momentum into your future endeavors?

User: I think I’ll keep setting small goals for myself to maintain my motivation and track my progress. I really want to keep this upward trend going!

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan, Ma Xiaowu! Setting small, achievable goals will help create a sense of accomplishment along the way. As we wrap up our session, what do you feel is the most important takeaway for you from today’s discussion?

User: I feel that I can manage both my studies and extracurricular activities by staying organized and motivated. It’s all about balance, and I will keep reminding myself of my achievements.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway. Balance is indeed key, and your awareness of your achievements will serve as a great reminder of your capabilities. I’m really impressed with your growth and the attitude you have towards your future!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support throughout this process.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I believe in your ability to navigate these changes successfully. If challenges arise, remember that you can always come back for support. I wish you all the best on your journey ahead!

User: Thanks again! I feel ready for the future now.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time we meet. Goodbye for now!
