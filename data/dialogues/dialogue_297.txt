Consultant: Hi there, Dong! I'm glad to see you today. Last time we spoke about your anxiety regarding eye contact with girls, especially in class. How have you been since then?

User: Hi! I've been okay but honestly still feeling anxious about eye contact. I want to participate more in class, but whenever I think of looking at a girl, I just freeze up and feel a bit embarrassed.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like you’re still struggling with that fear, which is completely understandable. Can you help me understand what thoughts arise when you think about making eye contact with girls?

User: I often think they will judge me or that I’ll say something stupid. I feel like everyone is watching me, and my heart starts racing.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite powerful, and it's no wonder they lead to anxiety. Let's dig a little deeper—what evidence do you have that supports these beliefs about being judged or saying something silly?

User: Well, I don’t really have specific evidence. It’s just a feeling I get, but it seems so real in the moment!

Consultant: It’s common for feelings to feel very real, even when there’s no solid evidence. If you were to advise a friend who felt the same way about making eye contact, what would you suggest to him?

User: I guess I would tell him to just relax and that people are usually focused on themselves, not judging others.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a great perspective. It's important to remember that others are often more preoccupied with their own feelings. Would you be willing to try an exercise where you gradually practice eye contact in low-stakes situations? 

User: Sure! I think I could try that. Maybe I could start by looking at girls in a casual environment, like a café.

Consultant: That sounds like a good first step! Gradual exposure can really help reduce anxiety. What if, during your next visit to a café, you took a moment to look at someone and just hold the glance for a few seconds? How does that sound?

User: That sounds a bit challenging, but I think it might help. I can give it a shot. 

Consultant: I'm proud of you for considering this! Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous at first. How about setting a small goal for yourself? Maybe you could aim to make eye contact with one person during your upcoming visit.

User: Yes, that sounds manageable. I think I can handle trying to look someone in the eye for a few seconds.

Consultant: Excellent! As you prepare for this, what are some thoughts you can remind yourself of to help ease your anxiety while you practice?

User: I could tell myself that it’s okay to feel nervous and that I’m just practicing. I could remind myself that it’s a normal part of social interactions.

Consultant: That's a fantastic tactic! Reassuring yourself can really help. After you try this, let’s discuss how it went during our next session. How are you feeling about making this step?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also hopeful! It feels good to have a plan.

Consultant: That’s a great combination—nervousness paired with hope! Just remember, facing your fears can take time, and every step is progress. If you encounter any overwhelming situations during your practice, don’t hesitate to jot down those moments. We can analyze them together.

User: I will. I hope talking about it will also make it less scary.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Talking it through can definitely help. As we continue, I’d also like to break down any situations where you feel particularly anxious. Can you think of another scenario, aside from the café, where eye contact feels daunting?

User: Sometimes in class when the teacher asks a question, I avoid looking at the girls in my group because I worry about their judgment.

Consultant: That’s a relatable situation. During class, what do you think makes those moments especially challenging for you?

User: I think it’s the fear that my answer will be wrong or that I’ll embarrass myself in front of them.

Consultant: Those are valid concerns, Dong. What if we considered reframing this thought? Instead of focusing on the possibility of embarrassment, could we shift the perspective to see it as an opportunity to share and connect with your classmates?

User: I see what you mean. I guess participating is a chance to contribute, not just to be judged.

Consultant: Exactly! Engaging in those discussions not only helps others learn but can also strengthen your connections in class. Would you be open to setting a goal of answering at least one question in class each session?

User: I think I could try that. I’ll aim for just one answer, even if it’s short.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Celebrating your small wins is key to building confidence. After this week, let’s check in on how that feels and what you can take from the experience.

User: I’m looking forward to it! I think having these goals will motivate me.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Dong. Remember, it’s all about progress. Keep practicing those small steps you’ve set, and we’ll explore your feelings together next time. How about we wrap up for today? 

User: Yes, that sounds good. Thanks for today! I feel much better having a plan.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of you for being proactive. Take care, and I can’t wait to hear about your experiences next time!

Consultant: Hello, Dong! I'm glad to see you for this session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I think I'm doing a bit better, but I still notice that I get anxious when I have to make eye contact with the girls in class. It's really frustrating.

Consultant: I can understand how challenging that must be for you. So, you're aware of the anxiety related to eye contact but you want to improve on it. Can you share what happens when you try to make eye contact? What kind of thoughts come to your mind?

User: Well, I often worry that they'll think I'm weird or that I'll look stupid. I also feel my heart racing, and sometimes I just look away. I feel embarrassed afterward.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts create a cycle of anxiety that makes it difficult to interact naturally. Let's explore those thoughts a bit deeper. When you think that they might see you as weird or stupid, what evidence do you have that supports this belief?

User: I don't have any solid evidence, I just feel that way. I think I've seen people avoid making eye contact with each other, and that makes me feel even worse.

Consultant: It seems like your feelings are strongly influencing your thoughts. What if we tried to look at this from a different perspective? If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their concerns?

User: I'd probably tell them that it's okay to be nervous and that people usually aren't thinking about them as much as they think. 

Consultant: That's a great insight! You recognize that others may not focus on those small details about you. How could you apply this thinking to your own situation when you're about to make eye contact?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it's normal to feel nervous, and that I shouldn't assume what they think of me. 

Consultant: Exactly! This kind of reframing can be very helpful. Let's take it a step further. Is there a way we can practice making eye contact in a low-pressure situation?

User: Maybe I could try making eye contact with friends first before tackling it in class. That sounds like a good idea.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! How about we set a small goal for you? Perhaps you could aim to hold eye contact with a friend for a few seconds during your next interaction. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds doable! I think starting with friends might make it easier for me.

Consultant: Awesome! You’re taking a great step. After you practice with friends, how do you think you might feel about trying it in class?

User: If I can succeed with friends, I might feel a bit more confident to try it in class. I hope it will help ease some of the anxiety.

Consultant: It definitely could! Remember, it's all about gradual exposure. After practicing, I encourage you to reflect on how it went. What thoughts might come up for you after those experiences?

User: I might feel proud of myself if I manage to make eye contact! But I also worry that I'll still feel awkward afterward.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel a bit awkward, especially after a new experience. What if you acknowledged those feelings but focused on the progress you’ve made instead?

User: Yeah, I can focus on how I'm trying instead of just the uncomfortable feelings. 

Consultant: That's a powerful approach! Keeping a record of your experiences can also help you see the progress over time. Would you be willing to write down how you feel after these practice sessions?

User: I could definitely do that. It might help me see that I’m improving step by step.

Consultant: Yes, and it will also allow you to challenge any negative thoughts that arise after those interactions. Looking forward, how do you feel about approaching our next session with these practices in mind?

User: I feel hopeful. I think I can push through my anxiety if I keep practicing and reflecting on my experiences.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Progress takes time, but your willingness to confront this challenge shows strength. Is there any particular concern or thought you’d like to address further before we finish today?

User: I just hope that I won't feel too embarrassed after trying to make eye contact. 

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. Let's remind ourselves that feeling embarrassment is part of growth. It shows you're pushing your comfort zone. As you continue to practice, this embarrassment may lessen over time. 

User: That makes sense. I appreciate your reassurance.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Dong! Remember, it's perfectly okay to feel uneasy at times. You're actively working on these feelings, and that’s an important part of your journey. Today, let's wrap-up by acknowledging your willingness to challenge your fears. That’s a significant step.

User: Thanks! I did enjoy this session, and I'm ready to try out these new ideas!

Consultant: Fantastic! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Keep up the great work, and take it one step at a time!

User: I will, thank you!

Consultant: You're welcome! See you next time, and take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Dong! I'm really glad you're here today. I remember from our last session that you made some progress in your interactions with girls, especially with eye contact. How have you been feeling about that recently?

User: Hi! Yeah, I feel like I've made some progress, but I still get a bit awkward sometimes. I want to get more comfortable and confident in those moments.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling some progress, even though there's still a bit of awkwardness. Can you tell me more about the specific situations where you still feel that discomfort?

User: Well, when I'm in class and I make eye contact, I can feel my heart racing, and I start second-guessing what to say next. Sometimes I just freeze up.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s completely normal to feel pressure in those moments. Let's explore together—what thoughts come to your mind when you feel your heart racing or when you freeze up?

User: I often think, "What if they don't like me?" or "What if I say something silly?" Those thoughts make me hesitate.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite powerful for you. Can we challenge those thoughts a bit? What evidence do you have that those negative outcomes would actually happen?

User: I guess I don’t have much evidence. Most of the time, the girls are nice, and they don’t seem to judge me harshly.

Consultant: That's a valuable insight! It's important to recognize that your fears may not be based on reality. How would you advise a friend who felt the same way in a similar situation?

User: I would probably tell them to relax and just be themselves, that people are usually friendly.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful piece of advice! Now, how about we practice a scenario together? Imagine a situation in class where you want to initiate a conversation. What could your opening line be?

User: Maybe I could say, "Hey, did you understand the last topic we covered?" It seems simple enough.

Consultant: That’s an excellent choice! A straightforward question can ease the conversation. How do you feel saying that out loud?

User: It feels okay, but I still worry about how they'll respond.

Consultant: It’s natural to have that concern. Let's focus on what you can control—your response. If they respond positively, how would that make you feel?

User: I think I’d feel really happy and relieved!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful outcome to aim for. And if the response isn't what you expected, what could you remind yourself in that moment?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it's just one interaction, and not everyone will vibe with me, and that's fine.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about the experience, not just the outcome. Practicing these small interactions will help reinforce your confidence. What other steps can you take to prepare yourself for these situations?

User: I could practice some self-talk in front of the mirror or try role-playing with friends to make it feel normal.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies! Role-playing can help you feel more at ease. Let’s also think about some positive affirmations you can tell yourself before approaching someone. Any ideas?

User: Maybe something like, "I’m enough as I am, and I can handle this."

Consultant: That’s powerful! Repeating affirmations like that can shift your mindset. How do you think you can incorporate this affirmation into your daily routine?

User: I can say it in the morning and whenever I feel nervous before class.

Consultant: Great plan! Consistency will help solidify that confidence. Now, let’s touch on non-verbal communication. How do you feel about your body language during these interactions?

User: I sometimes cross my arms or look down, which probably makes me seem closed off.

Consultant: That’s a good observation. Being mindful of your body language can really help. How about practicing an open posture, like uncrossing your arms and maintaining eye contact?

User: I can try that. I guess it’ll help me feel more open and confident.

Consultant: Absolutely! Your body language can influence how you feel. How do you think implementing these strategies will affect your social interactions?

User: I think I’ll feel more in control and less anxious about what to say or do.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! As we wrap up our session, let’s summarize what you’ve learned today. What strategies will you focus on moving forward?

User: I’ll work on positive affirmations, practice role-playing, and remember to keep an open posture.

Consultant: Those sound like solid steps towards building your confidence. Remember, it’s natural to experience some anxiety, and you’re making progress every time you push through it. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel more motivated and hopeful. Thanks for helping me see things more clearly!

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’re doing amazing work. Keep practicing, and I believe you’ll see more improvements in your social interactions. If you need any support in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Dong! I'm glad to see you again for our session. How have you been feeling since our last discussion about your social interactions?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident actually. I participated in a class discussion, and I managed to communicate with some of the girls in my class. But I still feel a bit shy and uneasy at times.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’ve experienced some confidence boosts! Engaging in discussions is a big step. Can you tell me more about what emotions you felt during and after that interaction?

User: During the discussion, I felt a mix of excitement and nervousness. After it was over, I felt relieved and proud of myself for being able to talk to them.

Consultant: Feeling proud of yourself is an excellent sign, Dong! It shows your progress. However, that nervousness still seems to linger. What do you think triggers that feeling of unease when you're in social situations?

User: I think it’s mostly the fear of saying something wrong or being judged that makes me anxious. I worry a lot about how others perceive me.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those fears, especially when social interactions can often feel uncertain. Can you recall specific thoughts that crossed your mind during those moments when you felt anxious?

User: Maybe I thought, "What if they don’t like what I say?" or "What if I embarrass myself?"

Consultant: Those thoughts can definitely heighten your anxiety. Let’s explore that together. On a scale from 0 to 10, how much do you believe those thoughts when they come up?

User: I’d say around 8. They really do seem real to me at that moment, and it’s hard not to think about them.

Consultant: That’s a significant level of belief in those thoughts! Now, let’s consider—what’s the evidence that supports or contradicts those thoughts? Have there been past experiences that suggest those fears might not always be true?

User: Well, my recent class discussion went well, and nobody really seemed to judge me. So maybe I’m assuming too much?

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight, Dong! It sounds like there’s evidence that contradicts your fears. How would you feel about trying to replace those negative thoughts with more balanced ones in future situations?

User: I suppose I could try to remind myself of the positive feedback and my past interactions instead of jumping to conclusions.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! We can call this a “thought replacement” strategy. Next time you feel anxious, you can remind yourself of instances where things went better than expected. How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful. I like the idea of focusing on the positives.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take this a step further. Are you open to setting small social tasks to practice these new thought patterns and build your confidence further?

User: Yes, I’m open to that! What kind of tasks do you have in mind?

Consultant: How about starting with something manageable, like initiating a short conversation with a classmate about a topic you both enjoy? This way, you’ll create an opportunity for connection while practicing your new thoughts.

User: I can definitely try that! Maybe I could ask about a project or something.

Consultant: Perfect! Asking about a shared interest is an excellent way to initiate conversation. What’s a specific next step you’d like to take before our next session?

User: I think I’ll aim to start that conversation by the end of this week and see how it goes.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Dong! Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. What feelings do you expect to experience when you attempt this task?

User: I might feel nervous again, but I hope to also feel excited, knowing that I’m trying.

Consultant: That’s a healthy way to approach it! Feeling nervous is expected, but excitement can also encourage you to step out. Before we wrap up, let’s reflect on the progress you’ve made. What changes do you notice in how you view social interactions now?

User: I feel like I’m slowly shifting from avoiding them to being more willing to participate. That feels empowering!

Consultant: Absolutely! Embracing that willingness is crucial. Before our next session, keep noting any shifts in your feelings or thoughts during interactions. We can build on this positive momentum. 

User: I will! Thanks for the encouragement. I’m looking forward to trying these strategies.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m proud of your efforts, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember, be kind to yourself as you navigate these challenges. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support.

Consultant: It’s my pleasure, Dong! Take care, and see you soon.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Dong! It's great to see you again. I'm glad to hear about your recent experiences in the social club. How have you been feeling about your social interactions lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling much better, actually. I’m enjoying meeting new people and participating in activities. It’s a lot more fun than I expected!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some positive strides in your social confidence. Can you share a specific moment or interaction in the club that made you feel proud or happy?

User: There was this group activity last week where I led a discussion. I was nervous at first, but I felt a rush of excitement when people engaged with what I was saying. It was such a relief!

Consultant: Leading a discussion is a significant achievement! It's great that you pushed through the initial nerves and found joy in engaging with others. How did that experience change your view on similar situations in the future?

User: I think it showed me that I can do more than I thought. I feel like I could take on more leadership roles or even just contribute more in conversations. It’s encouraging!

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing your capability to lead and engage is an important step toward building lasting confidence. Are there any challenges or lingering anxieties you still face when interacting in this new environment?

User: Sometimes I still worry about how I come across, especially when talking to girls. I don't want to embarrass myself or say something awkward.

Consultant: It's normal to feel that way, especially when interacting with someone you want to make a good impression on. What thoughts cross your mind when you find yourself feeling anxious about these interactions?

User: I keep thinking, "What if I say something wrong?" or "What if they don't find me interesting?" It puts a lot of pressure on me.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite heavy, and they often intensify our anxiety. Let's explore this a bit. Are there any instances where you felt those fears were unfounded or where things went better than you expected?

User: Actually, yes! There was a time I was chatting with a girl in the club. I thought I was rambling, but she seemed engaged in the conversation, and we shared a laugh. It ended up being really fun.

Consultant: That’s a perfect example! It shows that not only did your worries overshadow the reality of the situation, but you were also able to connect and have a positive experience. How can that realization help you next time you feel anxious?

User: I guess I can remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that people appreciate genuine conversation. I shouldn’t overthink it.

Consultant: Exactly! Keeping it simple and genuine can often lead to the best interactions. Let's practice a few affirmations or reminders you could tell yourself before engaging in social situations. What could they be?

User: Maybe something like, "I am interesting, and I can be myself" or "It's okay to be imperfect; everyone has awkward moments."

Consultant: Those are fantastic affirmations! Repeating them to yourself can help shift your mindset before social interactions. How do you feel about using these strategies in challenging situations moving forward?

User: It feels encouraging! I think they can help me build my confidence gradually.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Progress takes time, and your willingness to work on this is key. As we’re discussing enhancing your social skills and confidence, are there specific goals you want to set for yourself in upcoming events or situations?

User: I’d like to practice starting conversations more actively and maybe see if I can ask someone out for coffee. That feels like a big step!

Consultant: That’s a great goal, Dong! Starting conversations and taking that next step of inviting someone out is a wonderful way to challenge yourself. How do you envision preparing for these upcoming interactions?

User: I think I’ll write down some conversation starters and maybe visualize the scenarios before I actually do it. It could help clear my mind.

Consultant: Visualization and preparation are excellent strategies! They can help ease anxiety and boost your confidence. What specific topics or starters do you think you could use?

User: I could ask them about their interests or share something funny that happened to me. Keeping it light could help.

Consultant: Sounds like a solid plan! Light, playful topics can be great for breaking the ice. Are there any worries or concerns about these interactions that we haven't addressed yet?

User: I think I’ve covered most of it, but I sometimes fear rejection. It’s hard to handle.

Consultant: Rejection can be challenging, but it's also a part of life and social interaction. How do you currently cope with the fear of rejection?

User: I usually try to avoid situations where I might face it. But I know that's not the best approach.

Consultant: Avoidance is a common response, but facing those fears can often reduce their power over time. What if we explored ways to gradually expose yourself to those feelings of rejection in a safe manner?

User: That sounds tough, but I’m willing to try. Maybe starting small with less intimidating situations first?

Consultant: That’s a wise approach! We can create small goals where you engage in low-stakes interactions. This will give you a chance to practice and build resilience gradually. How does that sound?

User: It sounds manageable, definitely! I think small steps will help me feel less overwhelmed.

Consultant: Absolutely! With each small step, you'll gain more confidence and experience. As we wrap up our session, let’s reflect on the strategies we've discussed and how you plan to implement them in your social interactions moving forward.

User: I’ll use affirmations, practice conversation starters, and aim to invite someone out for coffee. I feel more equipped to handle these situations now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. I’m proud of your progress and confidence. You’re developing into a more socially engaged version of yourself! Looking forward to our next session to hear about your experiences and growth.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’m excited to share how things go!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Dong! Until next time, take care and keep practicing those new skills. You’ve got this!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Dong! I'm really pleased to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. My confidence in social situations has improved a lot. I can talk to girls without feeling as anxious as before.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Dong! It sounds like you’ve made some significant progress. Can you tell me more about what specific experiences have contributed to your improved confidence?

User: Well, I’ve been engaging more with my club members. Sharing ideas and participating in discussions has helped me feel more comfortable socially. I even went out for coffee with a few classmates!

Consultant: That’s excellent—those kinds of experiences can really boost your social skills. How did you feel during those conversations? Were there any moments where you felt particularly proud of yourself?

User: Yes! I felt more relaxed than I expected. There were moments when I initiated conversations, and it felt rewarding to see them respond positively.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you're taking the initiative. Building those connections can really enhance your overall experience. Now, looking ahead, what long-term goals do you have for your social life and studies?

User: I want to continue developing my social skills while balancing my academic work. I hope to connect with more people in my major and maybe even lead a group project.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Dong. Establishing connections in your field will definitely enhance your studies and help you grow. Let's talk about strategies to ensure you can achieve these goals. How do you feel about creating a structured plan for social interactions and study sessions?

User: I think having a plan sounds good. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed trying to manage everything at once, especially with assignments piling up.

Consultant: Absolutely, a structured approach can really help reduce that overwhelm. What if we break down your weekly tasks into manageable goals? For example, setting aside time for social activities and study sessions separately?

User: That could work! I often lose track of time when studying, so maybe scheduling specific social activities would help balance everything out.

Consultant: Great idea! It sounds like prioritizing your schedule can help you maintain balance. How about you aim for one social activity each week along with dedicated study hours? 

User: That seems achievable! I guess it will help me stay motivated in both areas.

Consultant: Exactly! Additionally, would it be beneficial to reflect on how each social interaction makes you feel? You might discover patterns that can guide you in future interactions.

User: I like that idea. Journaling my experiences could really help me understand myself better and build on my progress.

Consultant: Yes, journaling is a great tool! It allows you to note your feelings during social interactions and track your growth over time. What do you think might be your first entry after our session?

User: I think I’ll write about this conversation and how I feel about setting new goals. It helps to have a concrete plan to look forward to.

Consultant: That sounds like a beautiful way to start! Remember to celebrate the small wins as you go along. Is there anything else you feel you need support with as you progress?

User: I guess I'd just like to keep building my skills, especially in handling more challenging social situations.

Consultant: Understood. Facing challenging social situations can be daunting but also very rewarding. We can explore some techniques to approach those scenarios more confidently next time. How does that sound?

User: That sounds really helpful! I’m looking forward to it. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. As we conclude today, let’s recap your progress and plans. You've made great strides socially, and with your commitment to balance and reflection, you'll continue moving forward. 

User: Yes, I feel really good about the improvements I’ve made recently. 

Consultant: That's wonderful, Dong! You're doing an amazing job. If challenges arise, remember to apply the strategies we discussed. You’ve built a solid foundation. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! Keep up the great work, and remember you can always reach out if you need anything. This is our last session for now, but I believe you'll continue to flourish on your own.

User: I will! Thanks again for everything. 

Consultant: Take care, Dong! I'm confident you have everything you need to succeed. Goodbye!
