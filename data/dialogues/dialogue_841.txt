Consultant: Hello, I'm glad to see you here today. It sounds like you’ve been facing some challenges recently. Can you share more about what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been feeling really anxious and frustrated lately, especially after the argument I had with my roommate. It’s made my living situation really uncomfortable, and I find it hard to focus on my studies.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like the tension with your roommate is taking a toll on you and affecting your ability to concentrate on your studies. What thoughts come up for you when you think about that situation?

User: I often think that maybe they don't like me or that I'm a difficult person to live with. I feel like I'm always causing problems.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy. It's understandable that you would feel anxious with those kinds of beliefs. Can you tell me how those thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: I feel really down and anxious. It's like I can't escape this spiral of negativity. I used to be more confident, but now I just feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: It’s tough when those negative thoughts keep circling in your mind. Let’s explore them a bit further. When you say you're causing problems, do you remember specific instances that make you feel this way?

User: Well, during the argument, I raised my voice. I thought I was making a valid point, but I guess it just turned into a conflict. I keep playing that moment over and over in my head.

Consultant: It's clear that the argument has left a significant impact on you. When you replay that moment, what thoughts or beliefs come to the forefront for you?

User: I keep thinking that I shouldn't have said anything at all. Maybe if I had just stayed quiet, things wouldn't have escalated.

Consultant: So, it sounds like you believe that speaking up was a mistake. What evidence do you have that suggests staying quiet would have been a better choice? 

User: I guess it might have. But sometimes I feel like my opinions don't matter or that I'm just being a burden.

Consultant: I understand that feeling. It’s common to worry about being a burden, but let’s challenge that thought a bit. Can you think of any times when your input has been valued by others?

User: Well, there have been times in group projects where my ideas were appreciated. It makes me feel good when that happens, but they feel few and far between lately.

Consultant: It sounds like you do have value to bring to the table. Those moments of appreciation are important. Let’s consider how we can hold on to that perspective. If a friend were feeling like a burden, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has a right to express their thoughts and feelings. It’s part of being human.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re highlighting something really important. Everyone deserves to express themselves. How might you apply that understanding to your own situation with your roommate?

User: Maybe I need to communicate better and express my feelings without fear of conflict. It’s just daunting.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It can feel daunting, but taking small steps can help. What would be a small, manageable way to initiate a conversation with your roommate?

User: I could start by asking if we could sit down and talk things through calmly. I think sharing how I felt during the argument could help.

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive approach! Starting the conversation might not only give you a chance to express yourself but also create an opportunity for you both to understand each other better. How do you feel about attempting that?

User: I feel nervous but also a bit hopeful, like maybe things could improve if we talk.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about this! Hope is a powerful feeling. What steps can you take to prepare for that conversation?

User: I could write down what I want to say to make sure I stick to my points and don’t get too emotional.

Consultant: That's a solid plan! Writing can really help you organize your thoughts. Is there anything else you could do to support yourself emotionally before the conversation?

User: Maybe I could practice some deep breathing or even talk it out with someone I trust before I talk to my roommate.

Consultant: Those are both excellent strategies. Taking care of your emotional needs will help you feel more grounded during the conversation. As we wrap up today, what have you found most helpful in our discussion?

User: I think realizing that my feelings are valid and that I can communicate them better is really helpful. I feel like I have a plan now.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! You've made some significant insights today, and I believe you have the tools to move forward. Remember, open communication can make a big difference. If you run into challenges, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel a bit lighter now, and I’m looking forward to trying to improve things with my roommate.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It's been great working with you today. I look forward to hearing how your conversation goes next time we meet. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Dong! I'm glad you're here today. I understand you've been feeling quite frustrated with your social interactions lately. Can you tell me more about that?

User: Hi! Yes, I was really hoping to connect with my roommate, but when I tried to talk to her, she didn't seem interested at all. I felt really disappointed and a bit rejected.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It's understandable to feel disappointed when you reach out for connection and don’t get the response you hoped for. What specifically were you trying to talk to her about?

User: I just wanted to chat about our classes and maybe suggest studying together. I thought it might help us bond a bit more, but she didn't engage much.

Consultant: It makes sense that you wanted to form a connection through shared interests like studying. When you noticed her not being engaged, what thoughts went through your mind?

User: I started to think maybe she doesn’t like me, or that I'm not interesting enough to talk to. It's frustrating because I really want to make friends but keep hitting walls.

Consultant: Those thoughts are very understandable, especially after an interaction that didn't go as you hoped. It seems like you're feeling a mix of frustration and self-doubt. Let's explore those thoughts more. What evidence do you have that she doesn't like you?

User: Well, she didn't smile or ask any questions back, which made me feel like I was boring her.

Consultant: It's natural to conclude that based on her reactions, but do you think her lack of engagement could stem from something else, like maybe she was just preoccupied or tired?

User: That’s possible. I hadn’t thought of that. I guess there could be a lot going on that I’m not aware of.

Consultant: Exactly! Sometimes we can assume it's about us when there are other factors at play. If a friend of yours had the same situation, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them it’s not personal and to try again later.

Consultant: That’s a kind and supportive response! Remembering that perspective can be really helpful. Let’s think about how you can approach social interactions in a way that feels more comfortable for you. What are some small steps you could take to connect with others?

User: Maybe I could start with a simple hello or ask about something casual, like their plans for the weekend?

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Starting with light conversation can help ease the pressure. How would you feel about trying that with your roommate next time?

User: I think I could do that! It feels less intimidating than jumping into deeper topics.

Consultant: Wonderful! Keeping it light lowers the stakes, which can make it easier. What do you think might help you feel more confident in those moments?

User: I guess I need to remind myself that it’s okay if some conversations don’t go perfectly. Just trying is better than not trying at all.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! Remember, every interaction is a learning opportunity. How do you feel about setting some small social goals for yourself this week?

User: That sounds good! Maybe I could aim to talk to at least one person each day.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, Dong! Small steps lead to big changes. How will you keep track of your interactions and how they make you feel?

User: I could keep a journal. I used to do that, and it helped me reflect on my progress.

Consultant: A journal is an excellent way to monitor your feelings and experiences. Let’s plan to discuss how that goes next time. How do you feel about our conversation today?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful, actually. Talking it out makes things seem less daunting.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it's normal to feel nervous about socializing, but you’re actively working on it. What would be one takeaway from our session that you’d like to remember?

User: I want to remember that it’s okay if some people don’t engage back, and I will keep trying.

Consultant: That’s a solid takeaway! Keep that in mind as you move forward. I’m proud of you for being willing to put yourself out there. Our next session can focus on how those interactions go and any adjustments we can make. How does that sound?

User: Sounds great! I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: Me too, Dong! Keep practicing those skills and remember to be kind to yourself. You’re making progress! Take care until our next session.

Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit nervous. I tried to participate in some school activities, but my lack of confidence really held me back. I just want to feel comfortable in social settings.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. You’re wanting to build your confidence and engage in social activities without feeling anxious. Can you share what specific situations made you feel nervous recently?

User: I tried to join a club meeting last week, but I just couldn't bring myself to speak or even stay for long. I felt out of place and ended up leaving early.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience was really challenging for you. You had the intention to participate, but the feeling of being out of place made it tough. Could you tell me what thoughts crossed your mind when you were in that meeting?

User: I kept thinking that nobody would want to talk to me or that I would embarrass myself if I spoke up. It just felt overwhelming.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite heavy. It’s important to recognize how they affect your emotions. Can you identify how those thoughts made you feel at that moment?

User: I felt really anxious and a bit ashamed that I couldn't stay. It's frustrating because I want to socialize but just get stuck in my head.

Consultant: That frustration is understandable, especially when you have that desire to connect with others. Let’s look at those specific thoughts. Is there any evidence that supports the idea that others wouldn’t want to talk to you?

User: No, not really. I don’t know most of them, but I guess I just assumed they wouldn't be interested in me.

Consultant: It’s common to make those assumptions when feeling anxious. What would you say to a friend who felt this way about joining an activity?

User: I’d probably tell them to give it a try and that it's okay to feel nervous.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s okay to feel that way. Maybe we can work on changing your perspective. If you approach the next social situation with that same encouragement you would give to a friend, how might that change your experience?

User: Maybe I could be kinder to myself and let go of those harsh assumptions. I could think of it as just trying out and not a big deal.

Consultant: I love that idea! Looking at it as a trial rather than a pressure-filled situation can help ease some of that anxiety. Can we explore a small goal together that you might set for yourself for your next social event?

User: I think I could aim to stay for at least 30 minutes next time and maybe say hi to a few people.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic and achievable goal! It gives you a structured way to approach it without adding too much pressure. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Just having a goal like that makes me feel less overwhelmed.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we get closer to the event, it may be useful to remind yourself of that goal and your intention to connect with others. What strategies can you use to prepare for that situation?

User: I could practice some small talk beforehand or even make a few notes on what I could say.

Consultant: Practicing small talk sounds like a great strategy! It can help you feel more prepared and reduce anxiety. How would you feel about trying that in the days leading up to the event?

User: I think that would help a lot. I'll feel more ready if I have a few conversation starters.

Consultant: Absolutely! That sense of preparedness can make a big difference. After the event, we can discuss how it went and what you learned from the experience. Does that sound good to you?

User: Yes, I like that idea. I’ll feel like I have something to work towards and we can reflect on it together afterward.

Consultant: Definitely! Reflection is an important part of the process. How do you feel about your overall confidence to engage in social activities right now?

User: I feel a bit more confident. Just knowing that I have a plan gives me hope.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, progress might be gradual, but every step you take counts. You'll have the tools ready to face those situations, and I'm here to support you through it. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’m looking forward to applying what we talked about.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm proud of how you’re taking these steps. Keep that positive mindset, and we’ll continue building on this in our next session. 

User: Sounds good! I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: See you! Enjoy your week, and remember to be kind to yourself as you navigate these experiences.

Consultant: Hello, I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better actually. I participated in a group discussion recently, and I got some positive feedback when I shared my thoughts. It made me feel more confident about socializing, but I still have some worries.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear that you received positive feedback! It sounds like you're making progress with your confidence in social situations. Can you share what specific worries you still have about socializing?

User: Well, even though I felt good in that discussion, there's still a part of me that's afraid of being judged by others. I worry that I might say something silly, and everyone will think less of me.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to have those fears; many people experience similar thoughts. Let's explore that worry a bit more. When you think about the possibility of being judged, what kind of thoughts come to your mind?

User: I often think that if I make a mistake, people will laugh at me or think I'm not smart enough. I guess I just don't want to embarrass myself.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It seems like you're concerned about how others perceive you, which can be really challenging. Let's consider this: how true do you think those thoughts are? Is there evidence that supports or contradicts them?

User: I guess I don't have any solid evidence. Most people were actually kind during that discussion, and no one laughed at me. But I still fear it could happen next time.

Consultant: It sounds like you're already beginning to challenge those thoughts by recognizing that the evidence doesn't support your fears. If a friend were in your position, feeling worried about being judged, what would you advise them to think or do?

User: I would probably tell them not to worry so much and that it's okay to make mistakes. Everyone has their moments, right?

Consultant: Exactly! Everyone makes mistakes, and it's part of being human. Instead of focusing on a potential negative outcome, we can shift the focus to the experience of sharing and learning together. How do you feel about using that perspective the next time you're in a social situation?

User: I think that could help a lot. If I remind myself that it's okay to mess up, I might feel less pressure.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It sounds like you're open to trying a different mindset. What are some small steps you can take to practice this new way of thinking in your next social interaction?

User: Maybe I could start by just reminding myself to enjoy the conversation and not worry about what others think. I could tell myself that mistakes are normal.

Consultant: Yes, that sounds like an excellent approach! Enjoying the conversation can help you feel more relaxed. How about we also think of a few specific affirmations or phrases you can say to yourself to reinforce this positive mindset before engaging with others?

User: I could say something like, “It's okay to be myself” or “I'm here to share my thoughts and learn from others.”

Consultant: Those are wonderful affirmations! Repeating those can help calm your nerves and encourage you to engage more openly. How will you remind yourself to use these affirmations before your next social situation?

User: I could write them down in my planner or even put a note on my phone as a reminder.

Consultant: That's a practical and effective strategy! Using reminders can help reinforce your commitment to this new mindset. As we wrap up today’s session, what are your thoughts on the progress you've made so far?

User: I feel like I'm in a better place than before. Even though I still have some worries, I'm more willing to confront them instead of letting them hold me back.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! It's great to see you acknowledging your growth while still being aware that there's more to work on. Remember, it’s all part of the journey. For our next session, let’s discuss any experiences you have with applying these strategies. What do you think?

User: That sounds perfect! I'm looking forward to sharing how it goes.

Consultant: I look forward to hearing about your experiences too. You've done really well today. Just keep in mind that every step you take is progress. See you next time!

User: Thank you! See you then!

Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you again! I remember we were discussing your upcoming social gathering and your feelings around it. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been okay, but I still feel a bit anxious about going to that party. I’m worried about being isolated again, but I also want to enjoy the experience.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel anxious about social situations, especially when there’s a fear of isolation. Let’s explore those feelings together. Can you share what specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about attending the party?

User: I keep thinking that everyone will have fun without me, and I won't be able to connect with them. I fear that I'll just sit there and feel out of place.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing some negative thoughts about the event. These thoughts might be making you feel even more anxious. How do these thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: They make me feel really down and overwhelmed. I wish I could just go and have a good time like everyone else.

Consultant: That desire for a positive experience is important. Let’s break this down. You mentioned thinking that you might feel out of place. What evidence do you have that this will happen? Can you think of any times when you've felt more comfortable in social situations?

User: Well, there were a few times when I did manage to talk with someone and had fun, but they feel like rare occasions. Most of the time, I struggle to join in.

Consultant: It’s great that you have those positive experiences to draw from, even if they feel rare. What if we tried to think about what you did during those moments that made you feel comfortable? Maybe we can identify some strategies you can use at the party.

User: I remember trying to ask questions or sharing something funny. It helped me feel less anxious.

Consultant: Asking questions and sharing funny stories can definitely help break the ice. How about we role-play a few scenarios where you practice those moments? This could build your confidence for the party.

User: That sounds helpful! I think practicing could really help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s imagine you’re at the party. A group is talking about a TV show that you enjoy. How would you jump into that conversation?

User: I could say something like, "Have you guys seen the latest episode of that show? I thought it was amazing!"

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start! It shows your interest and invites others to engage. How might you feel after making that comment?

User: If they responded well, I think I'd feel more included and maybe even excited.

Consultant: Exactly! Engaging like that can create a connection and help reduce feelings of isolation. Now, let’s think about how you could handle if the response isn’t what you hoped for. How would you cope with that situation?

User: I guess I could just change the subject or ask someone else about their interests. I shouldn't take it too personally.

Consultant: Yes, that’s a healthy perspective! Focusing on the larger group can help you stay involved. If you encounter a less enthusiastic response, reminding yourself that it’s not a reflection of you might make it easier to move on. 

User: I like that idea. It makes it feel less daunting.

Consultant: Great! Let’s also establish a calming technique you can use before and during the party. What’s something that helps you feel more relaxed?

User: Listening to music usually calms me down.

Consultant: Perfect! Listening to your favorite music can set a positive mood before heading out. You might consider creating a playlist just for this occasion. How do you feel about that?

User: I love that idea! I'll definitely make one.

Consultant: Awesome! You'll have a tool to uplift your mood on the way to the party. Lastly, what is one goal you’d like to set for yourself for this social event?

User: I want to try to initiate at least one conversation, even if it's just to say “hi.”

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal—simple yet effective! Starting with a friendly greeting can pave the way for more interactions. How do you feel about working towards that?

User: I feel excited! It seems achievable.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, let’s review what you’ve learned and how you plan to implement these strategies at the party. 

User: I’ll remember to ask questions, share funny stories, listen to music beforehand, and aim for initiating one conversation.

Consultant: Exactly! Those are solid strategies. I believe you'll do great at the gathering. Remember, it's a step-by-step process, and you can always come back if you need more support. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel much more prepared now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of your progress today. Good luck, and I look forward to hearing how it went in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Duan! It's great to see you for today's session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite good, actually. After that conversation with my roommate, I felt really comfortable and enjoyed the time spent together.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like that interaction helped boost your confidence. Can you share more about what made that conversation enjoyable for you?

User: Well, we talked about our favorite shows and shared some funny stories. It felt nice to laugh and connect. I didn’t feel as anxious about speaking up.

Consultant: It seems that the experience brought you some joy and a sense of connection. How do you think this newfound confidence has impacted your daily life?

User: I think it has made me more open to speaking with others. I was usually the quiet one, but now I feel more willing to join in on conversations.

Consultant: That’s a significant improvement! It’s great that you're opening up more. What specific situations do you feel most comfortable in now compared to before?

User: I feel more at ease in group settings, like during group study sessions or meal times. I used to just listen, but now I find myself participating more.

Consultant: That's fantastic! Taking part in those situations is essential for building relationships. What do you think contributed to this change in behavior?

User: I guess gaining some positive experiences really helped. Plus, I remind myself that it's okay to share my thoughts and not worry too much about what others think.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset! It’s important to recognize that everyone has their thoughts to contribute. Have you encountered any challenges while trying to maintain this new confidence?

User: Sometimes, I still feel a bit nervous before starting a conversation, especially with people I don’t know very well. But I’m working on it.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous in new situations. What strategies are you considering to help manage those feelings when they arise?

User: I try to take a few deep breaths and remind myself of the good conversations I've had. It sometimes works, but other times I still freeze up.

Consultant: Breathing techniques can be very helpful! We can also explore some other approaches together. Would you like to try to challenge those anxious thoughts when they come up?

User: That sounds good! Sometimes I catch myself thinking things like, "What if they don't like me?" 

Consultant: That’s a common fear. Let's look at this thought more closely. What evidence do you have that supports this belief, and is there any evidence against it?

User: Well, I guess my roommate really enjoyed talking with me, so that counters the idea. But I still sometimes think the worst will happen.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s great that you could identify that positive experience. Let's examine this further. If you were to advise a friend who felt this way, what would you suggest?

User: I think I would tell them to focus on the good experiences and to just give it a try instead of overthinking. 

Consultant: That’s wise advice! Now you can apply this to yourself. Visualizing past positive experiences can help reduce anxiety. Can you think of a specific situation where you could challenge this thought in the future?

User: Maybe when I'm in a class discussion next week. I could remind myself of the fun conversation I had with my roommate.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Remembering past successes can empower you. What other activities or situations would you like to try to further your social skills?

User: I might join a club or attend more social events. It feels good to be around others and share interests.

Consultant: Joining groups is a great way to practice social skills! It’ll also let you meet like-minded individuals. What are some clubs or events you’re interested in?

User: I’m interested in joining a book club or a cooking class. I love both reading and cooking!

Consultant: Those sound like fantastic options! Engaging in activities you enjoy can make it easier to connect with people. How does that make you feel thinking about these possibilities?

User: I feel excited! But there's still a little bit of nervousness about meeting new people.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a mix of excitement and nerves. Embracing that anxiety by seeing it as a natural part of the process can be helpful. How would you plan to manage those nerves when you start meeting new people?

User: I could practice starting conversations. Maybe I could think of a few questions or topics beforehand to mention.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach. Having a few conversation starters in mind can ease some anxiety. Would you like to brainstorm some ideas together now?

User: Yes, please! That would be really helpful.

Consultant: Great! Topics like favorite books, recent movies, or cooking tips are excellent starters. Which ones resonate the most with you?

User: I think talking about favorite books could work well since I’m really passionate about them.

Consultant: Excellent choice! Discussing something you’re passionate about can help spark lively conversations. Do you feel ready to implement these strategies during your next social gathering?

User: Yes, I feel more prepared now! I appreciate all the help.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Duan! Today, we’ve identified many positive changes and strategies you can use moving forward. Remember to celebrate your progress. How are you feeling about our session today?

User: I feel really positive! I look forward to trying out these new ideas.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Keep building on your successes, and remember, it's okay to take things step by step. When you're ready to check in again, I’ll be here for you. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel like I have clear steps to work on, and I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It has been a pleasure working together. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
