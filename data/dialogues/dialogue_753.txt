Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you’re here for today’s session. I want to check in with you about how you've been feeling lately. Can you share a bit about what's been going on?

User: Hi. I’ve been really struggling since my boyfriend broke up with me a couple of months ago. I feel so lost, and I can’t stop thinking about it. I’ve been feeling really down, not sleeping well, and I just don’t have any appetite. Everything feels meaningless.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that you’ve been feeling this way. It sounds overwhelming. You mentioned a lack of sleep and appetite—how has that been affecting your daily life and responsibilities?

User: I can’t concentrate on my studies at all. I sit at my desk, but my mind just wanders. I feel guilty for not being able to focus, which only makes me feel worse.

Consultant: It makes sense that you'd feel guilty when you're struggling to concentrate. It’s common for emotions to really take a toll on our ability to focus. Let’s explore that a bit more. Can you tell me what thoughts come to your mind when you try to study?

User: I keep thinking that I’m a failure, that I won’t be able to achieve anything in my life. I compare myself to my friends who seem to be moving on and doing well.

Consultant: Those comparisons can be really tough. It sounds like you're being quite hard on yourself. When you think you're a failure, how does that make you feel emotionally?

User: It makes me feel even more depressed and anxious. Like, why can’t I just be happy like everyone else? I start feeling hopeless and think maybe I just won't be able to finish my studies.

Consultant: Feeling hopeless can create a heavy burden. Let's challenge that thought for a moment. What evidence do you have to support the idea that you won’t finish your studies? Are there examples from your past that contradict this?

User: Well, I guess I’ve done well in school before. I just feel like I’m not good enough right now.

Consultant: It’s important to recognize that past achievements don’t disappear just because you’re experiencing a tough time. Everyone faces setbacks. What do you think might help you remember your strengths during this time?

User: Maybe I could make a list of things I’ve accomplished in the past? That could remind me of what I’m capable of.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Creating a list can help reframe your thoughts about yourself. Alongside that, are there any small activities you could try that might help lift your mood or get you back into a studying routine?

User: I haven't really done anything enjoyable lately. I guess I could try going for a walk or something. Fresh air might help.

Consultant: Definitely! Fresh air can be revitalizing. How about setting a small goal for yourself, like taking a 10-minute walk each day? That can serve as a great starting point to improve your mood.

User: Yeah, that sounds doable. I think I could manage 10 minutes.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s check in on your feelings over the next week. How do you feel about making a plan to share how those walks impact your mood when we meet again?

User: I can do that. I hope it helps. I’ll try to notice how I feel afterward.

Consultant: That's a great approach! Noticing your feelings after those walks will help you gain insight. Also, it’s important to remember that it’s okay to feel what you're feeling right now. This situation doesn’t define your value or your future.

User: I keep telling myself that, but it’s hard to believe. Sometimes I think I just want to give up.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way during such a challenging time. Let’s work together on recognizing those thoughts of giving up as signals to pause and check in with yourself. What would you tell a friend if they felt this way?

User: I would tell them it’s okay to feel sad, but to not give up and that things will eventually get better. 

Consultant: That’s kind and supportive advice! You deserve that same compassion. Let's focus on practicing that self-kindness for you. What are the steps we can take to remind you to be gentle with yourself during this process?

User: I guess I could set reminders on my phone to take breaks and do something nice for myself. 

Consultant: That sounds like an effective and practical strategy! Self-care is crucial during challenging times. How about we explore some activities you enjoy or find relaxing to include in those breaks?

User: I like listening to music and watching movies. Maybe I can set aside time for that.

Consultant: That’s great! Atmospheres created by music and movies can be uplifting. Let’s make that part of your daily routine. What’s one movie you’ve been wanting to watch that you could set as a reward for your study efforts?

User: I really want to watch that new romantic comedy everyone is talking about. I could watch that after completing my study goals for the day.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful reward to look forward to! Balancing work and enjoyable activities can help you stay motivated. I believe you can find a rhythm that works for you.

User: I hope so. When I talk about it, it sounds achievable, but it’s still hard to put into practice.

Consultant: Change comes step by step, and it’s okay to have mixed feelings. Every small effort counts, and over time, things will get easier. We’ll explore your progress together and adjust as needed.

User: Thank you for understanding. I feel like talking about this helps, even if it’s hard to do.

Consultant: I’m here for you, and it’s completely normal to have difficulty discussing these feelings. It takes time to work through emotions. As we prepare to wrap up today’s session, what are some key takeaways you’d like to focus on?

User: I want to remember to be kinder to myself and to try to keep up with those small goals like walking and taking breaks.

Consultant: Those are essential takeaways! You’re already making progress just by acknowledging these steps. Next time, we’ll check in on how implementing those strategies has been for you. Remember, it's a journey, and I’m here every step of the way.

User: Thank you so much. I feel a bit lighter now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s continue this progress together. If you need anything in between sessions, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care until we meet again!

Consultant: Hello, Song! I’m glad you’re here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi, I've been trying to cope with the breakup, but it's been really tough. I still feel quite low and struggle to get back into my studies.

Consultant: It's completely understandable that you're feeling this way after such a significant event. Could you share with me more about what specifically has been challenging for you lately?

User: Well, I've been having a hard time concentrating. Sometimes I just zone out and can't focus on my studies. I feel like I'm not making any progress, and that makes me feel even worse.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling stuck and frustrated, which is reasonable given the recent changes in your life. Can we explore what thoughts come to your mind when you find yourself zoning out while studying? 

User: When I zone out, I often think that I'm not good enough or that I will never catch up with my peers. That thought makes me feel more anxious and helpless.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Song. It seems like those thoughts of not being good enough are really weighing heavily on you. Let's try to break that down a bit. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you are not good enough? 

User: I don't know... maybe it's just how I feel when I see my classmates doing better. They seem to handle everything without any struggle.

Consultant: That’s a common thought pattern—comparing ourselves to others. However, it’s worth considering that we often don’t see the challenges others face. If a friend were feeling this way, what would you say to support them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has their own pace, and it's okay to struggle sometimes.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s easier to show kindness to others. Let’s apply that same understanding to yourself. Can you try to reframe that thought about not being good enough to something gentler, perhaps acknowledging that it’s okay to have ups and downs?

User: I guess I could think, “It’s okay to struggle right now, and I can still improve.” 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful shift in perspective, Song! Recognizing that it’s okay to have difficulties is an important step. Now, how about your daily activities—have you tried engaging in anything that used to make you happy or bring you joy?

User: I haven’t felt like doing much lately. I used to enjoy painting, but even that feels pointless now.

Consultant: I hear you; it’s natural to lose interest in things we used to enjoy when we’re feeling down. However, what if we set a small goal regarding your painting? Perhaps starting with just a few minutes a day could help bring some joy back. 

User: I suppose I could try that. Just a few minutes doesn’t sound too overwhelming.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! It’s about making small steps that feel manageable. How does it feel to think about incorporating just a little bit of painting back into your routine?

User: It feels a bit encouraging, actually. Maybe I can reconnect with that part of myself.

Consultant: That's great to hear! Let’s also think about the study routine. During this time, how can you structure your studying to make it feel less daunting? 

User: Maybe I can break my study sessions into shorter intervals so it’s not as overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Shorter study sessions can help keep you focused without feeling burnt out. How about you combine that with some breaks, giving yourself some time to recharge? 

User: Yes, that sounds reasonable. I like the idea of mixing study time with little breaks.

Consultant: Fantastic! Implementing breaks can really help improve your focus. As we work on these new strategies, how do you feel about setting some weekly goals for yourself in terms of both studying and painting?

User: Creating weekly goals sounds helpful. I think it can give me something to look forward to and help me track my progress.

Consultant: Definitely! Let’s outline some specific goals together. For instance, how many painting sessions do you think you could manage this week, along with your study goals?

User: I’d like to aim for at least two painting sessions and try studying for about three days this week for shorter periods.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals, Song! They feel achievable and balanced. How will you hold yourself accountable for these plans?

User: I think I can write them down and check them off as I go. It keeps me motivated.

Consultant: Writing them down is a fantastic idea! It gives you a visual reminder of your goals and accomplishments. Now, let's talk about how we can handle any moments of self-doubt that may arise while pursuing these goals.

User: When I doubt myself, I tend to freeze and do nothing. 

Consultant: That’s understandable. A way to combat that is to have a brief mantra or reminder to tell yourself in those moments. Would something like, "I’m making progress, even if it feels slow," resonate with you?

User: Yes, I could definitely use something like that to push through doubt.

Consultant: Perfect! Keeping that in mind during challenging moments can help shift your focus back to your progress. Let’s take a moment to acknowledge how far you’ve come so far. What do you feel has been your biggest takeaway from our sessions?

User: I think I’ve learned that it’s okay to feel how I feel and that I can still take small steps forward.

Consultant: Absolutely! Embracing your feelings while taking small, manageable steps is key. As we wrap up today, let’s also talk about how you can continue building your self-worth and coping with external judgments. How does that sound?

User: Sounds good. I think I need to work on how I feel about myself, especially when comparing to others.

Consultant: Comparisons can be quite challenging, but we can develop strategies to reinforce your self-worth. You might consider keeping a journal where you celebrate your achievements, no matter how small.

User: I love that idea! Focusing on my achievements could really boost my confidence.

Consultant: I believe so too! It’s been really encouraging to see your mindset shifting during our time together. Remember, it's a journey, and it's okay to take your time. If you ever feel overwhelmed, keep our strategies in mind.

User: Thank you! This has been really helpful. I’ll definitely keep everything in mind.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Song! You’ve made wonderful progress today. Just remember, you have the ability to navigate through these feelings. If you need support in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: I will. Thank you again for the support!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care of yourself, and I look forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Song! I'm glad you could join me today. I’d love to hear how you've been feeling since our last session. 

User: Hi! I've been trying to participate more in social activities, but I still feel really sensitive to what others think of me. It's like their negative comments really shake me up, and I can't help but feel down.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're making an effort to engage socially. I can understand how difficult it must be to deal with those sensitive feelings towards others' opinions. Can you tell me more about a recent situation where you felt particularly affected by someone's comment? 

User: Last week, I went to a gathering with friends. Someone jokingly said that I was too serious all the time. Even though I tried to laugh it off, I felt really embarrassed and ended up feeling bad for the rest of the night.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. You tried to brush it off, but it still impacted your mood. How did you cope with those feelings afterward? 

User: I just went home and isolated myself. I turned off my phone and didn’t talk to anyone for a couple of days. It felt like I wanted to hide from the world.

Consultant: Hiding from the world can feel like a safe option when those feelings become overwhelming. Let's explore those feelings a bit deeper. When that comment was made, what thoughts went through your mind? 

User: I immediately thought that maybe they really don’t like me, or that I'm not fun to be around. It reinforced my belief that people see me as boring.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like that comment triggered some strong negative beliefs about yourself. What if we tried to challenge those thoughts? Can we find any evidence that counters the idea that you're boring or unlikable? 

User: Well, my other friends often invite me to join them, so maybe they don't think I'm boring... But it’s hard to shake that feeling off when someone says something like that. 

Consultant: That's a good point. Your friends' invitations reflect that they enjoy your company. It's understandable that a negative comment could overshadow that perception. How about we consider other perspectives? If a friend felt hurt by a similar comment, what would you say to them? 

User: I'd probably tell them that one comment doesn’t define who they are and that they're loved for their personality. 

Consultant: Exactly! You observed how you would be supportive of a friend in that situation. Perhaps, it may be worthwhile to apply that same kindness to yourself. How might you reframe that negative comment using a more compassionate perspective? 

User: I could remind myself that I am more than just one comment and that people have mixed opinions. I’ve been working on being more social, and that’s a step in the right direction.

Consultant: That's a wonderful reframe! Recognizing the effort you have put into being social is key to building a more positive self-image. Since making these connections is important, let's discuss strategies you can use next time you encounter a triggering comment. 

User: I think I could try to remind myself of my worth and not let one comment get to me as much. Maybe I could even ask friends for reassurance when I feel that way.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Having a safety net in your friends can be quite empowering. Moving forward, what other coping strategies could you put in place to maintain your emotional balance in such situations? 

User: Maybe I could practice some mindfulness techniques or deep breathing to help me calm down when I feel triggered. 

Consultant: Mindfulness and deep breathing are excellent tools! They can help ground you and reduce anxiety in the moment. Have you tried any mindfulness techniques before?

User: A little, but I’m not sure I practice them consistently. 

Consultant: Consistency is key! We can integrate mindfulness techniques into your daily routine. How about starting with just a few minutes every day and building from there? 

User: That sounds manageable. I could set reminders on my phone to practice it regularly. 

Consultant: Perfect! Regular practice can significantly impact your emotional resilience. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. As we wrap up for today, let’s revisit your gains so far. What achievements are you most proud of since we started working together? 

User: I feel like I’ve become more aware of my thoughts and emotions. It still feels hard, but I’m starting to learn how to manage them better.

Consultant: That’s huge progress! Acknowledging your awareness and commitment to improvement is a significant step. Looking ahead, how can you continue to reinforce your self-worth and cope with others’ feedback?

User: I’ll try to remind myself of past positive experiences and focus on the things about myself that I value. 

Consultant: That’s a great approach! You value your qualities and experiences. I believe you'll continue to grow in your understanding of yourself. Remember, I’m here for you whenever you need support. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate the help and feel a bit more hopeful now. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad to hear that you feel more hopeful. Just remember that healing is a journey, and every small step counts. Take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially after the recent positive feedback from your community activity?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better, actually. The feedback really boosted my mood, but I still find myself getting lost in thought sometimes and doubting my worth.

Consultant: It sounds like the positive feedback was uplifting, which is great! However, the lingering feelings of doubt can be challenging. Can you share more about the thoughts that come up when you start to doubt yourself?

User: Well, I often think that I'm not good enough or that others are better than me. It’s frustrating because I want to feel secure about my worth, especially after receiving compliments.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It’s completely normal to have those thoughts, but they can be so hard to deal with. How do those thoughts make you feel when they arise?

User: They make me feel anxious and sad. Sometimes I just want to avoid social situations because I feel like I’ll embarrass myself.

Consultant: It seems like those thoughts can really hold you back from enjoying social interactions. Let’s explore this together. Can you recall a specific situation recently where you felt this way?

User: I went to a gathering last week, and even though people were nice to me, I felt out of place and kept thinking that I didn’t belong there.

Consultant: It sounds tough to feel out of place in a gathering, especially when others are being kind to you. What thoughts were running through your mind at that moment?

User: I kept thinking that everyone was judging me and that I was just pretending to fit in. I felt like a fraud.

Consultant: That’s a really heavy feeling to carry. Sometimes we can be our own harshest critics. Looking at that moment, do you think there was any evidence that supported the idea that others were judging you?

User: Not really. I mean, no one said anything negative, but I couldn’t shake the feeling.

Consultant: It’s interesting how our perceptions can shape our experiences. What if we reframed that thought? What might you tell a friend who felt the same way in a similar situation?

User: I would probably tell them that they are valued and that people appreciate their presence.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate response! So, why not apply that same logic to yourself? You are worthy of being in those social settings. Let’s think of some activities that affirm this belief. What are some things you enjoy doing or would like to try that could boost your self-esteem further?

User: I used to love painting but haven’t done it in a while. I think I could start doing that again.

Consultant: Painting sounds like a wonderful way to express yourself! It could also serve as a reminder of your talents and interests. How might incorporating painting into your routine help reinforce your self-worth?

User: I think it would help me feel more connected to my creative side and distract me from negative thoughts.

Consultant: Perfect! Engaging in activities you love can create a positive emotional foundation. How about we set a goal? How often could you try to paint each week?

User: I could probably fit in some time on the weekends—maybe two to three sessions?

Consultant: That sounds very achievable! Let’s commit to that for this week. After each painting session, I invite you to write down how you felt during and after. This reflection can help reinforce the positive impact of the activity.

User: That makes sense. I’m actually looking forward to it!

Consultant: I’m happy to hear that! Remember, it’s about celebrating those small victories. As we continue, how else can we ensure you maintain this positive shift? What strategies do you think could help?

User: I think maybe reminding myself of the compliments I received from the community service could help reinforce how others see me.

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping a list of affirmations or positive feedback can serve as a powerful reminder of your worth. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds really good! I feel like it will help me shift my mindset.

Consultant: Great! You’re already taking proactive steps, which is fantastic. As we move forward, I encourage you to practice being mindful when those self-doubting thoughts arise. How do you feel about being more aware of your thought patterns this week?

User: I feel more confident about it. I will try to notice those thoughts and replace them with positive ones.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset! Remember, it’s a practice, and it’s okay to have ups and downs along the way. Would you like to set a few specific goals for the upcoming week to help maintain this momentum?

User: Yes! Besides painting, I want to remind myself to reflect on the positive feedback daily, like keeping that list.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! It’s all about reinforcing those positive experiences. Before we wrap up, let’s summarize what you’ll focus on this week.

User: I’ll paint two to three times, keep a list of compliments, and practice noticing and changing my negative thoughts.

Consultant: Sounds perfect! I believe these steps will help strengthen the positive self-image you’ve been building. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. I’m really proud of you for taking these steps.

User: Thank you! I feel more motivated now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m excited to hear about your progress next time. Keep shining, and I look forward to seeing how this week goes for you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Song! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident, especially with my studies. My professor praised my recent work, which really boosted my self-esteem. But I’m still grappling with the aftermath of my breakup.

Consultant: It’s great to hear about the progress you’re making in your studies! That praise must have felt rewarding. Regarding your breakup, can you share more about how you’ve been coping with your feelings since then?

User: Well, I’ve been trying to focus on my studies to keep my mind off things, but sometimes I still feel sad and distracted. It’s hard to fully concentrate.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re putting in a lot of effort to redirect your focus, which is positive. When those feelings of sadness arise, what thoughts or images come to your mind that perhaps distract you from your studies?

User: I often think about the happy moments we had together and that makes me feel lonely now. I can’t help but think about what went wrong between us.

Consultant: Those memories can indeed evoke strong emotions. Let’s take a moment to explore those thoughts—what specifically do you feel when these memories come up? How do they influence your mood and your ability to study?

User: I feel a mix of nostalgia and regret. Sometimes it makes me want to shut down and just do nothing. Other times, I feel more motivated to succeed, as if I want to prove something to myself.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel pulled in different directions by those emotions. It seems there’s a part of you that wants to transform that sadness into motivation. Would it be helpful to look at ways you can translate those feelings into something constructive for your studies?

User: Yes, I’d really like that. I want to make sure I keep my progress up and not let my emotions drag me down.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! Let’s talk about some short-term goals you can set for your studies. What are some specific objectives you would like to achieve in the coming weeks that can keep you focused and motivated?

User: I have a few projects coming up, and I want to make sure I allocate enough time for each. Maybe I can aim to complete one project well before the deadline so I can relax a bit afterward.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan! Completing projects ahead of time can alleviate some stress. How about we break down that goal into manageable steps? What would your first step be to get started on your first project?

User: I think I should draft an outline and gather my resources—that way, I can see what I’ll need to accomplish.

Consultant: Great! Creating an outline is a solid starting point. How do you feel when you think about taking that first step?

User: I feel a bit excited, actually. It would be good to have a clearer picture of what I'm working on.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Excitement can be a great motivator. As you work on this plan, remember to acknowledge and celebrate small milestones. How would you feel about setting up mini rewards for each stage you complete?

User: I love that idea! Maybe I can treat myself to something nice or take a break once I finish a section.

Consultant: Absolutely! Rewarding yourself is an excellent way to reinforce positive behaviors. Speaking of rewards, what activity do you enjoy the most that could serve as a nice break for you?

User: I really enjoy painting. It helps me unwind and express my feelings.

Consultant: Painting sounds like a fantastic outlet for you! How about incorporating some painting into your study breaks as a reward for completing your project steps?

User: That would be perfect! It gives me something to look forward to when I finish my work.

Consultant: I’m glad that resonates with you. It’s essential to find balance between work and relaxation. Moving forward, as you continue to focus on your studies and integrate painting, how do you envision handling those moments of sadness about your breakup?

User: I think if I keep my studies on track and make time for painting, it might help lessen the sadness. I’ll have more positive things to focus on.

Consultant: That's a wise perspective! Engaging in activities that nurture your passions could indeed provide a healthy distraction. Let’s also reflect on your support systems—who in your life can you lean on when you need encouragement or to talk about your feelings?

User: I have my family and friends who are supportive. I can always talk to my twin sister; she understands me well.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Having supportive people around you can be a tremendous help. By reaching out to your sister, you can share both your triumphs in studies and any struggles you’re facing emotionally. How might you feel about doing that more frequently?

User: I think it would be really helpful. I’ve been a bit reserved about sharing my feelings, but it’s probably better to open up.

Consultant: Sharing your feelings can indeed lead to deeper connections and support. It sounds like you’re on a good path towards both academic success and emotional healing. As we approach the end of our session today, how do you feel about the goals we’ve discussed?

User: I feel motivated to put those ideas into practice! Setting small goals and allowing myself breaks seems manageable. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It looks like you have a plan in place that can lead to both academic achievement and emotional balance. As we wrap up today, let’s briefly reflect on what you’ve learned about yourself and your goals during this session.

User: I’ve realized that I can channel my feelings into something productive. Setting small goals and using my painting as a reward can help me stay positive.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight, and I’m proud of your progress! Remember, if you ever feel overwhelmed or need support, reaching out is always a good idea. Our next session can focus on how you've implemented these strategies and any new challenges you face. What are your thoughts?

User: I’m looking forward to it! I feel more equipped to handle everything now.

Consultant: Excellent! Keep up the good work, and I can’t wait to hear about your progress next time. Take care, and until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Song! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I think I've been feeling much better, especially after the family gathering. Being around my family really helped me. I'm still reflecting on some things, though.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Family connections can have such a positive impact. What specific reflections do you have in mind that you would like to discuss today?

User: Well, I was thinking about how much I've struggled with my self-esteem in the past. Despite feeling better now, some of those old feelings still linger.

Consultant: It’s completely normal for those feelings to surface, even when we're feeling more positive overall. Let’s explore this further—what specific thoughts about yourself do you find coming up?

User: I often think I’m not good enough, especially when I see my peers succeeding. I tend to minimize my achievements, blaming others for my past issues.

Consultant: It sounds like you might still be holding onto some negative beliefs about your worth and accomplishments. How do those beliefs make you feel on a day-to-day basis?

User: They make me feel insecure and sometimes really overwhelmed. It's hard to celebrate my successes because I always find a way to downplay them.

Consultant: I can see how that would be frustrating. Let’s try to identify these negative thoughts more clearly. Can you recall a specific moment recently when you felt this way about your achievements?

User: Sure, the other day I completed a significant project for school, but instead of feeling proud, I kept thinking that it wasn’t as good as what others did. 

Consultant: That sentiment of not measuring up can be particularly challenging. What emotions did you experience when that thought crossed your mind?

User: I felt anxious and a bit useless, like I didn’t deserve any praise for my work. 

Consultant: Those feelings are tough to navigate. When you think about your project, do you think there's any evidence to support the idea that it wasn't good enough?

User: I guess not really. I received positive feedback from my professors, but I still focus on the negatives.

Consultant: It’s essential to recognize that feedback. If a friend came to you with the same experience, what would you advise them regarding their feelings of inadequacy?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on their hard work and appreciate their progress rather than comparing themselves to others.

Consultant: That’s great advice! How might you apply that same compassion to your own situation?

User: I need to remind myself of my hard work and the effort I put in, rather than just focusing on how others perform.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s work on that together. Can we come up with some affirmations or reminders that you can use to reinforce this mindset?

User: Maybe something like "I am proud of what I achieve, and my work is valuable." 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful affirmation! How do you feel about using that when you sense self-doubt creeping in?

User: I think it could really help, especially if I remind myself of specific accomplishments when I say it.

Consultant: That's a fantastic approach! Let's also talk about how we can ensure this progress continues. What goals do you see for yourself in the coming months?

User: I want to keep building my confidence, maybe by taking on more challenging projects or being more involved in group activities at school.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent goals! Involving yourself more could provide opportunities to celebrate your strengths and achievements. How do you envision starting with this plan?

User: I could aim to participate in a club or take on a leadership role in a group project. I think that would help push me out of my comfort zone.

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive strategy! Setting small, manageable steps will help. How about we outline what your first step might be?
