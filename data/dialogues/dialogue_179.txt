Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today's session. Before we start, I’d love to know how you’ve been feeling recently. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hello! I've been really anxious lately, especially with the end-of-term exams approaching and the pressure to find an internship. It feels overwhelming, and I’m struggling to focus on my studies and applications.

Consultant: It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of pressure from your exams and the internship process. That can definitely feel overwhelming. Can you tell me more about how this anxiety is affecting your daily life?

User: Well, I’ve been having trouble sleeping and I'm not eating well. I can’t seem to concentrate on my studies, and sometimes I just feel completely lost. 

Consultant: I can see how difficult that must be for you—feeling lost and unable to focus while having so many responsibilities. Let’s explore your feelings a bit more. What thoughts are going through your mind when you try to study or work on your internship applications?

User: I keep thinking that I won’t do well in my exams or that I’ll fail to get an internship. Sometimes I feel like I’m not good enough and that I’m letting my family down.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy to carry. It’s understandable that you'd feel anxious when facing such high expectations. Let’s take a moment to examine these thoughts. How true do you think they really are? Is there any evidence that supports or contradicts these beliefs? 

User: I guess I have done well in my studies so far, and I have received positive feedback before. But the fear of failing feels very real right now.

Consultant: It seems like there’s a conflict between your accomplishments and the fear of not meeting expectations. When you experience this fear of failure, what emotions does it bring up for you? 

User: I feel really stressed and worthless, like I’m not capable of handling anything. It's exhausting.

Consultant: That sounds very challenging. Feeling stressed and worthless can take a toll on your mental well-being. During this stressful time, have you found any ways to cope or relax?

User: Not really. I used to enjoy playing video games or hanging out with friends, but I’ve lost interest in those things lately.

Consultant: Losing interest in activities you once enjoyed can be a sign of the stress you're under. It might help us to think about incorporating some small enjoyable activities back into your routine. What do you think about setting aside some time, even briefly, for something you used to like?

User: It does sound nice, but I feel guilty taking time away from studying.

Consultant: Guilt is a common feeling when we take time for ourselves, especially during stressful periods. However, taking breaks can actually help improve your focus and efficiency. Would you be open to experimenting with short breaks for activities you enjoy and see if that helps with your studying?

User: I can try that, even though it feels strange. 

Consultant: It’s totally understandable to feel that way. Let’s think about a few specific activities you might want to try during your breaks. What is one thing you’d enjoy, even for just a few minutes? 

User: Maybe I could listen to some music. I used to do that a lot.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Music can be very soothing and a nice way to lift your mood. How about you try listening to music for five to ten minutes during your study breaks? 

User: Yeah, I can see myself doing that. I hope it helps.

Consultant: I believe it will! Taking those moments for yourself is important. Now, moving forward, let’s look at how we can tackle the thoughts that are making you feel unworthy or anxious. Can we identify some specific negative thoughts you have about your performance or capabilities?

User: I often think, "I’ll never find an internship," or "I’m going to fail the exam." 

Consultant: Those are very powerful thoughts that can lead to heightened anxiety. Let’s challenge them together. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts these thoughts?

User: I guess I don’t have clear evidence that I won’t find an internship. I do have some relevant skills, and I’ve passed my previous exams.

Consultant: That’s a great observation! You have succeeded in the past, and you have strengths that can help you in the future. What would you say to a friend who expressed similar fears?

User: I’d probably tell them that they are capable and that they've succeeded before, so they can do it again.

Consultant: Exactly! You're able to see your capabilities when it comes to your friend, but it’s harder to extend that same kindness to yourself. How about we reframe your negative thoughts? Instead of "I'll never find an internship," you could say, "I have the skills to find an internship, and I’m actively looking." 

User: I like that. It feels more optimistic. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! This positive reframe can help reduce some of that anxiety. Let's focus on practicing this new thought process over the next week. How do you feel about setting a goal to rewrite some of your negative thoughts into positive affirmations?

User: I think I can do that. I’ll write down my negative thoughts and then try to change them into positive ones.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! By actively challenging those thoughts, you're taking important steps towards managing your anxiety. Before we wrap up, let’s acknowledge what we’ve discussed and focus on what you want to achieve in these coming weeks.

User: I want to feel more confident about my studies and my internship applications. 

Consultant: That’s a great goal. As we work together, remember that it’s okay to feel uncertain at times—what matters is how you respond to those feelings. You've already begun to take steps toward a healthier mindset. I’m here to support you through this process. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and understanding. It makes me feel less alone.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. We’ll continue to build on what you’ve learned today. I’m looking forward to our next session and to hearing about your progress. 

User: Yes, me too! I’ll work on my thoughts and find time for music. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan. Take care, and I’ll see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. Before we begin, I’d like to check in with you about how you've been feeling lately. What's been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious about my future career lately. I’ve been preparing for internships, but the recent interviews didn’t go as well as I hoped, and now I feel even more uncertain about my abilities.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel anxious about the future, especially when the pressure of internships is on your shoulders. What specific thoughts or feelings do you experience when you think about these interviews?

User: I keep thinking that I might not be good enough or that I’ll fail to find a decent job after graduation. It's frustrating because I’ve always worked hard in my studies.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It seems like you’re feeling a lot of pressure to meet expectations. Can you tell me more about how these thoughts affect your emotions and daily activities?

User: When I think like that, I feel overwhelmed and end up losing sleep and appetite. It’s hard to concentrate on studying when my mind is racing with these worries.

Consultant: Sleep and appetite are essential for your well-being, so it’s concerning to hear that they are affected. Let's explore some of those racing thoughts more closely. Can you share a specific thought that comes up for you before or after an interview?

User: I often think, "What if they see I’m not qualified?" This makes me feel so anxious that I second-guess everything I say during the interview.

Consultant: That’s an important thought to examine. How likely do you think it is that the interviewers would judge you harshly based on feeling unqualified? Can we find any evidence that counters this idea?

User: I guess they don’t know me personally and might not think that way. But it's difficult to shake off that feeling during the moment.

Consultant: It can be challenging to shift those feelings in the heat of the moment. You mentioned that you’ve always worked hard. Can you think of any specific achievements or skills that you hold which support your qualifications?

User: Well, I’ve done well in my courses and have some project experience. But when I’m in an interview, it’s like I forget all that.

Consultant: It's great to hear about your accomplishments! It may help to remind yourself of those strengths before an interview. What if we practiced some self-affirming phrases that highlight your skills? How would that sound?

User: That might help, but I'm not sure I’d believe them at first.

Consultant: That's completely normal. The goal is to gradually train your mind to recognize your abilities. Let’s think of a couple of phrases together that feel achievable for you. How about "I have valuable experiences to share" or "I am capable of learning and growing"?

User: I like “I have valuable experiences to share.” It sounds more realistic.

Consultant: Perfect! We can use that as a starting point. Would you be willing to practice repeating that to yourself before your next interview? 

User: Yes, I can do that. It seems like a good step.

Consultant: Excellent! Now, let’s talk about your relationship with your roommate. I've noticed that you've mentioned feeling isolated. Can you share a bit more about that?

User: Yeah, I feel like they don’t understand what I’m going through with my career anxiety, and it's hard to talk about it. I often keep things to myself now.

Consultant: Feeling misunderstood can be really difficult. Would you like to explore ways to open up that conversation with your roommate, so they might better understand your feelings?

User: I think I need to, but I’m just not sure how to start.

Consultant: A good place to start could be expressing how you've been feeling and why it’s been hard for you to talk about it. Maybe something like, “I’ve been feeling really anxious about my future, and it would help me to talk about it.” How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds manageable. I think starting with my own feelings will help ease into it.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. Remember, opening up can foster deeper connections. As we wrap up today, what do you feel is the most important takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think it's important to believe in myself and to communicate more openly. Those affirmations might really help me build my confidence.

Consultant: Absolutely. Building confidence through those affirmations, along with open communication, can make a significant difference. You’ve made some great progress today. Remember, it’s completely okay to seek support from others as well. 

User: Thank you for the guidance! I really appreciate it.

Consultant: You're very welcome. I’m here to support you. Feel free to reach out anytime you need further assistance or need to talk. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling lately? 

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really isolated and misunderstood. The pressure of studying for exams and looking for an internship is really getting to me, and now I've had some arguments with my roommate, which just adds to my stress.

Consultant: I hear you. It seems like you're feeling a lot of pressure from different areas of your life. Let's talk more about your current situation. Can you share what specifically has been stressful with your roommate?

User: We had a fight over some small things, but it escalated. I just feel like he doesn’t get what I’m going through, and I'm worried it might affect our living situation.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, especially when you're already feeling overwhelmed. It's tough to have that kind of tension at home. How did the argument make you feel about yourself and your situation?

User: I felt really alone. It's like my worries aren’t being understood by anyone. I thought we could support each other, but now I feel more isolated.

Consultant: It makes sense to feel isolated when you're not receiving the support you were hoping for. You mentioned hoping to improve your relationship with your roommate. What would that look like for you?

User: I guess I just want us to communicate better and not let small things blow up like that again. It would be good to have someone to talk to about everything.

Consultant: Building better communication could really help. Let’s explore some strategies for that together. Have you tried discussing your feelings with him directly?

User: I haven't. I’m worried that it might just lead to more conflict or that he might not care to listen.

Consultant: It's natural to feel apprehensive about starting that conversation. What if we role-play how that discussion might go? This could help you feel more prepared.

User: That sounds like a good idea. I’m open to trying it.

Consultant: Great! Let's imagine you’re telling your roommate how you feel. What would be your opening line?

User: I guess I would say something like, "Hey, can we talk? I’ve been feeling really stressed lately."

Consultant: That's a straightforward start. What feelings would you like to express next?

User: I want to let him know that I feel overwhelmed and that our arguments make things harder for me.

Consultant: Perfect. Expressing your feelings directly is a great way to communicate. Would you like to add how you’d appreciate more support from him?

User: Yeah, I could say I could really use someone to lean on, especially during this time.

Consultant: That sounds constructive! How do you feel about conveying those thoughts during the actual conversation?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also a bit more empowered now that we've practiced.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! It’s common to feel nervous beforehand, but practicing can really help. Besides improving this relationship, how else might you expand your social support?

User: I’ve been thinking about joining some campus activities to meet new people. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Engaging with others can reduce feelings of isolation. What activities are you interested in?

User: I’m not sure yet. Maybe a study group or a club that focuses on something I like.

Consultant: Both of those options sound great! They could provide a relaxed environment to meet people with similar interests. How can you take the first step towards exploring these opportunities?

User: I guess I could look online for clubs that match my interests and see what’s available this semester.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Setting a small goal can make it easier. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I’m feeling motivated to do that! It sounds manageable.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Seeking out opportunities like this can really enrich your social network. As you explore this, how will you handle feelings of pressure that may arise?

User: I think I need to remind myself to take it one step at a time, and that it’s okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! Being gentle with yourself is important. As we prepare to wrap up today, what do you feel your main takeaways have been from our session?

User: I feel like I have some concrete steps to improve my communication and expand my social life. I’ll definitely practice talking to my roommate and look into campus activities.

Consultant: You’ve made some significant insights today. I encourage you to implement those strategies and remind yourself that it’s normal to feel pressure during this time. 

User: Thanks! I feel clearer about what I need to do now.

Consultant: You’re welcome! It's been great discussing this with you. Remember, you’re not alone in this. If you need further support, feel free to reach out. 

User: I appreciate that. I’ll keep working on those things. 

Consultant: I believe in your ability to navigate through this challenging time. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you again today. Based on our last session, it sounds like you’ve been reflecting on the pressures from your family and yourself. How are you feeling about that now?

User: Hi. Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it a lot. I realize how much I’ve been pushing myself to meet expectations, but the stress is overwhelming. I still feel anxious about my studies and finding an internship.

Consultant: It sounds like you're starting to gain some clarity about the expectations you carry, but the pressure remains quite heavy. Can you share what those expectations look like for you? What specifically feels most overwhelming right now?

User: I think it’s the fear of disappointing my family. They’ve sacrificed so much for me to be in university. I want to make them proud, but I can't help but feel like I’m just not enough, especially when I can’t focus on studying or maintaining a good diet.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way given the sacrifices your family has made. Balancing your own expectations with theirs can be a difficult challenge. What would it look like for you to find a balance between these expectations and your well-being?

User: Ideally, I’d like to feel okay with not being perfect all the time. I want to study effectively without feeling overwhelmed by guilt or fear of failure.

Consultant: That’s a great goal. Let's explore some of the thoughts that come up when you feel that guilt or fear. Can you recall a specific moment recently when you felt overwhelmed, and what thoughts were running through your mind at that time?

User: Yes, last week I sat down to study, but all I could think was how if I don’t get straight A’s, I’m failing everyone. It made it impossible to concentrate, and I ended up just staring blankly at my notes.

Consultant: That thought sounds really heavy and it's understandable that it would prevent you from studying. Let’s take a closer look at that thought: how true do you think it is that not getting straight A’s means you’re failing? Are there other ways to evaluate your success?

User: I guess that’s an extreme way of thinking. I know my family loves me no matter what, but it’s hard to shake off the feeling that I owe them my best performance.

Consultant: It’s a common struggle to feel like our worth is tied to our performance, but it sounds like you recognize that your family's love is not conditional. What could be a more balanced thought you could replace that extreme thought with?

User: Maybe I could think that I am doing my best and that’s what matters, not just grades. I could remind myself that learning is also part of the journey and I’m growing through this experience.

Consultant: That sounds like a much healthier perspective! Focusing on your effort and growth rather than solely on outcomes can help reduce that pressure. What would it look like to implement this new thought into your daily routine?

User: I could remind myself daily, maybe even write it on a sticky note, to see it every time I study. I think that could help shift my mindset. 

Consultant: Writing it down is a great strategy! This visualization can keep that positive affirmation at the front of your mind. Alongside that, are there any specific practices you could incorporate into your study sessions to make it feel less stressful?

User: I’ve thought about taking short breaks or even doing some light exercise to reset my mind. I’ve heard that can help with focus, but I haven’t consistently tried it yet.

Consultant: Incorporating regular breaks and physical activity can indeed improve focus and reduce anxiety. Let’s discuss how you can create a study schedule that includes these breaks—how might that look for you?

User: Maybe I could study for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. After two of those, I could take a longer break to do a quick workout.

Consultant: That sounds manageable and effective. Checking in with your body through movement can be a good way to relieve tension as well. How do you feel about implementing this plan in your studying?

User: I feel more optimistic about it. It seems achievable, and I think it would really help me not to feel as anxious when I sit down to study.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re beginning to build a supportive approach to your studies. As we continue to work together, I encourage you to notice your accomplishments, however small they may be, and reflect on your growth throughout this process. 

User: Thank you, that’s a good reminder. I think I’ll start tracking my progress with small milestones.

Consultant: Tracking progress can provide positive reinforcement, reminding you of how far you’ve come. What milestones would you like to set for yourself in the coming weeks?

User: I’d like to set a goal of completing my study material for one subject each week and being kind to myself if I have setbacks.

Consultant: That sounds like a realistic and compassionate goal! Allowing room for setbacks acknowledges the challenges of life while you work toward your academic objectives. How do you feel about the balance of your personal and family expectations now?

User: I feel like I’m starting to view things differently. I can still honor my family’s sacrifices while also focusing on my well-being. It’s a delicate balance, but I think I’m beginning to find it.

Consultant: It’s great to hear you’re feeling more balanced and recognizing your worth beyond grades. As our sessions end, let’s reflect on your journey and how far you’ve come. What have you learned about managing expectations, both yours and your family’s?

User: I’ve learned that it’s okay to not have everything figured out perfectly. My worth is not determined by my performance alone, and I can have my own path while still valuing my family’s support.

Consultant: That’s a profound realization, and it’s a valuable perspective. Remember this as you move forward. You’ve built important tools during our sessions; carry them with you as you continue on your journey. If you ever need support again, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance. I feel much more empowered to handle things now. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of your progress and I wish you the best moving forward. Take care, and remember this newfound confidence as you navigate your challenges!
###################
Consultant: Hi there! I'm really glad you could join me today. I’d like to start by checking in on how you’ve been feeling since our last session. Can you share a bit about your recent experiences?

User: Hello! I've been feeling much better lately. I managed to secure an internship, and my academic performance has improved. It's like everything is slowly falling into place, but I still sometimes feel anxious about balancing everything.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear that you’ve secured an internship and are noticing improvements in your academics! It sounds like you’ve made great progress. Can you tell me more about what this improvement means to you and how you’ve been dealing with the pressures?

User: It feels rewarding because I've always worked hard for my education. However, the pressure to perform well at my internship and in classes can still get overwhelming at times. I want to keep this momentum going but worry I might slip back into feeling stressed.

Consultant: I understand that feeling of pressure; it can be tough to maintain your momentum while managing anxiety. Let’s take a moment to reflect on the strategies you've learned in the past that have helped you cope with anxiety. What techniques or methods have you found most helpful so far?

User: I’ve been trying to organize my study schedule better and take breaks when I feel overwhelmed. Writing things down has also helped clear my mind. 

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies! Organizing your schedule can really help reduce feelings of chaos. When you take breaks, how do you usually spend that time?

User: I often go for short walks or listen to music. It helps me relax, but sometimes I feel guilty about taking those breaks when I have so much to do.

Consultant: It’s great that you have identified activities that help you relax. It’s important to remember that taking breaks is not only okay but also crucial for maintaining productivity. How could you allow yourself to take breaks without feeling guilty?

User: Maybe I can set a specific time for breaks and remind myself that they’re part of staying productive, not a waste of time. That makes sense!

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Setting specific break times allows you to recharge and can enhance your focus during work periods. Let’s think about the progress you’ve made. What would you say is your biggest achievement in managing your anxiety since our last session?

User: I think my biggest achievement is recognizing when I start to feel anxious and being able to talk about it instead of just bottling it up.

Consultant: That’s a significant milestone! Being able to vocalize your feelings is a powerful step towards managing anxiety effectively. Reflecting on this progress, how do you think you can leverage this skill moving forward?

User: I guess I can practice more proactive communication with my friends or family when I feel stressed. That way, I won’t have to face challenges alone.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Sharing your feelings can provide additional support and open up conversations that may help you manage stress. What steps can you take this week to communicate your feelings proactively?

User: I could start by texting a friend about how I've been coping. Maybe we can check in with each other more often.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Connecting with friends can create a supportive network. As we continue today, let’s also talk about how to reinforce these positive changes. What are some ways you can remind yourself of your progress during challenging times?

User: I could keep a journal of my experiences and remind myself of how far I’ve come. Maybe even list out the strategies that have worked for me so far.

Consultant: A journal sounds like a wonderful tool for self-reflection! Writing can help reinforce positive thoughts and remind you of your successes when facing challenges. How often do you think you could dedicate time to this journaling?

User: I think I can set aside ten minutes every day. It doesn’t seem too overwhelming, and I can build a habit from there.

Consultant: That sounds very achievable! Dedicating even a small amount of time to journaling can make a big difference. As we wrap up our session today, let’s summarize the key takeaways. What have you learned about managing your anxiety and maintaining your growth?

User: I’ve learned that it’s important to take breaks without guilt, communicate with friends, and reflect on my progress regularly. I feel more confident now in using these strategies.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It seems like you have a strong foundation to build upon. How do you feel about applying these strategies moving forward?

User: I feel optimistic and ready to keep practicing these skills! I’m grateful for the support I’ve received.

Consultant: You’ve done incredibly well, and I believe you’re on the right path! As we conclude today, remember that it’s a journey, and you have learned useful skills to manage your anxiety. If you ever feel the need for additional support, I’ll be here. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate all the guidance and understanding you've provided. I'll definitely keep working on these skills.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad I could help. Take care, and until next time, keep practicing those positive changes!
