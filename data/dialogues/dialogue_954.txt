Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today, Li. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really low. There’s a lot of pressure with my application for foreign universities, and I just can’t seem to keep my focus when studying. It's like my mind is just... blank.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds really overwhelming to handle both your studies and the application process. Can you share what kind of thoughts go through your mind when you're trying to study?

User: I often think that I'm not smart enough or that I won’t make it. Then I just feel even more tired and unmotivated.

Consultant: That sounds tough. It seems like these thoughts about not being smart enough are really weighing you down. When you think those thoughts, how do they affect your mood?

User: They make me feel even more depressed. I start doubting myself and feeling like I'm a failure.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way when under so much stress. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit more. Can you identify any specific situations where these feelings of failure come up?

User: Mostly when I'm studying and I can't remember things as easily as before. I just feel embarrassed and think I’m disappointing my mom.

Consultant: It sounds like your mom's expectations play a significant role in how you view your own success. How do you feel about those expectations?

User: I feel immense pressure. On one hand, I want to meet her expectations, but on the other hand, it makes me feel really anxious and inadequate.

Consultant: That’s a challenging position to be in. We can work on this together. What if we take a moment to challenge the thought that you’re disappointing her? What is the evidence for and against that belief?

User: I guess I often assume she thinks I'm not doing enough, but maybe that’s not entirely true. She just wants me to be happy and successful.

Consultant: It’s great that you can see another perspective. Our minds can sometimes exaggerate these fears. What would you say to a friend who felt like they were disappointing their parents in a similar situation?

User: I would probably tell them that their worth isn't based on their achievements and that they’re doing their best.

Consultant: Exactly! You have some helpful thoughts there. Let’s try to apply that same kindness to yourself. How can you remind yourself that you’re doing your best despite the challenges?

User: Maybe I can keep affirming that I'm putting in the effort and that it’s okay to struggle sometimes.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Incorporating affirmations can help shift your perspective. Can we explore some daily practices to reinforce this self-kindness?

User: I think writing down positive things about my progress each day could help. 

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! Keeping a journal can also help you track not just your challenges but also your successes, no matter how small. What else could you do to ease some of this pressure?

User: I might take breaks more often when studying instead of trying to push through. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy. Taking breaks can help you recharge and improve your focus. How do you feel about starting to implement this?

User: I think I can do that. I just hope I don’t feel too guilty when I take those breaks.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have that feeling, but remember, breaks are essential for your mental health. You deserve them just as much as anyone else. We can also work on strategies to combat that guilt. Would you be open to that?

User: Yes, definitely. I want to feel more balanced with my time.

Consultant: Great! For today, let’s summarize what we've discussed. You’re recognizing that you have some negative thoughts tied to your performance, and we're working on challenging those thoughts. You also have some exciting strategies to practice kind self-talk and take breaks. How are you feeling about all of this?

User: I feel a bit hopeful, but I still struggle with the idea of disappointing my mom. 

Consultant: It’s a process, and it’s perfectly okay to feel that way. Remember, your value is not solely based on meeting expectations. We’ll continue to unpack this in our future sessions. How do you want to proceed from here?

User: Just to keep talking about my feelings toward my mom's expectations and find ways to handle them better. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. As we explore this further, we will look for ways to help you manage your emotional responses. How do you feel about scheduling our next session?

User: I think that would be good. I’d like to keep working on these issues.

Consultant: Perfect! I’m looking forward to it. Remember, you’re making progress simply by understanding these feelings. You’re not alone in this journey, and I'm here to help you every step of the way. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li. Take care until we meet again, and remember to be kind to yourself. 

User: I will! Thank you again.
###################
Consultant: Hi Li! It's great to see you again. I remember last time we discussed the pressure you feel from your mother's expectations. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hello. Honestly, I've been feeling even more overwhelmed. The pressure seems to increase, especially when I struggle with subjects I'm not interested in. I often feel disappointed that I can't meet my mom's expectations.

Consultant: I see. So, the feeling of disappointment and overwhelm regarding your mother's expectations has intensified. Can you share a specific instance where you felt this way recently?

User: Just last week, I had to present a project in class about a topic I find boring. My mom was so excited about it, and I felt like I failed when I couldn't engage with it. She had high hopes, and I couldn’t meet them.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, and it's understandable to feel that way. What kind of thoughts went through your mind during that presentation? How did it affect your emotions?

User: I felt like I was failing her. I kept thinking, "I'm not good enough" and "I can't do anything right." Those thoughts made me so anxious that I almost couldn’t focus on the presentation itself.

Consultant: Those thoughts you mentioned—"I'm not good enough" and "I can't do anything right"—they sound quite harsh. Would you say they're a bit extreme? How do you think these thoughts shape your feelings about yourself?

User: Yes, I guess they are extreme. They make me feel trapped, like I'm disappointing not just her but myself too. I doubt my abilities and wonder if I’ll ever meet her expectations.

Consultant: It's important to recognize how powerful those thoughts can be. It seems they create a cycle of negativity that affects your self-esteem. What if you challenged those thoughts? For instance, can you think of any evidence that suggests you are capable and that it’s okay not to meet every expectation?

User: Sometimes, I do well in subjects I like, and my teachers give me compliments. But I just can't shake off the feeling that it doesn't matter because my mom's expectations are always higher.

Consultant: That’s a valid point. Compliments from your teachers indicate your abilities. It sounds like your mother's expectations overshadow your achievements. How would you advise a friend feeling this way? What would you say to them?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on their strengths and remind them that nobody can be perfect all the time.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate approach! It seems like you have a wise perspective. Now, how can you apply this advice to your situation? What small steps can you take to remind yourself of your worth, independent of your mother’s expectations?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal of my achievements, even the small ones, and look back at it when I feel down. That might help me focus on what I can do instead of what I can’t.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent strategy! Keeping a journal can help you track your progress and recognize your strengths. Let’s think about other ways you can challenge those negative thoughts. Can you identify any specific situations where you could practice reframing your thoughts, especially about your mother's expectations?

User: I could talk to her about how I feel when I don’t succeed in things I’m not interested in. Maybe if she understood my challenges, she’d have lower expectations.

Consultant: That’s a proactive idea! Communication could help bridge understanding between you and your mother. What might be a good way to start that conversation?

User: I guess I could tell her how much I appreciate her support but also express that I find it hard to meet her expectations in some subjects. 

Consultant: That’s a great way to express both appreciation and your own needs. What fears or concerns do you have about having this conversation with her?

User: I'm worried she might get upset or think I'm not trying hard enough. I don’t want to disappoint her more.

Consultant: It's natural to worry about her reaction. You care about her feelings. However, expressing your own reality is also important. How could you prepare yourself emotionally for that conversation?

User: I could remind myself that my feelings are valid and that it's okay to be honest about my struggles, even if it makes her upset.

Consultant: Absolutely, validating your own feelings is crucial. This conversation can also be a step in defining your self-worth. Next time we meet, we can discuss how it went. For now, what would you like to focus on before we wrap up today?

User: I want to explore more ways to manage my emotions when I feel overwhelmed and continue building my self-confidence.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! We can work on techniques to manage your emotions and confidence building strategies in our next sessions. You’re making important steps today, Li, and remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I feel a bit better just talking about these things.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It's always a good step to express what you're feeling. I look forward to our next session together. Take care and see you soon!

User: See you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you could make it today. Before we dive in, can you share how you've been feeling lately, particularly regarding your application materials?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really overwhelmed. Every time I sit down to work on my application, I get this wave of negative emotions, and I just can't focus.

Consultant: It sounds frustrating to feel that way when you're trying to accomplish something important. Can you tell me more about the emotions you're experiencing during those moments?

User: I often feel anxious, and sometimes even hopeless. I start doubting my abilities and worry that I won't meet my goals, which just makes things worse.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially with the pressure of applying. You mentioned doubting your abilities; what specific thoughts do you find yourself having when those feelings arise?

User: I think things like, "What if I'm not good enough?" or "What if I mess everything up?" It really weighs me down and makes me feel stuck.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite challenging. Let's explore them a bit. When you think, "What if I'm not good enough?" how does that impact your feelings and your ability to concentrate?

User: It makes me feel even more anxious and kind of paralyzed. I end up staring at my materials without being able to write anything down.

Consultant: I see. It’s like a cycle—those negative thoughts create anxiety, which then affects your focus and progress. Can we try to reframe those thoughts together? What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts the idea that you’re not good enough?

User: I mean, I have done well in my studies before, and I have people who believe in me, but in that moment, it’s really hard to remember that.

Consultant: That makes sense. It's easy to overlook your past successes under stress. Maybe we can create some affirmations from those positive experiences to counter those negative thoughts when they come up. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds helpful! I could really use reminders of my strengths.

Consultant: Great! Let's think of a few affirmations: for example, "I have achieved my goals before, and I can do it again." How does that resonate with you?

User: I like that. It feels empowering to remind myself of my past achievements.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Now, let's talk about practical strategies for managing those overwhelming feelings. Have you tried any relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or mindfulness?

User: I haven't really used any techniques. I just feel too overwhelmed to think about doing something like that.

Consultant: That's understandable. It can be tough to focus on techniques when emotions run high. But practicing relaxation can help ground you. Would you be willing to try a simple deep breathing exercise with me now?

User: Sure, I can give it a try.

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s take a moment. Close your eyes if you can, and slowly inhale through your nose for a count of four… hold it for four… and exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Let’s repeat that a few times.

User: *after a moment* That felt a little calming. I think it helped me feel a bit more centered.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Li! Deep breathing is a great way to manage immediate stress. Would it be okay for us to integrate this technique into your daily routine, especially when you feel that anxiety creeping in while working on your application?

User: Yes, I can definitely try to do that every day.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan! Also, we can talk about setting a timeline for working on your application. Breaking it down into smaller tasks may help you manage your time better and reduce that feeling of being overwhelmed. What do you think?

User: Yes, that could help. I definitely struggle with managing my time and often put too much pressure on myself to finish everything at once.

Consultant: Let’s start by identifying the main components of your application. We can then allocate specific times for each part. How does that sound?

User: That sounds reasonable! I could use help figuring out where to start.

Consultant: Perfect! What are the key sections you need to work on for your application?

User: I need to write my personal statement, update my resume, and gather recommendation letters.

Consultant: Great list! How about we set aside specific days for each of those tasks? For instance, you could draft your personal statement on Monday, work on your resume on Wednesday, and reach out to your referees by the end of the week. Would that work?

User: Yes, that sounds really doable!

Consultant: I'm happy to hear that! This plan will help structure your week and give you clear goals to focus on. Remember to incorporate those deep breathing exercises during stressful moments too. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel more positive now that I have a plan and some techniques I can use. It feels less daunting.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Writing this down and seeing it visually might also help. I encourage you to keep a progress tracker, noting down small wins each day. This will help reinforce your efforts and achievements.

User: I love that idea. It’ll be nice to see my progress.

Consultant: Absolutely, and celebrating those small victories can boost your confidence even further. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. How about we check in next time about how this plan worked for you?

User: Yes! I think having that accountability will really help me stay on track.

Consultant: Fantastic! I look forward to hearing about the progress you make. Keep practicing those techniques and remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process. You're doing great!

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your support. I feel much better about handling everything now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm proud of you for taking these steps. Remember, you have the tools to manage your emotions and focus on your goals. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care, and I’ll see you next time!

User: See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! It’s great to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better, actually. I’ve been trying to engage more in social activities and explore new hobbies.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Engaging in social activities and exploring new interests can really help with emotional stability. Can you share which activities you've tried and how they made you feel?

User: I joined a painting class and met some new people. It felt refreshing to express myself creatively, but sometimes I still feel a bit anxious, especially about whether I’m doing everything right.

Consultant: Painting sounds like a fulfilling way to express yourself. It’s normal to feel anxious about wanting to do things perfectly. How has that anxiety impacted your enjoyment of the painting class?

User: I enjoy it, but I catch myself worrying too much about the final product instead of just having fun with the process. It makes me a bit hesitant to fully dive in.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you’re caught between wanting to enjoy the experience and the pressure of aiming for perfection. What do you think would happen if you allowed yourself to focus more on the enjoyment rather than the end result?

User: I think I might feel more relaxed and actually enjoy painting instead of stressing about my skills.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Enjoyment is a key part of the creative process. How about we explore some ways you could remind yourself to focus on the fun while painting?

User: Yes, that would help! Maybe I can set an intention before starting to just have fun and let go of the outcome?

Consultant: Absolutely! Setting that intention can be a powerful tool. You might also try limiting self-critique during the process—perhaps even create a mantra that encourages you to embrace spontaneity. What do you think about that?

User: I like that idea! A mantra could help me shift my mindset. I usually focus too much on what others think, so this might help me enjoy myself more.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re already recognizing some patterns in your thinking. Would you like to share what worries you about others' opinions?

User: I guess I just don’t want to be judged or compared to others. I want to fit in and be accepted, especially in new social settings.

Consultant: Seeking acceptance is a common feeling, especially in new situations. If you were to challenge that thought, what might you come up with? Is it possible that others are focused more on their own experiences rather than judging you?

User: You know, that’s probably true. People are often caught up in their own thoughts, and I realize not everyone is judging me as harshly as I imagine.

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing that can lessen some of that pressure. How could you remind yourself of this when you feel anxiety creeping in during social situations?

User: Maybe I could create a little reminder note for myself or even mention it to a friend who I can trust. That might help me feel less alone in those moments.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Having a trusted friend to talk to can also provide support. How do you feel about discussing more strategies to help you manage those anxious moments when they arise?

User: I would love that! I think having a toolbox of strategies would be really useful.

Consultant: Great! Let’s talk about some specific strategies. One effective method is deep breathing or grounding exercises. Have you ever tried something like that before?

User: I’ve heard of deep breathing, but I haven’t really practiced it. It sounds like it could help!

Consultant: It can be very helpful! Deep breathing helps activate your relaxation response. Want to try a short exercise together right now?

User: Sure! That sounds good.

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four, hold it for four, and exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Ready? Inhale… 1, 2, 3, 4… hold… 1, 2, 3, 4… now exhale… 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. How did that feel?

User: It felt really calming! I can see how that could help during stressful moments.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Practicing this regularly will make it easier for you to access that calmness when you need it. Could you imagine incorporating this into your routine?

User: Yes! I think I could do it before heading to my painting class or any social gathering.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! As we wrap up today, let's think about one or two things you would like to accomplish before our next session.

User: I want to work on my mantra for painting and try practicing deep breathing before events. 

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! You’re already building a solid foundation for managing your thoughts and emotions. Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate our chat today. It’s really encouraging and helpful.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li! I'm proud of the progress you're making. I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session. Remember, I'm here to support you, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need further assistance in between. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to stay positive, especially after receiving feedback on my early applications. But I still get anxious when I think about planning my future.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re maintaining a positive outlook, but it's natural to feel anxious about the future. Can you share a bit more about what specifically makes you feel anxious when thinking about your plans?

User: I think it’s the uncertainty. I want to make the right choices, but I feel overwhelmed by all the options and what might happen if I choose the wrong one.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. You're feeling the pressure to make the right decisions amidst all those uncertainties. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed. How does this anxiety affect your everyday life or your ability to focus on things?

User: It makes me second-guess myself a lot. I find it hard to concentrate on my studies, and I keep worrying if I'm choosing the right path. Sometimes I even get stuck and don’t know what to do next.

Consultant: It sounds like your anxiety is really impacting your ability to focus and move forward. Let’s explore some of those automatic thoughts that come up for you in these moments. What goes through your mind when you start feeling anxious about your choices?

User: I often think things like “What if I fail?” or “What if I make a mistake?” It’s really discouraging.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite heavy and are often viewed as cognitive distortions. They can create a significant amount of stress. Have you noticed how those thoughts make you feel emotionally when they come up?

User: Yes, they make me feel really anxious and even a bit hopeless sometimes. It’s hard to see things positively when I’m in that mindset.

Consultant: It's tough when those thoughts cloud your perspective. Let’s challenge those versions of your thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts those “what if” scenarios? 

User: I guess I don't really have evidence that I will fail. It’s just something that pops into my head. I’ve succeeded in many things before, but in this situation, I just focus on the negatives.

Consultant: It’s valuable to recognize that those negative thoughts might not be based on reality. If you think about it, what advice would you give a friend who is worried about failing in a similar situation? 

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and it’s okay to not have everything figured out. We learn and grow through those experiences.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective! It seems like you already have a compassionate view for others but struggle to apply that to yourself. How might you use that same understanding when you start feeling anxious?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that it’s okay not to have all the answers and that I can learn along the way. 

Consultant: Absolutely! That self-compassion can be powerful. Now, let’s think about some practical steps you can take when you start feeling overwhelmed. What activities or strategies can help ground you and redirect your focus?

User: I find that taking breaks, going for a walk, or talking with friends helps a lot. I also like journaling, but I often forget to do it when I'm busy.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Taking breaks and connecting with friends can help you regain your focus and ease your anxious feelings. How about incorporating journaling more regularly? Perhaps setting a specific time each week could make it easier for you.

User: That sounds like a good idea! I can schedule a time on Sundays to reflect on my thoughts and feelings.

Consultant: Excellent plan! Creating that space for reflection will allow you to process your feelings and concerns. Let's also talk about setting small, achievable goals for your future plans. What’s one small step you could take this week?

User: I could research one of the career paths I'm considering. Just getting more information might reduce some of my uncertainty.

Consultant: Fantastic! Gaining more information can help you feel more empowered and informed about your choices. As we move toward concluding our session, let’s review the progress you’ve made today. What do you feel is your biggest takeaway?

User: I think I realized that I can choose to view my situation differently. I don’t have to be paralyzed by fear but can allow room for learning and growing through uncertainties.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization, Li. Remembering that growth often comes from facing uncertainties can really help. As we wrap up today, what strategy can you put in place to maintain this positive mindset moving forward?

User: I’ll try to remind myself of that self-compassion and possibly write down affirmations or reminders to read when I feel anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a valuable strategy! I’m confident you’ll be able to manage your emotions and navigate through uncertainties more effectively. If you keep practicing these tools, you'll continue making progress. Remember, you can always return for support whenever you need it. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel more optimistic about my future now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you today, and I look forward to seeing how you apply what we’ve discussed. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you again. Today, I’d like to start by discussing how you've been feeling since our last session. What changes have you noticed in your emotions and coping strategies?

User: Hi! I feel like I've made some progress. My emotions are more stable now, and I’ve started to manage my time better between studying and relaxing. But sometimes I still doubt my capabilities.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’ve experienced emotional stability and improved time management. Those are significant steps! Let’s explore your self-doubts a bit more—what specific situations prompt these feelings of doubt?

User: When I'm preparing for exams, I often think that I might not do well, even though I've studied hard. This thought makes me anxious and I start to question whether I'm truly good enough.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re putting a lot of pressure on yourself during exam preparation. This self-doubt can be overwhelming. Can you share what thoughts come to mind when you feel anxious about the exams?

User: I often think, “What if I fail?” or “Everyone else seems to be doing better than I am.” It's like a cycle of negative thinking that I can't shake off.

Consultant: I understand how challenging that can be. Let’s try to identify and challenge those thoughts together. What evidence do you have that supports these fears, and is it possible to find a different perspective on them?

User: I guess I don’t really have solid evidence. I do well on practice tests, but I somehow forget that when it’s time for the real exam.

Consultant: That’s a helpful realization! Recognizing that your practice performance is a strong indicator of your abilities can be empowering. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their doubts?

User: I would probably encourage them to focus on their strengths and remind them that one test doesn’t define their worth.

Consultant: Exactly! Now, let’s translate that positive perspective back onto yourself. How can you gently remind yourself of your strengths when those self-doubting thoughts arise?

User: I could create a list of my achievements or things that I’m good at. That might help when I start doubting myself.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea, Li! Creating a list can serve as a positive reminder of your abilities. How would you feel about integrating this list into your study routine as a quick motivator?

User: I think that could really help. I could look it over before starting my study sessions to boost my confidence.

Consultant: Wonderful! We can also explore some new strategies to maintain your emotional stability. How has your mood been outside of the exam context? Are there other areas where you feel you could use support?

User: Overall, I’ve been more positive, but my perfectionism still makes everyday tasks feel exhausting sometimes.

Consultant: It’s good to hear you’re feeling more positive! Perfectionism can indeed be draining. Have you noticed any specific tasks where this trait is more pronounced?

User: Yes, when I work on group projects, I find myself trying to control everything to ensure it's perfect. I worry that if I don’t, others will judge my contribution.

Consultant: That’s common in perfectionism. It creates additional pressure. Let’s think about setting more flexible standards for yourself. What if you allowed yourself to make mistakes or delegate tasks to others in those projects?

User: That sounds difficult but possibly helpful. I tend to think that if I don’t handle everything, the outcome won’t meet my standards.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those thoughts, but allowing others to help can often lead to better outcomes and relieve some of that pressure. How about trying to set small, achievable goals for your contributions in group projects?

User: I can try breaking my part into smaller tasks and sharing responsibilities. That might reduce the anxiety.

Consultant: Absolutely! By focusing on gradual progress instead of perfection, you can create a more manageable workload. Remember, teamwork is about collaboration. Would you feel comfortable sharing your thoughts about this with your group?

User: I think I could bring it up. They might appreciate knowing I'm trying to manage my perfectionism.

Consultant: That’s a great step forward, Li! Open communication can alleviate your burden and help strengthen teamwork. As we approach the end of our session, let’s summarize what you've learned today. What strategies do you feel most confident implementing moving forward?

User: I feel good about making that list of my achievements and starting to set flexible goals in group projects. I think these will help me manage my anxiety better.

Consultant: Those sound like fantastic strategies! As a final note, remember to be kind to yourself during this journey. If you encounter self-doubts in the future, returning to those strategies may keep you grounded. 

User: I will definitely keep that in mind. Thank you for your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li! I’ve enjoyed our session. It’s clear that you've made significant progress. If you ever feel the need for support again, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care!

User: I will, thank you!
