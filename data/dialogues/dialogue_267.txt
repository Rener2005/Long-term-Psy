Consultant: Hello, Xiao Li! I'm really glad to see you today. How are you feeling, especially with your studies and sleeping patterns lately?

User: Hi. To be honest, I've been feeling really overwhelmed. My sleep has been terrible, and I just can't seem to find the motivation to study for my upcoming finals. I used to be one of the top students in high school, but now everything feels so much harder.

Consultant: It sounds like you're facing quite a bit of pressure with your exams coming up. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when you're used to performing well, and suddenly everything feels different. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing when you sit down to study?

User: When I try to study, I just feel this huge weight on my chest. I think about all the material I have to cover, and I get so anxious that I end up just lying down instead. Sometimes I sleep during the day and then can't fall asleep at night.

Consultant: That must be really frustrating to deal with, especially since you're recognizing that it's impacting both your sleep and your study habits. You mentioned feeling that weight—what thoughts are going through your mind when you start to feel that way?

User: I keep thinking that I can't possibly cover all the material. It feels like I'm just not capable anymore, and I might fail. I feel so disappointed in myself for not being able to keep up.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy. It's understandable to feel a sense of disappointment during this transition. Let's explore that feeling a bit more. When you think about failing, what sort of emotions or physical sensations come up for you?

User: I feel really anxious and sometimes even a bit hopeless. My stomach gets tight, and I can’t focus on anything. 

Consultant: Anxiety and feelings of hopelessness can be really tough to handle, especially when you're facing a lot of pressure. Perhaps we can take a moment to look at some of those thoughts—how realistic do you think it is to expect yourself to cover all that material perfectly? 

User: I guess it’s not really realistic. But I just can't shake off the feeling that if I don’t do well, it will reflect poorly on me. 

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel that way, but remember that grades don't define your worth or abilities as a person. What if we tried to break down the studying into smaller pieces? How would that feel for you?

User: It might help, actually. The thought of tackling everything at once is just too daunting.

Consultant: That sounds like a good start! Let’s set some small, manageable study goals that are achievable for you. What topics do you feel you could start with first?

User: I think starting with the subjects I find a bit easier could help build my confidence. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on easier subjects can give you a sense of accomplishment. How much time do you think you could dedicate to studying each day?

User: Maybe an hour or two? But I’m scared I’ll lose track of time or get distracted.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. We could discuss strategies to keep you focused during that time. For instance, we could try using a timer to work in short bursts followed by brief breaks. Would you be open to that idea?

User: Yes, I think that could work. It sounds less overwhelming.

Consultant: Great! Taking those breaks can help you recharge. Alongside that, let’s think about how you can manage your emotions surrounding studying and sleeping. What are some activities that typically help you feel calmer?

User: I usually enjoy playing video games or listening to music. They help me relax a bit.

Consultant: Those sound like effective ways to unwind! How about incorporating those into your routine? After studying, you could play some games or listen to music as a reward for completing your tasks. 

User: That’s a good idea. I could definitely use something to look forward to after studying.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s important to give yourself those incentives. As we move forward, what are some other thoughts you want to challenge regarding your abilities in school? 

User: I really want to reframe my thinking from “I can’t handle this” to “I can find ways to manage this.” 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic shift to aim for! It's empowering to recognize that you can develop strategies to cope. Have you thought about any specific strategies you might want to implement moving forward?

User: I think the goal setting and breaks will help. I also want to remind myself that it's okay to ask for help when I'm struggling. 

Consultant: Asking for help is a great strategy! It shows strength and willingness to learn. Do you have support systems in place, like friends or academic resources?

User: I do have friends. Sometimes I hesitate to reach out because I don’t want to burden them.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but remember that good friends often want to support each other. You can also share your experiences and create understanding. It may be beneficial to let them know how you’re feeling; it might lighten your load a bit.

User: Yes, I think I’ll try that. It would be nice to have someone to talk to about it.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Connecting with others can open new perspectives and provide comfort. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on one key takeaway you want to hold on to.

User: I think I’d like to focus on breaking down my study goals and giving myself permission to take breaks. 

Consultant: Excellent takeaway! You're taking a step toward managing the pressure you're feeling. I’m glad you’re embracing this approach, and please remember, you can always reach out for help when you need it. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your support. I feel a bit lighter after our conversation.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that, Xiao Li! Remember, it’s a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. I'm looking forward to our next session, and I hope things improve for you. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Li! It’s great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite down. My sleep is still poor, and I really don’t want to study. I keep doubting my abilities ever since I got to college.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're facing a lot of challenges with your emotions and studies. Let's talk about what's been going on. What happens when you sit down to study?

User: When I try to study, I just feel overwhelmed. The amount of material I need to cover for the upcoming exams makes me anxious, and sometimes I just end up sleeping instead of studying.

Consultant: That's tough, Xiao Li. The anxiety about exams is completely understandable. Can you share what thoughts go through your mind when you think about studying and the upcoming exams?

User: I keep thinking that I won't do well, especially compared to my classmates. It makes me feel like I'm not good enough, and that just makes me want to give up.

Consultant: It’s really hard when you feel that way. Those thoughts can be really heavy. Let’s try to pinpoint them. What specific thoughts come to you that make you feel so discouraged?

User: I often think, "Everyone is studying harder than I am," or "I'm going to fail if I keep this up." It’s like a cycle of negativity.

Consultant: That sounds quite exhausting. Those thoughts sound like they're really affecting your motivation. Let’s explore them together. How likely do you think it is that you will fail, based purely on your efforts and progress so far?

User: I guess I can't say it's very likely. I mean, I have studied before, even if it's been hard lately. Still, I can't shake off the feeling that I’m falling behind.

Consultant: It's helpful that you recognize there’s a difference between your feelings and the reality of your past successes. What would you say is a more balanced way of looking at your situation? 

User: Maybe something like, “I’ve done well in the past, and I can improve if I try new strategies.”

Consultant: That sounds like a healthier perspective! Now, what strategies have you considered trying to help you get back on track with your studies?

User: I don't really know. I tried changing my study environment and scheduling, but it didn't help much.

Consultant: That’s a great start, though! Sometimes it takes a few tries to find what truly works for you. How about we brainstorm some new ways you could structure your study sessions?

User: Sure. I could try breaking the material into smaller sections and focus on one at a time. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Breaks the pressure down into manageable parts. How would you feel about implementing a reward system for yourself after completing each section?

User: That sounds motivating! Maybe I could treat myself to something I enjoy once I finish a section.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Rewards can help reinforce positive behavior. When do you think you could start this new approach to studying?

User: I could start tomorrow. I'll write out a schedule tonight and plan my rewards.

Consultant: That's a solid plan, Xiao Li. As you prepare for this change, what feelings come up when you think about following through with this schedule?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful, but also anxious. I’m worried that I might slip back into my old habits.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel anxious about change, especially since it can be difficult to maintain new habits. How do you think you could handle those moments when you feel tempted to give up?

User: Maybe I could remind myself of the reasons why I want to study better and think of the rewards I set for myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a good strategy! Keeping your reasons in mind can help strengthen your resolve. Have you thought about also checking in on your feelings and progress regularly?

User: I haven’t, but that sounds important. Maybe I could note how I feel at the end of each study session.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Reflecting on your progress can help you see the little successes and keep you motivated. Let’s summarize what you want to implement moving forward. What are your main takeaways from today’s session?

User: I want to break my study material into manageable chunks, set up a reward system, start a study schedule, and regularly reflect on my feelings and progress.

Consultant: That’s excellent progress, Xiao Li! I’m proud of you for taking these steps. As we wrap up today, do you feel more confident about implementing these strategies?

User: Yes, I do! I feel like I have a bit more control over my learning now.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s perfectly okay to have ups and downs. Just keep practicing those new strategies. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Li! I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Good luck with your studies!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you again, Xiao Li. Last time we talked, you mentioned adapting to new time management strategies and feeling some improvement in your studies. How have things been since then? 

User: Hi! Yes, I have been trying my best to stick to the new strategies. Overall, it's been positive, but I still sometimes fall back into old habits, especially when the pressure from exams starts building up.

Consultant: I hear you. It's great that you're noticing some benefits from the strategies, but it sounds challenging to maintain them under pressure. Can you share more about how you’re feeling when you slip back into those habits?

User: I feel really frustrated and a bit hopeless. It’s like no matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to keep up. Sometimes I just avoid studying altogether, and that makes me feel worse.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially with the added stress of exams coming up. Avoidance can provide temporary relief, but it often leads to more stress in the long run. How do you think your avoidance affects your emotional state and studies?

User: It definitely makes me more anxious in the end because I know I have things to catch up on. But at the moment, it feels easier to just ignore it.

Consultant: It makes sense that you would seek comfort during a tough time. However, let’s think about how we can break this cycle. What would it look like for you to face your studies head-on instead of avoiding them?

User: I guess I'd feel a bit more in control. If I could just study a little bit each day, it might reduce the pressure leading up to the exams.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step. One method we could explore is gradually increasing your study time instead of overwhelming yourself. What small, manageable goals can you set for yourself that would help you feel more in control?

User: Maybe I could start with just 30 minutes a day, focusing on one subject at a time, rather than trying to tackle everything at once.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Starting with 30 minutes is very manageable. How do you think you can remind yourself to stick to this habit when you feel the urge to avoid studying?

User: I could set reminders on my phone or maybe enlist a friend to study with me. Having someone there might help keep me accountable.

Consultant: Using reminders is a solid idea, and studying with a friend can also create a supportive environment. How do you feel about reaching out to a friend to create a study schedule together?

User: I think it sounds good! I just hope I don’t let them down if I struggle to keep up with the plan.

Consultant: It’s normal to have concerns about accountability, but remember, everyone struggles at times. How do you think you can communicate your feelings to your friend if you do run into difficulties?

User: I guess I could just be honest with them. If I let them know I’m having a tough time, hopefully, they’ll understand.

Consultant: Absolutely. Open communication can strengthen your support system. Now, let’s think about your emotional state when you study. What can you do to make your study sessions more enjoyable or less stressful?

User: Maybe I could incorporate short breaks to relax or listen to some music while I study to make it less boring.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Short breaks can refresh your mind, and music can create a better atmosphere. Let’s talk about how you can structure those breaks. What do you think would work well?

User: I could study for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. I can do this for a few cycles, and then take a longer break after a couple of hours.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical method! The Pomodoro technique—studying in bursts with breaks—can really boost your focus. How do you feel about setting this structure into your daily routine?

User: I feel like it could help. I just need to commit to it and not get distracted too easily.

Consultant: Staying committed can be tough, but with practice, it can become habit. What other strategies can you use to minimize distractions during your study periods?

User: I could find a quieter place to study or put my phone in another room so I won’t be tempted to check it.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Taking control of your study environment can significantly impact your focus. Now, let’s check in about your emotional state again. When you find yourself becoming anxious or overwhelmed, what techniques from our past sessions can you use to help manage those feelings?

User: I could try deep breathing or remind myself that it's okay not to be perfect.

Consultant: That's a great plan! Deep breathing is a highly effective way to calm your mind. How do you feel about practicing that technique when you start feeling anxious?

User: I think it could be helpful. Sometimes just a few deep breaths can make a difference.

Consultant: You’re right. It can take you out of that anxious mindset quickly. As we move forward, I want you to remember that progress is not always linear. It’s okay to have ups and downs. How do you think this understanding might affect your approach to studying?

User: I hope it makes me a bit more forgiving of myself if I fall short. Knowing that setbacks are normal might help ease some pressure.

Consultant: Exactly! Embracing the journey rather than focusing solely on the outcome can alleviate a lot of stress. Looking ahead, what do you think will be your biggest challenge in maintaining these strategies during your exam period?

User: I think the biggest challenge will be managing my time effectively and not getting overwhelmed by the amount of material I need to review.

Consultant: That’s a common concern, but remember you have the tools now to structure your studying. As we wrap up, what new insights have you gained about maintaining your study habits and emotional well-being?

User: I’ve learned that breaking tasks into smaller chunks and allowing myself to take breaks can help a lot. I also feel more reassured about being open with my friends and myself.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Remember, balancing your studies with self-care is crucial. I believe you have the ability to implement these new strategies. If challenges arise, take a step back and be kind to yourself. How are you feeling about our session today?

User: I feel relieved and more empowered to tackle my studies. Thank you for the guidance!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiao Li! You've made great progress, and I’m here to support you as you continue on this path. Remember to check in with yourself regularly. If you need more help in the future, feel free to come back anytime.

User: Thank you! I’ll definitely keep that in mind.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Li! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I’ve started participating in some extracurricular activities to relieve stress, but I still find it hard to study effectively. With finals approaching, I'm really worried about the amount of material I need to review.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're engaging in extracurricular activities. It seems like you're trying to balance your responsibilities and find ways to manage stress. Can you elaborate on how those activities have helped you feel better?

User: Well, I've been enjoying myself when I participate in these activities, and it’s given me a break from studying. However, I still feel overwhelmed when I think about studying for my exams. It’s hard to focus, and I often end up napping instead.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re finding some relief through those activities, but the pressure of studying still weighs heavily on you. What thoughts do you have when you consider your upcoming exams? 

User: I keep thinking that I won’t be able to remember everything, and it feels like I've forgotten how to study well. In high school, I was always at the top of my class, and now I feel lost.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel lost given the shift in your academic environment. Let’s explore that feeling of being overwhelmed a bit more. When you think about not being able to remember everything, how does that affect you emotionally?

User: It makes me feel really anxious and frustrated. Sometimes, I just want to give up and not think about studying at all.

Consultant: I can see how those feelings can be quite challenging. You mentioned a desire to improve your study efficiency. What do you think it would look like if you could reduce that anxiety and find a way to balance your studies effectively?

User: I guess I would feel calmer and more in control. I would be able to stick to my study plan without feeling so pressured.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive goal. Let's think about your study plan together. What specific changes do you think you could make to help you feel more in control of your studying?

User: Maybe I could set smaller, more manageable study goals instead of trying to tackle everything at once. But I worry I won't be able to stay disciplined.

Consultant: Setting smaller goals is a fantastic idea! It's important to recognize that discipline can be built gradually. When you find yourself starting to feel overwhelmed by your study tasks, what strategies could you use to refocus and stay on track with those goals?

User: I could create a schedule or even set timers for my study sessions, which might help me stay committed.

Consultant: That's a great approach! Creating a structured schedule can indeed help you manage your time better. Additionally, have you thought about how you might reward yourself after completing those smaller study tasks?

User: I haven't really considered rewards. I usually just move on to the next task without taking a break.

Consultant: Incorporating rewards can be a powerful motivator. After you complete a study session, giving yourself time to enjoy an activity you like or relaxing can reinforce positive behavior. What activities might you include as rewards?

User: I could watch a favorite show or take a walk outside, something to help me unwind.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful rewards! Now, considering how you've recognized the importance of relaxation, how do you feel about integrating these breaks into your study schedule?

User: I feel it would help a lot. Having something to look forward to could keep me motivated to study.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s crucial to create that balance. As we wrap up, let's summarize what changes you’re willing to implement. What will your first steps be after discussing these strategies?

User: I will start by creating a study schedule with smaller goals and plan breaks, with rewards after completing each session. I’ll try this for the next few days.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Xiao Li! You've shown a lot of insight today, and I believe these strategies will help you effectively manage your stress while studying. Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. How do you feel about moving forward with these plans?

User: I feel much more hopeful now. I think these steps can really help me manage my time and emotions better.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Your willingness to try these new approaches will make a big difference. As we conclude today’s session, do you have any final thoughts or questions?

User: No, I think we've covered a lot. I’m looking forward to seeing how these changes impact me.

Consultant: Wonderful! I believe you'll make great progress. Remember, it's okay to reach out if you need further support. Best of luck with your studying, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Li! I'm glad you could join me today. It sounds like you've been making some progress in balancing your new life and studies. How are you feeling about that?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more stable lately. I've been trying to manage my time better and it helps, but I still occasionally feel overwhelmed by all the material I need to study for my exams.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re feeling a bit more stable. Managing time can be really tricky, especially with exams approaching. Can you share more about what specific strategies you've been trying to manage your study time?

User: I've started to create a study schedule and set small goals for myself. I try to stick to it, but sometimes I get distracted or just don’t feel like studying, and then everything feels like too much.

Consultant: Creating a study schedule and setting small goals is a good step! It’s understandable that distractions can happen. When you find yourself feeling distracted or not wanting to study, what thoughts usually come to your mind?

User: I often think that there's just too much to cover, and I start feeling like I'm never going to finish. Sometimes I think about how well my classmates are doing, and it makes me feel worse.

Consultant: Those kinds of thoughts can be really overwhelming. When you think that there’s too much to cover, how does that affect your emotions, and what do you tend to do when you feel that way?

User: I feel really anxious and then I usually end up just procrastinating. I’ll tell myself I’ll start later, but then I just end up sleeping or scrolling through my phone.

Consultant: Procrastination can feel like a way to escape those anxious feelings, even if it doesn’t help in the long run. If you could challenge those thoughts about the overwhelming material, what might you tell yourself instead?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that I’ve managed to learn a lot before and that I can tackle one subject at a time instead of looking at everything all at once.

Consultant: That’s an excellent realization! Focusing on one subject at a time could help reduce that sense of overwhelm. How do you feel about trying to implement that mindset more consistently as you approach your study sessions?

User: I think it could help me feel less anxious. If I could break things down into smaller parts, it might not feel so overwhelming.

Consultant: Absolutely! Breaking things down into smaller parts can really alleviate anxiety. What are some of the specific subjects or topics you’re currently struggling with that we could break down together?

User: I’m mostly struggling with my math and statistics class. There’s so much to cover and I find the concepts challenging.

Consultant: Let’s work through that. How about we break down your study materials for math and statistics into smaller sections? You could dedicate a certain time each day to focus solely on a specific topic. How does that sound?

User: That sounds doable. If I could spend an hour on just one topic each day, it might feel more manageable.

Consultant: That’s a great plan, Xiao Li! Committing to an hour a day on one topic can help reinforce your understanding. Additionally, how do you usually reward yourself once you've met a study goal?

User: I usually don’t reward myself. I just move on to the next task. I guess that might be part of the problem.

Consultant: Recognizing that is an important insight! Giving yourself a reward can help create positive reinforcement. What kind of reward do you think would motivate you after completing a study session?

User: Maybe I could allow myself some time to play video games or watch an episode of a show after I finish my study goal.

Consultant: That sounds like a fun and motivating reward! Scheduling that in could make your study sessions feel more rewarding. Do you think it would help to set a specific time for your study and your reward?

User: Yes, I think that could help me stick to my plan more effectively. It gives me something to look forward to after studying.

Consultant: Exactly! Having a balance between work and reward can really enhance your motivation. In our previous sessions, you've mentioned feeling low. How do you feel these new strategies might impact your overall mood and motivation?

User: I think if I can manage my time better and feel more accomplished, it might help lift my mood. I want to feel more motivated and less overwhelmed.

Consultant: That's an encouraging perspective! As you implement these strategies and see some success, you may notice a positive shift in your mood. How can we ensure that you stay committed to these new habits?

User: I could write them down and maybe check in regularly with my progress. It would help to hold myself accountable.

Consultant: Writing them down is an excellent idea! Keeping track of your progress can provide you with motivation and insight into what works for you. When do you think you would like to start implementing these changes?

User: I think I can start tomorrow. It feels good to have a plan in place now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Starting tomorrow gives you a good timeline. As we wrap up today, let’s review what you've learned and how we can build on your progress moving forward.

User: I've realized breaking my studies into smaller goals, rewarding myself, and tracking my progress could really help me manage my anxiety and improve my mood.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve made some significant insights today, Xiao Li. As you put these plans into action, remember that it’s okay to have ups and downs. You’ve developed the skills to handle challenges as they arise.

User: Thank you! I feel like I have better tools now to tackle my studies. I appreciate your help.

Consultant: It’s my pleasure! You've shown great commitment to making positive changes. Keep applying these strategies, and remember that I'm here for support whenever you need me. Good luck with your studies, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Li! I'm glad to see you today. It sounds like you've been working through quite a bit lately. How are you feeling about your current situation?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. After talking with my family and friends, I feel more supported. But I’m still worried about my study efficiency for the upcoming exams.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you’ve felt the support from those around you! Since you've seen some improvement, let's discuss that further. What specific changes have you noticed in your mood or study habits since our last session?

User: I've been trying to stick to a study schedule, and I have moments where I feel motivated. My anxiety isn't as overwhelming as it used to be, but I still struggle to find the energy to start studying sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like you're making progress with your motivation and managing anxiety, which is a positive step! When you mention struggling to start studying, can you share what thoughts come up for you in those moments?

User: I usually think about how much I need to cover, and it feels like an overwhelming mountain. I sometimes tell myself that I can’t do it, and that makes me want to avoid studying even more.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It seems like those thoughts of feeling overwhelmed can really hold you back. Let’s explore them together. What evidence do you have that supports those thoughts? Is there another perspective you might consider?

User: Well, I did well in high school and I managed to get through tough times before. Maybe I’m just putting too much pressure on myself now.

Consultant: That's a valuable realization! Reflecting on your past successes can remind you of your capabilities. If a friend were in your position, how might you encourage them to view that situation differently?

User: I would probably tell them to take it one step at a time and not to worry so much about the big picture. Just focus on what’s in front of them.

Consultant: Exactly! By breaking it down into smaller steps, you can reduce that overwhelming feeling. What are some manageable ways you can apply that approach to your study plan?

User: I could set specific, shorter study goals each day instead of looking at everything all at once. That might make it less daunting.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Setting smaller goals can help create a sense of accomplishment and keep you motivated. What activities or rewards can you incorporate to celebrate these smaller victories?

User: Maybe I can allow myself to watch a show or take a break outside after I complete my study tasks for the day.

Consultant: Excellent plan! Integrating rewards can make studying feel less like a chore and more enjoyable. Have you had the chance to try out these strategies yet?

User: I haven't really started yet, but I think I'm ready to give it a try this week. I feel more positive about approaching my studies now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Before we wrap up, let’s discuss any ongoing support you might need to maintain this positive momentum. Are there particular aspects of your routine or mindset where you foresee challenges ahead?

User: I think I might need reminders to stay on track and perhaps check-ins to evaluate my progress. Sometimes I lose motivation quickly if I don't see results.

Consultant: Seeking reminders and check-ins is a proactive approach! Would it help if we set up a system for you to review your progress regularly and adjust your goals as necessary?

User: Yes, that would definitely help. Just knowing I have a plan and someone to check in with would keep me accountable.

Consultant: I'm here for that! Let’s summarize what we've talked about today: you've recognized your progress, set up manageable daily goals, and devised a reward system to reinforce your achievements. Does that sound about right?

User: Yes, it does! I feel like I have a clearer plan now. 

Consultant: I believe you're well on your way to maintaining this positive state and tackling your studies with confidence. Remember, you can always reach out if you feel overwhelmed again. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support and guidance through this process.

Consultant: It's my pleasure, Xiao Li! I'm proud of the steps you've taken, and I look forward to hearing about your successes in the future. Take care and best of luck with your studies! 

User: Thanks! I will keep you posted. Goodbye! 

Consultant: Goodbye, Xiao Li! Take care!
