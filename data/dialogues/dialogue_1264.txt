Consultant: Hello there, Stafani! I'm really glad to see you today. I’d like to talk about how you’ve been feeling lately. Can you share a bit about what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi! I don't know... I just feel really upset. My sisters have all moved out, and now there’s this little baby in the house. I feel like I’m not important anymore.

Consultant: I hear you, Stafani. It sounds like you’re feeling a bit lost and maybe even jealous with everything changing around you. Can you tell me more about how these changes make you feel?

User: Well, I just get really angry sometimes. I want everybody to pay attention to me like they used to, but they’re too busy with the baby now.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way when things change, especially when you’ve always had their attention. Can you describe what happens when you feel this anger?

User: I shout at everyone and sometimes I throw things. I just feel so alone and it makes me act out.

Consultant: It sounds like your feelings of alone-ness and frustration come out as anger. Let’s explore that a bit. When you’re feeling angry, what thoughts go through your mind?

User: I think they just don’t care about me anymore. I feel like I’m not special to them.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It seems like your mind is telling you that you’re not important. What would you say to a friend who felt that way? 

User: I guess I’d tell them that’s not true and that they are still loved. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to talk to ourselves the same way we’d talk to a friend. So, let’s think of other reasons your family still loves you, even with the new baby around.

User: They still hug me a lot, and my mom reads to me. I know they care, but it feels different.

Consultant: That’s a great observation! Even if things feel different, they still show you love in various ways. How do you think you can express your feelings when you start feeling angry or upset?

User: Maybe I could tell them instead of yelling. But it’s hard to remember to do that when I’m mad.

Consultant: It can be hard to remember, especially in the moment. We can practice some ways to remind yourself. Would you like to come up with a signal or a word to use when you start feeling angry?

User: That could help! Maybe if I say "pause," they could understand I need a minute without me getting loud.

Consultant: "Pause" is an excellent idea! It gives you a moment to cool down and think. When you feel the urge to shout, you can say “pause” and take a deep breath instead. How does that sound?

User: It sounds good! I think I can try that.

Consultant: Wonderful, Stafani! In addition to “pause,” what is something you enjoy doing that could help you feel calmer when you’re upset?

User: I really like drawing. It makes me feel better sometimes.

Consultant: That's a fantastic way to express your feelings! Drawing can be a great tool to process emotions. Maybe you can set aside some time for that when you're feeling overwhelmed. How would that fit into your routine?

User: I could draw after school when I’m feeling angry or sad. That might help distract me.

Consultant: Absolutely! That could be a very helpful strategy. We can also think about how to talk to your mom about needing her attention without feeling angry. What do you think might work for that?

User: I could ask her to spend some time with just me, like when we read together.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Expressing what you need can really help strengthen your connection. You might say, “Mom, could we have some special time together?” How does that feel to you?

User: I like that! It feels nice to think about spending time with her.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Stafani. Focusing on moments of connection sounds like a positive step. Is there anything else you would like to share or think about today?

User: I guess I just want to feel more important again, like I did before all these changes.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to want that. As you practice expressing your needs and enjoy activities you love, you’ll likely find ways to reconnect with your family and feel valued. What’s one thing you can do this week to practice expressing your feelings more?

User: I’ll talk to my mom and maybe show her my drawings too!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! Sharing your drawings can really open up discussions and help show your feelings. As we wrap up today, what is one thing you learned about yourself in our talk?

User: I learned that it’s okay to ask for attention and that drawing can help me feel better.

Consultant: Exactly, Stafani! Remember, your feelings are valid, and it’s great that you’re recognizing ways to express them. When you want to talk again, I’m here. Keep practicing what we discussed!

User: Thank you! I feel a bit better now.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! Take care, Stafani, and I can't wait to hear about your progress next time.

Consultant: Hello, Stefanie! I'm really glad to see you today. Let's talk about what's been going on lately. How have you been feeling?

User: Hi! I don’t know... I feel really sad sometimes. Since I started going to after-school care, I miss spending time with my mom. It feels like she doesn't pay attention to me anymore.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a bit neglected and that you miss your time with your mom. Can you share more about how this makes you feel day-to-day?

User: I feel lonely and sometimes I get really angry... like I don’t know why, but I don’t want to go to school or do anything. I just want my mom to be with me.

Consultant: It must be really tough for you to feel that way, especially when you just need that closeness with your mom. What kind of things do you usually enjoy doing with her?

User: We used to read stories together and play games. I liked when she would help me with my homework after dinner. Now, she seems too busy.

Consultant: I understand how much those moments mean to you. It sounds like you really cherish that time. Have you had a chance to talk to your mom about how you're feeling?

User: No, I don’t want her to think I’m being silly... but I just wish she would notice I’m sad.

Consultant: It's completely okay to feel the way you do, and it’s not silly at all. What do you think would happen if you shared your feelings with her?

User: I guess she might understand and want to spend time with me... but I'm worried she might say she’s too busy.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, but expressing your feelings could help her see how important this is to you. Maybe you could suggest a specific time when you both could spend together. What do you think?

User: That could be good... I could ask her to read to me one night. But what if she forgets?

Consultant: That’s understandable too. Perhaps you could make it a special routine, like every Wednesday evening? You could remind her in a gentle way. Would that help you feel more secure about the time together?

User: Yes, having a special night sounds nice. I’ll try to ask her.

Consultant: That’s a great plan, Stefanie! Asking for what you need can help you feel more connected to her. Besides talking to your mom, how else do you think you could feel better at home or school?

User: I think I need to find new friends at school. Sometimes I feel scared to talk to kids in my class.

Consultant: Making new friends can be tricky, especially when you feel scared. What do you think stops you from talking to them?

User: I don’t know... I’m just shy, and I don’t know what to say. I feel like they might not want to play with me.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel shy! Instead of thinking they might not want to play, maybe we could look at it differently. How about thinking, “They might like my company”? What do you believe could help you start a conversation with them?

User: Maybe I could say something simple, like “Hi” or ask them what game they’re playing? 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful start! A simple “Hi” is a friendly way to break the ice. How do you feel about trying that next time you’re at school?

User: I feel a little nervous, but also a bit excited. I think I can try.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic attitude! Feeling a bit nervous is normal, but remember that every small step counts. Let’s also talk about how you could handle it if they don’t respond positively.

User: I guess I could just try again another time. It doesn’t have to be perfect.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s all about trying and being patient with yourself. Each attempt will help build your confidence. How about we set a small goal for this week regarding both your time with your mom and starting conversations at school?

User: I think my goal could be to ask my mom about our special reading night and then to say “Hi” to at least one classmate.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals, Stefanie! Achieving them will help you feel more connected at home and more confident in school. I believe in you! How will you remind yourself to do these things?

User: I can write it down somewhere I can see it every day so I won’t forget.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Writing it down can help keep those goals on your mind. Remember, it’s okay to feel a little nervous. I’m proud of you for wanting to share your feelings and make new friends. How do you feel about our conversation today?

User: I feel better! Talking to you made me think of ways to change things. I’m excited to try!

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that, Stefanie! Remember, taking these small steps is so important. I’m here to support you, and I look forward to hearing how everything goes. Keep in mind you’re not alone in this, and it’s perfectly okay to reach out for support.

Consultant: Hello, Stafani! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, especially in school?

User: Hi! I’ve felt really lonely at school. I think my teacher doesn’t understand me, and I don’t feel comfortable talking to my classmates. It makes me really upset.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing some strong feelings of loneliness and discomfort in your school environment. Can you share more about what happens in class that makes you feel this way?

User: Well, when I try to join the group activities, I feel like I don’t belong. My classmates laugh, and I don’t know how to make them like me. I just get anxious and freeze up.

Consultant: That sounds tough, Stafani. It must be difficult when you feel that way in front of your classmates. What thoughts go through your mind when you are in those situations?

User: I think they’ll make fun of me if I say something wrong. It's like my heart races, and I feel really small, like I just want to disappear.

Consultant: It sounds like you're concerned about how others perceive you, which can be really overwhelming. Have you noticed any specific situations that trigger these feelings for you, like when you’re called on in class?

User: Yes! When my teacher calls my name, I feel like everyone is staring at me, and my thoughts just go blank. I don't want to say anything because I’m scared I’ll mess up.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel anxious in those moments. You mentioned feeling scared about messing up. What would it look like for you to feel more confident in those situations?

User: I think if I could just say one thing without feeling judged, it would make me feel better. But I don’t know how to do that.

Consultant: Let’s explore some ways to tackle that feeling! Maybe we can practice how you would respond if a teacher asks you a question. What do you think that might look like?

User: I guess I could take a deep breath and just try to answer, even if I’m unsure. But sometimes it’s hard to remember to breathe.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Remembering to breathe can help calm you down. How about we set a little goal for you, like picturing yourself taking a deep breath before answering? How does that sound?

User: That sounds okay. I can try that next time. 

Consultant: Awesome! It’s helpful to take small steps. Let’s also think about how you can create connections with your classmates. Have you ever thought about sharing something about yourself or asking them about their interests?

User: I’ve thought about it, but I'm scared they won’t care about what I have to say.

Consultant: It makes sense that you're worried! Sometimes, starting with a simple question can open up a conversation, like asking about their favorite games. What’s something you enjoy that you could share with them?

User: I love playing dolls! If I could find someone who likes dolls too, maybe we could play together.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Sharing your interests can help you connect with others. If you feel comfortable, you might start by mentioning that to a classmate. How do you feel about trying that?

User: I guess I could try to mention it. It might be fun if someone wants to play!

Consultant: Exactly! It can definitely lead to a fun experience. Remember, practice makes progress. How do you feel about the idea of practicing small talks before class this week?

User: I feel a little nervous, but also excited. I hope it goes well.

Consultant: That’s a great attitude to have! Nervousness can be normal, but getting excited about it can make it easier to approach. How will you remind yourself to take that deep breath before you speak?

User: I can try to remember it as I walk into class. Maybe I could even say it in my head: "Just breathe."

Consultant: Perfect strategy! Using that reminder can help you stay calm. Let's talk about how you can handle it if things don’t go as planned. What do you think you could tell yourself in that situation?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that it’s okay to mess up, and I can try again next time.

Consultant: That’s a healthy approach, Stafani. Mistakes are part of learning! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize some key takeaways. You’re going to practice deep breathing and chatting about your interests to help with connections. How does that sound?

User: It sounds good! I’ll definitely try it.

Consultant: I’m really proud of you for being open to trying these strategies. Remember, progress takes time, and it’s okay to have ups and downs along the way. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel better. Talking about it helps me think of ways to make things better. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Stafani! You’ve made great strides today. If you ever feel overwhelmed, know that you can come back here anytime. You’re not alone in this.

User: Thank you! I’ll remember that. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Stefanie! I'm glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling lately about your family situation?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit strange. My little nephew was born recently, and it seems like everyone is focusing on him now. I feel like I’m not getting as much attention as before, and it makes me angry sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling a little neglected with the arrival of your nephew, and that’s making you feel angry. Can you tell me more about how this is affecting you at home and at school?

User: At home, I notice that my parents and sisters are always talking about the baby. Sometimes, when I try to talk to them about my day, they don't seem to pay attention. At school, I have been acting out and getting in trouble because I feel like I need to do something to get their attention.

Consultant: I see. So, you're trying to express yourself in any way possible, but it feels like your feelings are being overlooked. Let's explore what you wish would happen instead. If you could change this situation, what would you want your family to do?

User: I wish they would spend more time with me, just like they used to. I want to feel special too, not just the baby.

Consultant: That’s understandable. You want to feel valued and loved in your family. There’s a new role for you to play now as an older cousin. How do you feel about that?

User: I don’t know... I’m not really sure how to be like that. It feels weird, and I don’t think I’m good at it.

Consultant: It’s perfectly fine to feel unsure about this new role. It can be challenging. Let’s try to think of ways you can connect better with your nephew. What are some activities you enjoy? Maybe we can find ways for you to share those with him.

User: I love playing with my toys and reading books. I guess I could show him my toys...

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Playing with your toys can be a fun way to bond with him. Perhaps you could introduce him to your favorite stories too? How do you think that would make you feel?

User: It might be fun! But what if he doesn’t like it? What if I don’t get any attention?

Consultant: It’s natural to worry about that, but remember, this is about sharing something you love. If he enjoys what you're sharing, that could create a special moment between you two. If he doesn’t respond how you hope, how could you remind yourself that it’s okay?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s not about the attention. It’s about having fun with him. 

Consultant: Exactly! And when you focus on having fun, it may help you feel less anxious about getting attention. How about we practice how you might invite him to play? What would you say to him?

User: Maybe I could say, "Do you want to play with my toys?" or "Do you want to see my favorite book?"

Consultant: Those sound like great openings! It’s friendly and inviting. Practice saying it out loud a few times. How does it feel to say that?

User: It feels a bit easier. I think I can do it.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Stefanie! Building a connection takes time, but this is a wonderful step. Now, let’s talk about how you can cope with the moments you feel left out. What are some things you might do to feel better?

User: I could talk to my friends or maybe draw pictures when I feel ignored.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Drawing or talking to a friend can be a great way to express your feelings. How would you feel about creating a little plan for moments when you feel left out?

User: I think that would help. I could write down what I want to do when I feel sad.

Consultant: Absolutely! Writing it down can make it feel more real and give you something to look forward to. Would you like to set up a little list together now?

User: Yes, I’d like that! 

Consultant: Great! What would you want to put at the top of your list for when you feel sad?

User: I could write, "Draw a picture of my family," and "Call a friend." 

Consultant: Those are fantastic ideas! And remember, if family activities are reduced, it’s still okay to ask for some time for just you. How might you express your feelings to your family if you’re feeling left out?

User: Maybe I could say something like, "I feel a bit sad and I really want to talk or play together."

Consultant: That’s a wonderful way to express your feelings! It’s honest and opens the door for dialogue. If you share how you feel, they might not realize you’re feeling this way. How does that feel to think about doing that?

User: It feels good! I think they would listen if I said it like that. 

Consultant: I believe so too! Communication is key. As we wrap up today, let’s take a moment to reflect. What would you say is the biggest takeaway from our chat today?

User: I feel more confident about playing with my nephew and talking about my feelings. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You've made great progress today, and I'm proud of you for taking these steps. Remember, it’s natural to feel a mix of emotions during changes like this. If you ever need to talk again, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you! I feel better already!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Stefanie! I'm glad to hear that. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Stefanie! I'm really glad you could join me today. How have you been feeling lately, especially regarding your family activities?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really lonely. I don’t like that we haven’t been spending much time together as a family. I just want things to go back to how they were.

Consultant: That sounds tough, Stefanie. It’s understandable to feel upset when things change at home. Can you share more about what’s been bothering you regarding this change?

User: Well, my mom has been really busy with work lately, and it feels like we hardly do anything together anymore. I just get so angry sometimes, and then I get in trouble for yelling.

Consultant: It’s really common to feel frustrated when we notice changes that make us feel excluded or alone. You mentioned feeling angry when things aren’t as they used to be. What do you think you’re trying to achieve when you get angry?

User: I guess I’m trying to get their attention. I just want them to realize I miss our family time.

Consultant: That's really insightful, Stefanie. Wanting attention and connection isn’t a bad thing at all. Let’s explore how you can express that desire in a way that helps your family understand what you need. Can you think of ways to share your feelings with them without getting angry?

User: I don’t know... Maybe I could just tell them that I’m feeling lonely and miss them.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Communicating your feelings directly can really help. What if you expressed to them how much you enjoyed family activities? How do you think they would respond?

User: I think they would want to spend time with me, too. I just need to say it nicely, not through yelling.

Consultant: Exactly! You're moving towards finding a more positive way to connect with them. It's about understanding that expressing feelings can lead to better family time. Let's talk about another way to engage with your family. How about we set a specific day each week for family activities? How would that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! If we have a set time, maybe they won't forget about me.

Consultant: That's a great plan! Having a regular family time could help you maintain those connections. We can also think of fun activities that you all might enjoy together. What activities do you think your family would enjoy?

User: We could play games or watch movies together. I like when we laugh and have fun!

Consultant: Those are fantastic ideas! Playing games and watching movies can definitely bring everyone closer together. How do you feel about suggesting these specific activities to your family?

User: I feel excited! I want to suggest having a game night or a movie night.

Consultant: Wonderful! Expressing your excitement might encourage them to be just as enthusiastic. It sounds like you’re gaining more confidence in sharing what you want. How can you remind yourself of these positive feelings when you feel lonely?

User: I can write it down or talk to my dolls. They always listen!

Consultant: That’s a creative strategy! Using your dolls to express your feelings can really help you process your emotions. It shows that you’re trying to handle your feelings without getting angry. How do you think you will feel the next time you want to yell?

User: Maybe I can take a deep breath and remember that I can talk about my feelings instead.

Consultant: Yes, taking deep breaths is a great idea! It can help calm you down so you can express your feelings more positively. I’m really proud of how you’re progressing, Stefanie. Can we talk about some ways to reinforce this positive behavior during our next session?

User: Sure! I’d like that. I want to keep feeling good and not get angry.

Consultant: Absolutely! We’ll work together to make sure you have the tools to manage your feelings. As you continue to work on this, can you think of how you might feel when your family starts spending more time together?

User: I think I would feel really happy and loved. Like I belong.

Consultant: Exactly, Stefanie! Feeling happy and loved is what we all want. Let's make sure to continue nurturing that sense of belonging, both for you and your family. As we wrap up today’s session, how do you feel about the strategies we’ve discussed?

User: I feel really good! I’m looking forward to talking to my family and having fun together again.

Consultant: It's amazing to hear that, Stefanie! You’ve made significant progress in understanding your feelings and finding new ways to connect with your family. Remember, communication is key, and I’m confident you will handle things well. If you ever feel overwhelmed, just remember the strategies we talked about. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I can't wait to share everything with you next time!

Consultant: You’re welcome, Stefanie! Bye for now.

Consultant: Hello, Stefanie! I'm glad to see you today. It sounds like there have been some positive changes for you recently at home and school. How are you feeling about everything?

User: Hi! I feel much better now. My parents and sisters have been really supportive, and I think I've learned to manage my emotions better. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like your family has been a great help. Can you tell me more about what you've noticed about your emotions and how you've been managing them?

User: I used to get really angry when things didn’t go my way, but now when I feel upset, I try to take a deep breath and think for a moment. It really helps!

Consultant: Taking deep breaths is a great strategy! It’s really impressive that you’re thinking before reacting. Have you noticed any specific situations where this strategy has worked well for you?

User: Yes! Last week, I had a disagreement with one of my classmates during a group project. Instead of yelling, I took a breath and talked to her calmly. We worked it out!

Consultant: That's a fantastic example of using your breathing technique to manage your emotions. It sounds like you’ve made some real progress in communicating better. How did that make you feel afterward?

User: I felt proud! It was nice to resolve things without getting angry. I think my classmates also appreciated it.

Consultant: You should definitely feel proud! Resolving conflicts calmly is a skill that will help you in many situations. How about at home? Have there been any challenges where you applied what you've learned?

User: Sometimes I still get annoyed with my sisters, but I try to talk to them instead of just getting mad. It’s not always easy, but I’m trying.

Consultant: It's great that you're making an effort to communicate with your sisters. Building these skills takes time, and it’s okay to find it challenging sometimes. What do you think could help you when you start to feel annoyed?

User: Maybe if I can remind myself to take a break or walk away for a little bit, that might help.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Taking a break can really help you gather your thoughts and calm down before returning to the situation. Do you feel like you can share this approach with your family as well?

User: Yes, I think I will! If my sisters see me doing that, maybe they’ll do it too.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Encouraging each other can create a supportive environment for everyone. Speaking of support, how do you feel your family can continue to help you maintain your emotional growth?

User: I think if they keep talking to me and asking how I’m feeling, that would be great. Sometimes I still have tough days.

Consultant: Regular conversations about feelings can be very helpful. Have you talked with them about how you're feeling on the tougher days?

User: I’ve told them when I’m upset, but sometimes I don’t want to share too much. I don’t want to trouble them.

Consultant: It's understandable to want to protect your family from worry. However, sharing your feelings can also bring you closer together. Perhaps you can find a comfortable way to share little bits at a time. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I think I’ll try to let them know when I'm really upset, but also share the small things as I go. 

Consultant: That sounds like a balanced approach! I’m proud of you for thinking through this. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on the progress you’ve made. What do you feel has been your biggest achievement during our sessions?

User: I think learning to manage my emotions and communicate better has been my biggest achievement. I feel more like myself!

User: I’ll keep practicing my breathing, talking to my family, and taking breaks when I need to.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies. I believe you have the skills to manage your feelings effectively. Remember, it’s okay to seek support whenever you need it. This will help you continue to grow. 

User: Thank you! I feel more confident now. I appreciate all your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It's been a pleasure working with you, and I’m really proud of the progress you’ve made. If you ever need to chat again, don’t hesitate to reach out. Best of luck with everything, Stefanie!
