Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately regarding your studies and gaming?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really down because of my gaming habits. I know I should be studying, but I just can’t seem to stop playing. I feel guilty about it, especially with exams coming up.

Consultant: It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of pressure from your studies and that gaming has become a way for you to cope with that stress. Can you tell me more about how you feel when you find yourself turning to gaming?

User: When I start playing, I feel a sense of escape, like I'm not thinking about my worries. But afterwards, I just feel worse because I know I’ve wasted time.

Consultant: I see. So gaming provides a temporary relief for you, but it leads to feelings of guilt afterwards. What do you think triggers your desire to play instead of focusing on your studies?

User: Whenever I have too much homework or feel overwhelmed, I just want to escape. It’s like gaming is the easiest way to avoid the stress.

Consultant: That makes sense. It seems like if the academic pressures feel too intense, gaming becomes a go-to escape route for you. How do you usually feel before you start playing?

User: I feel anxious and stressed. Like, my mind keeps racing about what I need to do but I don’t know where to start.

Consultant: It sounds exhausting to feel that way. Let's dive a bit deeper—do you notice any specific thoughts that come to mind during those moments of anxiety?

User: I keep thinking that I’m going to fail if I don’t study harder, but I can’t seem to bring myself to do it. 

Consultant: That sounds tough. It appears those thoughts might be contributing to your stress. What would happen if you didn't meet your expectations? 

User: I guess I’d feel like a failure, especially since my family expects a lot from me. 

Consultant: That's a lot of pressure to bear. What if we tried to challenge those thoughts about failure? What evidence do you have that you would actually fail?

User: I mean, I have done okay in my classes overall, but I feel like I could be doing better. 

Consultant: That’s an important observation. It sounds like you have moments where you recognize your achievements. What might it look like to focus more on those successes instead of just the pressure?

User: I guess I could try to remind myself that I’ve managed to keep my grades up before. Maybe I don’t give myself enough credit.

Consultant: Absolutely! Giving yourself credit is important. How about we work on a list of things you’ve accomplished? That could help with the self-criticism you’re experiencing.

User: Yeah, that might help. I’ll feel more motivated if I see what I’ve done right instead of just focusing on what I haven’t done.

Consultant: That sounds like a productive strategy. Also, what activities can we think of that might help ease your anxiety instead of turning to gaming? 

User: Maybe I could take short walks or try listening to music. That sometimes helps clear my mind. 

Consultant: Great ideas! Incorporating breaks for those activities could provide you with moments of relief. How about setting small goals for your study sessions and rewards for when you take breaks with those activities?

User: Setting small goals sounds doable. I often get overwhelmed when I think about how much I have to do.

Consultant: Exactly! Small goals can make things feel more manageable. When you reach a goal, reward yourself with a break. How does that feel to you?

User: That makes sense. I think that could really help break the cycle of stress.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. As we move forward, it’s important to keep track of your thoughts and feelings around gaming and studying. Are you willing to try recording how you feel before and after studying and gaming?

User: Yeah, I can start doing that. It’ll probably help me see patterns in my behavior.

Consultant: Perfect! This reflection will provide insights into what triggers your gaming. We can discuss it in our next session. How are you feeling about all this so far?

User: I feel a bit hopeful. It feels good to talk about this instead of just keeping it all inside.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Acknowledging your feelings can help with the process. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Are there any last thoughts or questions before we wrap up today?

User: No, I think we’ve covered a lot. Just looking forward to trying out these strategies.

Consultant: I'm excited for you to try them out too! You've made great strides today. Remember, taking those small steps can lead to significant changes. If you need anything before our next session, feel free to reach out. Take care!

User: Thank you! I will. See you next time.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. I understand you've been feeling quite overwhelmed lately. Can you share more about what's been going on with you?

User: Hi. I've been having a tough time with my studies. There are some challenges I can't seem to get past, and I feel really isolated. I've started playing games more to escape from it, but now I just feel worse after playing.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure and turning to games as a way to cope. Can you tell me more about how that affects your emotions after you play?

User: Well, while I'm playing, I feel better—it's like I'm in a different world. But afterwards, I feel really down and disappointed in myself for avoiding my studies.

Consultant: It makes sense that playing games can provide a temporary escape, but it seems to lead to negative feelings afterwards. What would you say your main sources of stress are in your studies right now?

User: I think it's mainly the pressure to perform well and keep up with my classmates. I don’t want to fall behind, but some subjects are just so challenging for me.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s hard to balance the pressure to succeed with difficult coursework. Have you found any study methods that work well for you, or do you feel stuck in that area too?

User: I usually just try to memorize things, but it doesn’t stick well. I struggle to understand the deeper concepts, and that makes studying frustrating.

Consultant: I understand how that can feel frustrating. Perhaps we can work on finding ways to study that make those concepts clearer for you. Do you think exploring different study techniques might help reduce some of that stress?

User: Yes, that might be helpful. I just don’t know where to start.

Consultant: Let's take a step back and think about stepping away from gaming for a bit. If we focused on building a study plan that includes breaks and rewards, do you think that could be a good alternative to gaming?

User: I guess if I had something to look forward to, it might help. But I'm not sure how to balance it all.

Consultant: That's a valid concern. We can work together to create a plan that allows you to study but also incorporates breaks that aren't gaming-related. What are some activities you enjoy that could serve as these breaks?

User: I like going for walks, and I enjoy gathering news stories. Maybe I could use those as breaks instead.

Consultant: Those sound like great options! Incorporating walks or news stories as breaks could help refresh your mind. How about we develop a structure for your study sessions that includes these activities?

User: That sounds good. I think if I had some schedule, it would make it easier to stick with it.

Consultant: Perfect! We can create a balanced study schedule together. Let's consider how long you want to study before taking a break and how you can use your walking or news reading time effectively.

User: Maybe I could study for 45 minutes and then take a 15-minute walk? I can always check the news after that, too.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Let’s keep it flexible, and you can adjust it based on how you're feeling. How are you feeling about taking this approach?

User: I feel a bit hopeful. I guess having a plan might help reduce my anxiety.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s a good step forward. Now, regarding your social connections, how do you feel about reaching out to classmates or friends when you’re feeling overwhelmed?

User: I usually don’t. I feel like they won’t understand, or they’ll think I’m not good enough.

Consultant: That’s understandable, but remember that everyone struggles at some point. It can be helpful to share your feelings with someone you trust. What would you think about reaching out to one person this week? 

User: I could try that. Maybe I could talk to a classmate about studying together. I’ve just been too shy.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Finding a study buddy can create a supportive environment. How would it feel to take that step this week?

User: It makes me a bit anxious, but I see how it could help. I think I’ll try to approach someone.

Consultant: That’s a brave decision, and it shows you're willing to take action. Remember, even small steps count. What would you want to say to them when you reach out?

User: I could just ask if they want to study together. It’s simple enough.

Consultant: Exactly! Keeping it simple can help ease the pressure. Let’s make a plan to check in about this next time. How do you feel about our conversation today?

User: I feel good about it. I appreciate the focus on practical steps. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, improving your study habits and social connections takes time, but you’re already making progress. Let's keep exploring these strategies together, and I look forward to our next session!

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to it too.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. I want to start by understanding how you've been feeling lately. Can you tell me what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really isolated. My relationship with my roommate has become tense, and I feel like I'm being pushed aside. I wish I could socialize, but I don't really know how. 

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling quite alone and that the tension with your roommate is really bothering you. You mentioned wanting to socialize more. What kind of social interactions would you like to have?

User: I just wish I could connect with others, maybe hang out or have a conversation without feeling awkward. Right now, gaming is my only way of socializing, but it doesn’t feel fulfilling. 

Consultant: I understand. It seems gaming has become your main source of connection, but it’s not really meeting your needs for deeper social interaction. Can you tell me more about how you feel when you're gaming compared to when you try to socialize in other ways?

User: When I’m gaming, I feel part of a community, even if it’s not real-life interaction. But when I think about talking to people face-to-face, I feel really anxious and unsure of what to say.

Consultant: That’s a common feeling, especially when you want to connect but fear the outcome. Let’s explore that anxiety a bit. What specific thoughts go through your mind when you think about interacting with others?

User: Mostly, I worry that I’ll embarrass myself or that they won’t want to talk to me. It feels like everyone else knows how to socialize, and I’m just… stuck. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're having thoughts that make you doubt your social abilities. Let's try to unpack that together. How much evidence do you think supports the idea that others wouldn’t want to talk to you?

User: I guess I don’t really have evidence. It’s just a feeling I have. They seem so confident, and I feel like I don’t belong. 

Consultant: That realization is important—your feelings don’t always reflect the reality of the situation. Would you be willing to consider a different perspective? For example, what if others are more understanding than you think, or that you have something valuable to contribute to conversations?

User: I suppose that’s possible. It’s just hard to see it that way when I feel so anxious. 

Consultant: Absolutely, and your feelings are valid. Let’s take a small step. Can we brainstorm a simple social situation you could try? Maybe something low-pressure where you could practice connecting with others?

User: Maybe I could join a study group for one of my classes. That way, it’s more about learning, and I wouldn’t feel so much pressure to socialize. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Joining a study group can provide a structured way to interact with others without the pressure of typical social settings. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also a little excited. I want to try it. 

Consultant: That’s a good combination of feelings to have. It shows that you’re open to new experiences even if there’s some anxiety involved. What strategies can you use to ease your nerves before joining the group?

User: Maybe I could prepare some questions to ask, so I have something ready if I don’t know what to say. 

Consultant: Preparing questions is a wonderful strategy! It gives you confidence and a conversation starter. Shall we come up with a few questions you could use to help break the ice?

User: Sure! I could ask about what they think of the last class we had or if they understand any specific topics. 

Consultant: Those are excellent questions, as they both express interest in others and can lead to further discussion. How do you feel about trying these questions when you meet the group?

User: I think I can try that. It makes the idea feel a bit less daunting. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It’s all about taking small, manageable steps. After trying out the study group, we can reflect on how it went and adjust our strategies if necessary. 

User: Yeah, I like that. I’m looking forward to it. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Another important aspect we can work on is your confidence in expressing yourself. How do you feel about practicing some role-playing scenarios together to help you prepare for these interactions?

User: Role-playing sounds a bit awkward but also helpful. I could see how it might work to boost my confidence. 

Consultant: It might feel odd at first, but it can really help you become more comfortable in real-life situations. Let’s try a simple scenario. Imagine you’re meeting someone for the first time. How would you introduce yourself?

User: I’d probably say, “Hi, I’m XX. I’m studying engineering. What about you?” 

Consultant: That’s a solid introduction! It’s straightforward, and it invites the other person to share about themselves. Great job! How do you feel saying that out loud?

User: It feels okay, I think. I could practice that a bit more to feel even better. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing is a key step in building confidence. Each time you try, it will get easier. How about setting a goal to practice this introduction a few times before your study group meeting?

User: I can do that. It doesn’t seem too overwhelming now. 

Consultant: That's the spirit! Remember, it's a gradual process. Each effort you make is a chance to grow your social skills. As we approach our session's end, how would you summarize your feelings going into this new experience?

User: I feel a mix of nerves and excitement, but I also feel like I have some tools to help manage the anxiety. I really want to try it! 

Consultant: That's a wonderful mindset to have! Your willingness to step outside your comfort zone is commendable. Before we wrap up, what’s one thing you can do this week to continue building on what we discussed?

User: I think I’ll try to connect with a few classmates online before the study group, just to warm up a bit. 

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Engaging with classmates will help prime you for the group. You’re making great strides, and I’m proud of you. Remember, I’m here for you as you navigate this journey.

User: Thank you! I appreciate all of this. I'll see how it goes and let you know in our next session.

Consultant: I look forward to hearing how it goes. Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself along the way! 

User: Bye! I feel much better now.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling about your recent experiences in social activities?

User: Hello. I've been trying to engage more with my classmates since I started volunteering. It's been kind of nice, but sometimes I still feel a bit awkward.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're making an effort to connect with your classmates! Feeling awkward at times is completely normal, especially when trying something new. Can you tell me more about those moments—what usually goes through your mind during those interactions?

User: Well, sometimes I think they're not really interested in what I have to say, so I get nervous and just say a few words. 

Consultant: It sounds like you might be feeling a bit self-conscious about how others perceive you. What kind of feelings does that bring up for you, when you're in those situations?

User: I feel kind of anxious and then I just want to disappear. But sometimes when I do engage, people seem to respond positively, which is nice.

Consultant: That's a really important observation—recognizing that there are positive interactions too. Let's focus on those moments. When you feel that positive response from others, how does that impact your confidence?

User: It boosts my confidence a bit, but then I start worrying again about the next time I talk to them.

Consultant: That cycle of feeling confident and then anxious again is very common. It seems like acknowledging those positive moments could be really helpful. What do you think might help you remember those successful interactions when you're feeling anxious about the next one?

User: I could try to remind myself about the nice things people said to me after our conversations. 

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Keeping those supportive moments in mind could help counter the anxious thoughts. Can we explore some specific examples of positive feedback you've received recently and how that made you feel?

User: Sure, last week during a group project, a classmate told me I gave a good idea that really helped. That felt awesome.

Consultant: That is fantastic! It seems like that moment made a significant impact on you. How might you leverage that experience in future social interactions to help ground yourself in confidence?

User: Maybe I can think about that feedback before I talk to someone. It could calm me down.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s an excellent plan. Bringing that positive experience into your thoughts beforehand could help ease your anxiety. Are there other social goals you'd like to set for yourself moving forward?

User: I want to start more conversations and not just wait for others to approach me. 

Consultant: That’s a positive goal! What are some small steps you could take to initiate conversations with others?

User: I could try asking classmates about their projects or interests. It sounds easy enough.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful approach! Starting with questions about shared interests can definitely open up the dialogue. How do you currently feel about putting that into practice?

User: I feel a bit nervous thinking about it, but I also think it's possible.

Consultant: That’s a very balanced perspective! It’s totally normal to feel some nerves. It might be helpful to remember that just like your previous positive experiences, many conversations can lead to good outcomes. Would you like to practice how you might initiate a conversation?

User: Sure! I could say something like, "Hey, I heard you're working on that project. What’s your take on it?"

Consultant: That’s a great opening! It’s friendly and shows your interest. Practicing these kinds of statements can help build your confidence. After trying this out, how would you evaluate your experience? 

User: I think I would note how the other person responds. If they seem interested, that would encourage me.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Focusing on the response of others while reflecting on your own feelings can be really insightful. Remember, it's a gradual process. How else do you think you could reinforce the positive feelings from these interactions?

User: Maybe keeping a journal to write down positive interactions would help me remember them.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Journaling can provide you with a tangible record of positive experiences, and reflecting on those can enhance your confidence. How do you feel about committing to that after our discussion today?

User: I think I can do that. It should help me remind myself of the good experiences.

Consultant: I'm sure it will! As we wrap up today, let's briefly summarize what you've learned and how you'll move forward. You’ve acknowledged your feelings of anxiety, identified positive moments, and set clear goals to initiate conversations. Does that sound right to you?

User: Yes, that sounds accurate. I feel more motivated thinking about these steps.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! I believe these strategies will support you in your journey towards enhancing your social interactions. Remember, you’re not alone in this, and you’ve made significant progress. If you ever need to revisit these topics, feel free to come back. You've got this!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’m looking forward to trying these things out.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm excited for you too. Take care, and I look forward to hearing how it goes next time we meet.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been trying to focus more on my studies. I feel like I've made some progress in reflecting on my learning, but I still find it hard to create a structured study plan.

Consultant: That's great to hear that you're reflecting on your progress! It shows you are becoming more aware of your academic journey. Can you share a bit more about what kind of structure you envision for your study plan?

User: I guess I want to have a clear daily schedule that helps me allocate time for each subject. I just get a bit overwhelmed thinking about it.

Consultant: It sounds like you recognize the importance of having a plan, but the idea of creating one feels overwhelming. Let’s explore that deeper—what specifically overwhelms you when you think about scheduling your studies?

User: Well, I worry that I won't stick to the plan or that it won't work out as I hope. I sometimes feel that I'm not disciplined enough. 

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. You’re concerned about your ability to follow through with the plan. Let’s take a moment to consider how you’ve managed to stay focused in the past. Can you recall any times when your discipline shone through?

User: Actually, there were times when I had deadlines for projects, and I was able to finish them on time. I guess I just need that kind of pressure to motivate myself.

Consultant: That’s an important insight! You’ve demonstrated discipline when there’s a deadline in place. We could look at setting smaller, similar deadlines for your study goals, creating a bit of that pressure in a more manageable way. What do you think about that idea?

User: That sounds doable. I think I can try to set smaller goals and deadlines for myself.

Consultant: Excellent! Setting smaller goals can make the process less daunting. What subjects do you find most challenging, and which ones do you enjoy more?

User: I find math pretty challenging, but I enjoy my programming classes. 

Consultant: It’s great to know what excites you! Perhaps we can use your interest in programming to motivate you during those tougher times with math. How about turning your study sessions into a mix of both? 

User: That might work. I could start with programming to get in the mood and then switch to math.

Consultant: That sounds like an exciting plan! By starting with something you enjoy, it might help ease the transition into more challenging subjects. Let’s also think about how to keep track of your progress with this new plan. How do you think you can monitor your study time and achievements?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal or an app to log my hours and what I accomplish each day.

Consultant: Keeping a journal or using an app can definitely help you stay accountable! It allows you to reflect on your daily achievements and reinforces your sense of progress. How do you feel about starting that process?

User: I think I can do that. It feels motivating to see my progress visually.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! Seeing your progress can boost your motivation and self-efficacy. As you embark on this challenge, how do you plan to handle days when motivation dips? 

User: I guess I could remind myself of my goals or review my accomplishments to keep myself motivated.

Consultant: That’s a wise strategy! Reminding yourself of your goals and reflecting on your past accomplishments can definitely reignite your motivation. Let's also discuss balancing your academic life with social activities. How do you feel about group study sessions or joining a study group?

User: I haven't really thought about that. I usually study alone, but it could be nice to connect with others.

Consultant: Group study sessions can provide you with support and motivation, plus they can enhance your understanding of the material. Would you be open to exploring that option?

User: Yes, I think that would help me feel more connected and less isolated while studying.

Consultant: I’m glad you see the potential benefits! It can really enrich your learning experience. Let’s set a target for when you'd like to start reaching out to peers for study sessions. What feels reasonable for you?

User: Maybe in the next week or two, I can reach out to some classmates.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Setting a timeline can keep you accountable. As you prepare to take these steps, how are you feeling overall about entering a more structured academic routine?

User: I’m feeling more optimistic. It feels good to have a plan in mind and to think about connecting with others.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Optimism can be a powerful driver of success. Just remember, it’s okay to have setbacks along the way; what matters is learning from them. Let’s also consider strategies for managing stress, especially if things don't go as planned. What will you do on a tough day?

User: I could take breaks, maybe go for a walk, or listen to music to relax.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Taking breaks and engaging in relaxing activities can help mitigate stress. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on the progress you’ve made. What would you say is your main takeaway from our conversation?

User: I realize that having a structured approach to my studies and reaching out to connect with others can significantly help me. I feel like I'm starting to find my way.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic takeaway! You’re on a promising path, and it’s great to see you embracing these changes. Remember, integrating these strategies into your daily routine may take time, but you’re already making strides. If challenges arise, I’m here to help. Our next session can be a good time to discuss your progress. 

User: Thank you! I feel good about our session and what’s to come.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! I believe in your ability to manage this journey effectively. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you again! How have you been since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty good. Joining the study group has been helpful. I really see the value of teamwork now.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like participating in the group has had a positive impact on you. Can you share more about how it has helped with your studies and social interactions?

User: Well, working with others makes studying less overwhelming. We can bounce ideas off each other, and it's nice to have support. My grades have improved a bit too.

Consultant: Collaboration can indeed make studying more manageable. I'm glad to hear your grades are improving! How do you feel about your contributions to the group? 

User: I feel a bit hesitant sometimes, but I’ve been trying to speak up more. It’s just that my thoughts come out slower than everyone else's.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel that way, especially in a group setting. It’s important to remember that your perspective is valuable too. What strategies do you think you could use to build more confidence in sharing your ideas?

User: Maybe I could prepare a bit before the meetings? If I have key points to discuss, I might feel more confident.

Consultant: Preparing in advance is a great idea! That way, you'll feel more ready to contribute. Have you tried this strategy yet? 

User: Not yet, but I think I will for our next meeting. 

Consultant: That's a positive step! How do you feel about balancing your game time with the study group activities? You mentioned you’ve been controlling your game time better.

User: Yeah, I've been spending less time gaming. It's easier to focus on studying when I know I'm not wasting time on games.

Consultant: That's great progress! It shows you're making conscious choices about how you spend your time. How do you feel when you're able to manage your gaming and study commitments?

User: I feel a sense of achievement. It’s nice to see that I can control my time better. 

Consultant: That sense of achievement is really important! Let’s explore how you can maintain this balance moving forward. What do you think would help you stay motivated to prioritize your studies and social interactions?

User: I guess setting small goals might help? Like finishing some study material before playing games. 

Consultant: Setting small, achievable goals is an excellent strategy! It can help you stay focused while also allowing yourself to enjoy leisure time without guilt. Can you think of a specific goal you want to set for the upcoming week?

User: Maybe I could aim to finish two chapters from my textbook before the weekends. 

Consultant: That sounds like a realistic and manageable goal. How do you plan to reward yourself for achieving this goal? 

User: I could allow myself some extra gaming time if I finish those chapters. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic way to create a positive reinforcement cycle! When you combine study goals with enjoyable activities, it can keep you motivated. What are some other activities you enjoy doing besides gaming?

User: I like to read about current events. It’s interesting to see how things connect with what we learn in class.

Consultant: Reading about current events is a great way to stay informed and can enhance your understanding of your studies as well. How do you feel this can be incorporated into your routine along with the study group?

User: I think I could dedicate some time after studying to read articles. It might also give me new topics to discuss with the group.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! By integrating your interests, you can deepen your knowledge and bring fresh perspectives to the group discussions. How does that resonate with you?

User: It feels exciting! I like the idea of sharing new insights with classmates. 

Consultant: Excellent! I’m glad you find it exciting. As we near the end of our session today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed. You've shared positive experiences about the study group, established goals for balancing study and gaming, and found ways to enrich your discussions with current events.

User: Yes, everything feels clearer now. 

Consultant: I'm pleased to hear that! As you move forward, remember to keep track of your progress towards those goals. What strategies will you use to maintain your motivation and keep growing?

User: I’ll keep setting and achieving small goals and try to stay engaged in discussions. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! You’re doing really well at finding ways to navigate your studies and social life. If you ever feel stuck or need support, remember I’m here to help. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support.

Consultant: You're very welcome! This concludes our session today. I'll be here if you need to talk again. Keep up the great work, and take care!

User: Bye! I will.
