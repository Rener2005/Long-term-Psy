Consultant: Hello, Long! I'm glad you're here today. I understand that you've been facing some challenges lately. Can you share how you're feeling right now?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite overwhelmed. A few days ago, I ran into some former friends from my past, and it stirred a lot of anxiety in me. I’m worried about relapsing, and I just feel lost about my future.

Consultant: I see. It's completely normal to feel anxious when you're reminded of past triggers, especially in your situation. Let's discuss those feelings a bit more. What specific thoughts were running through your mind when you met your former friends?

User: I kept thinking about how easy it would be to fall back into old habits. I felt this strong pull, like I was standing on the edge, and I could just plunge back into that lifestyle. It frightens me.

Consultant: That sounds very distressing, Long. It seems like you're experiencing a lot of fear regarding the possibility of relapse. Can you tell me what emotions accompany those thoughts? How do they make you feel physically and emotionally?

User: I feel this tightness in my chest and my stomach churns. Emotionally, I feel hopeless and scared, like I’m losing control. I want to stay on the right path, but those feelings are hard to shake off.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when those thoughts arise. Let’s take a moment to identify what’s happening in your mind. When you think about potentially relapsing, do any specific negative beliefs come to the surface? 

User: I often think that I’m not strong enough to resist temptation. I doubt my ability to stay sober, and that makes everything feel more daunting.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you might be experiencing some cognitive distortions, like all-or-nothing thinking. Do you think there’s another way to view your strength in this situation? 

User: Maybe I could think of myself as someone who is learning to cope, instead of someone who has to be perfect all the time. It’s just hard to see it like that.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Long. Recognizing that you’re on a journey and that it’s okay to have setbacks might help ease some of the pressure you're feeling. How can we reframe that fear of not being strong enough?

User: I guess I could focus on small victories instead of expecting to be perfect. Every day I remain sober is a win, right?

Consultant: Absolutely! Each day of staying sober is definitely a victory. Let’s build on that. Can we brainstorm some smaller, achievable goals that you can focus on daily to reinforce this mindset?

User: I could start by setting a goal to call someone from my support group every week. That could help me stay connected and accountable.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Connecting with others can provide great support. Now, besides reaching out to your support group, what are some activities you enjoy that could help keep your mind occupied?

User: I used to enjoy drawing and playing video games, but I haven’t done them in a while. I think I’d like to give them another try.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Engaging in hobbies can provide a positive outlet for your emotions and help reduce stress. How about we set a goal for you to incorporate drawing and gaming into your routine this week?

User: Yes, I could aim to draw a few times a week and play video games on the weekends. That feels manageable.

Consultant: Excellent! Setting achievable goals is key to building confidence. Now, let’s shift a bit towards your family situation. You mentioned earlier that your relationships with your parents and sisters are tense. Can you share more about that?

User: It’s just really hard at home. My parents don’t really understand what I’m going through or how to support me. I feel like I’m always walking on eggshells.

Consultant: That sounds quite challenging. Feeling misunderstood can be very isolating. Have there been moments when you’ve tried to express your feelings to them?

User: I tried once, but I felt like they didn’t really listen. They just worry about me and it makes me feel even more helpless.

Consultant: It’s tough when you feel your feelings aren’t acknowledged. What if we think of ways to communicate your needs more clearly? What could you say to help them understand your perspective?

User: Maybe I could explain how their worry affects me and ask them for their support in a different way, rather than just worrying.

Consultant: That’s a constructive approach! Framing your request for support can help them understand what you need from them. Are you willing to try discussing this with them?

User: I’m scared, but I think it might help. I’ll try to have that conversation soon.

Consultant: That’s a positive step! Remember to be gentle with yourself during this process. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on the progress you’ve made. What do you feel has been your biggest takeaway?

User: I realized that I can take small steps to feel more in control, and that I don’t have to face everything alone.

Consultant: Exactly! You're taking important steps toward building your self-efficacy. Keep reminding yourself of those small victories. If you find yourself struggling, remember that reaching out for support is a strength, not a weakness. I'm here to help you in this journey.

User: Thank you. I appreciate that.

Consultant: You're welcome, Long! I'm confident that you can navigate these challenges. Our next session will continue to explore ways for you to strengthen your support system and continue on your path. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello! I’m glad you’re here for this session. How are you feeling today, and what would you like to talk about?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling quite down lately. There was a big argument with my family, and it seems like I can’t get through to them. I just want some understanding and support from them.

Consultant: It sounds really tough, feeling misunderstood by your family. Can you tell me more about what happened during that argument and how it made you feel?

User: We were discussing my situation, and it escalated quickly. They just don’t seem to understand what I’m going through, and it left me feeling really frustrated and alone.

Consultant: That sounds really frustrating. Wanting support from your family is completely natural, especially when you’re dealing with so much. How do you think this situation has impacted your feelings about your progress?

User: I feel like I’m struggling on my own. I want to be better and move forward, but it feels like I’m being held back by their lack of support.

Consultant: I can see how that would make you feel stuck. It sounds like building a better communication channel with your family could help. What do you think is the biggest barrier in your communication with them?

User: They don’t listen to me. I feel like they jump to conclusions and don’t really hear what I’m trying to say.

Consultant: So it feels like there's a lack of active listening on their part. What do you think might help you express yourself in a way that they can hear and understand?

User: I guess I could try being more calm and clear, but it’s difficult when I’m feeling so overwhelmed.

Consultant: It is definitely challenging when emotions run high. Let's explore some strategies together to help you communicate more clearly. Could we try a role-play where you explain your feelings to them? 

User: Sure, that sounds like a good idea.

Consultant: Great! Think about how you would start the conversation. What would you want to say first?

User: I would probably start by saying that I want to feel supported and understood. 

Consultant: That’s a solid start. How about if you express that feeling first, rather than jumping into the specifics? This might help them understand your perspective better. What do you think?

User: Yeah, that makes sense. If I focus on my feelings first, maybe they’ll be more empathetic.

Consultant: Exactly! Expressing your emotions can open up a more meaningful conversation. What might be some specific feelings you could share with them?

User: I think I would tell them that I feel anxious and alone when they don’t understand me. 

Consultant: That’s very honest and can create a connection. Would you practice saying that out loud?

User: Sure. “I feel anxious and alone when you don’t understand me.” It feels a bit vulnerable, but I see how it could help.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel vulnerable. Expressing emotions takes courage, but it can also lead to deeper connections. How do you think your family might respond to that?

User: I hope they might be more open to listening if they realize how I feel.

Consultant: Yes! It’s possible they’ll be more receptive. What if they respond defensively? How do you think you could handle that?

User: I guess I could remind them that I really just need their support right now and that I'm trying to open up.

Consultant: That sounds like a good strategy. Reinforcing your need for support might help redirect the conversation. What other strategies could you try if they become defensive?

User: Maybe I could take a break from the conversation if it gets too heated, to give us both time to cool off.

Consultant: Taking a break is a great idea! It allows for a pause to reflect. How can you communicate the need for a break without shutting down the conversation?

User: I could say something like, “I need a moment to gather my thoughts; can we take a short break?” 

Consultant: That’s a respectful way to pause the discussion. Remember, it’s okay to prioritize your feelings in that moment. How are you feeling about this plan?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Having a plan makes me feel more in control.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Feeling in control can greatly influence your confidence. As we prepare to wrap up, how do you plan to implement these strategies in your next conversation with your family?

User: I think I'll write down my feelings and practice what to say, so I know I’m prepared when I talk to them.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Writing things down can clarify your thoughts. As we finish today’s session, what are your biggest takeaways?

User: I learned that expressing my feelings clearly could help my family understand me better, and the importance of having a plan for tough conversations.

Consultant: Absolutely! You've made some great insights today. Remember, it takes time and practice to communicate effectively. I'm here to support you in this journey. If you ever feel overwhelmed, feel free to reach out again. You're making progress towards a stronger family connection.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help. I'll definitely keep these strategies in mind.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care and believe in yourself!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Long! I'm glad to see you today. I know that we've been working on building your job confidence and skills. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling pretty overwhelmed. I keep doubting my abilities and worrying whether I can really find a job. It's really frustrating.

Consultant: I understand that feeling of being overwhelmed can be really tough. It sounds like you're struggling with doubts about your abilities. Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you about finding a job?

User: I just feel like I don't have any skills that employers want. I've been out of work for so long, and I haven't really been doing anything constructive.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel that way, especially after a long time away from work. Let’s take a moment to really assess your skills. What have you done in the past or what activities have you engaged in that you think could be relevant to a job?

User: Well, I have some experience in manual labor jobs, like construction work. But I doubt those jobs are available for me now, and I don't think I'm strong enough anymore.

Consultant: It sounds like you do have some experience, even if it's not in a traditional sense. Let's examine that a bit further. What aspects of your past jobs did you enjoy or feel you were good at?

User: I liked working with my hands, and I felt accomplished when I completed a task. But I worry again that I won't be able to perform like I used to.

Consultant: I hear you, Long. It's understandable to have those concerns about performance. What if we considered your past accomplishments and how you could apply that work ethic to any job you pursue now? 

User: I guess I could look at it that way. But each time I think about applying for something, those negative thoughts creep in.

Consultant: Those negative thoughts can definitely be a barrier. It's important to recognize them. Can you share one specific negative thought that comes up when you think about applying for jobs?

User: I often think, "I'm not good enough," or "No one will hire someone like me."

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. Let's challenge that thought together. What evidence supports the idea that you're not good enough or that no one would hire you?

User: Well, I can’t think of any job offers I’ve received recently or how I could even compete with others who have better qualifications.

Consultant: It can feel discouraging when we fixate on what hasn't happened. But can we consider alternative explanations? What skills or attributes do you have that could make you a valuable candidate?

User: I guess I can work hard, and I'm reliable. And I have a good understanding of how to complete physical tasks efficiently.

Consultant: Those are great qualities, Long! Reliability and a strong work ethic are highly valued. If a friend were in your position, how might you encourage them to look at their strengths and the potential opportunities available?

User: I suppose I would tell them to focus on what they can do and be confident in their ability to learn new skills. 

Consultant: That's a useful perspective! Now, let’s apply that to you. If you were to think positively about your ability to learn and adapt, what would you tell yourself?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that everyone has to start somewhere, and I can learn new things too.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a powerful affirmation. Now, let’s think about some practical steps you can take to prepare for job hunting. What’s one small action you could commit to this week that will help you build your confidence?

User: I guess I could start looking up some training programs. It might help me improve my skills and boost my confidence.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan, Long! Engaging in a training program could really enhance your skills and help you feel more equipped for job opportunities. What kind of programs are you considering?

User: I’ve seen some courses on construction and general labor skills that seem interesting. 

Consultant: That sounds promising! Would you like to set a specific goal for how many programs you'd like to explore this week?

User: Maybe I could aim for looking up two or three programs to see the options available.

Consultant: That’s a solid goal. By doing this, you’re taking active steps towards your growth. How do you feel about this plan moving forward?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Having a direction helps me feel less stuck.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time. As you continue exploring training programs this week, how do you think you can maintain this hopeful attitude?

User: I think I need to remind myself of the positive qualities I discovered and how I'm trying to change my situation.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Reflection on your strengths can empower you. Before we wrap up today, what do you think will be the most significant takeaway from our session?

User: I think realizing that I actually have skills and can learn more is my biggest takeaway. 

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight to carry with you. I'm proud of you for recognizing this! Keep believing in yourself, and when we meet next, we can discuss what you've discovered about those training programs. You’re making progress, Long. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here for you. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your next steps in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Long! I'm glad you're here for this session. I've seen some positive steps you've taken recently, and it sounds like you're feeling slightly more confident. Can you share how you've been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hello. Yes, I've been feeling a bit better. Participating in the skill training course makes me feel hopeful about finding a job. It's nice to have something to focus on.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Focusing on something constructive can really help boost your confidence. What specific skills are you learning in the training course, and how do you feel about them?

User: I'm learning basic computer skills and some customer service techniques. At first, I was nervous, but the more I practice, the more comfortable I feel. It's nice to see some progress.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really pushing through those initial nerves and making progress. How does this newfound comfort in practicing these skills affect your outlook on potential job opportunities?

User: I think it makes me feel a bit more prepared. But I still worry that my past might hold me back, and I fear I might not perform well in interviews.

Consultant: It's completely natural to have those worries, especially after what you've been through. Let's explore those feelings a bit more. What thoughts come to mind when you think about your past and how it might affect your job search?

User: I think people might judge me for my past, and that I won't be given a fair chance. It feels discouraging sometimes.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Long. It's understandable to feel that way, especially when facing something as challenging as job interviews. Could we try to reframe that thinking? What evidence do you have that suggests people might judge you unfairly?

User: Well, I guess it's mostly my assumption. I haven’t had many job interviews yet, so I might be jumping to conclusions.

Consultant: That's a really insightful observation! It sounds like you might be making some assumptions based on limited experiences. If a friend were in your position, what advice would you give them about facing judgement during interviews?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on their skills and what they bring to the table. Also, to remember that everyone has a past, and it doesn't define who they are now.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on your strengths and what you’ve learned can be empowering. Considering what you've just said, how might you shift your focus in an interview to emphasize your skills and the progress you've made?

User: Maybe I could practice translating my experiences into skills I’ve developed, like resilience and adaptability. Those are important in any job, right?

Consultant: Absolutely! Resilience and adaptability are highly valued traits. It could be helpful to prepare a few examples of how you've shown these traits in your training or daily life. How comfortable do you feel about practicing some interview questions together?

User: I think that could help! I’m a bit nervous, but I'm willing to give it a try.

Consultant: That’s a great attitude! Let’s start with a common interview question: "Why do you want to work here?" How would you approach that question, knowing everything you’ve accomplished lately?

User: I’d say that I’m excited to bring my skills and experience to the team. I want to contribute positively and grow within the company.

Consultant: That's a fantastic response! It's clear and confident, and it emphasizes your eagerness to contribute. How do you feel after practicing that response?

User: I feel a little more relaxed. It helps to think about what I can offer instead of my worries.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Focusing on your strengths can really shift your mindset. What other interview questions do you find challenging that we could work on together?

User: I find questions about my weaknesses really tough. I don't want to sound like I'm making excuses.

Consultant: That’s a common concern! A useful approach is to frame your weaknesses in a way that shows your awareness and your efforts to improve. For example, you might say, "I tend to get anxious in new situations, but I’m working on this by taking training courses and seeking opportunities to engage with others." How does that sound to you?

User: That does sound helpful! It lets them see my commitment to improving myself.

Consultant: Exactly! It shows your growth mindset. As we prepare for potential interviews, let’s also discuss how to manage any anxiety you might experience. What do you currently do when you feel anxious?

User: I usually just try to distract myself, but it doesn’t always help. Sometimes I just get overwhelmed.

Consultant: It's understandable that distractions aren't always effective. Would you be open to trying some breathing exercises or mindfulness techniques that might help you ground yourself during anxious moments?

User: I’m willing to try anything that might help!

Consultant: Great! Deep breathing can be really effective. For instance, you can try inhaling deeply for a count of four, holding for four, and exhaling for four. We can practice this together right now. Ready?

User: Sure, let’s do it!

Consultant: Let's take a deep breath in together. One, two, three, four, and hold. One, two, three, four, and now exhale. One, two, three, four. How did that feel?

User: It felt calming. I think I could use that before an interview.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Incorporating these techniques can help you feel more centered. As we wrap up today, let's summarize what we've discussed. You’ve identified key skills, practiced interview questions, and learned some anxiety relief techniques. How do you feel about your preparations now?

User: I feel more optimistic. I need to keep practicing, but I think I can do this.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. You’ve made great strides, and I believe in your abilities. For our next session, let’s discuss how your practice has gone and any new challenges you face. How does that sound?

User: That sounds perfect! I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: Wonderful! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress. Remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way. Take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Long! I'm glad you're here for today's session. Let's chat about how you're feeling about the upcoming interview.

User: Hi! I'm feeling quite optimistic because I completed the skills course, and I have the opportunity for an interview. But I still worry that I might not perform well and that it could affect the outcome.

Consultant: It's great to hear you're feeling optimistic about the interview. What would a successful performance look like for you? How would you like to feel when you walk into that interview?

User: I want to feel confident and articulate. I hope to convey my skills well and leave a good impression.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid goal. Confidence can make a big difference. Can you share what specific aspects of the interview process make you feel anxious?

User: I get anxious when I think about potential questions they might ask and whether I’ll be able to respond appropriately.

Consultant: That’s a common feeling, and it's okay to have those worries. What are some of the questions you're most concerned about?

User: I'm particularly worried about questions about my past and how I’ll explain my previous issues with drug use without it negatively impacting their impression of me.

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry about that part. We can work on how to frame your experiences positively. What are some skills or strengths you have that you can highlight during the interview?

User: I think my technical skills have improved a lot, and I’ve also learned to work better in teams thanks to the course. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Emphasizing your growth and teamwork can be valuable. How can we practice talking about your strengths in a way that connects to your past experiences?

User: Maybe I could mention how overcoming those challenges has made me resilient and more focused on my goals.

Consultant: Exactly! Highlighting your resilience shows strength. Let’s try a role-play; I can ask you a typical interview question, and you can respond as if you were in the interview. How does that sound?

User: Sounds good! I’m ready.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start. “Can you tell me about a time you faced a significant challenge and how you dealt with it?”

User: Well, I faced a significant challenge when dealing with my past substance use. It affected many aspects of my life, but through community support and personal dedication, I managed to regain focus and improve my skills.

Consultant: That’s a very honest response! It shows growth. What if we frame it even more positively by highlighting how these experiences have made you a better candidate for the job?

User: I guess I could say that the challenge taught me valuable lessons about perseverance and the importance of self-improvement, which I know will benefit me in the workplace.

Consultant: Absolutely! That makes your story powerful and relatable. How do you feel now about presenting this narrative during the interview?

User: I feel a bit more confident about it. Talking it through helps me see it in a better light.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! What other scenarios or questions do you think we should practice to boost your confidence even more?

User: I think practicing typical behavioral questions would help, like teamwork and conflict resolution.

Consultant: That's a great idea. Let’s go with a teamwork question. “Can you describe a situation where you had to work closely with others to achieve a goal?”

User: Sure! In my course, we had group projects where we all had to contribute equally. I learned to communicate better and support my team, which made us successful.

Consultant: Excellent response! It shows your ability to collaborate. How do you feel about your ability to convey these positive experiences now?

User: I feel much better about it. I can see that I have valuable experiences to share.

Consultant: Fantastic! It’s important to recognize your strengths. As we approach your interview, let’s also discuss how to manage any anxiety that might come up before and during the interview. How do you typically cope with nerves?

User: I usually just try to distract myself, but it doesn’t always help. 

Consultant: Distracting yourself can be useful, but let’s also explore relaxation techniques you can use, such as deep breathing or visualization. Would you like to try one together?

User: Yes, I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Let’s do some deep breathing together. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold it for four, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for four. Ready? 

User: Okay, let’s do it.

Consultant: Inhale… hold… exhale. How does that feel?

User: It feels calming. I think I can use this before my interview.

Consultant: That’s great! You can practice this technique whenever you start to feel anxious. As we wrap up today’s session, what are some key takeaways you want to remember as you prepare for your interview?

User: I’d like to remember to focus on my strengths and how my past has shaped me positively, and to use relaxation techniques to manage my nerves.

Consultant: That sounds like a strong plan! You've made great progress today. Remember, you have the skills and determination to succeed. How are you feeling now about your upcoming interview?

User: I feel more confident, actually. I think I can handle this now!

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! You’ve worked hard, and I believe you’ll do great. If any concerns come up as the interview approaches, feel free to revisit these strategies. I wish you the best of luck!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’ll definitely reach out if I need more support.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Long! I'm pleased to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling surprisingly good. I recently got a job, and I’m really happy about it. My relationship with my family has improved a bit too. 

Consultant: That sounds great to hear! It seems like you've made some positive changes in your life. Can you share more about how your job has been going and any specific moments that made you feel good about it?

User: Sure! The first few days at work went really well. I felt confident, and my coworkers were nice. There was even a moment when I received positive feedback from my manager, which made me feel great.

Consultant: Receiving positive feedback is really uplifting! It’s wonderful to see you feel more confident. How did that acknowledgment from your manager affect your feelings about the work you do?

User: It made me realize that I can actually do this job and that people believe in me. I didn’t expect to feel so empowered, but it really motivated me to keep going.

Consultant: That empowerment is an important feeling as you embark on this new path. How about your family relationships? You mentioned that they have improved. Can you elaborate on that?

User: Yes, we’re getting along better. I've been trying to communicate more with my parents. They seem to appreciate my effort, and there are moments when we have good conversations. 

Consultant: That's a significant step forward. It’s wonderful to hear that you’re putting effort into communication. What strategies have you used that you think have contributed to this improvement in family dynamics?

User: I’ve been patient and tried to listen more. I also share my experiences from work with them, which has opened up some nice discussions.

Consultant: Listening and sharing your experiences are excellent ways to build understanding and trust in relationships. How do you feel about this progress you've made with your family and work?

User: I feel proud and relieved. It’s nice to see that I can change things for the better. However, I still worry sometimes about whether this will last.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to have those worries, especially when you’re experiencing significant changes. Let's explore those concerns more deeply. What particular aspects of your current situation make you feel uncertain about the future?

User: I guess I worry that I might slip back into my old habits if things get stressful, especially with family dynamics.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, Long. Let’s think about some strategies to help you maintain your progress. What coping mechanisms or support systems do you currently have in place to deal with stress when it arises?

User: I have been talking to a few friends who are supportive. They understand what I've been through, and I find it helpful to share my concerns with them.

Consultant: It’s great that you have supportive friends to talk to. Maintaining that connection can be really helpful during stressful times. Have you considered setting any specific goals for yourself to further strengthen your coping strategies?

User: I haven't thought of specific goals, but I’d like to keep things in check. Maybe I could set weekly check-ins with myself to evaluate how I'm doing.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Weekly check-ins can help you reflect on your progress and identify any potential challenges early on. How do you feel about implementing this strategy?

User: I think I can do that. It would give me a better perspective on my thoughts and feelings.

Consultant: Absolutely, it will provide a structured way to monitor your emotional well-being. As we close this session, let’s summarize the main points we discussed today. You mentioned your job and family relationships are improving, and you plan to implement weekly self-check-ins. Does that capture what you want to focus on?

User: Yes, it does! I feel like I have a clearer plan moving forward.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Long! Remember, it’s all about progress, and you’re already making significant strides. You have built a solid foundation. As we conclude today, how do you feel about everything we've talked about?

User: I feel hopeful and more empowered. Talking about my experiences and strategies really helps solidify my confidence.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’ve made great progress, and it’s commendable. Keep holding onto that hope and empowerment as you move forward. If you find any challenges arise, know that I’m here to support you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance and support. I'll see you next time!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to our next session. Take care and keep up the great work!
