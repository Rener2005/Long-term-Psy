Consultant: Hello Qianqian! I'm really glad to see you again today. I understand you've been going through a tough time. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! Honestly, I've still been feeling really overwhelmed. The pressure from school and my dad's disappointment is weighing heavily on me. I sometimes just feel like I can't handle it anymore.

Consultant: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders. The pressure to perform well in school, especially with your father's reactions, can be really challenging. Could you share a bit more about what specific thoughts are making you feel overwhelmed?

User: I keep thinking that I'm a failure because my grades have dropped. It's hard not to feel like I've let everyone down, especially my dad.

Consultant: That sounds really painful. It’s common to feel like a failure when we face obstacles, but I want to explore that thought with you. What evidence do you have that means you are a failure?

User: I guess because my grades aren't what they used to be, and I just can't seem to keep up with everything. I feel like I should be doing better.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel this way, especially with the changes you’ve faced. But let’s consider—are there any factors outside of your control that might be affecting your grades and how you feel right now?

User: Yes, I lost my tutoring sessions, and it’s been really hard to adjust. I try to study by myself, but I often get distracted or anxious.

Consultant: Losing that support can indeed make things significantly harder. Let’s talk more about those feelings of distraction and anxiety. What thoughts run through your mind when you try to study?

User: I often think that I won’t remember anything I read or that my efforts are pointless. It just feels so hopeless sometimes.

Consultant: Those thoughts can create a cycle of anxiety, making it harder to study. Let’s challenge that idea—what would you say to a friend who felt the same way?

User: I would probably tell her that she's trying her best and that it’s okay to have setbacks. I wouldn’t want her to be so hard on herself.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective. It’s interesting how we can be kinder to others than we are to ourselves. How might your feelings change if you practiced that same kindness towards yourself?

User: I suppose I would feel a bit better. It makes sense, but it’s hard to remember that in the moment.

Consultant: Absolutely, it can be very challenging. It might help to keep reminders of that kindness visible. Also, let’s think about some healthy ways to express what you’re feeling. Have you considered journaling or engaging in art to express your emotions?

User: I used to enjoy drawing, but I haven't done that in a while. I can see how it might help me let my feelings out.

Consultant: That's a great insight! Drawing could be a wonderful outlet for your emotions. How about we set a small goal for you to start drawing again this week? Even just for a few minutes could make a difference.

User: That sounds manageable. I could try to draw something every day, even if it’s just for a few minutes.

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a great step. It’s all about finding moments of relief. As we move forward, let’s also think about your family relationship. How do you feel about discussing your experiences with your parents?

User: I really want them to understand me, but I fear they might just think I’m being dramatic or difficult.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious about sharing your feelings, especially when you’re worried about their reactions. What would it take for you to feel comfortable expressing yourself to them?

User: Maybe if I can gather my thoughts better, or write them down first before talking to them. That might help, I think.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Writing down your feelings can often help clarify what you want to communicate and make you feel more confident. Do you think you could try that before speaking to them?

User: Yes, I think I can work on that. I just want them to know how tough things have been for me.

Consultant: It’s completely valid to want them to understand your struggles. Remember, you deserve to be heard. Let’s recap what we've discussed today. We've explored your feelings around school pressure, challenged some negative thoughts, and identified healthy coping strategies like drawing and journaling. 

User: Yes, that sounds about right. I feel a bit lighter after talking about it.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Qianqian. As we wrap up, I encourage you to focus on your small goals this week and reach out if things feel overwhelming again. It’s all part of the journey towards feeling better.

User: Thank you! I appreciate the support. I feel like I have some steps to take now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, it’s all about taking it one step at a time. I look forward to hearing how things go for you in our next session. Take care!

User: I will, thank you again!

Consultant: Hello, Qianqian! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, especially with everything happening at home?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed. My parents have been arguing a lot, and it makes me feel really helpless and sad. I don’t know how to deal with it.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like the tension at home has been quite difficult for you. Can you tell me a bit more about how these arguments affect you personally?

User: Well, when they argue, I feel this heavy pressure in my chest. I also worry about my younger brother because he seems to be affected too, but I don’t know how to help him or myself.

Consultant: It must be tough to witness those arguments and feel responsible for your brother's feelings. What do you find yourself thinking or feeling during these arguments?

User: I feel really alone. It’s like I’m trapped in my own world, and I just wish everything would calm down. Sometimes, I even think it would be better if I just disappeared.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of pain and loneliness. I want you to know that it’s okay to feel this way. You’re not alone in this. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit more. What do you think makes you feel like disappearing?

User: I guess I feel like I can’t change anything, and my feelings just get ignored. I sometimes think that if I weren’t around, maybe they wouldn't fight as much.

Consultant: That’s really heavy to bear, believing that your presence affects the situation negatively. It’s understandable to feel that way, but let’s challenge that thought a bit. Do you think it’s really true that your absence would change their behavior?

User: I don’t know. Part of me thinks that maybe they would just argue less, but another part of me knows it’s probably more complicated than that.

Consultant: You're right; family dynamics are complex. It’s not just about one person’s presence. Your feelings are valid, and it’s important to acknowledge them. What if we considered other ways to cope with these feelings instead of wishing to disappear?

User: I’d like that. I just don’t know what to do when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Let’s think about some small steps you can take when those feelings hit. Have you tried any activities that help you feel a bit more relaxed or relieved?

User: Sometimes I read or draw, but lately, I haven’t had much motivation to do anything.

Consultant: It’s normal to lose motivation when you’re feeling heavy. Let’s gently encourage you to explore those activities again. How about setting a small goal for this week to engage in drawing or reading at least once?

User: I could try that. I used to love drawing, but I just feel stuck right now.

Consultant: That’s a great attitude! It’s about finding ways to express what you’re feeling. Even a few minutes of drawing can serve as a release. Also, how do you feel about talking to your brother during these tense moments? 

User: I’ve thought about it, but I’m not sure how to approach him without making things worse.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. You might start with something simple, like checking in on how he feels when things get tense. Sharing your own feelings might also help him open up. Would you feel comfortable trying that?

User: I think I could try that. I just want him to know he’s not alone either.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate approach, and it shows strength to want to support him. Let’s think about what words you might use when you talk to him. What do you think you could say?

User: Maybe I could say something like, “I know things are really stressful right now, and I’m here if you want to talk about it.” 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! It opens the door for him to share while letting him know he’s not alone. As we work through this, how do you feel about your own reactions to your parents' arguments? 

User: I still feel a bit scared, and I worry they’ll get worse. But talking about it makes me feel a little lighter.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. It’s important to have a safe space to express yourself. As we continue, let’s focus on building your confidence in handling those situations. What do you think would help you feel more secure?

User: Maybe knowing that I can control my own reactions would help. It feels like everything is out of my control otherwise.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on what you can control, like your reactions and feelings, can empower you. Let’s practice a few techniques to help you regain some of that control. How does that sound?

User: I’d like that. I really want to feel less helpless.

Consultant: Great! One technique is grounding yourself when you feel overwhelmed. You can try focusing on your breathing or keeping a journal to express your feelings as they arise. Are you okay with giving those a shot?

User: Yes, breathing sounds good. I think writing will help too, especially when things are really rough.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. We’re building a toolbox for you to manage these feelings. How do you feel about our discussion today?

User: I feel more hopeful, like I’m not completely powerless anymore. Thank you for helping me see a way forward.

Consultant: It’s my pleasure, Qianqian! You’ve taken an important step today by speaking about your feelings and considering how to cope. Let’s keep building on this in our next session.

User: I’m looking forward to it. Thank you so much!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Qianqian! I'm really glad to see you today. Let’s start by discussing how you've been feeling recently. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really low lately. I’ve noticed that I tend to avoid activities at school, and I feel like I’m not good enough compared to others. I recently declined an invitation to a school event because I just felt too inferior.

Consultant: It sounds like you've been struggling with feelings of inadequacy and avoidance. That can be really tough to deal with. Can you tell me more about what you feel when you think about participating in these activities?

User: I feel really anxious and self-conscious. I worry that people will judge me or think I'm not interesting enough to be around. It's really overwhelming.

Consultant: I can see why that would be overwhelming for you. It’s important to recognize those feelings. When you're in situations where you feel anxious, what kinds of thoughts run through your mind? 

User: Usually, I think that I'm going to embarrass myself or that no one will want to talk to me. 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very challenging, Qianqian. Can we take a moment to reflect on how those thoughts might be affecting your feelings? For instance, when you think “no one will want to talk to me,” what emotion does that create for you?

User: It makes me feel really sad and isolated. Sometimes I just want to disappear.

Consultant: Feeling isolated can be really painful, and it’s understandable to want to avoid those feelings. Let's explore this a bit more—when you think about disappearing, what do you hope that will achieve for you?

User: I guess I just want to escape the discomfort of feeling judged or unworthy. 

Consultant: That's a completely understandable desire. Escaping from discomfort seems like a way to protect yourself. But avoiding situations might also keep you from potentially positive experiences. What do you think would happen if you decided to join an activity, even just a little?

User: I don't know... I guess I might enjoy it, but I'm so scared of what could go wrong.

Consultant: It's okay to be scared. How about we try to break it down into smaller steps? What if you made a plan to attend a smaller gathering first? Just to see how it feels without too much pressure?

User: That sounds a bit less intimidating. Maybe I could try to join a small study group instead of a larger event.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! A study group could be a supportive environment. Can you think of any specific group you might feel comfortable joining?

User: There’s a group that meets every Wednesday, and I know a couple of people there. I thought I could sit in and listen the first time.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan, Qianqian. Just listening the first time can take the pressure off. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel a bit better. I like that it’s not too overwhelming.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Let’s also think about how you can reward yourself after you attend. What could you do to celebrate this small step?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to my favorite dessert afterward!

Consultant: That sounds like a delightful way to acknowledge your efforts! Setting up positive reinforcements can really help boost your confidence. How do you envision sharing this experience with your family afterward?

User: I think I might tell them I joined the study group, and I hope they’ll be proud of me.

Consultant: That's a lovely motivation! Sharing your success can create a sense of connection and support from your family. What do you want to tell them specifically about your experience?

User: I might say I was nervous but did it anyway and that I felt okay being there.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic story to share! It's a testament to your courage. As you approach this event, what strategies can you use to remind yourself of this success and your efforts?

User: Maybe I could write a note to myself reminding me that I can handle it and that it’s okay to be nervous.

Consultant: Writing a note is a brilliant idea! It serves as a tangible reminder of your strength. Remember, it’s natural to have fears, but you’re taking meaningful steps forward. How does it feel to think about doing this?

User: I feel a little more hopeful. It’s still a bit scary, but thinking about it makes me feel stronger.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Qianqian! It sounds like you’re cultivating a sense of hope. As you work on attending the study group, let's also touch on your hobbies or interests. Do you think there's a way you can integrate those into your social interactions too?

User: I love painting. I think I could invite a friend over to paint together.

Consultant: Inviting a friend over sounds like a lovely idea! It combines your interest with socializing in a more comfortable environment. What do you think about this approach?

User: I feel excited about it! I think it's easier to relax when I'm doing something I enjoy.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Balancing social interaction with something you enjoy can make it much more enjoyable. It’s also an excellent opportunity to practice social skills in a safe space. How do you feel about exploring this more in our future sessions?

User: I’d like that! I want to keep building my confidence, and sharing those experiences sounds helpful.

Consultant: Absolutely! This journey is about gradual progress, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Before we wrap up, do you have any final thoughts or feelings about today’s session?

User: I feel relieved and hopeful. I’m grateful for your support.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Qianqian. It’s been a pleasure working together. Remember, you’re taking steps toward a brighter future. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. If you need to share anything in between, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: I will, thank you!

Consultant: Goodbye for now, and take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Qianqian! Welcome to today's session. I'm glad you're here. How have you been feeling lately, especially with everything that's been going on?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. I really want to join the school choir, but I worry about my dad's reaction and there’s also the pressure of my grades. It's hard to balance everything.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really passionate about joining the choir, but the thought of your father's disapproval and academic pressure is weighing on you. Can you share more about what makes you excited about being part of the choir?

User: I love singing and performing. It's a way for me to express myself, and I think it would really make me happy. But my dad always prioritizes grades, and I don't want to disappoint him.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. It's wonderful that you want to express yourself through singing. Balancing your passions with your family's expectations can be tough. What kind of support do you think you need to help you pursue your interests while managing your father's expectations?

User: I guess I need to figure out a way to talk to my dad about it. I just don’t know how to bring it up without him getting upset. 

Consultant: That’s a good insight, Qianqian. Improving communication with your dad could be key to finding a balance. What are some specific worries you have about how he might react if you tell him about your interest in the choir?

User: I'm afraid he might think it's a waste of time, and that I should focus more on my studies. He has high expectations for me.

Consultant: It sounds like you really value his opinion and want to meet his expectations, which is understandable. Let’s explore the possibility of framing your interest in the choir in a way that shows him how it could also benefit your studies. What do you think? 

User: That could work, maybe I could tell him that it helps relieve stress or improve my mood, which might help me study better.

Consultant: Exactly! Highlighting the positive effects of singing on your mood and stress levels may help him see it as beneficial rather than as a distraction. How do you feel about trying that approach?

User: I feel a bit better thinking about it that way. It makes it seem less confrontational, and it might help him understand.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s all about opening a dialogue. Can you think of a specific time or situation when you could bring this up with him?

User: Maybe after dinner one evening when we’re all relaxed. But I still feel nervous about it.

Consultant: That's a good plan! Timing can really help. It’s normal to feel nervous, but remember, it’s just a conversation sharing something important to you. What can you do to manage that nervousness before you talk to him?

User: I could practice what I want to say in front of a mirror or with my brother. That might help.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Practicing can definitely reduce your anxiety and help you feel more confident. How does it feel to think about having that conversation with your dad after practicing?

User: I feel a little bit more confident. I hope he listens.

Consultant: I think he will appreciate you being open with him. Remember, you're expressing something that matters to you. What else could you do in the meantime to manage your feelings about this situation?

User: I could try to find ways to relax, like listening to music or going for a walk. 

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Engaging in activities that bring you joy can certainly help manage stress. How can we incorporate these relaxation techniques into your daily routine while you prepare for this conversation?

User: I could set specific times in my day for relaxing activities, like listening to music after homework. 

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Establishing time for yourself can create a balance between your studies and your interests. What will be your first step towards making this happen?

User: I think I’ll write down a schedule for the week that includes both study time and relaxation time. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I encourage you to be kind to yourself as you navigate this. It's important to stay flexible with it as well. How are you feeling about everything we discussed today?

User: I feel more hopeful, but I know it's still going to be a challenge. 

Consultant: That's quite normal, Qianqian. Change takes time and practice. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. You’ve already thought of some valuable strategies today. As we wrap up, what’s one takeaway you have from our conversation?

User: I think I need to keep working on my communication skills with my family, and I’m excited to work on my schedule.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic takeaway! Working on communication and scheduling time for your interests is a great move. Don’t hesitate to reach out for support as you continue this journey. I'm here for you. 

User: Thank you so much. I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Qianqian! I’m looking forward to seeing how things go for you next time. Keep up the great work, and take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Qianqian! I'm glad to see you back for another session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I think I've been feeling a bit better. I’ve been trying to communicate more with my family, but it can still be tough sometimes.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're making an effort to communicate with your family. Can you share a specific experience where you tried to express yourself?

User: Sure! Last weekend, I tried to tell my dad about how I felt like he wasn’t really interested in what I was doing at school anymore. He didn’t react badly, but I’m not sure I got my point across.

Consultant: It sounds like you took a brave step by sharing your feelings with your dad. What emotions did you experience during that conversation?

User: I felt a mix of nervousness and hope, but also a bit frustrated that I couldn’t get him to understand completely.

Consultant: Those mixed feelings are completely normal, especially when it comes to family communication. What do you think made it difficult for you to express your point clearly?

User: I guess I sometimes get worried about making him upset or sounding whiny. I don’t want him to think I’m complaining.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Many people fear being perceived as complaining when they share their feelings. Could you think of any alternative ways to express your needs without feeling like you're complaining?

User: Maybe if I focus on how much I value his support and then share my feelings, it might come across better?

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Framing your feelings in a positive way can help reduce defensiveness. Have you had any thoughts on practicing this technique in future conversations?

User: I think I will. I could maybe write down what I want to say before talking to him.

Consultant: Writing it down can be a helpful way to clarify your thoughts. Would you like to try drafting a small message to your dad as practice?

User: Yes, that sounds useful! I could say something like, “Dad, I really appreciate your support, and I wanted to share how I’ve been feeling about school lately.”

Consultant: That's a wonderful start! You’re expressing gratitude first, which opens the conversation positively. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel a lot better thinking about it this way. It makes me less anxious.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Reducing anxiety can help you communicate more openly. Have you thought about how you could encourage your dad to share his thoughts as well?

User: Maybe I could ask him how he feels about my schoolwork and if he has any advice. I think he might open up if I do.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Inviting him to share his thoughts can create a two-way dialogue. What do you hope to achieve from this kind of conversation?

User: I hope to understand him better and feel more connected. I really want to build our relationship.

Consultant: That’s a commendable goal, Qianqian. Strengthening that connection will likely support your overall emotional well-being. Do you have any concerns about how he might react?

User: Sometimes I worry he might be too busy to talk or not interested, but I’ll try not to think that way.

Consultant: Focusing on your intention rather than assuming his response can be liberating. What’s one small step you can take to initiate this conversation?

User: I could bring it up over dinner when we’re all together. That’s usually a relaxed time.

Consultant: Dinner sounds like a perfect opportunity! It can create a comfortable environment. Do you feel prepared to start this conversation?

User: I do! I feel more confident about it now. 

Consultant: I’m so proud of you, Qianqian. It’s important to recognize this confidence. As we move forward, how can we ensure you keep developing your communication skills?

User: I’d like to keep practicing here and maybe role-play some scenarios to build my confidence.

Consultant: Role-playing can be very effective! Would you like to try a brief role-play exercise now?

User: Sure, that sounds fun!

Consultant: Great! I will play your dad, and you can try expressing yourself. Whenever you're ready, go ahead.

User: Okay... *clears throat* "Dad, I really appreciate your support, and I wanted to share how I’ve been feeling about school lately."

Consultant: "Thanks for saying that, Qianqian. What’s on your mind about school?"

User: "I’ve been feeling a bit stressed about my grades and would love to hear your advice on how to handle it."

Consultant: "I see. I’m here to help. What specifically are you stressed about?"

User: *pauses* “Well, I feel like I’m not studying as well as I could, and I sometimes doubt if I’m good enough.”

Consultant: That was very natural, Qianqian! How did it feel to have that conversation?

User: It felt good to express my concerns! I think practicing like this helps a lot.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Recognizing your feelings and expressing them is an important part of improving communication. As we wrap up today, what insights do you take away from our session?

User: I learned that structuring my thoughts can help me express myself better. I also feel more confident about communicating with my dad now.

Consultant: Those are valuable insights. Remember, each conversation is a step towards strengthening your relationship and supporting your emotional health. How do you want to prepare for our next session?

User: I will try to have that dinner conversation and see how it goes. I'll write down my thoughts to share with you next time.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! I look forward to hearing how it goes. Remember, even small steps count. Keep building on what you’ve learned today!

User: Thank you! I feel excited to try this out.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Qianqian! Take care, and I’ll see you next time. Keep up the great work.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Qianqian! It's great to see you again. Today, we're here to review your progress and discuss how to maintain the positive changes you've made. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel a lot more stable now, and I’ve noticed that my confidence has improved, especially after participating in the choir. It’s been nice to be involved in something that brings me joy.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Engaging in activities that you enjoy can really boost your mood and self-esteem. What specific experiences in the choir have contributed to your feeling of confidence?

User: I think singing with others and performing in front of people helped me realize I can do more than I thought. It felt great to receive positive feedback from my teacher and friends.

Consultant: Receiving positive feedback can be incredibly validating. It sounds like this experience has helped you see your potential. How do you feel you can build on this confidence in other areas of your life, such as at school or home?

User: I’ve been trying to apply that same energy to my schoolwork and responsibilities at home. I’m more willing to speak up in class and help my brother with his homework, too.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach, Qianqian. Helping your brother and participating in class can further reinforce your confidence. Are there any challenges you've faced while trying to maintain this positivity in your daily life?

User: Sometimes I still feel overwhelmed with assignments and responsibilities. It can get a bit much, and I worry that I might start to feel down again.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed occasionally, especially with schoolwork and family duties. Let's explore some strategies to handle those feelings when they arise. What are some techniques you’ve used before to cope with stress?

User: Well, I used to doodle or listen to music when I felt stressed. Those helped a bit, but I also remember that those self-harm urges came up during really tough times.

Consultant: Acknowledging those feelings is an important step. It's positive that you've identified music and doodling as coping methods. We can also discuss how to further strengthen your emotional resilience so you can better manage stressful situations. Would you like to explore some new strategies together?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I really want to avoid feeling that way again.

Consultant: Great! One effective way to manage stress is to develop a daily routine that includes time for relaxation and self-care. What would be some activities you would enjoy incorporating into a daily routine?

User: I think I could set aside time to read, spend time with my brother, and maybe even practice singing more. 

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful ideas! Balancing enjoyable activities with your responsibilities can help maintain your overall well-being. How do you envision organizing these activities into your daily life?

User: I could allocate specific times for each task. For instance, I could read after my schoolwork before hanging out with my brother, and then practice singing every few days.

Consultant: That sounds like a well-structured plan! Setting specific times can help establish a habit and give you something to look forward to. What do you think might be the biggest barriers to sticking to this routine?

User: I guess I might get distracted or feel unmotivated sometimes, especially if I don't see results right away.

Consultant: It’s common to face distractions and motivation issues. A helpful technique is to set small, achievable goals to build momentum. If you find yourself feeling unmotivated, what strategies could help you stay focused?

User: I could remind myself of my goals or maybe even reward myself after completing tasks. 

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Rewards can be very motivating. What are some rewards you think would be effective for you after a task is completed?

User: Maybe allowing myself to watch a favorite show or have some snack I really like.

Consultant: Those sound like nice incentives! Balancing work with enjoyable rewards can make the process more enjoyable. Now, let’s also consider how you can reinforce the positive experiences you've had, like in the choir. How can you continue to build on those successes?

User: I could look for more clubs or activities to join, maybe even consider leading some in the future.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Taking on leadership roles can further enhance your confidence and skills. Is there a specific club or activity you're interested in pursuing next?

User: I’ve been thinking about starting a small study group for my classmates. 

Consultant: That’s an impressive initiative! Leading a study group can not only help you reinforce your own knowledge but also create a supportive environment for others. How do you feel about taking this step?

User: I feel excited but a little nervous about how my classmates will react.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel nervous when initiating something new. What would help you manage that nervousness before approaching your classmates?

User: I think practicing what I want to say beforehand might help, or even discussing it with a close friend first.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Practicing can boost your confidence, and having a supportive friend can make the process feel less intimidating. As we wrap up today’s session, Qianqian, what do you think are the key takeaways from our conversation?

User: I’ve learned that establishing a routine with enjoyable activities can help me maintain my confidence and that taking small steps can prevent me from feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s crucial to balance your responsibilities with self-care activities. Remember, you have made significant progress, and you’re equipped with various strategies to sustain this positive mindset. How do you feel moving forward with this plan?
