Consultant: Hello, Jiy! I'm glad you're here today. I know there's been some changes at home recently. How are you feeling about everything?

User: Hi. Well, since my little brother was born, things have felt a bit different at home. I'm not sure how to feel about it, and it makes me anxious sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing some mixed feelings about your new brother. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you anxious?

User: I guess I'm just worried about not having enough attention from my parents anymore. They seem really busy with the baby.

Consultant: I understand. It must be tough to feel that your parents are busy, and you might fear that you won't get as much attention. Have you noticed any changes in how you interact with your family since your brother arrived?

User: Yeah, I kind of feel left out sometimes. My mom is always with the baby, and my dad helps a lot too. I feel like I need to be quieter so I don’t disturb them.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way with such a major change in the family. Wanting to be considerate shows you care about your family's needs. But how does that make you feel inside when you try to be quieter?

User: It makes me feel anxious and a little lonely. I just wish I could talk more, but I worry it's not the right time.

Consultant: Feeling lonely and anxious is understandable, especially if you're holding back your feelings. If you could express yourself more, what would you want to say?

User: I want to tell them that I still need them and I miss spending time together like before.

Consultant: That’s a very important feeling to express, Jiy. Communication can help you feel connected and understood. What do you think might happen if you shared this with your parents?

User: Maybe they would make time for me again, or at least understand how I feel. But I'm scared they'll be too busy to listen.

Consultant: It’s brave of you to recognize that fear. How about we explore some ways you can approach them when you feel ready? What could be a good moment to bring it up?

User: Maybe during dinner when we’re all together? That feels like a time when we can talk easily.

Consultant: Dinner sounds like a great opportunity! You could share how you’re feeling while enjoying a meal together. How do you think you could start that conversation?

User: I could say something like, “I’ve been feeling a bit lonely since the baby came, and I miss our time together.”

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful way to start. You’re expressing your feelings honestly, which is really brave. How does thinking about this plan make you feel?

User: It makes me a little less anxious to have a plan. I hope they understand me.

Consultant: Feeling a bit less anxious with a plan is a positive step! Remember, it’s okay if they don’t respond perfectly at first. Sharing your feelings is important. Are there other things about this change that you’ve been thinking about?

User: I just really miss playing games with them. I’m worried I won’t be able to do that anymore since the baby takes up their time.

Consultant: Missing those moments is totally understandable. How about we think of some fun games or activities you could suggest to them that involve your little brother too? This way you can still be part of the fun!

User: That sounds good. Maybe we can play with some toys that are safe for babies, and I can help entertain him while they are free.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! It allows you to bond with your brother and still be involved with your parents. What feelings do you think that could create for you?

User: Maybe I wouldn’t feel so left out if I included him. I could even teach him how to play.

Consultant: Exactly! Sharing those moments could help strengthen your bond with both your brother and your parents. It might also ease some of that loneliness. Do you think you’d like to try this out maybe this week?

User: Yeah, I would like to try that! I feel a bit excited now about including him.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Jiy! Feeling excited is a great sign. How about we check in next time to see how it went? Also, I’m here to support you through this adjustment.

User: Yes, I’d like that. I want to feel more comfortable with everything.

Consultant: Perfect! We can keep working on those feelings together. Remember that it’s okay to feel unsure, but you’re taking steps towards feeling better, and that’s what matters.

User: Thanks for listening and helping me think about this. I feel a bit lighter about everything now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm glad you're feeling lighter. It's all about taking those small steps. Until our next session, keep practicing expressing yourself, and remember I’m here for you.

Consultant: Hello, JI! I'm glad you came for this session today. How have you been feeling lately about the new activities at school?

User: Hi! I've been a bit anxious. I'm trying to join in on the group games, but I often get too excited, and it feels overwhelming sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed when things get exciting in those group activities. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel that way?

User: Well, when we start playing, I just get really pumped up, but after a while, I feel like I can't keep up and that makes me anxious.

Consultant: I see. So, the excitement builds up, but then there's a moment when you feel like it's too much. How do these feelings affect your ability to enjoy the activities?

User: I think I end up feeling frustrated because I want to have fun, but I feel like I can't control my emotions. Sometimes I even feel like I want to leave.

Consultant: That frustration makes sense. It’s not easy when you have those strong feelings. Let’s try to explore one of those moments when you felt overwhelmed during a game. What thoughts were running through your mind at that time?

User: I remember one time during a team game, I thought, “What if I mess up and everyone laughs at me?” That thought just kept looping in my head.

Consultant: That thought of being laughed at seems to have made you even more anxious. Let's consider this—how likely is it that everyone would actually laugh at you if something went wrong?

User: I don't know... maybe not very likely. They are all my friends, and they wouldn't really do that.

Consultant: Exactly! It seems there's a part of you that knows your friends wouldn't react that way. What if we challenged that thought? If a friend of yours was in your shoes, what would you tell them?

User: I would tell them to just enjoy the game and not worry about making mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a great piece of advice! It sounds like you have compassion for your friends. Let’s apply that same compassion to yourself. How do you think feeling this way could change your experience in group activities?

User: Maybe I could relax more and just focus on having fun instead of worrying so much.

Consultant: Yes! Shifting your focus to fun could really help. Have you tried any techniques to help calm yourself down in those moments when you feel anxious?

User: Not really... I usually just try to push through it.

Consultant: Pushing through can be tough! How about we explore some relaxation techniques that you can use when you start feeling overwhelmed? Would you be open to trying some?

User: Sure! I’d like to know what those techniques are.

Consultant: Great! One simple technique is deep breathing. When you notice the excitement building, you can try to take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a moment, and then slowly breathe out through your mouth. Would you like to try that now?

User: Okay, let’s try it. I’ll follow along.

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s take a deep breath together. Inhale… hold… and exhale slowly. How does that feel?

User: It feels nice. I think I like this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Practicing this technique in your daily routine can help you feel more in control during those activities. How do you feel about using this technique in your next group game?

User: I think I can try to remember it. It might help me stay calm when I feel anxious.

Consultant: That’s a positive step! Another thing to consider is to maybe set small goals for your participation, like giving yourself permission to just enjoy the game without worrying about being perfect. How does that sound?

User: It sounds good! I think I could set a goal to have fun rather than focus on how well I’m playing.

Consultant: Perfect! Focusing on enjoyment will really ease some of that pressure. As we continue to work on these strategies, it's important to remember that it's okay to feel a little anxious—what matters is how you handle it. 

User: Yeah, that makes sense. I feel like I’m starting to understand my feelings better.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, JI! We’ve made great progress today. Before we wrap up, can you share how you feel overall about what we've discussed and practiced today?

User: I feel more confident about dealing with my feelings. I think trying the breathing will help during group games.

Consultant: I’m so proud of you for taking these steps! Remember that it's okay to have a mix of feelings, and using these strategies can help you manage them more effectively. Next time, we can continue to build on this progress and address any other lingering concerns.

User: I’m looking forward to our next session! Thank you for your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, JI! I believe in your ability to navigate these challenges. See you next time, and keep practicing those relaxation techniques!

Consultant: Hello, Ji! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling about the new responsibilities your mom has given you at home?

User: Hi! I feel a bit anxious about taking care of my younger brother and doing household chores. It seems like a big job all of a sudden.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way when new responsibilities come up. Can you share specifically what tasks your mom has asked you to help with?

User: She wants me to look after my little brother sometimes and help with cleaning the house. I’m afraid I won’t do it well.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to meet these expectations. What do you think would help you feel more confident when doing these new tasks?

User: Maybe if I knew exactly what I needed to do and had a plan, it would help me feel better about it.

Consultant: Having a clear plan can definitely make things easier. What if we brainstorm together a step-by-step approach for each task? How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I think that could help.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start with taking care of your brother. What do you think are some simple things you can do to look after him?

User: I could play with him or help him with his homework if he needs it.

Consultant: Those are wonderful ideas! Playing and helping with homework can also be fun for both of you. What about the cleaning tasks? What’s something you feel you could handle easily?

User: I think I can help with washing the dishes or tidying up my room.

Consultant: Those are very achievable tasks, Ji! How about setting a small goal, like washing the dishes every evening? Would that be doable for you?

User: Yes, I can try that! It doesn’t sound too hard.

Consultant: Good! And how do you think accomplishing that small goal will make you feel?

User: I think I would feel proud and maybe a bit more confident that I can do other things too.

Consultant: Exactly! Small successes can build your confidence over time. Now, let’s consider some ways to celebrate when you complete these tasks. What do you think would be a nice reward for yourself?

User: Maybe I could play a video game for a little while or have a snack I like.

Consultant: Those are great rewards! They can motivate you to stick with your tasks. How do you feel about having this plan and using these rewards?

User: I feel better knowing I have a plan! It makes everything seem less stressful.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As you take on these responsibilities, it’s also important to remember to ask for help if you’re feeling overwhelmed. Who could you talk to when you need support?

User: I can talk to my mom if I get stuck. She’s really helpful.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea, Ji. It’s great to have that support. Now, reflecting on these responsibilities, can you think of any positives that might come from them?

User: I might learn how to take care of things better and feel more grown-up.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking on responsibilities can help you grow and become more independent. As we wrap up today, how are you feeling about the upcoming interest group activities? 

User: I’m a little nervous but also excited to meet new friends.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. Remember the skills you’ve been practicing today; they can help you feel more at ease in those situations. What’s one thing you can do to prepare for that group?

User: I could try to think of something interesting to share with everyone, so I feel more confident.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Sharing something about yourself can help you connect with others. Let’s keep building on this progress. I’m looking forward to seeing how you feel about these responsibilities next time we meet. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember, you're doing great. Until next time, take care, Ji!
###################
Consultant: Hello, J, I'm glad to see you today! I understand you're feeling a bit nervous about the upcoming interest group activities at school. Can you tell me more about what you're feeling right now?

User: Hi. Yes, I'm a little nervous because I don't know many of the other kids, but I'm also excited to try. I want to make friends and have fun.

Consultant: It sounds like you have mixed feelings. Excitement about making friends is a great motivation, but the nervousness can be a challenge. What specifically are you worried about when you think about joining the group?

User: I guess I'm worried I won't know what to say or do, and that everyone else will already be friends.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. Many people worry about fitting in and knowing how to interact. Can you think of any situations in the past where you felt similar, but then things turned out okay?

User: Last year, I felt nervous at my first soccer practice too, but I ended up making some friends after a while.

Consultant: That’s a great example! It shows you have successfully navigated through a similar situation before. How did you manage to connect with others during soccer practice?

User: I just started talking to one of the players about the game. It helped me relax a little.

Consultant: Talking about common interests can be a great way to break the ice! We could practice some conversation starters that you might use in your interest group. How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful! What kind of things could I say?

Consultant: You could ask questions like "What do you think about this activity?" or "Have you tried anything like this before?" These open-ended questions can encourage others to share and help you engage in conversation. How do you feel about trying that?

User: I think I could try that! It doesn’t sound too hard.

Consultant: That’s the spirit, J! Remember, most kids are probably just as eager to make friends as you are. When you feel nervous, you can remind yourself of how you successfully connected with your soccer teammates. Does that sound like a good plan?

User: Yes, it does! I will remind myself of that when I feel nervous.

Consultant: Great! It’s all about building your confidence step by step. What activities will you be doing in your interest group?

User: We’ll be doing some art projects, and there might be games too, I think.

Consultant: That sounds like a lot of fun! Engaging in art projects and games can be perfect opportunities to bond with others. Perhaps you could also share your thoughts on the art projects with the group—what you like about them or what you’re working on. How does that make you feel?

User: That makes me feel a bit better! I like art, so I could talk about it.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Sharing something you enjoy can definitely help ease your nerves. Now, let’s discuss what you can do if you start to feel anxious again. Have you thought of any calming techniques you could use?

User: Maybe I could take deep breaths or think positive thoughts.

Consultant: Deep breathing and positive thinking are both excellent strategies! You might also consider a short mantra or phrase that you can repeat to yourself to regain focus. Would you like to come up with one together?

User: Sure! Maybe something like "I can do this"?

Consultant: "I can do this" is a powerful and encouraging mantra! You can remind yourself of this before and during the group activities. How do you feel about using that mantra when you start to feel nervous?

User: I think it will help! I’ll remember that.

Consultant: Wonderful, J! I believe you’ll do great in your interest group. In our next sessions, we can celebrate your experiences and any progress you make. What is your goal for the next week regarding these activities?

User: I want to join in the activities and at least talk to one new kid.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! Connecting with one new person can really enhance your experience. How will you feel if you accomplish that?

User: I would feel proud of myself!

Consultant: Feeling proud is an empowering emotion! It sounds like you are ready to take these steps. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any additional concerns you have?

User: No, I think I’m good for now! Thanks for your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, J! I’m looking forward to hearing about your adventures in the interest group next time. Keep practicing those conversation starters and your mantra. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ji! I'm so glad to see you today. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing some positive changes recently. Can you share with me how you’ve been feeling about the group activities since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel a lot more confident now. The other day in school, I contributed my ideas to a group project, and the teacher praised me. It made me really happy!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like your confidence has grown. How did it feel to receive that praise from your teacher?

User: It felt amazing! I was proud of myself for being able to share my ideas. I think it helped my classmates too.

Consultant: It sounds like you not only enjoyed sharing your ideas but also recognized the positive impact it had on the group. What do you think that means for your future participation in similar activities?

User: I want to keep sharing my ideas. I feel like I can do well if I try.

Consultant: That's a great attitude, Ji! Keeping that motivation will certainly help you. Can you think of any specific goals you might want to set for yourself in future group activities?

User: Maybe I could try to come up with at least one new idea for each project. That way, I can keep contributing!

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent goal! Setting targets like that can help you stay focused and engaged. How might you feel if you reach that goal every time?

User: I’d feel really confident! It would be nice to think that my ideas could help the group.

Consultant: Absolutely! Contributing will reinforce that sense of achievement. Have there been any challenges you’ve encountered when trying to share your ideas?

User: Sometimes, I still feel a little shy when everyone is waiting to speak. I worry they won’t like what I have to say.

Consultant: It’s very common to feel shy in those situations. Let’s try to reframe that thought. What evidence do you have that they wouldn’t like your ideas?

User: I don’t really have evidence, just a feeling. I guess I should trust that they might be open to my thoughts.

Consultant: That’s a good insight! It’s important to challenge those feelings, especially since your ideas have been successful before. What could you remind yourself of next time you feel that way?

User: I could remember that I’ve had good experiences before, like the last project, and that my ideas matter.

Consultant: That's perfect! Keeping those positive experiences at the forefront can help reduce that shyness. Can we build an action plan together based on what we've discussed today?

User: Sure! I want to keep my goal of sharing new ideas in mind. I also want to remember my past successes.

Consultant: Great! It sounds like your plan is to set an idea-sharing goal for yourself and to remind yourself of your positive experiences before speaking up. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel excited! I want to try it in the next group project.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. If it doesn’t go exactly as planned, that’s okay too. You can use those experiences to learn and grow. Do you feel ready to take this next step?

User: Yes, I’m ready! I think I can do it.

Consultant: Wonderful! I'm proud of the progress you've made, Ji. Let’s summarize what we’ve accomplished today. You're setting a goal to contribute new ideas in future projects and using your past successes to boost your confidence. Anything else you want to include?

User: I think that covers it. I feel really good about this!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It sounds like you’re on a positive path. As we wrap up today, what strategies do you think you’ll use when you face challenges in sharing your ideas next time?

User: I’ll remind myself of the praise I received and that my ideas are valuable. That should help with my confidence.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Ji! Remember, I’m always here to support you. Today was our last session for now, but I believe in your ability to keep growing. If you ever need help again, don’t hesitate to reach out. How do you feel about everything we've discussed today?

User: I feel proud and hopeful! Thank you for everything!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Ji! I’m proud of you too, and I'm excited about your journey ahead. Take care and keep shining!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ji! It’s great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel much better, actually. I was able to talk to my relatives at the family gathering. It was exciting to share my interests with them.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Sharing your interests with your relatives shows great progress in your confidence. How did that experience make you feel?

User: It felt good to be able to express myself without feeling nervous. I was really proud of myself.

Consultant: You should be proud! It’s a significant achievement. Let’s reflect on your journey. Since you’ve been working on your social skills, what specific changes have you noticed in yourself?

User: I think I’m becoming more comfortable speaking up. Before, I would just listen and not say anything because I was afraid.

Consultant: That’s an important observation, Ji. Recognizing the change in your comfort level is a big step forward. Have you noticed any situations where you still feel nervous or hesitant?

User: Sometimes I still feel nervous when I’m around new people, especially in large groups.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a bit anxious in those situations. Let’s talk about how we can address that. Can you recall a recent experience where you felt nervous around new people? What thoughts were running through your mind?

User: At a friend's party, I thought everyone would judge me if I said something silly or wrong.

Consultant: That thought can be quite anxiety-provoking. Let’s explore it together. How much evidence do you have that people would judge you negatively? 

User: I guess I don’t really know. I just assumed they might think I’m awkward.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have such assumptions. However, it’s important to challenge those thoughts. What might be an alternative thought you could have in that situation instead of feeling judged?

User: Maybe I could think that people are there to have fun and not really focusing on me.

Consultant: That's a great alternative thought, Ji! Shifting perspectives can be powerful. Next time you find yourself in a similar situation, how could you remind yourself of that thought?

User: I could mentally say to myself, “They are just here to relax and enjoy.”

Consultant: Yes, exactly! Having that reminder can help ease your anxiety. Now, let’s also discuss your future growth. What goals would you like to set to continue improving your social skills?

User: I’d like to try joining a club at school so I can meet new people more often.

Consultant: Joining a club sounds like a fantastic idea! It can provide you with regular opportunities to interact with others. What kind of club are you interested in?

User: I’m thinking about the art club because I like drawing. I could meet other kids who share the same interest.

Consultant: That aligns perfectly with your interests! Engaging with others who share similar passions can make it easier to connect. How can we help you feel prepared for joining the club?

User: Maybe I can practice talking about my art with my friends first, so I feel more confident.

Consultant: Practicing with friends is an excellent strategy. It allows you to build confidence gradually. Let’s set a timeline—when do you think you’d like to approach the art club?

User: I think I can try to join next month when school starts again.

Consultant: Sounds like a solid plan! As you approach this goal, remember the progress you've made so far. What do you think will be your biggest challenge as you prepare to join the club?

User: I guess I’m worried about not fitting in or being too shy to participate.

Consultant: Those feelings are common, but remember, everyone has their own insecurities. What's important is that you’re taking the step to put yourself out there. What might you do if you start feeling shy in the club?

User: Maybe I can remind myself to take deep breaths and focus on the art instead of the people.

Consultant: Great coping strategies! Focusing on the activity can help shift your attention. Let’s take a moment to summarize what we’ve discussed today. You’ve shared your achievements in expressing yourself and set a goal to join the art club.

User: Yes! And I think I’m ready for it.

Consultant: I believe you are, Ji! It’s evident that you’ve come so far. Remember, you can always return to these strategies whenever you feel anxious. Lastly, do you feel equipped to tackle these upcoming challenges?

User: Yes, I feel more confident now. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of your progress, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in the art club. Always remember that you can handle challenges. This will be our last session for now, but I’m here if you need support in the future.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate it.

Consultant: Take care, Ji! Keep embracing new experiences and believe in yourself. Goodbye for now!
