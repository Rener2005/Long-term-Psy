Consultant: Hi Xiaoli, it's good to see you again. I understand that you have been feeling quite troubled lately. Can you share with me how you've been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious and down. The feelings of loneliness and being abandoned keep coming back. I sometimes just want to cry, and the thought of what happened with my mother overwhelms me.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's understandable to experience these feelings, especially after such a significant event in your life. Let’s take a moment to explore those feelings. What thoughts or memories come to your mind when you feel this way?

User: I keep thinking about the last time I saw my mother. It was so confusing and painful. I remember how she just left without warning, and I didn't get a chance to go with her. I feel like I lost a part of myself that day.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly painful. It makes sense that you would feel confused and hurt with such a strong emotional tie to your mother. In moments like these, sometimes we may have thoughts that contribute to our emotional pain. Can you identify any specific thoughts you have when you feel sad or abandoned?

User: I often think that I'm not good enough for her to want to stay. Maybe if I had been different, she wouldn't have left. I question if I did something wrong.

Consultant: Those thoughts must be really heavy to carry. It’s important to challenge these beliefs. Do you think there might be any evidence that contradicts the idea that you weren't good enough for her?

User: Well, I know she has her struggles too. She wasn't happy with her life. I guess maybe it wasn't entirely my fault, but I still feel guilty.

Consultant: It's a positive step that you're recognizing that her decisions may have been influenced by her own struggles. Guilt can be a heavy burden to bear. Let's think about how you can challenge that feeling of guilt. If a friend found themselves in your situation, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s not their fault and that they deserve love no matter what. 

Consultant: Exactly! You deserve that same compassion and understanding. It’s essential to treat yourself with the same kindness. Let’s work on ways to recognize and counter those negative thoughts when they arise. What could be a small step you might take to practice self-kindness?

User: Maybe I could write myself a note reminding me that I’m worthy and that it’s okay to feel sad.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Writing affirmations can help reinforce positive beliefs about yourself. Let’s dive a bit deeper into how those feelings of sadness affect you daily. Are there specific situations where you find your emotions becoming more intense?

User: I feel especially sad when I'm alone, especially at night. It’s like all the memories flood back, and I feel so lost.

Consultant: Loneliness can indeed amplify those feelings. When those memories come flooding back, what thoughts do you find yourself facing during those moments?

User: I think about being abandoned and how no one wants me. It’s really hard to deal with.

Consultant: Those thoughts can feel very isolating. Let’s think of some coping strategies to manage those moments. Have you ever tried distraction techniques or engaging in activities when those thoughts arise?

User: Not really, I usually just sit with my feelings. I don’t know what else to do.

Consultant: It’s okay to sit with your feelings, but sometimes distraction can help break that cycle. What activities do you enjoy? Maybe we can brainstorm some that you could turn to during those tough moments.

User: I like drawing and listening to music. Maybe I could use those to help me distract myself.

Consultant: Those are great options! Engaging in creative outlets can be very therapeutic. Would you be willing to set aside time for drawing or listening to music when those overwhelming feelings come up?

User: I think I could try that. It might help take my mind off things, even if just for a little while.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! Little steps can make a significant difference. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed. How do you feel about working on recognizing and altering those negative thoughts now?

User: I feel a bit hopeful. It seems possible to challenge those thoughts about not being good enough.

Consultant: That’s a step in the right direction! Remember, it’s a process, and it’s important to be patient with yourself. Let’s plan to talk more about these coping strategies and how you've been feeling next time. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. Thank you for listening and helping me sort through my feelings.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoli. It’s essential to have a space to express your feelings. Take care, and I look forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoli! I'm glad you're here for this session. How are you feeling today?

User: Hi. I still feel pretty lost and sad about my relationship with my mom. I thought moving south would help, but things just feel different, and I’m not sure how to handle it.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're struggling with those feelings and the changes you've experienced with your mom. Can you share more about what's been going on lately that’s making you feel this way?

User: Well, I found that even though my mom is nice to me now, she’s not the same person I remember. I expected things to go back to how they were, but they haven’t. It hurts.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging for you. You're experiencing a mix of emotions—disappointment and perhaps confusion about your expectations. What specific moments stand out to you that reinforce these feelings?

User: There were times when I felt connected to her, but then she would act distant or distracted, and I’d remember how much I used to need her. It’s like she’s a stranger now.

Consultant: That must be very frustrating, especially after everything you've been through. Have you noticed how these thoughts about her distance impact your feelings or behavior?

User: Yeah, I feel anxious and sometimes really angry. I just can’t shake off the idea that I should have a different kind of relationship with her.

Consultant: It seems like those expectations might be intensifying your emotions. Can you identify those thoughts when you feel this anger and anxiety? What do they say to you?

User: I keep thinking that I should be able to talk to her like before, but it never happens. I feel like I’m failing somehow.

Consultant: That sense of failure is understandably heavy. Let’s explore this together. Is there any evidence that supports this belief, or could there be other ways to interpret your situation?

User: I guess maybe there’s no clear evidence. It's just how I feel. But it's hard to accept that change is okay.

Consultant: Accepting change is difficult, especially with deep emotional ties. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about feeling this way?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s normal to feel hurt but that they shouldn’t blame themselves for the change.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective. It’s important to remember that your feelings are valid, but they don’t have to define your self-worth. Now, let’s try and think of some alternative ways to view your relationship with your mom. What are some other possibilities for her behavior?

User: Maybe she’s just overwhelmed with her life now. I haven’t considered how hard things must be for her.

Consultant: That insight is powerful, Xiaoli! Recognizing that your mom could be dealing with her struggles can shift your perception. How does that thought make you feel about her actions?

User: I feel a little more understanding, but it doesn’t fully help the sadness I still carry.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It's a process. How about we brainstorm some ways to express your feelings to her or communicate your needs? This could help build a bridge between you two.

User: I guess if I could just find the right words to tell her how I feel, that could help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Finding those words can be very empowering. Let’s take a moment to practice. What would you want to convey to her about your feelings?

User: I think I want to say that I miss the closeness we once had and that I feel lonely sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful start. Expressing vulnerability opens up conversation. How do you think she might respond to that?

User: I hope she would understand. Maybe it’ll get her to talk about her feelings too.

Consultant: Exactly! Communication can be a two-way street. It’s great that you're considering her perspective as well. How can we prepare you for this conversation so you feel more confident?

User: Maybe I can write it down first so I don’t get too emotional while talking.

Consultant: Writing it down is an excellent strategy. It allows you to organize your thoughts and feelings. Would you like to set a small goal of having that conversation this week?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. Just setting the intention feels a bit reassuring.

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress! I’m proud of you for taking this step. What might be some feelings you could experience after having that conversation?

User: I might feel relieved to finally express myself, but I might also feel anxious about how she reacts.

Consultant: Those mixed emotions are totally normal. Remember, regardless of the outcome, you've taken an important step for yourself. How can you remind yourself to stay calm during or after this conversation?

User: I could practice some deep breathing before I talk to her. That usually helps me feel grounded.

Consultant: Perfect! Deep breathing is a great technique to help with anxiety. Let’s incorporate that into your preparation. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you’ve gained from our conversation?

User: I feel a bit clearer on my feelings and how to approach my mom. I also feel a bit lighter, I think.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! You're taking steps toward understanding yourself and your relationship better. Before we finish, how can you keep this momentum going until our next session?

User: I will keep reflecting on my emotions and practice the deep breathing. I’ll also write my thoughts down.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Xiaoli! I'm looking forward to hearing how things go for you next time. Remember, it’s okay to take this process one step at a time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Li! It's great to see you today. I understand you've been feeling quite confused about your family relationships. Let's talk about how you're feeling right now.

User: Hi. Yes, I feel really confused. I try to communicate with my dad, but it doesn't seem to work. I feel like I'm screaming, but no one hears me.

Consultant: That sounds really distressing. It’s as if you're trying to express your feelings, but you're not being understood. Can you tell me more about what happens during these conversations with your dad?

User: When I talk to him, I often feel nervous. I want to tell him how much I miss my mom and how hurt I feel, but I end up just saying nothing or losing my temper.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel nervous about sharing such deep feelings. You want to express your longing for your mother but end up feeling frustrated instead. What thoughts go through your mind when you think of bringing up these feelings with your dad?

User: I keep thinking he won’t understand or think I’m just being silly. Sometimes I even think he might blame me for how things turned out.

Consultant: It’s tough when you feel like your emotions might not be taken seriously, or worse, that you'll be blamed for your feelings. Can you recall a specific conversation that felt particularly difficult?

User: Yes, last week I tried to tell him about the dreams I have where I’m running back home to find my mother, and he just changed the subject to work. It felt like I was invisible.

Consultant: That must have felt invalidating, as if your feelings didn’t matter in that moment. When he changes the subject, what emotions do you experience?

User: I feel even more isolated and angry. It makes me want to give up on talking to him altogether.

Consultant: It seems like your attempts to connect lead to feelings of loneliness and frustration. Let's explore what you might need from your dad during these conversations. What do you wish he would say or do when you express your feelings?

User: I wish he would just listen and acknowledge my feelings. I want him to understand that I’m hurting and that I want to talk about mom.

Consultant: It sounds like validation and understanding are really important to you. What might it look like for you to ask him for his attention and understanding when you want to share?

User: I could maybe tell him that I need his help understanding what happened with mom or how to cope with it. But I worry he might feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s very thoughtful of you to consider his feelings. You might be surprised; asking for connection can sometimes open the door to deeper discussions. How about we practice what you might say to him?

User: Okay, I guess I can try. Maybe I’d say something like, “Dad, I really need to talk about mom and what’s been on my mind.”

Consultant: That’s a great start! It’s clear and direct. How might you feel after saying that to him?

User: I think it would feel scary but also a relief to finally say it. I just worry about what he’ll reply.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel scared before opening up. You’re being brave by wanting to express yourself. What are some possible responses you’d like to hear from him?

User: If he said he understood and that he was there for me, that would help a lot.

Consultant: That's a very supportive response to hope for. Perhaps you can prepare yourself for different types of replies too. Remember, his response might not match your hopes, but your feelings are still valid. What’s a takeaway you have from our discussion today?

User: I think I learned that I can ask for what I need and that it’s okay to open up, even if it's scary.

Consultant: Absolutely, Xiao Li! It’s a powerful step to express your needs and allow yourself to be vulnerable. As we continue our sessions, we’ll build on these skills and explore more ways to communicate. How do you feel about that?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I really want to try and improve my communication with my dad. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You're taking significant steps toward gaining more confidence in your emotional expression. Remember, it’s a journey, and every little progress counts. Until next time, let’s keep practicing this together!

User: Thank you! I'm looking forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Li! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been a bit better, but I still feel overwhelmed sometimes. I’ve been thinking a lot about my emotions and how to manage them, but it’s really challenging.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've been reflecting on your emotions. This is a good step towards understanding them better. Can you share what specific challenges you've been facing?

User: Well, sometimes I just feel really anxious for no reason, and other times I get really angry. I don’t know how to control these feelings when they come.

Consultant: That sounds tough, Xiao Li. It's important to recognize that experiencing anxiety and anger is quite common, especially given what you've been through. Have you noticed any specific situations that trigger these feelings?

User: Yes, I often feel anxious when I think about my future or if I have to interact with new people. I start worrying about what they might think of me.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel anxious in those situations. Let's explore that a bit. What kind of thoughts come to your mind when you're worried about how others perceive you?

User: I usually think that they will judge me or think I'm not good enough. Those thoughts make me want to avoid talking to them.

Consultant: It seems like those thoughts are quite powerful for you. Can you identify how that makes you feel in the moment? 

User: I feel really scared and alone, and I just want to disappear. It’s like I can’t breathe, and I want to cry.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that, Xiao Li. It sounds like those feelings can be quite overwhelming. Let's work together to look at those thoughts. Is there any evidence that supports or contradicts the idea that others might judge you?

User: I guess I don’t really have any proof. Most times, people are just busy with their own lives. But my mind keeps telling me otherwise.

Consultant: That’s a really important insight. Challenging those automatic thoughts can help reduce anxiety. If a friend came to you with the same worries, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably say that they shouldn’t worry so much and that people usually don’t pay that much attention.

Consultant: Exactly! If you can extend that kindness to yourself, it might help ease some of your anxieties. Would you be open to trying a few techniques to manage those feelings, like deep breathing or mindfulness?

User: I’d like to try that. I heard mindfulness can help, but I haven’t done it properly.

Consultant: That’s a great choice! Mindfulness can really help ground you in the present moment. Let’s start with some deep breathing exercises together. Would you try inhaling gently through your nose for a count of four, holding for four, and exhaling slowly through your mouth for a count of four?

User: Okay, I can try that. (User practices breathing.) 

Consultant: How did that feel for you?

User: A little bit calming, actually. I felt some of the tightness in my chest ease up.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Regular practice can really help. We can also explore some human interaction techniques to help you feel more comfortable when engaging with others. Have you thought about small steps you could take in that area?

User: Maybe I could start by speaking to someone in a safe space, like a group activity? 

Consultant: Absolutely, that’s a great idea! Group activities can provide a supportive environment. What kind of activities do you enjoy or feel comfortable participating in?

User: I used to love drawing and painting. Maybe I could join an art class.

Consultant: That’s a perfect choice! Art can be a wonderful way to express yourself and connect with others. How do you think participating in an art class might help you?

User: I think it would let me meet people with similar interests and maybe feel less judged since we’re all just there to create.

Consultant: Yes! It fosters a sense of belonging and connection. How do you feel about setting a small goal, like researching a local art class this week?

User: That sounds doable! I’ll look it up. 

Consultant: Awesome, Xiao Li! I'm proud of you for taking that step. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on what you’ve learned. What is one thing you feel you can apply right away?

User: I think I can practice the deep breathing and be kinder to myself when I start worrying about being judged.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time. I believe in your ability to manage these feelings. I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences in the next session!

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Li. I’m glad to hear that. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hi Xiao Li, I'm glad to see you again. It seems like you've started participating in some activities lately. How have those experiences been for you?

User: Hello. Yes, I’ve tried joining a couple of activities, and it feels a bit better than before. But I still have this lingering worry about how I’ll cope once I leave the hospital.

Consultant: It's great to hear you’re engaging with activities! It's completely normal to have concerns about life outside. Let's talk more about what makes you feel better during these activities and what worries you have for the future.

User: I enjoy the group games. Being part of something makes me feel less alone. But I worry that outside I won't find that same connection. What if I just revert to being isolated again?

Consultant: Those feelings are valid. It sounds like you're realizing how valuable those connections can be. What do you think has contributed to feeling more connected when participating in these activities?

User: I think it's the support from others. We're working together, laughing, and I feel like I belong. But outside, I don’t know if I can recreate that environment.

Consultant: Building a support network is really important. Can you recall any specific moments during these activities that made you feel particularly included or supported?

User: There was this one game where we had to rely on each other for clues. I felt really happy when I realized I could contribute to the group’s success. It was nice to hear people appreciate my input.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful experience! It seems like working together gave you confidence. What if you tried to identify ways to recreate that sense of teamwork and appreciation when you are back outside?

User: I could look for groups or activities that focus on collaboration, but I worry that I might not fit in. 

Consultant: It's understandable to have that fear. What if we thought of small steps you could take to ease into new social environments? Perhaps starting with a familiar activity or interest?

User: Yes, starting small sounds better. Maybe I could join a local team or class where I can explore my interests and meet new people gradually.

Consultant: That’s a great plan, Xiao Li! Starting small can help build confidence. Is there a particular interest you have that could guide your search for a group or class?

User: I like art. Maybe joining a local art class would be a good start. 

Consultant: An art class sounds like a perfect way to express yourself and connect with others who share a similar interest! How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel excited but also nervous. What if I don’t connect with anyone? 

Consultant: Feeling excited yet nervous is completely normal! Remember, it's okay to take your time. If you find that it’s hard to connect at first, you can focus on enjoying the process of creating art instead of the outcome.

User: I guess if I focus on the art itself, it might take some pressure off. But I’m still scared.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel scared, Xiao Li. Embrace those feelings, and remind yourself of the supportive environment you’ve had here. You’ve made progress in overcoming some of your fears; you can carry that strength with you.

User: That makes sense. I did feel stronger after engaging with others here. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s also think about how you can reflect on your progress in this journey. Keeping a journal or noting your experiences in art could help you see how far you’ve come and maintain a positive mindset.

User: I like writing, so that might work for me. It would be nice to have a record of my feelings and progress.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! You can express your feelings, share your worries, and celebrate your achievements. It will also serve as a reminder of your ability to connect and engage. 

User: I feel a bit more hopeful thinking about that.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up, let’s summarize what you’re taking away from our conversation today. What will be your focus moving forward?

User: I’ll focus on joining an art class, writing about my experiences, and taking small steps to gradually connect with people. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! You’re more capable than you think. Remember to be gentle with yourself as you transition back outside. I believe in your ability to find a supportive environment.

User: Thank you. I really appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You’re welcome! It’s been a pleasure talking with you. As you continue on this journey, know that it's normal to feel apprehensive, but you have the tools and support to make positive changes. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need guidance again. Take care, Xiao Li!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoli! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I feel a bit more stable than before, and I’m starting to look forward to the future, but I still have concerns about returning to real life.

Consultant: I’m happy to hear that you feel more stable and are hopeful about the future. That’s an important step. Can you share more about the specific concerns you have about returning to your daily life?

User: I’m worried about how to reintegrate into everyday activities. I haven’t worked for a while, and the thought of finding a job again feels overwhelming. 

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, especially after a significant break. Let's work together to break it down. What kind of job are you considering, and what do you think would help you feel more ready for that step?

User: I think I’d like to work in a stable environment, maybe something at an office. I just don’t know if I’ll handle the pressure.

Consultant: It's great that you have a direction in mind! Feeling pressure is normal, but we can develop strategies to help you manage that. What do you see as the biggest source of pressure for you in a job setting?

User: I think it’s the fear of not being good enough or making mistakes. That feeling is really intense for me.

Consultant: That fear is something many people experience. Let’s take a moment to explore that feeling. Can you recall a time when you felt you weren’t good enough? What thoughts crossed your mind during that experience?

User: I remember times in school when I didn’t do well on tests. I thought I was just a failure or that I would never succeed.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite damaging. Let's challenge those ideas together. What evidence do you have that supports the belief that you are a failure? Are there instances that contradict that belief?

User: I guess I did finish high school, and I’ve had some compliments about my work previously. So, maybe it’s not entirely true.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! Acknowledging your achievements is important. What if we reframe the thought of “being a failure” into something more supportive? 

User: Maybe I could think of it as “I’ve struggled, but I’ve also succeeded at times.”

Consultant: That sounds more balanced! Let's keep that positive perspective in mind. Now, regarding your job search, what steps can you take this week to move forward towards finding that office job?

User: I could update my resume and perhaps start looking at job listings. Maybe I can also practice some interview questions.

Consultant: Those are excellent steps! It’s about taking small, manageable actions. How do you feel about setting aside some time each day to work on these tasks this week?

User: I think that’d help. Just focusing on one task at a time might lessen the pressure.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on one task at a time can make everything feel more attainable. As you work on this, how can you remind yourself of the progress you are making?

User: I could keep a journal to note my accomplishments or just how I feel each day. That might help me reflect on my progress.

Consultant: A journal is a wonderful idea! It allows you to celebrate small victories and reflect on your journey. I believe that practicing self-reflection will also help strengthen your sense of control. 

User: I’ll definitely give that a try.

Consultant: Great! As you prepare to leave the hospital and start this new chapter, what challenges do you foresee arising, and how might you navigate them?

User: I’m worried about feeling overwhelmed again, like I did in the past. What if I can’t handle the stress?

Consultant: Recognizing that possibility is a good start. We can develop coping strategies together. What are some activities or practices that help you when you start feeling stressed? 

User: I like drawing and listening to music. Those things usually calm me down.

Consultant: Those are fantastic tools! Let’s integrate those into your daily routine so that you have healthy outlets for stress. When might you set aside time each week for drawing or music?

User: I could spend evenings drawing for an hour after I finish my tasks.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Allowing yourself that time to relax and express creativity will help prevent feelings of overwhelm. 

User: Thanks, that really helps!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! So let’s summarize your plan: You will update your resume, look for job listings, practice interview questions, and keep a journal while carving out time for drawing. How does that sound?

User: It sounds great! I feel a bit more organized and ready.

Consultant: I'm thrilled to hear that! You've made significant progress today. Remember, it’s about taking it one step at a time. 

User: Yes, I will keep that in mind.

Consultant: As we wrap up, what’s one takeaway from our session that you feel will be most helpful for you moving forward?

User: I think it would be remembering that I’m capable of handling challenges. I just need to take small steps.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway! Trust in your ability to manage challenges, and take it step by step. You’re more capable than you realize.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaoli. I’m proud of the progress you've made. If you ever need support again, know that I’m here for you. Good luck with everything!

User: Thank you! I feel more confident about the future now. Goodbye!

Consultant: Goodbye, Xiaoli! Take care and best of luck on your journey!
