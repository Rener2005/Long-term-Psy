Consultant: Hello, Tom! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling recently, especially with your team's performance in the matches?

User: Hi! Honestly, it's been tough. I'm feeling a lot of pressure because our team hasn't been performing well. I want to help them improve, but I feel pretty lost when it comes to sports psychology.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when you care so much about your team's success. Let's talk more about what specifically feels challenging for you right now. What do you think is affecting the team's performance?

User: I think it's a mix of things. Many of the players are new, and they don't seem to gel well together. I feel like I'm responsible for getting them to work more seamlessly, but I don't know how to make that happen.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, managing a group of new players and trying to build a cohesive team. Building rapport and cooperation among team members is indeed critical. What have you tried so far to help improve the team's dynamics?

User: I've organized a few training sessions, but they mostly focus on skills. I haven’t really incorporated any team-building exercises or psychological strategies. I guess I've just assumed they would get better with practice, but it doesn't seem to be enough.

Consultant: It sounds like you see the importance of practice but are unsure about integrating psychological strategies to improve teamwork. Sports psychology can significantly enhance not just individual skills but also group dynamics. Would you like to learn some concepts that could help here?

User: Yes, absolutely! I want to understand how to help my team work better together and improve their mindset during games.

Consultant: Great! One foundational concept in sports psychology is the idea of team cohesion. It's about how united your players feel as a group. Can you think of any specific moments during your training or matches where you've noticed the team not working well together?

User: Definitely. There have been times when players seem hesitant to pass the ball to each other or when tensions rise during a game. It feels like they're not trusting each other's skills.

Consultant: Trust is crucial in a team setting. One way to encourage trust is through open communication. Have you considered conducting sessions focused on discussing team roles or expectations? This could help players feel more connected and understand how they fit into the team's dynamics.

User: I haven’t really done that. I usually just focus on the drills and game strategies. I see how discussing roles could help, but I'm not entirely sure how to facilitate that discussion.

Consultant: That's a valid concern. You can start by having a casual meeting outside of training to allow players to express their thoughts and concerns. You could ask open-ended questions like, "What do you enjoy most about playing on this team?" or "How do you think we can support each other better on the field?" These questions can open the door to more in-depth discussions.

User: That sounds manageable! I like the idea of having a relaxed setting for them to share. It could help them feel more at ease.

Consultant: Absolutely! A relaxed environment can lead to more honest conversations. Additionally, consider incorporating some team-building exercises that focus on collaboration. Activities that require players to depend on each other can strengthen their bonds on the field.

User: I’ve seen some teams do trust falls or team obstacle courses. Would something like that be beneficial?

Consultant: Yes, those activities can be effective! They encourage communication and build trust among team members. Just ensure that everyone is comfortable participating. Once trust increases, they're likely to perform better during matches. 

User: I like that idea. I can see how these types of activities might help break down barriers. 

Consultant: It's a good start! Also, remember to reinforce positive communication habits. Praising efforts and achievements, no matter how small, can boost team morale and help maintain a positive atmosphere.

User: That makes sense. I often focus on errors during training instead of highlighting what they do well. 

Consultant: It can be easy to fall into that pattern, especially when trying to improve. Shifting the focus to positivity can create a more supportive environment, which in turn can enhance performance. What do you think will be your next step after this discussion?

User: I think I’ll try organizing that meeting to discuss roles and expectations, and then introduce some team-building exercises in our next training session.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Just remember, building trust and cooperation takes time, so be patient with both yourself and your players.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your advice. It’s been helpful to talk this through. I feel more confident about trying these strategies.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Tom! As you apply these strategies, keep reflecting on what works and what doesn’t. We can always discuss the results in future sessions. How do you feel about what we've talked about today?

User: I feel much better! I have a clearer understanding of how to approach things with my team. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Remember, these changes take time, but even small steps can lead to noticeable improvements. 

User: Definitely! Thank you again for your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Tom. Take care, and I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Tom! It's great to see you today. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been okay, but I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. The training is improving, but during actual matches, the team is still struggling with coordination and teamwork. I'm not quite sure how to boost their on-field chemistry yet.

Consultant: I see, it sounds like you're experiencing some frustration with the team's performance despite the progress in training. Let's take a moment to evaluate your thoughts on this. What do you feel is causing the lack of chemistry during matches?

User: I think it's a mix of the new players not knowing each other well and the pressure to perform. I'm worried that they might be too focused on their individual performance instead of working together.

Consultant: That makes sense. It sounds like the pressure and the team's dynamics are affecting how they play together. Have you observed any specific behaviors during the games that illustrate this lack of teamwork?

User: Yes, during the last match, I noticed players were not communicating effectively. They seemed hesitant to pass the ball or make spaces for each other. They were all trying to be the star.

Consultant: It sounds like communication is a significant barrier for the team right now. In your view, what impact does this have on their overall performance and your role as a coach?

User: It's frustrating because I know they have potential, but without teamwork, it's hard for them to succeed. I feel like I'm failing them as their coach.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, but remember, building a cohesive team takes time. Let’s explore some strategies to enhance communication and teamwork during matches. Have you considered incorporating team-building exercises or practices focused on cooperation?

User: I haven't done much in that regard. I usually focus more on skills and drills. I suppose team-building activities could help them bond better, right?

Consultant: Absolutely! Team-building activities can strengthen relationships and improve communication on the field. Perhaps we could brainstorm a few activities that would be fun and promote teamwork?

User: That sounds good. Maybe we could do some trust exercises or small-sided games that require cooperation.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Small-sided games can create opportunities for players to interact and rely on one another, while trust exercises can help build rapport. What are your thoughts on trying these activities in your next training session?

User: I think it would be beneficial. I hope they’ll open up and start trusting each other more. 

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! Building trust is essential for team dynamics. It may take some patience, but consistently implementing these activities could foster a better environment for collaboration. How do you feel about encouraging feedback among team members during these exercises?

User: That sounds helpful. If they can express their thoughts, it might make them feel more involved. But what if they don’t take it seriously?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Setting a supportive atmosphere where everyone knows feedback is constructive could make a difference. You could also model this behavior by sharing your observations and encouraging openness. How does this approach resonate with you?

User: I like that. If they see me being open and supportive, they might feel more comfortable sharing too. I just need to find a way to convey this effectively.

Consultant: Yes! Leading by example is vital. You might demonstrate vulnerability and express how you value their input. Additionally, promoting a culture where mistakes are seen as learning opportunities can help reduce pressure. What are your thoughts on addressing mistakes positively?

User: I think that could work. I used to get frustrated when they made mistakes, but maybe if we highlight learning instead, it might encourage them more.

Consultant: Exactly! Shifting the perspective from a fear of mistakes to viewing them as part of the learning process can build resilience and confidence. What steps can you take to implement this mindset during your next training?

User: I'll definitely try to highlight the positives in their performance, even when they mess up. I want to create an environment where they feel safe and supported.

Consultant: That's a fantastic strategy! It's large steps towards fostering a positive and resilient team culture. How are you feeling about your role as a coach now?

User: I still feel a bit unsure, but I’m encouraged to implement these ideas. I see the potential in the team, and I really want to help them succeed together.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling encouraged! Remember that improving teamwork takes time, and you're already making progress by trying new approaches. Let's summarize what we've discussed today and outline tangible actions you can take.

User: Okay! We talked about incorporating team-building activities, encouraging open feedback, and focusing on learning from mistakes.

Consultant: Exactly, and by applying these strategies, you're not just enhancing teamwork but also building a supportive environment that can help boost your own confidence as a coach. How do you feel moving forward with these insights?

User: I feel a little more positive about it. I think with these activities, we can get to know each other better and improve our performance. I just hope to see the results in the next game.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! Keep in mind that progress can be incremental. Celebrate small victories along the way. If you ever feel uncertain or need support, I'm here to help. I wish you the best of luck, Tom! 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance. I’m looking forward to the next training session with a new approach!

Consultant: You're welcome, Tom! I'm excited for you and the team. Let’s catch up again soon to review how things are evolving. Have a great day!
###################
Consultant: Hello Tom! It's great to have you here for today's session. Before we dive in, how have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a mix of encouragement and disappointment. I’m proud that our team has improved, but I still feel let down that we didn’t win the last match as we had hoped.

Consultant: It sounds like you are experiencing a blend of positive and negative emotions related to your team's performance. Let’s explore that a bit more. What specifically about the outcome has been bothering you?

User: I think I expected too much from the team after the improvements we made in practice. But, deep down, I know they are still getting used to playing together. 

Consultant: It's understandable to expect success when you see progress. It can be tough when things don't align with our expectations. What would you say success means to you in this context? 

User: I guess success means winning games, but maybe it should also include how well we play as a team and the progress we make together. 

Consultant: That's a valuable insight, Tom. It seems like you have a broader understanding of success now. How do you feel this new perspective impacts your role as a coach?

User: It makes me feel like I should focus more on team cohesion rather than just the outcomes. But I still worry about the players feeling discouraged if we don’t win.

Consultant: It’s great that you want to prioritize team cohesion. Let’s unpack that concern regarding discouragement. What can you do to nurture their spirits even in challenging times?

User: Maybe I could emphasize the improvements we’ve made, not just in winning but in how we work together and support each other.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful approach! Highlighting those improvements can help shift the focus away from just winning. Can you think of instances in practice where you've noticed positive changes?

User: Yes, during our last training, I saw players communicating better and working more effectively as a team. I should definitely remind them of that.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing those moments can reinforce their growth. How does that make you feel about your leadership role?

User: It makes me feel more confident as a coach. I’d like to create an environment where everyone feels valued for their contributions.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, Tom! Cultivating a positive environment can really enhance team morale. What strategies can you implement to foster that sense of value among your players?

User: I think I could give more positive feedback during practices and create opportunities for players to share their thoughts and ideas.

Consultant: Positive feedback is a powerful tool! How do you think your players would respond to that type of encouragement?

User: I believe they would appreciate it and feel more motivated to participate. It might help them open up and work even better together.

Consultant: That’s a promising perspective. Encouragement can be a game-changer. Have you noticed any specific cognitive patterns that might be affecting your feelings about the game outcomes?

User: Sometimes I catch myself thinking that if we lose, it means I'm not doing a good job as a coach, which really stresses me out.

Consultant: That sounds like a tough thought to carry. Let’s challenge that thought together. What evidence do you have that losing reflects your abilities as a coach?

User: I guess there are many factors, like player dynamics and how new they all are. It’s not entirely on me if we don’t win. 

Consultant: Exactly! You’re recognizing that multiple factors contribute to the game’s outcome. How would you describe your role in focusing on improvement instead of just the final score?

User: I should be more like a guide who supports the team's development rather than just judging based on wins or losses.

Consultant: That’s a very constructive reframe, Tom! What would it look like for you to embody that guiding role more actively?

User: I could set specific development goals for the team and celebrate small victories in practice, no matter how minor they seem.

Consultant: Celebrating those small victories is essential for building momentum and confidence. If you apply this approach, how do you envision your team's response moving forward?

User: I think it would foster a sense of unity and resilience, making them focus more on improving rather than fearing failure.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant way to enhance your team's psychological resilience! As we wrap up today’s session, what are some key takeaways you’d like to implement moving forward?

User: I want to emphasize team growth, give positive feedback, and remind everyone that improvement is more important than just winning.

Consultant: Those are fantastic intentions, Tom. I believe these strategies will help cultivate a more supportive environment. Remember, you've got the skills to guide your team effectively. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance and support. I feel more hopeful about the next stages of our coaching journey.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Tom! I'm glad to see you today. How have things been since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good. I've been diving deeper into sports psychology concepts for my coaching. It's been quite enlightening, but I still have some questions about integrating these ideas into my training sessions.

Consultant: That sounds great! It’s encouraging to hear that you are exploring sports psychology. What specific concepts have you found most interesting, and what challenges are you encountering with integration?

User: I've been looking into motivation techniques and how to foster better focus among my players. However, sometimes I wonder if they'll really respond to these methods. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have doubts about how your players will react to new techniques. What do you think might influence their response to these motivation techniques?

User: I guess it depends on their individual personalities and their motivation levels. Some of them seem really eager, while others appear more reserved or less engaged.

Consultant: You've identified a crucial point! Understanding the unique dynamics within your team can make a significant difference. How do you currently gauge their motivation during training?

User: I usually watch how they engage in drills and how they communicate with each other. But I wonder if I should be doing more to assess their mental readiness or motivation levels.

Consultant: That's a good start! Observations during drills can reveal a lot. Would you be open to incorporating some brief mental readiness assessments at the beginning of each session? It might give you more insight into their current state.

User: That could work! I could ask them how they’re feeling and what they want to achieve from that session. But what if they seem disengaged or unsure?

Consultant: It’s understandable to be concerned about possible disengagement. You could normalize these feelings by explaining that it's okay to have off days too. Encouraging open communication may foster a more supportive environment for them to express concern or uncertainties.

User: I like that idea! If I create a safer space, they might feel more comfortable sharing their thoughts. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Establishing that trust is vital in a team setting. Have you thought about how you can apply this approach consistently in your sessions?

User: I think I could start with a quick check-in at the beginning of practice. Maybe even create a quick group activity that encourages everyone to share their goals for the session.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive initiative! This check-in could help build camaraderie and encourage your players to stay focused. How do you envision implementing this activity in your next training?

User: I could set aside the first 10 minutes for everyone to share. I’ll make it feel more like a team-building exercise rather than just a formality. 

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Think about how proud they will feel contributing to the team's goals. What kind of responses would you hope to hear from them during this check-in?

User: I’d love to hear them express their personal goals and maybe some struggles. It would be great for them to also encourage each other.

Consultant: Encouragement among team members can foster a sense of community and accountability. What if we explore some ways to encourage those supportive interactions?

User: Maybe I could facilitate a round where they share a positive note about another teammate’s effort from previous practices?

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! By highlighting each other’s strengths, your players will likely feel more valued, enhancing their performance. Are you excited to try this out in your next training?

User: Definitely! I think this could really help improve the team dynamic, and I feel more confident about trying this out.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear your excitement! Let’s also discuss what mental skills training concepts you might want to introduce in conjunction with this. Do you have any initial ideas?

User: I was thinking about teaching them focus techniques, like breath control or visualization, to help them channel their energy better during practice and games.

Consultant: Those are fantastic skills! Visualization can be a powerful technique. How familiar are your players with these mental skills?

User: Not very. Most have probably never encountered anything like it. I’ll need to introduce it in a simple and engaging way. 

Consultant: Of course! We can break down these concepts to make them accessible. Perhaps starting with a brief introduction to each technique, followed by a group activity to practice together could be effective?

User: Yes! That would make it less intimidating. I could use simple language and relatable examples. 

Consultant: That's a great approach! It's important to ensure they feel comfortable with such concepts. Would you like to try a brief exercise right now, imagining how you would introduce one of these techniques to your team?

User: Sure! For breath control, I might say something like, "Let’s take a moment to just breathe together. Focus on your inhale and exhale—this helps clear our minds."

Consultant: That sounds calming and effective! How do you think your team would respond to such an exercise?

User: I think they'd be surprised at first but might enjoy it. I hope it helps them feel more present.

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s all about creating an experience that promotes mindfulness. You seem really enthusiastic about implementing these changes. How does that make you feel?

User: I feel really positive! I think I can make a real impact on my team’s mindset. I'm ready to put these ideas into action!

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Tom! Your readiness to embrace these techniques will lead to significant improvements not just for you, but for your entire team. As we wrap up today, what key takeaway do you want to focus on before our next session?

User: I want to really commit to the check-in practice and the breathing technique. I think establishing those could set a positive tone for everything else.

Consultant: Great focus! I believe these practices will aid in building trust and openness within your team. I'm looking forward to hearing how they respond in our next session. Remember, you're making valuable progress!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance. I'm looking forward to implementing everything!

Consultant: You're welcome, Tom! It's always a pleasure working with you. Let’s reconnect soon and celebrate your progress!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Tom! It's great to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially after the friendly match?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good, actually. Seeing the team work together and perform better definitely boosted my confidence in the strategies we've discussed before.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like the match was a validating experience for you. Can you tell me more about what you observed in your team's performance that made you feel confident?

User: Well, the players seemed more cohesive; their communication on the field was much better than before. I think my emphasis on teamwork and positive reinforcement really helped.

Consultant: It's great that you noticed such a positive change in your team's dynamics. How did it feel for you to see those improvements during the match?

User: It felt really rewarding! I was proud of the guys for stepping up and working together. It gave me a sense of achievement as their coach.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It’s important to recognize your own contribution to that success. What specific strategies do you think were most effective in fostering that teamwork?

User: I encouraged them to communicate openly and keep each other motivated. I also focused on instilling a sense of trust among the players. I think that made a huge difference.

Consultant: Building trust and open communication can indeed strengthen a team's performance. How do you plan to continue emphasizing those strategies in future practices or games?

User: I want to keep reinforcing those principles in our training sessions and perhaps spend a few more minutes on team-building exercises. They really seemed to respond well to that.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Tom. Have you had a chance to reflect on any challenges or areas for improvement that you noticed during the match?

User: Yes, I did spot a few players who were a bit hesitant at times. I think they need more confidence to make quick decisions under pressure.

Consultant: Identifying those hesitations is a key insight. How might you help those players build confidence in those high-pressure moments?

User: I could incorporate some pressure situations in practice to help them learn to react quickly. Maybe even simulate game scenarios to boost their comfort levels.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! By simulating those situations, you can create a safe space for them to practice and gain that vital experience. How do you feel about implementing that in your training?

User: I feel good about it! I think it will encourage the players to step out of their comfort zones and grow as athletes.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Growth often comes from pushing boundaries. While you're fostering their skills, how do you ensure you’re also taking care of your own coaching mindset?

User: I try to remind myself that it's a process. I have to be patient with both myself and the players. I think practicing mindfulness has helped me stay grounded.

Consultant: Mindfulness can be a powerful tool. It sounds like you're aware of the need to balance your focus on the team while also nurturing your own growth. How are you feeling about your application of sports psychology techniques so far?

User: I'm feeling quite positive. The techniques I’ve been applying appear to pay off, and I have more confidence in my approach now.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s build on that confidence. Can you identify any specific moments where you felt the techniques had a direct impact during the match?

User: Sure! There was a moment when a player made a mistake, and instead of reacting negatively, I used positive reinforcement to encourage him, which worked surprisingly well.

Consultant: That’s a great example! Using positive reinforcement in the moment can significantly influence players’ morale. How did the other players respond to that approach?

User: They seemed to rally around each other more after that. It was like they were lifting each other up instead of getting down.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic shift! It suggests you’re creating a supportive environment. As you continue this journey, how do you plan to maintain and expand on these positive strategies?

User: I want to keep reinforcing this idea of support and positivity in our team culture. Maybe I could even set clear goals for how we can improve together.

Consultant: Setting goals is a great way to solidify your team's path forward. Reflecting on everything we’ve discussed, what are you feeling proud of today?

User: I’m really proud of how far I’ve come as a coach and how the team has evolved. It’s great to see our hard work starting to pay off.

Consultant: That’s a tremendous achievement, Tom! Acknowledging your progress is important. As we wrap up, what strategies can you carry forward to continue this success in your coaching journey?

User: I plan to stick with the positive reinforcement, keep practicing mindfulness, and maintain open communication with my team.

Consultant: Excellent strategies! You’ve built a strong foundation. Remember, it's about maintaining those techniques over time. If you ever need support, I'm here to help. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate all your guidance in this process.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of your progress. Until next time, keep up the great work!
###################
Consultant: Hello Tom! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling about your role in the football team lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite proud and accomplished recently. The psychological skills I've been teaching to the team seem to be making a positive difference. It's nice to see them respond well!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made a positive impact on the team. Can you share some specific changes you've noticed since implementing these skills?

User: Definitely! The team atmosphere has become much more supportive. Players are communicating better with each other and are more open about discussing their feelings on the field. 

Consultant: That's a significant improvement! Enhanced communication can really elevate team dynamics. How do you feel witnessing these changes as their coach?

User: It feels rewarding! I never imagined the psychological techniques would resonate so well. It gives me confidence and motivates me to continue working on these skills.

Consultant: That’s excellent, Tom! It’s fantastic that you’ve experienced such a positive response. What are your thoughts on the long-term application of these psychological skills within the team?

User: I think it's essential. If we can maintain this momentum, it will lead to even better performance and cohesion. I'm just not sure how to keep everyone engaged over time.

Consultant: That's a valid concern. Keeping players engaged is key to sustaining these positive changes. Would you be open to discussing some strategies to ensure continued application and improvement of these skills?

User: Absolutely! I’d love to hear some suggestions.

Consultant: One approach could be to have regular check-ins with the players, perhaps discussing how the skills are impacting their performance. This could help reinforce their importance. How do you think the players would respond to that?

User: I think they would appreciate that. They seem to value open communication, so having those discussions would likely keep them engaged.

Consultant: Great! Another suggestion is to encourage peer support among team members. They could help each other apply these psychological techniques in practice. What do you think about that idea?

User: That makes sense! If they can hold each other accountable, it might create a more consistent practice environment.

Consultant: Exactly! Creating a culture of support and accountability can reinforce their learning. Additionally, are there any specific challenges you've encountered while implementing these skills?

User: Sometimes, I feel like a few players might hesitate to fully open up. They might be unsure about discussing their feelings in a sports context.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Some people might be hesitant to share their feelings, especially in a competitive environment. It might help to establish a safe space where players can express themselves without judgment. How would you approach that?

User: I could make it a point to share my own experiences and feelings. If they see me being open, they might feel more comfortable doing the same.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Leading by example can foster trust and encourage others to share. As you reflect on these developments, how do you envision maintaining your own motivation and engagement as a coach?

User: I think by continuing to see the progress my players make. It reinvigorates my passion for coaching. I also enjoy learning new techniques, so I can keep improving.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Pursuing your growth alongside your team can cultivate a learning environment for everyone. How do you plan to implement new techniques or strategies as you move forward?

User: I could schedule regular training sessions, focusing on both skills and psychology. That way, we can integrate the techniques into our practices consistently.

Consultant: That's a solid plan! Integrating psychological skills into your regular practice can enhance their effectiveness and keep the team engaged. Have you thought about any particular metrics or feedback methods to assess the ongoing impact of these skills?

User: I want to establish some informal feedback mechanisms, maybe through short surveys or informal discussions. It will help gauge how the team is feeling about their progress and the skills.

Consultant: That sounds effective! Soliciting feedback regularly can provide valuable insights and make players feel valued. As we come to the end of our session, what do you see as your biggest takeaway today, Tom?

User: I think establishing a consistent communication channel for feedback and accountability is crucial. I'm optimistic about continuing this journey with my team.

Consultant: That's a great takeaway! You've shown tremendous dedication to your players. Remember, staying engaged and open will encourage a lasting positive atmosphere. If any challenges arise, know that you’re welcome to return for further support.

User: Thank you! I appreciate all the guidance and support you've offered. I feel more equipped to handle the future.

Consultant: It's my pleasure, Tom! I'm glad to hear that. Best of luck with your team, and take care until we meet again!
