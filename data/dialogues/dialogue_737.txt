Consultant: Hello, Xiaoduan! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling quite lost. With graduation approaching, I feel overwhelmed by future decisions. I don't know if I should pursue a PhD or go back home and take civil service exams. It's making me really anxious.

Consultant: That sounds tough. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when facing such significant decisions. Can you tell me more about what those choices mean to you and why they’re causing you anxiety?

User: Well, if I choose to pursue a PhD, I feel like I might be delaying my entry into the real world. But if I go for the civil service exams, I worry about whether I’ll be satisfied in that role. I constantly question my abilities and whether I can handle either path.

Consultant: It’s natural to have those doubts, especially when considering your future path. It seems like you’re feeling pressure from both options, and that’s impacting your confidence. Can you reflect on how these thoughts are affecting your mood and sleep?

User: It's really hard. I often find myself lying awake at night, worrying about making the wrong choice. Some nights, I even wake up earlier than I need to, feeling anxious about what lies ahead.

Consultant: I hear you. Those worries can certainly make it difficult to rest. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. When you think about your future, what specific thoughts come to your mind, and how do they make you feel?

User: I often think, "What if I fail?" or "What if I choose the wrong path?" And then I feel really hopeless, like I don't have any direction or purpose.

Consultant: It sounds like those negative thoughts are quite heavy on you and contribute to your feelings of hopelessness. Let’s examine one of those thoughts together. When you think, "What if I fail?" how much evidence do you think supports that idea?

User: I honestly feel like I don't have much evidence. But I can't help but think about past experiences where I struggled. It makes me feel like I'm not capable of succeeding.

Consultant: That’s a valid understanding of your feelings. It can be easy to let past experiences dictate our current thoughts. If a friend were in your position, what would you say to them about their fears of failure?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay to not be perfect. I’d encourage them to try their best and not fear failure.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective! You showed kindness and understanding towards your friend. Perhaps you can apply that same kindness to yourself. In challenging those negative thoughts, how can you reframe "What if I fail?" into something more supportive?

User: Maybe I could think, "I might face challenges, but I have the skills to overcome them." That feels a bit more encouraging.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a great reframe. By acknowledging your skills, you start to build a more balanced view of your abilities. Let’s shift gears a bit and talk about how you can manage these feelings so they don’t interfere with your sleep. Have you considered any relaxation techniques before bed?

User: I haven’t really tried anything specific. I usually just lie there, worrying.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Engaging in a simple relaxation routine may help ease your mind. Techniques like deep breathing or mindfulness can help calm those racing thoughts. Would you be open to trying some of those before sleeping?

User: That sounds like it could help. I’d be willing to give it a shot.

Consultant: Great! We can explore some breathing exercises together. Practicing these techniques regularly can make a big difference in how you feel at night. And as you continue to challenge those negative thoughts, it may help you to feel more empowered about your future choices.

User: I really hope so. I just want to feel more certain about things.

Consultant: I understand that desire for certainty; it's completely natural. Remember, it’s okay to feel uncertain while exploring your options. It’s a part of the process, and we can work through it together. As we continue our sessions, we’ll focus more on identifying your core values and interests to help clarify your direction.

User: That sounds helpful. I think understanding myself better would make it easier to choose.

Consultant: Exactly! Self-discovery is an empowering journey, and it can lead to greater clarity. Let’s make that our focus moving forward. Is there a particular area or interest you’ve been curious about exploring?

User: I’ve always found psychology fascinating. Maybe I should consider that aspect more deeply.

Consultant: That’s an excellent area to explore, especially given your current situation. Psychology can provide various career paths, including counseling, research, or even teaching. Let’s think about what excites you about psychology and how that might fit into your future.

User: I like the idea of helping others through tough times, similar to what we’re doing now. It feels meaningful.

Consultant: Helping others can indeed be a very meaningful pursuit. It could also be a way for you to find your purpose and self-worth. As we delve into this field, we can look into how you might develop skills that align with that interest and generate a sense of fulfillment.

User: That makes sense. I’d love to find ways to develop those skills.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can look at opportunities, such as courses or volunteer programs, to start building those skills. It’s a fantastic way to gain experience while also nurturing your interests and passions.

User: I’m excited about that possibility. It feels like a step in the right direction.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiaoduan! Taking steps toward what excites you can create a positive momentum. Let’s also ensure you maintain a routine that incorporates those relaxation techniques to aid your sleep. 

User: Yes, I’ll definitely try to set up a routine.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize where we’re at. You’ve identified key thoughts and feelings around your future and acknowledged the importance of exploring your interests. How do you feel about the progress you’ve made today?

User: I feel a bit lighter, actually. Talking it out helped me see things more clearly.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! As you continue to explore these feelings and practice new techniques, remember to be gentle with yourself. You’re doing well, and I look forward to our next session where we can continue to build on this progress.

User: Thank you, I appreciate your support. I feel hopeful about moving forward.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoduan. Remember, it’s a journey, and I’m here to support you along the way. If any new thoughts or feelings arise before our next session, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care!

User: I will, thank you again!

Consultant: Hello, welcome to today's session. I'm glad to see you. I understand that you've been feeling some pressure regarding your career planning. Can you tell me more about what you’ve been experiencing recently?

User: Hi. Yes, I feel really confused about my career path. After attending a career development seminar at school, I realized I don’t have a clear understanding of my future direction. This has increased my stress levels immensely.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when faced with important decisions about your future. What kind of feelings come up for you when you think about your career path?

User: I often feel anxious and doubt my abilities. Sometimes, I even think I'm not good enough for the opportunities that come my way. It’s really discouraging.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me. It seems like there’s a strong sense of self-doubt. Can you identify specific thoughts that come to mind when you feel this way?

User: I think things like, “I won’t succeed,” or “Others are much more capable than I am.” These thoughts make me feel even more isolated and down.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite heavy and impactful. Let's explore them a bit more. How do you think these beliefs about your abilities affect your emotions and actions?

User: Well, they make me anxious, and then I often avoid making decisions or taking action because I feel paralyzed by those thoughts. It’s like a vicious cycle.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. Recognizing that cycle is an important step. What evidence do you have to support those negative thoughts? Have there been times where you succeeded despite feeling this way?

User: I did well in some projects before, and I got positive feedback. But I tend to overlook those moments and focus on my insecurities instead.

Consultant: That’s a common experience, focusing on the negatives while dismissing the positives. If a friend were in your shoes and shared those thoughts with you, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably remind them of their accomplishments and tell them to believe in themselves. 

Consultant: Exactly! You have the ability to see the value in others, but it’s essential to apply that same kindness to yourself. We can work on reframing those negative thoughts. What if you started acknowledging your strengths alongside your self-doubt?

User: That might help. I think I need to create a list of my strengths and past successes to remind myself.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Creating a strengths list can help shift your focus. How about we set a small goal for you this week? Perhaps you can write down three achievements or positive qualities each day.

User: I can do that! I think it would help boost my confidence if I can recognize these things more consciously.

Consultant: Wonderful! Alongside this, let’s discuss how you can approach your feelings of anxiety when they arise. What activities help you feel more relaxed or grounded?

User: I enjoy painting and listening to music. Those help me feel better momentarily.

Consultant: Those are fantastic outlets. How about integrating those activities into your routine? Maybe set aside time daily to create or listen to music. 

User: Yes, that sounds doable. I could use them to unwind, especially when I start to feel anxious about my future.

Consultant: That's a solid plan. Also, as you work on your strengths list, it’s important to practice self-compassion. Whenever you catch yourself doubting your abilities, gently remind yourself that it’s okay to make mistakes and learn from them.

User: I really need to remember that. I often feel like I have to be perfect, which adds to my anxiety.

Consultant: Perfectionism is indeed a heavy weight to carry. It’s okay to strive for excellence while also allowing yourself the grace to grow. What strategies do you think could help you manage that perfectionistic mindset?

User: I guess taking small steps instead of aiming for immediate perfection could work. I could practice being okay with just doing my best instead.

Consultant: That sounds like a productive approach! Remember, small, consistent steps often lead to significant change over time. As you continue to work on these strategies, let’s keep checking in about how they make you feel. 

User: Definitely. I’m feeling slightly more hopeful about making these changes.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, it’s a journey—be patient with yourself. For our next session, we can discuss what you've learned from your reflections and any obstacles you encounter along the way. 

User: That sounds great. I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing your thoughts today. To conclude our session, let’s summarize what you’ll be working on this week: practicing self-reflection through a strengths list and engaging in activities that relax you. 

User: Yes, I’ll focus on those!

Consultant: Excellent! You’re making important strides toward understanding yourself better. If you experience overwhelming feelings, remember you can always reach out. Take care, and I look forward to our next session together!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello there! It’s great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been thinking a lot about my future lately. I had a conversation with my brother about our goals, and it made me realize how far I feel from what I want to achieve. I can’t shake off this anxiety about where I’m headed.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like that conversation brought up some strong feelings about your future and self-perception. Could you share more about what specific thoughts or worries you've been having?

User: I keep wondering if I’m good enough or if I'll ever find a career that suits me. I envy my brother’s clarity and direction. It makes me feel lost and alone.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way, especially when comparing yourself to others. Let’s explore those feelings further. What do you think contributes to this sense of feeling lost?

User: I think it’s because I haven’t figured out what I genuinely enjoy. I’m just going through the motions, but I don’t feel passionate about anything.

Consultant: That feeling of being on autopilot can be quite disheartening. It’s important to identify what truly resonates with you. Can you recall any moments or activities during your studies that made you feel excited or engaged?

User: Well, I enjoyed a few seminars, especially the ones about research methodologies. But I still feel like I’m just not sure if that’s what I want to focus on.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! It sounds like there’s potential there. Let’s challenge this uncertainty a bit—what evidence do you have that suggests you couldn't pursue this area further?

User: I guess I don’t have a lot, but I keep thinking that my peers are more knowledgeable and experienced. It feels intimidating.

Consultant: Those feelings of intimidation can be powerful. Imagine if a friend shared the same concern—what would you advise her? Would you encourage her to pursue her interests despite those feelings?

User: I’d probably tell her not to be so hard on herself and that everyone has their own pace. I just wish I could see it that way for myself.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective! Let’s work on applying that understanding to your situation. What would it look like for you to take small steps towards exploring your interests in research?

User: I could maybe start by setting aside time to read more about the research topics that interest me and talk to my professors.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! By breaking it down into manageable steps, it can help reduce the pressure. How does that approach make you feel?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It seems more achievable when I think of it that way.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let’s take a moment to think about how these new insights and plans could positively influence your feelings about the future. 

User: I think if I engage more with my interests, I might feel more confident and less anxious about my path.

Consultant: Exactly! Engaging with what excites you can reduce that anxiety. What might be your first step in making this engagement happen this week?

User: I think I’ll reach out to one of my professors to ask about research topics they’re working on. That seems manageable.

Consultant: That’s a great starting point! You’re taking action, which is a significant step forward. As you prepare for that, what other emotions or thoughts are surfacing for you?

User: I’m a bit nervous, but mostly excited. I just hope I don’t freeze up when talking to them.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel nervous, but remember, this is an opportunity for learning and growth. You’re not alone in feeling this way. How might you prepare yourself to feel more at ease in that conversation?

User: Maybe I’ll write down some questions beforehand. That might help me feel more confident.

Consultant: That’s a smart strategy! Being prepared can ease some of that anxiety. Let’s also think about how to confront those negative thoughts if they arise during the conversation. What positive affirmation could you remind yourself of in that moment?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay not to know everything and that I’m taking steps to figure it out.

Consultant: That’s an empowering affirmation! Reflecting on that in challenging moments can help you navigate your feelings. How are you feeling about our discussion so far?

User: I feel a lot more optimistic. I think I can handle this if I take it step by step.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, exploring your interests is a journey, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. How are you planning to keep track of your feelings and progress?

User: I might start a journal to reflect on my experiences and emotions. It could help me see my growth.

Consultant: Journaling can be a powerful tool for self-reflection! It will allow you to observe your thoughts and feelings more clearly. As we look ahead, how do you envision your academic work evolving over the next few weeks?

User: I hope to gain more clarity about what I want. I’d like to explore different projects and see what resonates with me.

Consultant: That sounds like a great approach. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize your key insights and action steps. What feels like the most significant takeaway for you?

User: I think the biggest takeaway for me is that I don’t need to rush. I can take small steps toward my interests without overwhelming myself.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve made tremendous progress today. As we conclude this session, remember that it's okay to continue exploring and that you have the strength to navigate this journey. If you need support along the way, I'm here for you.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I’m feeling much better about moving forward now.

Consultant: You're welcome! I'm glad to hear that. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hi Xiaoduan! I'm glad to see you today. It seems like you've recently found some interest in academic work, and I'm really interested in exploring that with you. How have you been feeling about your research project?

User: Hi! Yes, I've started to enjoy the research project, but I still feel uncertain about my capabilities and what this means for my future. I really want to understand myself better in this context.

Consultant: It's great to hear about your newfound interest! It sounds like you're experiencing mixed emotions—excitement about the research but also some self-doubt. Can you share a specific instance from the project that sparked your interest?

User: Certainly! There was a moment when I contributed a valuable insight during a meeting. My advisor praised me for it, and it felt really validating. But immediately afterward, I worried if I could keep performing at that level.

Consultant: I see. That moment must have felt rewarding yet left you with some anxiety about maintaining that standard. When you reflected on your advisor's praise, what thoughts crossed your mind?

User: I thought, "Maybe I’m just lucky this time." It’s frustrating because I want to feel proud of my contributions instead of questioning them.

Consultant: That sounds tough, feeling like your accomplishments might not be fully deserved. It seems that a pattern of doubt arises after success. Have you noticed any triggers that lead to these negative thoughts?

User: Yes, I find that when I’m under pressure, like during deadlines, those doubts come flooding back. It’s like I can’t celebrate my wins without thinking they’ll be the last ones.

Consultant: That pressure can definitely amplify those doubts. Let's try to capture some of those automatic thoughts you have when you experience a victory. What went through your mind when you first got that positive feedback from your advisor?

User: I thought, "This is probably just a fluke, and I'll mess up next time." 

Consultant: So, you link your success to luck, rather than acknowledging your skill. If you were to look at that situation from a different perspective, how might you reframe that thought?

User: Maybe I could think that I have the skills and knowledge needed to contribute, and I deserve the praise.

Consultant: That's a good shift! Believing in your abilities is important. How would you feel if you accepted that your contributions are valid, rather than attributing them solely to luck?

User: I think it would relieve a lot of pressure off me. If I truly believe in my capabilities, I might be able to focus better on my work.

Consultant: Exactly! And this belief could lead to a more positive cycle of success. How can we help reinforce this perspective when you face self-doubt again?

User: I could remind myself that I’ve worked hard, and I’ll keep track of my successes to reflect on them.

Consultant: That's a solid plan! Journaling your achievements might help you see your progress more clearly. What specific achievements would you like to note down after our session?

User: I’d like to write about the insight I contributed and any positive feedback I receive, no matter how small.

Consultant: That sounds valuable. Keeping track of those moments can help build your confidence. As we move forward, how do you want to practice speaking to yourself positively when those doubts arise in the future?

User: I could create positive affirmations for myself, like “I am capable and my contributions matter.”

Consultant: Creating affirmations is a fantastic strategy! Let’s start integrating that into your routine. How about we set a small challenge for you this week to reinforce these affirmations?

User: That sounds good! I could say them every morning and maybe reflect on a success from the previous day.

Consultant: Perfect! I believe that will help build your confidence and counteract those self-doubts. As we wrap up today, what stands out to you about our conversation, and how do you feel about your progress?

User: I feel much better knowing I can challenge those negative thoughts. The idea of tracking my successes is empowering. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You’ve shown great insight today, and I believe you have a bright path ahead. Remember, it’s normal to experience doubt, but you’re making steps to address it. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate the support and guidance. I’m looking forward to implementing these strategies.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoduan! It's been a pleasure working with you. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support along the way. I’m looking forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling pretty good lately. My advisor recognized my work and I've been given another chance to participate in the research. It’s a big boost for my academic identity, but there are still moments of self-doubt.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant achievement! It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling the support in your academic journey. Can you tell me more about your self-doubt? When does it tend to pop up for you?

User: Well, sometimes I feel like I don’t belong or that I’m not as capable as my peers. It usually happens when I compare myself to others, especially during discussions or presentations.

Consultant: I see. It's very common to feel that way, especially in an academic environment. What do you think are the specific thoughts that come to mind when you're in those situations?

User: I often think things like, "They are so much smarter than I am," or "I’m going to mess up in front of everyone." Those thoughts really bring me down and make me anxious.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really challenging. They can create a cycle of negativity. Let's explore them together. How true do you believe those thoughts are? Is there evidence that supports them?

User: I mean, sometimes I do struggle with understanding concepts compared to some of my classmates who seem to grasp things quickly. It makes me feel insecure.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you perceive others as being ahead. However, can you think of times when you’ve succeeded or grasped concepts just as well as your peers?

User: Yes, actually. There were times when I received good feedback on my assignments and had successful presentations, but I guess I just forget those moments when I start comparing myself to others.

Consultant: Those successes are important to hold onto! They show that you are capable and deserving of your place in this program. Have you thought about how you might remind yourself of these achievements when self-doubt creeps in?

User: Not really. I haven't developed a way to counter those negative thoughts yet.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! One approach we can try is to create a list of your achievements and positive feedback. Whenever you feel self-doubt, you can refer back to this list. Would you be willing to start that together now?

User: Sure, that sounds helpful. I can think of a few examples where I performed well.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start. What’s the first achievement that comes to your mind?

User: I got an A on my last major project and my advisor praised my research skills. I felt really proud at that moment.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! You should be proud of that accomplishment. What else can you add to your list?

User: I also led a group presentation, and my classmates were very engaged. I felt like I really guided the discussion well.

Consultant: That’s another excellent achievement! You’ve demonstrated leadership and the ability to connect with others. Keep building on this list. How does it feel to reflect on these positive experiences?

User: It feels good, actually. I didn’t realize I had so many moments to be proud of.

Consultant: That’s a meaningful realization! It's vital to recognize your accomplishments as they help reinforce your self-worth. How do you think you can use this list moving forward, especially as you approach new challenges like your PhD applications?

User: I suppose I could look at it whenever I feel anxious about applying or if I start doubting my abilities again. It would be a reminder of what I’ve accomplished.

Consultant: Absolutely! You can remind yourself that you have a history of success to draw on. Each time you face an anxiety-inducing challenge, refer back to this list. Are there any other strategies you think might help you manage anxiety?

User: Maybe setting smaller goals for myself to feel more in control? 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Setting small, manageable goals can help break down overwhelming tasks into achievable steps. What could be a small goal related to your PhD application?

User: Perhaps starting to outline my statement of purpose next week?

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a very achievable goal. When you complete it, make sure to celebrate that milestone. How does this plan make you feel?

User: It feels much more manageable. I feel more in control now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It's all about taking small steps. As we wrap up today’s session, remember that you’re capable, and it's okay to acknowledge and celebrate your progress. 

User: Thank you, I really appreciate that. I feel lighter after talking about my achievements.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure to hear about your successes. Keep focusing on your strengths, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need further support. You're doing great, and I believe in your ability to tackle future challenges.

User: Thanks so much for your help today. I feel more positive about everything now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Take care, and I look forward to our next session. Remember, you’re not alone on this journey. 

User: Yes, I’ll remember that. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, welcome back! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better overall, but I still have this nagging anxiety about applying for my PhD. I want to be excited about it, but I'm just overwhelmed with the process and all steps involved.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling a bit better, though I can understand why the PhD application process might feel overwhelming. Let's explore that anxiety together. Can you share what specific aspects of the application are causing you stress?

User: Sure! I think it's mostly about the uncertainty—like whether I'll get accepted or how to effectively prepare my research proposal. I'm also worried about the recommendation letters and meeting deadlines.

Consultant: Those are valid concerns, and it’s normal to feel anxious about all those details in the process. Let’s take a moment to break this down. What would be your ideal outcome for the application process?

User: Ideally, I would love to submit everything on time and feel confident about my proposal. I also want to have positive feedback from my referees.

Consultant: That sounds like a clear goal! Let's consider the steps you could take to get there. How about we start by creating a timeline for your application components? What initial tasks feel manageable for you to begin with?

User: I think I could start by outlining my research proposal. If I clarify my ideas, it might help ease some of my anxiety.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Outlining your proposal will give you a clear starting point. Can you share what your research focus might be?

User: I’m really interested in exploring the impacts of social media on mental health, especially among students. 

Consultant: That’s a relevant and interesting topic! Focusing on that will surely make your proposal more compelling. How do you feel about dedicating some time this week to create a rough outline for it?

User: I think I could commit to that. Just the thought of having a plan eases some of my anxiety already!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Setting up a plan can indeed provide a sense of control. As you start working on your outline, what possible challenges do you foresee, and how might you tackle them?

User: I guess I might struggle with organizing my thoughts and ensuring that the proposal meets the expectations of the committee. 

Consultant: That’s a common concern! One way to handle that is by seeking feedback from classmates or professors once you have a draft. Would you be open to sharing your outline with someone to get their input?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful. I’ll reach out to a couple of friends who are also applying for their PhDs.

Consultant: Excellent! Collaborating with others can help you refine your ideas. As you prepare the outline, remember to take breaks to avoid feeling overwhelmed. What activities can you include in your schedule to help you relax?

User: I love taking walks outside or listening to music. I think I could set aside some time for those.

Consultant: Perfect! Incorporating enjoyable activities will help balance the pressures of preparing your application. Also, if you find yourself feeling anxious during this process, what strategies could you use to manage that anxiety?

User: I could try deep breathing exercises or remind myself that this is just one step toward my goals.

Consultant: Both of those strategies sound effective! Deep breathing can help you focus and calm down. It’s also great to remind yourself that this is part of a larger journey. How confident do you feel about executing that plan this week?

User: I feel quite confident! Just talking through all of this helps clarify my thoughts.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear. It’s important to acknowledge your progress. As we wrap up today’s session, what is the most valuable insight you’re taking with you?

User: I think the most valuable insight is that I can break the process down into smaller steps. It feels much more manageable that way.

Consultant: Absolutely! Breaking it down into smaller steps makes it less daunting. You’ve made significant progress today. Just remember to treat yourself with kindness during this journey. If those feelings of anxiety creep in, use the strategies we've discussed. 

User: Thank you, I will! This session has been really helpful.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You've shown commitment to your goals. Remember that I’m here to support you, so don’t hesitate to reach out if you need more guidance. Until next time, take care! 

User: Thank you, see you next time!
