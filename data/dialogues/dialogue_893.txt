Consultant: Hello, Xiaowu! I'm glad you’re here for this session. I understand things have been very tough for you lately, especially after what happened with the exams. I’d like to hear more about how you’re feeling right now.

User: Hi. I just feel so lost and hopeless. After being caught cheating, I really thought my life was over. I can’t see a future for myself anymore. It’s like all my dreams are shattered.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of despair and self-blame right now, which must be really heavy. Could you share more about what thoughts go through your mind when you feel this way?

User: I keep thinking that I disappointed everyone, especially my parents. My dad has been so angry, and it makes me feel even worse. I can't help but think that I won't be able to succeed at anything anymore.

Consultant: That sense of disappointment is understandably overwhelming. You mentioned that your dad's anger affects your feelings. How does that anger impact your self-view? 

User: It just makes me feel like I'm worthless. I used to believe I could do something meaningful, but now it just feels like I’m a failure.

Consultant: I hear you. It’s really common to feel this way after a setback. I’d like us to explore these thoughts together. Can we talk about the evidence you have for thinking you’re worthless? 

User: I guess I don’t really have any solid proof. I just feel like I’ve let everyone down, including myself. 

Consultant: That’s an important realization! It looks like you're starting to see that the belief of worthlessness might not be completely true. If a friend were in your position, what would you say to them?

User: I would probably tell them that one mistake doesn’t define who they are. I’d try to encourage them to keep trying.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you already have a perspective that recognizes that mistakes don’t define a person. How can you apply that same compassion towards yourself right now?

User: I guess I should remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and it's not the end of the world. 

Consultant: That’s a great start! Let’s name a few things that you’ve accomplished or positive qualities you possess, despite this setback. 

User: Well, I’m hardworking, and I’ve always tried my best in school. I also help my brother with his studies.

Consultant: Those are wonderful qualities! Recognizing those strengths can help shift how you view this situation. How does it feel to acknowledge those aspects of yourself?

User: It does feel a bit comforting to remember that I’m not a complete failure.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Now, let’s brainstorm some concrete steps you can take moving forward. What if we think about how to address your current feelings, while also planning for your studies?

User: I really want to focus on getting better at English, but I feel so discouraged. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel discouraged, especially after what you’ve experienced. Would you be open to setting small, achievable goals for your English study? 

User: Maybe I can try to study for just 20 minutes a day? 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Breaking it down like that can make it feel less overwhelming. How do you think you’ll feel after completing those short study sessions?

User: I think I’d feel a sense of accomplishment, even if it’s just a little bit.

Consultant: Absolutely! Those small victories can really add up over time. Besides studies, are there any activities or hobbies that bring you joy or help you relax?

User: I used to enjoy drawing but haven’t done much of it recently. 

Consultant: Drawing could be a great way for you to express your feelings and find some joy again. How about scheduling some time for that each week?

User: That sounds nice. I think I could use that to help myself feel better. 

Consultant: I’m proud of you for recognizing that. As we wrap up today, what feelings or thoughts do you want to carry forward with you from this session?

User: I want to remember that one mistake doesn’t have to define me, and I want to be kinder to myself. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway! We’ll build on this understanding in our future sessions. Thank you for your openness today, Xiaowu. Remember, it’s important to reach out if you need support. 

User: Thank you for your help! It really made me feel a bit better.

Consultant: You’re very welcome. I look forward to our next session together. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaowu! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, it's been a bit of a rollercoaster. I still feel really uncertain about my future, especially after failing the English exam. It’s hard to shake off that feeling of disappointment.

Consultant: I can see how that would be really tough for you. Failing an exam can be very disheartening, and it's understandable to feel lost afterward. Can you tell me more about what thoughts have been going through your mind lately regarding your future and your self-worth?

User: I keep thinking that since I failed, maybe I just don't have what it takes to succeed. I feel like I'm stuck in a low point and can’t see a way out.

Consultant: That sounds very heavy to carry. It's common to have those thoughts after a setback. Let's take a closer look at those feelings. You mentioned feeling stuck. Can you share what specific thoughts come to mind that make you feel this way?

User: I think things like "I will never get into a good university" or "I will disappoint my family." It's like a cloud of negativity just follows me around.

Consultant: It's really important to recognize when those thoughts creep in. They can feel overwhelming, but we can work on challenging them. Out of curiosity, do you notice any situations that trigger these thoughts for you?

User: Yeah, mostly when I think about my future or when my parents talk about my studies. I can feel their anxiety, and it makes mine worse.

Consultant: It makes sense that the environment at home would contribute to your feelings. You mentioned feeling their anxiety. How does that affect you when you talk to them?

User: It makes me anxious and pressured. I feel like I have to meet their expectations, but I’m not sure what those even are anymore.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, to feel pressure without clarity. Let’s consider this—you've faced some tough moments, but there are also things you enjoy or feel good doing. Can you think of some activities or past successes that you believe showcase your strengths?

User: Well, I enjoy painting, and I used to get good feedback in art class. But I think it's not relevant to my future studies, so I don’t focus on it much.

Consultant: Painting is a wonderful creative outlet, and it does matter! Engaging in things you love can help improve your mood and clarity. It might be useful to see how those strengths can connect to your future. What if we explore how your skills in painting could translate into other areas in your life?

User: I never thought about it that way. I guess I could use my creativity in problem-solving or maybe even in a career that involves design. 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a great insight. Your creativity can be a valuable asset. Let’s build on that. How about we list some potential pathways you'd be interested in exploring that align with your artistic talents and passions?

User: That sounds good. I really like the idea of exploring design or anything creative, but sometimes I fear it won’t be a stable career.

Consultant: It's natural to have those concerns about stability. Many people combine their passions with sound career choices. We can discuss some ways to research stable career paths while still incorporating what you love. How does that sound to you?

User: That does sound helpful. I think it might ease some worries if I can find options that feel right.

Consultant: Absolutely! Researching options could give you a better understanding of what’s out there. In the meantime, how can we incorporate some painting into your week to help improve your mood along with this exploration?

User: I could set aside some time to paint on weekends. It would be a nice break from studying.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Setting time for yourself is crucial. Let’s also think about how you can open up conversations with your family about your interests so they can support you in exploring these creative paths. What do you think?

User: That might help. I could bring it up when we talk about education next. I hope they’ll be open to it.

Consultant: It sounds like a constructive step to share your passions with them. It may also help ease the tension at home if they see you pursuing what you love. How do you feel about reaching out to them?

User: I feel a little nervous, but I think it’s worth a try. Maybe explaining how painting makes me feel might help them understand me better.

Consultant: That’s a brave step, Xiaowu! Expressing your feelings can lead to more understanding among you all. As we wrap up today, let’s take a moment to reflect on one key takeaway from our discussion that you can remember moving forward.

User: I think it’s realizing that I can explore areas related to my interests without feeling stuck on one path, which is reassuring.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! Exploring your interests can really open up opportunities for you. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. You’re doing well, and I’m proud of you for taking these steps. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’ll definitely keep these thoughts in mind.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Always feel free to come back when you need to talk things through. I'm here for you. Take care until our next session!

User: Thanks again! I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Wu! I'm glad to see you again today. It sounds like you've made some progress in communicating with your family. How are you feeling about everything lately?

User: Hi! I feel a bit better than before. I managed to share some feelings with my mom during our family gathering, but I still feel anxious about my future, especially with school.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that you're opening up more with your mom. Sharing feelings can be a big step. Let's talk more about your future anxieties. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about it?

User: I keep worrying that I won't do well in school and that I might let my family down again. After what happened with my English exam, it's hard not to feel scared.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, and it's understandable to feel scared after experiencing such a disappointment. When you think about letting your family down, what kind of thoughts run through your mind? Can you share some of them with me?

User: I often think that if I fail again, it will prove that I'm not good enough, especially after my mom's struggles with depression. I don't want to add to her stress.

Consultant: It sounds like there's a lot of pressure coming from those thoughts. You seem to feel that your performance defines your worth. Let's explore this a bit more. Do you think there might be other ways to view your situation that could be less harsh on yourself?

User: I guess I could consider that everyone makes mistakes and that maybe one bad exam doesn't define my entire ability as a student. But it's hard to believe that sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a really insightful way to look at it! Mistakes are indeed a part of learning. If a friend were in your shoes, how would you encourage her to view her mistakes?

User: I would tell her that it's just one exam and that she should learn from it, not let it ruin her confidence. But I don’t always follow my own advice.

Consultant: It’s common to give better advice to others than to ourselves. Let’s practice that self-compassion. What if we tried to reframe your thoughts around the exam experience? Instead of seeing it as a failure, how could we view it as a learning opportunity? 

User: Maybe I could see it as a chance to discover where I need to improve in my studies. I just don’t want to disappoint my family.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! Focusing on improvement instead of disappointment can help shift your mindset. What steps could you take to turn this experience into something positive moving forward?

User: I could make a study plan and ask for help when I struggle. That could help me feel more prepared for future exams.

Consultant: Absolutely! Creating a plan and seeking support can empower you. As we think about your communication skills, how might you communicate these needs to your family, especially your mom?

User: I could express that I need their support and understanding during my study time. I think they would be willing to help if I just ask.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Practicing clear communication can really help you feel more supported. Let’s role-play how you might start that conversation. How would you approach your mom?

User: I might say something like, "Mom, can we talk? I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed with my studies, and I could use your support." 

Consultant: That's a great start! It’s honest and opens the door for a conversation. How do you think your mom might respond to that?

User: I think she would understand, especially since she knows I've been under a lot of pressure lately.

Consultant: Exactly. This approach creates an opportunity for her to support you. Let's also discuss other ways to manage your anxiety. Have you thought about any activities that might help you relax or feel more engaged during stressful times?

User: I used to enjoy painting, but I haven't done it in a while. Maybe I could start doing that again to help with stress.

Consultant: Painting sounds like a wonderful outlet for your emotions! Engaging in activities you love can help relieve stress and make you feel more balanced. How can we incorporate more painting into your week?

User: I could set aside some time on weekends, maybe Saturday afternoons, just for painting. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Setting that time aside could bring you joy and relaxation. Remember, it’s important to take breaks and nurture your interests. 

User: I will definitely try to stick to that plan. I think it could help me not feel so anxious.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiao Wu! As we start wrapping up our session, let’s reflect on what you’ve learned today. What do you feel is your biggest takeaway? 

User: I think it’s recognizing that my worth isn’t tied to my mistakes in school and that I can reach out for support when I need it. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization. How do you think you can keep this mindset going forward?

User: I could remind myself whenever I start to feel anxious and maybe even share these thoughts with my mom, so she knows how I’m feeling.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant idea! Sharing your thoughts not only helps you but also strengthens your connection with your mom. Before we end our session, what strategies are you excited to implement in your daily life?

User: I'm looking forward to being more open with my family, setting aside time for painting, and creating a study plan. That feels motivating!

Consultant: I'm excited for you! You’ve made great strides today, and I believe you’re on the right path. Just remember, it’s about sharing how you feel and being gentle with yourself. I'm looking forward to hearing how it goes in our next session.

User: Thanks so much! I appreciate your help. I'll see you next time!

Consultant: You're welcome, Xiao Wu! Take care and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Wu! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better. I’m starting to take more interest in my studies and social activities, especially after meeting a new friend at the study salon. But I still find it hard to shake off the feelings of failure from my last exam.

Consultant: That’s a great step forward, Xiao Wu! It sounds like connecting with this new friend has had a positive impact on you. Let’s delve into that a bit more—how has your friend influenced your approach to studying or your outlook on life?

User: My friend is really passionate about her studies, and she encourages me to join study groups. It feels nice to have someone who motivates me and shares the same struggles. I think it’s helping me stay focused.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you’ve found a supportive friend! It’s often helpful to surround ourselves with those who uplift us. How do you feel when you participate in these study groups? 

User: I feel more engaged and less isolated. It’s like we’re all in this together. But I still have moments where I doubt my abilities, especially after what happened with my exam.

Consultant: Those moments of doubt are completely understandable, especially after experiencing a setback. When you have those doubts, can you identify any specific thoughts that come to your mind? 

User: I often think that I’m just not good enough and that I’ll never improve, especially in English. It’s hard to shake off that thought.

Consultant: Let’s explore that thought further. What evidence do you have that supports this belief of not being good enough? And is there any evidence that contradicts it? 

User: I guess I did do well in other subjects before, and I have improved in English over the years. But that exam feels like it defined me.

Consultant: It’s insightful that you recognize your past improvements. It’s easy to let a single experience overshadow our accomplishments. If you were to advise a friend in a similar situation, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them to see it as just one setback and focus on their journey rather than one mistake.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate response! Now, can we apply that same perspective to yourself? What might it look like to view this moment as just one part of your journey?

User: I guess it would mean acknowledging that I’m still learning and that one exam doesn’t define my entire ability. It doesn’t mean I can’t succeed in the future.

Consultant: Exactly, Xiao Wu! Recognizing that setbacks are part of the learning process can be empowering. How do you think you can remind yourself of this perspective when doubts arise in the future?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal of my achievements and improvements, no matter how small. It would help me see the bigger picture.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent strategy! Keeping a journal can help reinforce your progress and achievements, and serve as a reminder of your capabilities. Would you be open to starting this journaling practice?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful. Writing things down always helps me process my thoughts better.

Consultant: Great! Let’s set some goals for you. How about choosing a specific time each week to reflect and write in your journal? You can jot down both your challenges and your successes.

User: I can do that! Maybe I’ll write every Sunday to reflect on my week and set goals for the next.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! In addition to journaling, are there any activities or interests you’d like to explore this week that could add some positivity to your routine? 

User: I’ve been thinking about joining a book club or an art class. I’ve always liked painting, but I never thought about doing it outside of school.

Consultant: Joining a book club or an art class could be a fantastic way to engage with new people and express your creativity! What would be your first step toward signing up for one of these activities?

User: I could look up local clubs online and see if there are any that meet regularly. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Taking that initiative can lead to new connections and experiences. How do you feel about taking these steps this week? 

User: I feel excited! It seems like a fun way to meet new people and discover more about myself.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiao Wu! As you engage in these new activities, remember to check in with yourself. How are your emotions changing as you embrace these positive experiences?

User: I think I’ll feel more fulfilled and hopefully, more confident in my abilities.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! As we wrap up today, let’s create some affirmations together that you can remind yourself of when doubt arises. What phrases resonate with you?

User: Maybe something like, “I am capable of growth and learning,” and “One setback doesn’t define my worth.”

Consultant: Those are powerful affirmations! Remember to recite them, especially during those challenging moments. You've made excellent progress today, Xiao Wu. How do you feel about everything we've discussed?

User: I feel hopeful and more ready to face my challenges. I appreciate your help in guiding me through these thoughts!

Consultant: It’s my pleasure! You’ve shown great willingness to grow, and I believe you have the strength to navigate your journey. Let’s check in next week to see how your activities and journaling are going. Remember, you’re not alone on this path. 

User: I’ll definitely be here next week. Thank you so much! 

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xiao Wu! Take care, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaowu! I'm glad you're here for this session. It seems like you've been feeling more stable lately and have gained new insights about your self-worth. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling these days?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling much better. Helping others in that volunteer activity really opened my eyes to how I can contribute and feel valuable, which is quite different from how I felt after the exam incident.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It's great that you've found fulfillment in helping others. How do you think these recent experiences have impacted your view on yourself and your self-confidence?

User: I feel like I have more to offer than just my grades. I used to think that my worth was tied to academic success, but now I see that helping others brings me joy and satisfaction, which is really refreshing.

Consultant: It sounds like you've made significant progress in reshaping your understanding of self-worth. What specific actions or thoughts from your volunteer work have helped reinforce this new perception?

User: I remember a moment when I helped a young kid with his homework. His face lit up when he understood a concept, and I felt so proud. That moment made me realize I can have a positive impact, even outside of school.

Consultant: That sounds like a very rewarding experience! Helping others not only benefits them but also enhances your sense of purpose. How do you think you can continue to foster this sense of purpose in your life moving forward?

User: I think I want to keep volunteering and maybe even explore different ways to help in my community. It feels good to connect with others that way.

Consultant: That's a fantastic plan! Engaging in meaningful activities can certainly help maintain your positive emotions. Are there any specific volunteer opportunities you’re considering or would like to pursue?

User: I’d love to work with younger students, maybe in tutoring or after-school programs. I think I can relate to them because I’m still a student myself.

Consultant: Tutoring younger students sounds like a great fit! It allows you to share what you've learned while also reinforcing your own knowledge. How do you feel about setting some goals around volunteering and your academic journey?

User: I feel excited about that! I think I can set a goal to volunteer at least once a week. It might also motivate me to stay on top of my studies, knowing I’m making a difference.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Setting a regular volunteering schedule can provide structure and motivation. As you pursue these goals, how do you plan on keeping track of your emotions and experiences along the way?

User: I could keep a journal to note down my thoughts and feelings after each volunteering session. It might help me reflect on my progress and keep me motivated.

Consultant: A journal is an excellent tool for reflection and growth! Writing can help solidify your insights and provide a clear picture of your emotional journey. Have you ever kept a journal before, or would this be a new practice for you?

User: I’ve tried it a little bit in the past, but I wasn’t consistent. This time I want to make it a habit, especially since I'm feeling good about it.

Consultant: Consistency will definitely enhance its effectiveness! You could start with simple entries, like what you did during your volunteering and how it made you feel. Do you already have a plan for when or how often you'll write in your journal?

User: I think I’ll try to write every Sunday evening after my volunteering. It’ll be like a reflection on the week and what I’ve learned.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect routine! Reflecting weekly will likely help you integrate your experiences more effectively. Let's also discuss how your family dynamics have changed in light of your new insights and activities.

User: My relationship with my family has improved too. I’ve been more open with them about how I feel and my volunteer work has given me positive things to share.

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress! Open communication can strengthen family ties. Have you noticed any specific changes in your family's responses to your new perspective?

User: Yes, they seem to be more supportive. My parents are happy to see me doing something meaningful, and I feel less pressured about academic performance now.

Consultant: That’s an encouraging shift! It’s great that you're feeling more support from your family. To maintain this positive environment, what do you think would be helpful for continuing those open conversations with them?

User: I think I’ll just keep sharing my experiences. Maybe invite them to see what I do during volunteering, so they can be part of my journey too.

Consultant: Inviting them to witness your volunteering can foster shared experiences and reinforce the sense of support. As we wrap up today’s session, how do you feel about the progress you've made and the plans you've set for the future?

User: I feel really good! I didn’t realize how much my mindset has shifted, and I’m excited about volunteering and journaling. It feels like I’m on a better path.

Consultant: You’ve accomplished a significant transformation! It's inspiring to see your confidence grow and the positive changes in your relationships. As you move forward, remember to utilize the strategies we've discussed. If challenges arise, you can always revisit these insights.

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help. I’m looking forward to our next session to share how everything goes.

Consultant: Absolutely! I’m here for you. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your journey next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Wu! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling more confident lately, especially after my conversation with my family. Our relationship has definitely improved, and I feel more emotionally stable.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like your communication with your family has had a positive impact on you. Can you share more about how you felt during that conversation and how it contributed to your emotional stability?

User: During the conversation, I was able to express my feelings without fear. My family was supportive, and it felt like a real team effort. It made me more confident knowing they are there for me.

Consultant: That’s excellent, Xiao Wu. Having that support system is really important. How do you think this improved relationship affects your daily life and your approach to challenges?

User: I feel like I can tackle challenges more effectively now. It’s like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I don’t feel as alone dealing with things anymore.

Consultant: It’s great that your family is a source of support for you. Let’s explore that further. Is there a specific challenge you’ve faced recently where you felt their support made a difference?

User: Well, I had to deal with the aftermath of my exam results, which hit me hard. But this time around, I felt reassured just talking things over with my family, which definitely helped me cope.

Consultant: It sounds like the family support really helped you process those feelings about your exam results. How are you feeling about your future academic plans now?

User: I’m still nervous about the exams ahead, especially after the last experience. But I also feel more motivated to prove to myself that I can improve.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! Motivation can be such a powerful tool. What steps do you think you could take to channel that motivation into your studies more effectively?

User: I think it would help if I structured my study time better and included more breaks. I also want to set smaller goals to keep myself on track.

Consultant: Setting smaller, achievable goals is a smart strategy! How about we work together to outline these goals? What would be the first goal you’d want to set for your studies?

User: My first goal could be to create a study timetable for the week that includes revision sessions for each subject.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! What subjects would you like to prioritize in your schedule?

User: Definitely English, since I need to improve my understanding more. I also want to focus on Math and Science since they’re equally important.

Consultant: Great choice! Setting a clear plan for English, Math, and Science will help build your confidence. How do you feel about balancing these subjects in your schedule?

User: I think it will be challenging, but I believe I can manage it since I’m motivated now. I’ll need to keep reminding myself to stick to the plan.

Consultant: Staying committed to your plan is key. We can also discuss strategies that can help you stay accountable. How about setting small rewards for yourself once you complete your goals?

User: That sounds like a great idea! Having a little reward might keep me motivated to stay on track.

Consultant: Absolutely! Rewards can make the process feel more enjoyable. What kind of rewards do you think would work best for you?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to a movie or some favorite snacks after a week of sticking to the plan.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Enjoying a movie or a treat could be a great way to celebrate your hard work. How do you feel about reviewing your progress at the end of each week?

User: I think it would be helpful. It’ll give me a chance to see where I might need to adjust my plan too.

Consultant: Right! It’s all about flexibility and progress. So, when do you think we should have a follow-up to review how things are going for you?

User: I could come back next week to share my experience and discuss how I felt about my progress.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan! In our next session, we can evaluate your study plan and any challenges you faced. Is there anything else you’d like to focus on next time?

User: Maybe I could also talk about any feelings of anxiety that come up while studying. 

Consultant: Absolutely, we can address any anxiety you experience during your study sessions. It’s important to manage those feelings effectively. Is there anything else on your mind today?

User: No, I think I’ve covered everything I wanted to discuss for now. I feel really good about moving forward.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It seems like you have a solid plan in place, and I’m excited for you to take these steps. Remember, I’m here to support you whenever you need it. 

User: Thanks so much! I appreciate your help and guidance. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Wu! I’m looking forward to our next session. Take care until then!
