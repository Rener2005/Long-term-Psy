Consultant: Hello, Y! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling recently?

User: Hi. It's been tough for me lately. After returning to school, I feel overwhelmed with pressure about keeping up with my studies. I worry that I won’t be able to catch up like the others.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. You're experiencing a lot of pressure to meet academic expectations after your return to school. Can you tell me more about what you're feeling when you think about your studies?

User: I just feel really anxious and sometimes I can’t even focus. I’ve been having a hard time sleeping too, which doesn’t help at all. It’s like everything just feels too heavy.

Consultant: I understand that the combination of anxiety and sleep troubles can feel like a heavy weight to carry. What thoughts come to mind when you think about your ability to keep up with your studies?

User: I keep thinking that I’m going to fail or that everyone will notice I’m behind. It makes me feel like I don’t belong there.

Consultant: It seems like there’s a lot of fear around falling behind and how others might perceive you. What emotions do these thoughts create for you?

User: Mostly fear and sadness. I feel like I’m letting everyone down, including my parents. It’s like I’m a burden to them.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when dealing with so much pressure. Let’s explore those feelings a bit more. What specific actions or behaviors do you engage in when you feel this way?

User: Sometimes I just shut down and avoid studying altogether. I feel like if I don’t try, then I won’t be disappointed if I fail.

Consultant: That sounds like a way of protecting yourself from disappointment, but it might also be contributing to your feelings of anxiety. What do you think about that pattern?

User: I guess it doesn’t help in the long run. I know I should try to study, but I just don't have the energy.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a conflict between wanting to do well and feeling too drained to take action. We could explore some small steps you can take toward studying without overwhelming yourself. Would you be open to that?

User: Yes, maybe that could help. I'm just scared about where to start.

Consultant: That’s totally normal. Let’s try breaking it down. How about starting with just ten minutes of studying a subject you enjoy? How does that sound?

User: I think I can manage that. But what if I still can’t focus during those ten minutes?

Consultant: Great question! If you find your mind wandering, that’s completely okay. You can remind yourself that this is just a small step and it's okay to take breaks. Would it help to set a timer for those ten minutes?

User: Yes, I think that could help me stay focused. 

Consultant: That’s a good strategy. In addition to this, how about discussing some ways you can express your feelings about school and your fears with your parents? Sometimes sharing helps lighten the load.

User: I’ve been thinking about talking to them, but I’m afraid they won’t understand how I feel.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel hesitant. What if you started by sharing just one or two specific feelings? You might be surprised by their response.

User: I could try that. Maybe I’ll tell them I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: That sounds like a clear and honest way to begin. By sharing how you feel, it might open up a dialogue where they can support you more. 

User: Yeah, I think I’ll do that. It feels good to talk about it, honestly.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that. Communication can be really powerful. How do you feel about this session so far? 

User: It feels nice to talk about my worries. I think I’m starting to feel a little lighter.

Consultant: That’s excellent progress, Y. Remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time. As we continue our sessions, we can keep exploring these feelings and develop strategies that work for you.

User: Thank you. I appreciate that. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! In our next session, we can check in on how talking to your parents went and discuss any new feelings or challenges that come up. 

User: That sounds good. I’m looking forward to it. 

Consultant: Remember, you’re not alone in this, and it's important to be kind to yourself along the way. We'll work through these together. 

User: Thank you, I feel hopeful.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Take care until we meet again, and remember to practice those small steps. 

User: I will! Thank you so much. 

Consultant: Goodbye for now, Y. 

User: Bye!

Consultant: Hello, Y! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been trying to manage my feelings about my parents’ divorce, but I still feel really low and like I don’t matter. I notice that I often think my dad doesn’t care about me anymore since he seems busy with his new life.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling quite neglected, especially with your dad's reduced attention. It's understandable to feel this way given the circumstances. Can you tell me more about what specific feelings come up when you think that your dad may not care?

User: I just feel like a burden. Like if I weren’t around, things would be easier for them. Sometimes I think they don’t even want me anymore.

Consultant: That sounds really heavy to carry, Y. Feeling like a burden can be so painful. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit more. When you think, "I’m a burden," what emotions do you feel in your body? 

User: I feel a tightness in my chest and sometimes I get really sad. It’s like a weight I can’t shake off.

Consultant: I can see how that thought affects you physically and emotionally. It’s tough. Now, let’s consider your dad’s actions. Apart from those feelings of being a burden, can you think of a time when he showed care for you, even in small ways?

User: Hmm, well, he does call sometimes to check if I’m okay. But it’s usually about school and not really about me personally.

Consultant: That's a good observation. Even if it feels more academic, that call shows he still cares about your well-being. How might you interpret that differently? Perhaps he is trying to stay connected in his own way?

User: I guess so. But sometimes I wish he would just ask how I’m doing, like really ask, not just about school stuff. 

Consultant: It makes total sense to want that deeper connection. Let’s think about this: if he were to check in personally, how might that impact your feelings of being a burden? 

User: Maybe I wouldn’t feel as bad. I would feel more loved, I think.

Consultant: Exactly! It could definitely help reinforce that you are valued, not a burden. Now, how do you think you could express this need to him, in a way that feels safe for you?

User: I’m not sure… I’m afraid he might think I’m just being needy or something.

Consultant: That fear is understandable, but expressing feelings is important too, and it doesn’t make you needy. We can practice some phrases together if you'd like. How about starting with something simple like, “I would love to talk more about how I’m feeling sometimes”? 

User: Yeah, that sounds okay. But I still wouldn’t know how to bring it up. 

Consultant: How about planning a specific moment when you can talk to him? It could be during one of those calls. You can mention you have something personal to share. What do you think about that?

User: I could try that. But what if he gets busy and doesn’t want to talk?

Consultant: That’s a possibility, and it can feel discouraging. Perhaps having a back-up plan could help. If he’s not available, how would it make you feel to write down your feelings instead?

User: Writing might be easier. I can organize my thoughts better.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Writing can definitely help clarify your feelings without the immediate pressure. Then you can decide if you want to share that writing with him later. 

User: I think I would like that. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Let's talk about how this makes you feel. Does planning this way relieve some of the weight you were feeling before?

User: Yes, a little. Like I have a way to maybe change things, which feels good.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, you are working toward change by starting these conversations. As we move forward, what are some ways you could build on this moment of feeling empowered?

User: I guess I could try reaching out to friends more, instead of isolating myself. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea, Y! Strengthening friendships can really help with feelings of neglect. How do you feel about making a plan to reach out to someone this week?

User: I could text a friend and see if they want to hang out.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful step forward! The more you practice connecting, the more confidence you’ll build. How are you feeling about everything we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel a bit lighter, like I have tools to work with. 

Consultant: That's really great to hear! Remember, acknowledging your feelings and taking small steps makes a huge difference. For our next session, let’s discuss how those conversations went and how you felt afterward. Does that sound okay?

User: Yes, that sounds good! I feel hopeful about trying this.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear you’re feeling hopeful! I believe you can navigate these feelings, and I’m here to support you. Until next time, Y, take care of yourself and remember to be kind to yourself as well.

User: Thank you! I will. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Y! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling lately? 

User: Hi! I’m feeling a bit anxious. Even though things have improved a little with my classmates, I still worry about being misunderstood or hurt.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're really trying to build new friendships, but past experiences are still affecting your ability to trust others. Can you tell me more about those feelings?

User: Yeah, I really want to connect with them, but I keep thinking they might judge me like before. It makes me hold back in conversations.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It’s tough when past experiences linger in your mind. When you think about talking to your classmates, what specific thoughts come up that increase your anxiety?

User: I often think things like, "What if they don’t like me?" or "What if I embarrass myself?" 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really overwhelming. How do those thoughts make you feel emotionally in those moments?

User: They make me feel really anxious and like I want to avoid social situations altogether. It feels hard to breathe sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts create a cycle of anxiety, making it harder for you to engage with your classmates. Have you noticed if there were moments when your thoughts were less overpowering?

User: Occasionally, when we’re working on group projects, I feel a bit more at ease, but it doesn't last long.

Consultant: That’s a good start! It’s important to recognize those small moments when you feel more comfortable. What do you think might help you seize more of those opportunities to connect?

User: Maybe if I could change my mindset during those times? Like, convincing myself it's okay to just be me.

Consultant: Absolutely! Challenging those negative thoughts can be really effective. What other positive thoughts could you remind yourself of when you’re feeling anxious about social interactions?

User: I could tell myself that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s not the end of the world if someone does judge me.

Consultant: That's a helpful perspective! What evidence do you have that supports the idea that people might actually like you or be more forgiving than you assume?

User: I mean, my teachers and a few classmates have been nice to me. I guess they don’t see me like I do.

Consultant: Exactly! It's great that you’ve noticed that. It seems you have supportive people around you. How can you remind yourself of their kindness when you start feeling anxious?

User: Maybe I can write down those positive experiences and read them when I feel low.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Keeping a record of supportive moments could help reinforce a more positive mindset. Now, let’s think about some small steps you can take to feel more comfortable interacting in class. What comes to mind?

User: I could try to join in on small group discussions or just say hi to someone before class.

Consultant: Those are both good ideas! Starting small is always a great approach. What might be a specific goal for you to aim for this week related to that?

User: I could try to say hi to at least two classmates this week and participate in a discussion. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! How do you feel about setting those goals? 

User: It makes me a bit nervous, but also excited. I really want to connect with them.

Consultant: That excitement is a great indicator of your willingness to engage. Remember, it’s completely normal to feel nervous, and it doesn’t have to stop you. After you try it, we can discuss how it went. 

User: I would really like that. I hope I can do it without panicking.

Consultant: Of course! Just take it one step at a time, and don't be too hard on yourself if it doesn't go perfectly. How do you currently manage that fear of panicking?

User: I usually just freeze up or try to avoid situations that make me anxious. 

Consultant: It’s good to know what your usual responses are. This week, if you start feeling anxious, what would be a healthier way to cope with those feelings?

User: Maybe I could take deep breaths or remind myself that it’s okay to be anxious.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach! Deep breathing can help calm those anxious feelings. Would you like to practice a few deep breathing exercises together before we end our session?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I think practicing would help me remember to do it.

Consultant: Great! Let’s try a simple breathing technique. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold your breath for a count of four, and exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of four. Ready? 

User: Okay, let’s do it.

Consultant: Inhale... 2... 3... 4... hold... 2... 3... 4... and exhale... 2... 3... 4. How does that feel?

User: It feels a bit calming. I think I can use this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Keep practicing it, and remember, the more you use these techniques, the easier they will become. Let’s check in next time about how your goal-setting and interactions went. 

User: Yes, I’m looking forward to it! Thank you for your help!

Consultant: You're welcome, Y! I’m proud of the steps you're taking. See you next time, and take care!

Consultant: Hello, Y! It’s great to see you in our session today. How have you been feeling since our last talk?

User: Hi! I've been trying to get back to my studies, but I often feel overwhelmed. The pressure is really getting to me, and I find myself getting frustrated easily. 

Consultant: I can see how returning to school after everything you've been through must be quite challenging. Can you tell me more about what’s making you feel overwhelmed when you study?

User: Well, I have high expectations for myself and I want to catch up with my classmates. But sometimes, no matter how hard I try, I seem to fall behind, and that just makes me feel worse. 

Consultant: It sounds like there's a lot of pressure to keep up with your classmates, and that pressure is adding to your frustration. What does it feel like when you think about falling behind?

User: I feel really anxious and guilty, like I’m letting everyone down. I even question if I will ever be able to catch up at all.

Consultant: That’s a heavy burden to carry, feeling anxious and guilty about your progress. Let's take a moment to explore those thoughts. When you say you feel like you're letting everyone down, what specific thoughts come to mind?

User: I think about how my teachers must see me, like they think I’m not trying hard enough. Also, I keep comparing myself to my friends who seem to be managing well.

Consultant: Comparing yourself to others can be tough, especially when you're already feeling vulnerable. Do you think those comparisons are realistic? Are there areas in which you feel you've made progress?

User: I guess I have made some progress, but I focus so much on what I still need to do that I forget what I’ve accomplished, like just getting back to school.

Consultant: Recognizing your progress is an important step. What if we worked together to create a plan that acknowledges your achievements while also setting realistic goals for what’s next? How does that sound to you?

User: That could be helpful, I think. I just want to feel like I’m on the right track.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start by identifying some specific study goals that are manageable. What subjects do you feel you need to focus on the most?

User: I think math and science are the hardest for me right now. I really struggled with those subjects before all of this happened.

Consultant: Understandable! Let's break it down. What specific challenges do you face in math and science? 

User: Math just confuses me, especially all the formulas, and science feels overwhelming with all the information I have to memorize.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling overwhelmed by the volume of information and the complexity of math. Would you be open to exploring different study methods that might help make these subjects easier to manage?

User: Yes! I really need a method that works for me since what I've been trying hasn't been effective.

Consultant: Let’s think about study methods that might suit you. For instance, would breaking the material into smaller chunks or using visual aids, like diagrams or charts, be something you'd consider trying?

User: That sounds good! I like the idea of using visuals; they might help me remember the information better.

Consultant: Excellent choice! Visual aids can be very powerful. Also, how about scheduling short, focused study sessions instead of trying to cram everything at once? 

User: Yes, I think that would help. Short sessions could make it less stressful and keep me more focused.

Consultant: I agree. We could set up a study plan with specific times dedicated to math and science, ensuring it’s balanced with breaks to avoid burnout. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds really helpful. I often forget to take breaks and just end up feeling more exhausted. 

Consultant: Taking regular breaks can definitely help refresh your mind. Let's outline a simple plan. How many study sessions do you think you can handle in a week?

User: Maybe four or five sessions a week could work for me. 

Consultant: Perfect! We can mix in your subjects while also planning time for relaxation and fun activities. What hobbies or activities help you unwind?

User: I love painting and listening to music. Those really help me relax.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s incorporate painting or music into your breaks. Balancing study and relaxation is key. How are you feeling about this plan so far?

User: I feel more hopeful now, like I have a real plan to work with. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Remember, it's okay to adjust the plan as you go. It's all about finding what works for you. Do you think you can commit to this approach for the next week?

User: Yes, I think I can do that!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! When we meet next time, we can discuss how it went and make any necessary adjustments. In between, try to remind yourself of your accomplishments, no matter how small. 

User: I will. Thanks for your help today! 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Y! I’m proud of you for taking these steps. Remember, if you start to feel overwhelmed, just reach out for a little support. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Y! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I’m quite satisfied with my exam results for the first time. But sometimes, I still get anxious for no reason.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear about your exam results! It sounds like you’re experiencing some positive feelings, which is great progress. Let’s explore that a bit more. Can you tell me what triggers your anxiety sometimes?

User: Well, sometimes it just comes out of nowhere. I could be doing homework or just relaxing, and suddenly I feel this tightness in my chest and worry about things that happened in the past or what could happen in the future.

Consultant: It sounds like those unexpected moments of anxiety can really affect your peace of mind. When you feel that tightness, what kind of thoughts go through your mind?

User: I start thinking that maybe I’m not good enough, or I might not do well in the future, like what if I fail or disappoint everyone.

Consultant: Those are really heavy thoughts to carry, Y. It seems like they can be quite overwhelming at times. Do you notice if those thoughts become more intense in certain situations?

User: Yes! They get worse when I’m studying or preparing for something important. It's like the pressure builds up, and then I just freeze at my desk.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that pressure, especially around important tasks. Let's take a moment to look at those thoughts—would you say they are based on evidence, or are they more like assumptions you’re making about yourself?

User: They feel more like assumptions. I mean, I did well this time, but when I think about next time, I panic.

Consultant: That's an important realization, Y. You’ve succeeded before, and it’s essential to hold onto that evidence of your capability. How about we challenge those assumptions together? For instance, what would you say to a friend feeling the same way?

User: I guess I would tell them to remember their successes and not be so hard on themselves.

Consultant: That’s a kind and supportive response! Let’s apply that same kindness to yourself. What if you practiced reminding yourself of your achievements when those anxious thoughts arise? 

User: That sounds like a good idea. I could write down my successes and look at them when I feel anxious.

Consultant: Exactly! Keeping a list could serve as a great reminder. Now, let’s shift gears a bit. Have you had any moments recently where you found yourself enjoying something or feeling relaxed?

User: I’ve been watching some fun shows and hanging out with friends. Those moments help me feel a bit more at ease.

Consultant: That sounds lovely! Enjoying those activities is a great way to create balance. Would you like to explore ways to intentionally incorporate more of those moments into your routine?

User: Yes, I think that could help. I’d like to make sure I don’t just focus on studying.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective. Let’s consider some activities that you can schedule in along with your study time. What are some things you really enjoy doing?

User: I love drawing and reading. I could set aside time for that.

Consultant: Drawing and reading sound wonderful! Planning specific times for those activities could help you recharge and manage your anxiety better. As we also discussed your breathing exercises, would you like to practice a relaxation technique together now?

User: Sure, I’d like to try!

Consultant: Great! Let’s go through some deep abdominal breathing. Find a comfortable position, and when you’re ready, take a deep breath in through your nose, letting your belly expand, and then slowly breathe out through your mouth. Let’s do this a few times together.

User: Okay, I’m trying it now. It feels a bit calming.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Deep breathing can be a powerful tool for instant relief from anxiety. How do you feel after practicing that for a moment?

User: I feel a bit more relaxed now. I like this.

Consultant: Excellent! Practice makes perfect. I encourage you to use these breathing techniques any time you feel anxiety creeping in. Lastly, as we wrap up our session today, what do you see as the most significant thing you’ve learned or achieved through our conversations?

User: I think realizing that I can manage my anxiety by reminding myself of my successes and doing things I enjoy is huge. And the breathing really works.

Consultant: You’ve made impressive strides, Y! You’ve tapped into effective strategies for managing your anxiety. Remember, it's crucial to keep reflecting and nurturing those positive thoughts and activities. If you ever find yourself struggling again, know you have the tools to cope. 

User: Thank you! I feel more equipped to handle things now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As this session comes to a close, remember that you can always reach out if you need guidance again. It’s been wonderful working with you, and I wish you all the best moving forward!

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate all your help.
