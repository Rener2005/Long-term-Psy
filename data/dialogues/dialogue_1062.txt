Consultant: Hello, Li! Welcome back. I'm glad to see you again. I know this past week has been challenging for you. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’m still feeling pretty anxious, especially when I think about flowers and death. The memory of that patient’s passing keeps haunting me. I feel like I’m stuck in this cycle of fear.

Consultant: I can see how deeply that experience has affected you. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when faced with such strong emotions. Let's talk more about what you're feeling. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you see flowers or think about death?

User: Whenever I see flowers, my heart races, and I start sweating. I think about that patient and how helpless I felt. It’s like flowers are a reminder of death, and it terrifies me.

Consultant: It sounds like flowers have become a trigger for intense emotions related to that experience. Let's explore that further—what feelings do you recognize when these thoughts about the patient and death arise?

User: I feel a mix of sadness, anxiety, and guilt for not being able to save them. It makes me question if I’m good enough at my job, and I hate feeling this way.

Consultant: Your feelings of sadness and guilt are very common among healthcare professionals who face such challenging situations. It's tough when you care deeply about your work. How do these feelings affect your daily life and work?

User: They make it hard to concentrate at work. I keep reliving that moment, and I feel really anxious when I encounter anything related to death, like flowers. I often feel like I want to avoid them.

Consultant: Avoidance can seem like a way to cope, but it often prolongs the anxiety. What if we consider gradually facing those feelings in a safe and controlled way? How would you feel about that approach?

User: I think it’s scary, but I also want to overcome this fear. I don’t want to let it control my life anymore.

Consultant: That's a brave decision, Li. Facing fears can be uncomfortable, but it can lead to growth. Let's break it down—what would be a small step you could take toward facing your fear of flowers?

User: Maybe I could start by looking at pictures of flowers instead of seeing them in real life. That seems less overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds like a sensible first step! Looking at pictures allows you to gradually expose yourself to the idea of flowers without the immediate anxiety. How do you think you would feel after trying that?

User: I might feel a little anxious at first, but if I can manage it, maybe it will help me. I think I’d feel proud of myself for taking that step.

Consultant: Absolutely! Acknowledging that sense of pride is crucial. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. How about we set a goal for you to look at flower pictures a few times this week? We can discuss how it felt in our next session.

User: Yes, I think that could work. I’ll try to do that. 

Consultant: Great! And if you find yourself feeling anxious during this, it's important to remind yourself that it’s part of the process. How about we talk about some grounding techniques you can use if those feelings arise?

User: I’d like that. I sometimes feel so overwhelmed that I just don’t know what to do.

Consultant: One technique is to focus on your breathing. When you notice anxiety creeping in, take deep, slow breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Would you like to practice that together now?

User: Sure, I can do that.

Consultant: Let’s do it! Breathe in deeply… and out slowly. Keep this rhythm. With each exhale, imagine releasing some of that tension. How does that feel for you?

User: It helps, I feel a bit calmer. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Li! This technique can be your anchor when anxiety strikes. Remember, facing your fear of flowers will take time, but each small step counts. 

User: I understand. I want to keep moving forward, even if it’s slow.

Consultant: Exactly! And as we work on this, it’s also important to acknowledge the progress you’ve already made and the courage it takes to confront these fears. What aspects of your journey do you feel proud of so far?

User: I’m proud that I’m open to facing my fears instead of avoiding them. It feels good to talk about it too.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization, Li! Acknowledging your willingness to face these challenges is a big step. Keep that momentum going. In the meantime, let's think about a supportive mantra or phrase you can remind yourself of when facing these fears. 

User: Maybe something like, “It’s okay to feel anxious, but I am safe and capable.”

Consultant: That’s a beautiful mantra! Reminding yourself that it's okay to feel anxious while affirming your safety and capability can be very powerful. How do you think you can incorporate that into your daily life?

User: I can write it down and keep it somewhere visible, like my workspace. That way, I can remind myself when I start to feel anxious.

Consultant: Perfect idea! Writing it down will help solidify this positive reminder. As we’re nearing the end of this session, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any questions about what we covered today?

User: I think we covered a lot. I just want to feel better and not let my fear control me anymore.

Consultant: You are taking important steps toward that goal, Li. Remember, it's a journey, and you’re doing well. I’m here to support you along the way. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Li! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite anxious. I encountered some wreaths at work again, and I could feel my heart racing and my palms sweating. I keep blaming myself for not being able to handle it.

Consultant: I can sense the frustration and anxiety you're experiencing. It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you're facing your fears. Can you share more about how encountering the wreaths affects you at work?

User: Every time I see them, I feel a wave of panic. I try to focus on my work, but the anxiety takes over, and I end up avoiding areas where I know they might be. It’s affecting my performance.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, and it's completely normal to want to avoid situations that trigger intense feelings. What do you think would help you when you encounter wreaths in the future?

User: I wish I could just feel calm and not let the sight of them shake me up. I don’t want to keep running away from my responsibilities.

Consultant: It's great that you're recognizing the desire to confront these feelings rather than avoid them. Let’s talk about how you can gradually expose yourself to wreaths to reduce your fear. Can you recall a time when you felt a bit more in control despite seeing a wreath?

User: I did manage to stay in the room once when there was a wreath. I just focused on my breathing, but it was hard and I still felt overwhelmed.

Consultant: Breathing techniques can be a powerful tool. Let’s use that experience as a starting point. How can we build upon that to make future encounters with wreaths feel a little easier or more manageable for you?

User: Maybe I could practice breathing more often and try to look at wreaths in less overwhelming situations, like just pictures of them first?

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Gradual exposure and practice can significantly help. We can create a step-by-step approach. What would be the first step for you in facing this fear through images, perhaps?

User: I think just looking at pictures of wreaths online could be a good start. I can prepare myself for that.

Consultant: It seems like a reasonable first step. As you do this, pay attention to your thoughts and feelings. What thoughts pop up when you look at the pictures? 

User: I worry I'll feel dizzy or start panicking again. 

Consultant: Remember, these feelings can be uncomfortable but they are temporary. Let’s try to challenge that thought. Can you think of any evidence that might suggest that looking at a picture won’t lead to the same physical reaction you experience in real life?

User: Well, I haven’t actually felt dizzy just from looking at pictures before, so maybe it won't happen.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a powerful realization. We can also practice positive self-talk during this process. For instance, you might say, “I am in a safe place, and looking at this picture is just a small step towards feeling better.” How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds encouraging. I think I can try saying that to myself.

Consultant: I believe you can too! Remember that it’s a journey, and some days may be harder than others. How does this plan make you feel about facing wreaths again?

User: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful now. It seems more manageable when I break it down like this.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Hope is a crucial part of moving forward. As we continue this exploration, we can revisit your reactions to the images. How do you anticipate you might feel after practicing this for a while?

User: I hope I’ll feel less anxious and maybe even be able to handle seeing actual wreaths without panicking in the future.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! It’s all about progress, not perfection. Let’s also discuss some coping skills for when those anxious feelings do arise. Any strategies that have helped you in the past?

User: I used to go for walks when I felt overwhelmed, but I haven’t done that recently.

Consultant: Getting outside and moving can be incredibly beneficial for managing anxiety. How about we incorporate regular walks into your routine, maybe even after you've practiced looking at the pictures?

User: I think that would be great! It might help me relax afterwards.

Consultant: Absolutely! Regularly engaging in activities that bring you joy, like walking, can help you create positive associations. What do you think your next steps will be following this conversation?

User: I’ll start by looking at wreath pictures and saying positive affirmations to myself. And plan some walks to clear my mind.

Consultant: That sounds like a strong plan, Xiao Li! Let’s check in on your progress next time we meet. Remember, it’s okay to feel uncertain at times. You’re taking important steps. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel more understood and ready to tackle this! But I still have some doubts sometimes.

Consultant: It's completely natural to have doubts. We can work through those feelings together in our next session. Just know that you’re doing well by taking these steps. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Would you like to summarize what we’ve discussed today?

User: Yes! I’ll focus on looking at pictures of wreaths, practice positive self-talk, and go for walks if I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Perfect summary! I'm proud of your commitment. Until our next session, take care, and remember that each step matters.

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Li! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a little shaky. I attempted the exposure technique we discussed, but I still experienced unease when I confronted the flowers. I can't help but doubt whether it's really working for me.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel this way, especially when trying to confront fears. Can you tell me a bit more about what you experienced when you were around the flowers?

User: Well, I felt my heart racing, and I got really sweaty. I tried to breathe deeply, like you suggested, but sometimes I felt like I was going to faint. It almost makes me want to avoid it altogether, despite wanting to get better.

Consultant: I hear you, and it's great that you tried to face this fear. Those physical reactions can be really intense. It sounds like the exposure was quite challenging for you. What thoughts went through your mind during those moments?

User: I thought about how ridiculous I might look, panicking over flowers. I kept wondering why I can't just be normal about it. It's really frustrating.

Consultant: It makes sense to feel frustrated. Those self-critical thoughts can add to your anxiety. Would you say they sometimes interfere with how you handle your fear?

User: Definitely. I think my thoughts about not being normal make it worse. I sit there and overanalyze everything, which isn't helping at all.

Consultant: Understanding your thoughts is a key part of this process. Since you mentioned feeling like you're overanalyzing, let’s explore how those thoughts could be affecting your emotional state. When you say "not being normal," what evidence do you have that contributes to this thought?

User: Well, I suppose I've never encountered anyone else who reacts the way I do with flowers. It just makes me feel really alone in this.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel isolated. Remember, everyone's experiences are unique. Let's consider—if a friend were in your position, struggling with a similar fear, what would you say to them?

User: I would probably tell them that it's okay to feel how they feel and that they’re not alone in their struggles. I’d encourage them to keep trying and be gentle with themselves.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! Now, could you apply that same kindness to yourself? It’s okay to have these feelings. Recognizing that you’re doing your best can be empowering. What if we worked together to challenge that "not being normal" thought a bit more?

User: That might help, but it’s hard to believe anything else when I’m in the moment. 

Consultant: I understand. Often, these beliefs feel true during stressful situations. How about we come up with a few alternative thoughts to hold onto when those feelings arise? Something like, "It’s okay to be different" or, "I’m learning to manage this"?

User: Those sound better, yeah. I think I can try to remind myself of those. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s keep reinforcing those thoughts alongside the exposure practice. How about we try a simple exercise where you visualize being around flowers in a safe environment? You can incorporate deep breathing while we do this together.

User: That sounds doable. I feel like visualizing might help prepare me.

Consultant: Excellent! As we go through this visualization, focus on your breathing. Picture the flowers and imagine yourself feeling calm and in control. What do you think it might feel like?

User: I think it would feel empowering, like I’m taking back control.

Consultant: Yes! That’s a powerful perspective. Remember, it's all about progress at your speed. After we visualize together, we can discuss how it felt for you and adjust as needed. 

User: I’m feeling a bit more hopeful about this now, just thinking about it.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! I want to remind you that it’s okay to have mixed emotions throughout this process. It's part of your journey. 

User: Thanks for saying that. I really needed to hear it to help me feel less isolated in this.

Consultant: Absolutely! We are here to work through this together. As we continue, we’ll refine the approach based on your experiences. I want you to know that your feelings and progress are valid, and together, we can strengthen your resilience.

User: I appreciate that a lot. I’m realizing that this might take time, but I feel encouraged to keep going.

Consultant: That's a wonderful realization, Xiao Li! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we've discussed. You’ve recognized your feelings and began to challenge those negative thoughts. How can you remind yourself of your progress moving forward?

User: I think I’ll write down the alternative thoughts we talked about and try to reflect on them regularly. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! It will help you internalize those thoughts. Remember, even small steps count. If you encounter any difficulties, we can tackle those together in our next session. 

User: Thank you so much for your guidance today. I feel like I have a clearer path forward.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, and I'm glad you feel that way! Remember, it's all about progress. Continue to practice and be kind to yourself. I'm looking forward to hearing how you're doing next time.

User: I will! See you next time!

Consultant: Take care, Xiao Li! See you soon!

Consultant: Hello, Lisa! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been trying to work on my fear of flowers, but I still find it really difficult. Sometimes, I doubt if I can really overcome it. 

Consultant: It's completely normal to have doubts when facing fears. Can you share with me what you've been experiencing when you think about flowers or encounter them? 

User: Well, when I see flowers, I feel my heart races, and I get dizzy. It makes me want to avoid them altogether. 

Consultant: That sounds really overwhelming. It’s good that you’ve started recognizing these feelings. Let’s explore what specific thoughts come to your mind during those moments. What are you usually thinking when you start to feel anxious about flowers? 

User: I often think that if I get too close to them, I might faint or have a panic attack. 

Consultant: I see. That thought seems to create a lot of fear for you. How likely do you think it is that you would actually faint or have a panic attack if you were near flowers? 

User: Honestly, I know it's not very likely, but my mind just takes over and makes it feel really real. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Our minds can sometimes amplify fears. Let's challenge that thought: if a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about the reality of being near flowers? 

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to be afraid, but it’s not as scary as it seems, and facing it might help. 

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! You have insights that could be beneficial. Let’s think about how we can start facing this fear gradually, perhaps by observing flowers from a distance? How does that sound to you? 

User: That might be okay. I could try looking at pictures of flowers first, then maybe step outside where I can see them from afar. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Starting with pictures is a gentle way to approach it. How do you feel about incorporating that into your routine this week? 

User: I feel I can give that a try. I think it will help me gradually build my confidence. 

Consultant: That’s a positive step forward, Lisa! Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. How do you think you might handle any anxiety that comes up while doing this exercise? 

User: Maybe I can remind myself that the feelings will pass and that I’m safe. 

Consultant: That’s a sensible strategy. Practicing self-talk can help lessen the intensity of your feelings. What about after the exposure—how can you reward yourself for facing this challenge? 

User: I could treat myself to something nice, like a favorite snack or some relaxation time. 

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely reward! It's important to acknowledge your efforts. Let's also talk about your support system. Who in your life can you reach out to if you feel anxious while facing flowers? 

User: I could talk to my husband. He’s very supportive and would understand my fears. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Having someone supportive can make a big difference. Would it help if I encouraged you to share your plan with him so he can support you? 

User: Yes, I think I should definitely share it with him. It might make me feel less alone in this. 

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s great to have that connection. As we continue our sessions, we’ll focus on enhancing these coping strategies and building your confidence. What are your thoughts about exploring more underlying emotions related to this fear? 

User: I think it could be helpful. I’m curious if there’s something deeper causing this fear. 

Consultant: That sounds like an important avenue to explore. Understanding root causes can often bring additional clarity and healing. For now, as we start wrapping up, how do you feel about the steps we’ve discussed today? 

User: I feel hopeful. Talking about it makes it seem more manageable, and I’m ready to try taking those steps. 

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Lisa! You’re already making progress. Remember, it's alright to take it one step at a time. In our next session, we can discuss how your practice went and any other feelings that come up. 

User: Thank you! I'm looking forward to sharing my experience. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m proud of you for facing this. Keep in mind that support is just a call away. If you need anything before our next meeting, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: I will, thank you! I really appreciate your help. 

Consultant: It’s my pleasure! Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! It’s great to see you again. I remember you mentioned feeling a positive effect from social support in our last session. How have things been since then?

User: Hi! Yes, I've felt a lot better since sharing my experiences in the group. Their support really helped me; I feel less alone in dealing with my fear of flowers.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like opening up to others has had a significant impact on how you feel. Can you tell me more about any specific moments or thoughts that have stood out to you since our last session?

User: I've tried to talk to more friends about my feelings. It's easy to talk to them now, and I've even visited a flower shop! I still get anxious, but it’s slightly easier.

Consultant: That's an impressive step forward, Li! It takes courage to confront your fears like that. What emotions did you experience while at the flower shop?

User: I felt anxiety creeping in at first, like my heart was racing. But I took deep breaths and reminded myself of the support from my friends. It helped me stay calmer than before.

Consultant: It's great that you used breathing techniques and leaned on your support system. Recognizing the anxiety but managing it is a huge achievement. How do you feel about reaching out to your friends for support in the future when you face similar situations?

User: I think I could definitely do that. I feel like I have a safety net now, and it makes me more confident. 

Consultant: That’s a positive development! Building a safety net through your social connections can really bolster your confidence. What other situations do you think you might be able to share with them in the future?

User: Maybe I can talk about going to events or activities where flowers might be involved. I want to be able to enjoy those experiences without feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: That's an excellent goal! Engaging in activities while managing your feelings is a smart approach. How about we brainstorm some strategies or techniques you could use when approaching those situations?

User: Sure! I guess I could practice deep breathing again, maybe visualize calmness before going to these events. 

Consultant: Those sound like effective strategies. Visualization can be powerful in reducing anxiety. What if we also considered some positive affirmations to reinforce your confidence before these events?

User: That could be helpful! I’d like to remind myself that it's okay to feel anxious but that I can cope with it. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Affirmations can help reframe your mindset. How about creating a few affirmations together that resonate with you personally? 

User: I like that idea! Maybe something like, “I am brave enough to face my fears,” and “I can rely on my friends for support.” 

Consultant: Those are fantastic affirmations! They focus on your strength and the support you have, which is key. How often do you think you could practice these before facing social situations?

User: I could try to say them every day, especially before I know I’ll be around flowers or in situations that stress me out. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Consistency can really reinforce those positive beliefs. As we continue this process, it will be essential to monitor how these strategies work for you. 

User: I agree! I want to see how things change as I keep practicing this.

Consultant: Exactly! Let's set a goal for you to practice these affirmations daily and to reflect on any experiences that arise over the next week. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I feel excited to keep working on this. 

Consultant: I’m excited for you too, Li! As we move forward, let’s acknowledge your journey. We’ve discussed building confidence through affirmations and social support. How do you feel about the progress you've made so far?

User: I feel really proud! I didn’t expect to feel this way after just a few sessions. 

Consultant: You’ve made remarkable strides already, and it’s clear that your hard work is paying off. Looking ahead, what are some ways you think you can maintain this momentum?

User: I think keeping in touch with my friends and sharing my experiences will help, along with continuing to practice my breathing and affirmations.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Keeping those connections and practices alive will really help you manage the anxiety effectively. Do you feel ready to take some concrete steps toward these goals in the coming week?

User: Yes, definitely! I’m ready to tackle whatever comes my way.

Consultant: Fantastic! I believe in your ability to manage these challenges. Today, let’s summarize what we’ve covered and solidify your plans. What do you see as your biggest takeaway from today’s session?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is how valuable my support system is and that I can handle my fears with the right tools.

Consultant: Well said! You have the tools and support to progress further. Remember, it’s natural to have ups and downs, but with practice, you’ll continue to move forward. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your guidance.

Consultant: It’s been my pleasure, Li! As we conclude this session, know that you’ve made significant progress. If you need help in the future, feel free to reach out. 

User: I will! Thank you again. I’m looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: I am too! Take care and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Li! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a lot better, actually. I still get a bit nervous sometimes, especially when it comes to flowers, but it's much more manageable now. I've been participating in community activities, and it feels good to be recognized by my colleagues.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made significant progress. Can you share more about what specific situations have been easier for you lately?

User: Well, during a recent community event, there were a lot of flowers around, but I managed to engage with others without feeling overwhelmed. It was a big relief!

Consultant: That's a huge achievement! Engaging in social activities despite your fear shows your strength. How did that experience make you feel about yourself?

User: It made me feel proud and a bit more confident. I realized that I can face my fears without losing control, which is a nice change.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Building confidence is an important part of overcoming challenges. What do you think helped you manage your fear during that event?

User: I think knowing that I had support from my colleagues made a big difference. Plus, I reminded myself to breathe and focus on the conversation rather than on the flowers.

Consultant: Those are effective strategies! It seems that support and self-regulation played vital roles in your success. How can we ensure that you continue to maintain this progress moving forward?

User: I guess I need to keep practicing, maybe set some small goals for myself when it comes to being around flowers or other situations that make me anxious.

Consultant: Setting small, manageable goals is an excellent approach! What would be a small step you could take to slowly face your fear again?

User: Maybe I could start by spending some time in a garden or at an event where flowers are present, but with a friend next to me for support. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Gradual exposure with support can help reinforce your confidence. What feelings or thoughts do you think might arise during this experience, and how can we prepare for them?

User: I might feel anxious or have some flashbacks of past experiences, but I think reminding myself that I'm in control and that I've succeeded before can help a lot.

Consultant: Absolutely! Acknowledging these feelings and reminding yourself of your strength can empower you. How can we incorporate those reminders into your goal-setting?

User: I could create a little affirmation or mantra that I repeat to myself before and during the exposure, like "I am capable of handling this situation.”

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Having a personal affirmation can serve as a reminder of your progress and resilience. How do you feel about developing a plan that includes this mantra and your exposure steps?

User: I feel good about that. It feels more structured and allows me to really track my growth.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let’s outline a simple plan together. What would be your first step, and when do you think you could do it?

User: I think I could visit a small flower shop this weekend. It’s a familiar environment, and I can practice my breathing techniques there.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect first step! Remember to use your affirmation when you're there. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel excited but a little nervous. It’s a step outside my comfort zone, but I believe I can handle it.

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel nervous when stepping out of your comfort zone! A bit of anxiety often indicates growth. How can you celebrate this achievement once you've successfully completed your visit?

User: Maybe I could treat myself afterward or share my experience with a friend. It would be nice to commemorate the effort.

Consultant: Those are great ideas! Celebrating your successes, no matter how small, reinforces your progress. How do you see your progress influencing your future experiences with flowers and related situations?

User: I hope it will show me that I can handle more exposure gradually, and it might help me to enjoy situations I previously avoided.

Consultant: That’s an excellent perspective, Xiao Li! Viewing these experiences as opportunities for growth can be incredibly freeing. As we wrap up today’s session, what are your key takeaways from our discussion?

User: I’ve learned that I can build on my progress with small, structured steps and support. I realized I have strategies to handle my anxiety. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! You’ve come a long way, and I believe you’ll continue to achieve your goals. What will you take away as your main strategy moving forward?

User: Keeping track of my exposure steps, using my affirmation, and celebrating small wins will be my main focus.

Consultant: Excellent! I'm confident that you have the tools to succeed. Remember, it's perfectly okay to seek support when you need it. If anything comes up, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help and guidance. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Li! I'm proud of your progress and look forward to hearing about your next steps. Take care and talk to you soon!
