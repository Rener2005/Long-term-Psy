Consultant: Hello, welcome to today's session. I'm glad you're here. Before we start, I'd love to hear about how you've been feeling lately and any challenges you've faced recently.

User: Hi. I've been feeling really low and anxious ever since that conflict with my roommate a month ago. I can't shake the feeling that I'm being judged or not accepted by others, and it's hard to concentrate on my studies.

Consultant: It sounds like that situation has really impacted your emotional well-being and your ability to focus. Can you tell me more about what happened with your roommate and how that made you feel?

User: Well, she accused me of not being responsible with our shared space, which felt really unfair to me. I felt insulted and it just spiraled from there. Now, I'm always worried about what others think of me, especially her.

Consultant: I see. It must be incredibly upsetting to feel criticized like that, especially in a living situation where you expect to feel comfortable. How do those feelings of judgment affect your day-to-day life?

User: I just feel more anxious and like I'm always on edge. I often second-guess myself and I can't concentrate on anything. It's as if I'm not good enough, and that makes me really tense around her and everyone else.

Consultant: That's a tough spot to be in. It seems like the conflict has affected not just your relationship with her, but also your self-esteem and ability to focus. Let’s explore those thoughts you’re having about yourself. What do you think when you feel that you’re not good enough?

User: I usually think that people just see the negative side of me. Like they think I'm messy or untrustworthy. It makes me feel really lonely, like I'm not able to connect with anyone.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite harsh on yourself, and it’s understandable to feel lonely and anxious in that mindset. Are there specific situations that trigger these feelings of inadequacy more than others?

User: Yes, when I’m around my roommate or when I see other students being social. I feel like I'm always on the outside, looking in.

Consultant: It's really valuable that you're identifying these triggers. Let's dig deeper into these automatic thoughts. When you're feeling that way, what specific thoughts run through your mind at those moments?

User: I think things like, "They must think I'm weird," or "I’ll never make any friends." Those thoughts just cycle around in my head.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite negative, and it’s common for them to feel overwhelming. What evidence do you have that supports those thoughts? Are there any moments that challenge that perspective?

User: I guess sometimes I talk to other classmates, and they seem nice. But then I quickly dismiss it as just being polite. It’s hard to see any real friendships.

Consultant: That’s a great observation. It seems like there's a part of you that recognizes those positive interactions, but another part that dismisses them. If a friend was in your shoes, what would you tell her about those positive moments?

User: I’d probably tell her that not everyone is judging her and that maybe she’s just being too hard on herself.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you’re acknowledging that you're harsher on yourself than you would be on a friend. What do you think it would take for you to apply that same kindness to yourself?

User: I think I need to remind myself that it’s okay to not be perfect and that I have strengths too, even if I can’t always see them.

Consultant: That's a wonderful insight. Recognizing your strengths is an important part of building your self-esteem. What small steps do you think you could take to cultivate that kinder voice within you?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal to write down positive experiences or things I do well, no matter how small they are.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent idea! Keeping a journal can help you hold onto those positive moments and counter the negative thoughts. Would you be willing to start that this week?

User: Yes, I think I can do that.

Consultant: That's great to hear! As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed. You’ve recognized some negative thoughts and identified ways to begin shifting your perspective. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel a little more hopeful. It’s nice to think that I can work on changing my thoughts instead of just feeling stuck.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it's a process. This week, focus on your journaling and let's discuss how that goes in our next session. You’re doing important work, and I’m here to support you through it. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyou! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been a bit better since my mom came to stay with me, but I still feel uneasy around my roommate. Sometimes, I just feel like I'm not good enough.

Consultant: It's good to hear that your mom's presence has helped a bit. I can understand how it might be hard to overcome feelings of unease and self-doubt, especially with your roommate. Can you share more about your concerns regarding your roommate?

User: Well, it feels like she doesn't want to be around me, and sometimes it's like she's talking about me behind my back. I often feel excluded from the group.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult. Feeling excluded can be painful, and it seems like your mind is trying to protect you by being cautious. What specific thoughts come to mind when you feel excluded? 

User: I often think that maybe I'm just not interesting enough to be friends with them. It makes me feel sad and worried.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're questioning your worth based on how others are interacting with you. Can we explore the evidence for that thought? What are some things that could suggest you are interesting and valuable as a friend?

User: I do have some interests, like reading and drawing. Sometimes, I feel like I'm good at those. But when I'm around them, I just freeze and can’t express myself.

Consultant: It’s great that you have interests you enjoy! It might be helpful to remember those moments when you feel confident. We can work on how to express those interests around your friends. How does that sound?

User: That sounds okay, but I worry that if I share my interests, they still might not care.

Consultant: That’s understandable. However, is there a chance they might actually appreciate your interests more than you expect? Also, how would you feel if they didn't respond positively?

User: I guess it's possible they might like what I share. If they don't, it would probably hurt, but I wouldn't die from it, right?

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to recognize that while rejection can sting, it doesn't define your worth. Would you be willing to take small steps to share your interests, perhaps even just with one person at first?

User: Yeah, I could try talking to my roommate about a book I’m reading or my drawing. That feels a bit less scary.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start! Just sharing a little can help build connections. What if we plan how you might start that conversation? 

User: I could ask her if she’s read any good books lately, and then mention mine. 

Consultant: That’s a perfect icebreaker! It shows interest in her opinions too. How would you feel approaching this conversation next time?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited. It's nice to think about connecting with her.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful combination of feelings to have! Nerves are normal, but excitement can motivate you. How can you remind yourself of your worth if negative thoughts pop up?

User: Maybe I can tell myself that I have my own strengths and interests, and it’s okay if not everyone appreciates them.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reaffirming your strengths is key. Let’s also discuss strategies for when you feel the old doubts creeping in. What would work for you?

User: I think taking a few deep breaths and reminding myself about the positive things I like about myself could help.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Breathing and positive self-talk can provide a great support for you. How do you feel about trying this in a situation with your roommate?

User: I feel like I would at least give it a shot. I know I need to step out of my comfort zone a bit.

Consultant: Stepping out of your comfort zone is a brave move. Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. We can celebrate every little step you take. What would you like to focus on before our next session?

User: I want to work on approaching my roommate and maybe also try to be around the group more, even if it’s hard.

Consultant: That sounds like a great goal! I believe you can do it. Before we wrap up, let's summarize what you hope to achieve. 

User: I want to share my interests confidently with my roommate and try interacting more with the group.

Consultant: Fantastic! And how about practicing the breathing technique and self-affirmation whenever you feel anxious? 

User: Yes, I can do that. 

Consultant: Great! I’m proud of your willingness to take these steps. Remember, I'm here to support you. If you encounter any challenges, we’ll tackle them together in our next session. 

User: Thank you so much. I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaoyou! I look forward to hearing about your progress. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyou! I'm glad you're here again. I remember from our last session that you've been working on finding some balance between personal space and social interactions. How have you been feeling about that lately?

User: Hi! I've been trying to focus on my studies and keep some distance from my roommate, but I still feel anxious when I think about socializing with others. I sometimes feel like I'm not making progress in my relationships.

Consultant: It sounds like you're putting in a lot of effort to create that balance, but there's still some anxiety around socializing. Can you share more about specific situations that make you feel anxious or where you feel stuck?

User: Well, I felt really anxious when there was a group project in class. Even though I tried to participate, I couldn't shake off this feeling of dread and worry about how others might perceive me.

Consultant: That sounds challenging. Group settings can be especially tough. What thoughts were running through your mind during that project that contributed to your anxiety?

User: I kept thinking that I would mess up or that people wouldn't take me seriously. It made it hard to speak up, and I felt overwhelmed.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. Those thoughts can really affect how you interact in group settings. Have you noticed any patterns in your thoughts during those moments?

User: Yes, I often think the worst will happen, like if I say something wrong, everyone will judge me, and then I’ll feel embarrassed.

Consultant: That’s a common thought pattern called catastrophizing, where we expect the worst outcomes. Would you be willing to explore more about that thought and challenge it together?

User: Sure, I’d like to understand this better.

Consultant: Great! Let's start by examining how likely it is that your worst fears would actually happen. What evidence do you have that others would judge you harshly?

User: I guess I don't really have concrete evidence. It just feels that way when I’m nervous.

Consultant: That’s a really insightful realization. It sounds like the feelings of anxiety may be clouding your judgment. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about those fears?

User: I would probably tell them that it's okay to make mistakes and that most people are focused on themselves, not judging others.

Consultant: Exactly! That's a kinder perspective. Now, let's think about a small social goal you could set for yourself. What is one manageable social interaction you could try this week to help build your confidence?

User: Maybe I could ask a classmate to study together? That doesn’t seem too overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! It’s a supportive, low-pressure environment. How do you feel about setting that goal for yourself?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited about it. I guess it's a step forward.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful attitude! It’s normal to feel nervous, but taking that step can help you build confidence. How about we also plan how to measure your feelings after this interaction? 

User: Maybe I can jot down how I felt before and after, and whether I found it easier to talk.

Consultant: Yes, tracking your feelings can be very helpful. It allows you to reflect on your experiences and recognize your progress. How about we plan to discuss this in our next session?

User: That sounds good! I think it will help me stay accountable.

Consultant: Absolutely! I'm excited to hear how it goes. Remember, each small step counts. Is there anything else you want to discuss today before we end our session?

User: I think that’s all for now. I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoyou! It's been great to see you actively engaging in this process. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need any support before our next session. Take care and good luck with your goal!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyou! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to apply what we discussed. I did participate in a school event, and it felt good, but I’m still struggling to feel comfortable in larger social settings.

Consultant: That's a great step forward, participating in the event! It shows you're willing to challenge yourself. Could you tell me a bit more about what made you feel good about that experience?

User: I felt a sense of achievement, like I could connect with others, even if it was just briefly. But when I think about bigger gatherings, I still get anxious. 

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. It sounds like you’re starting to adapt to smaller group interactions, but larger ones still cause some anxiety. What specifically do you worry about when you think of a larger gathering?

User: I worry that I won’t know what to say or that people will judge me. It’s like I freeze up in my mind and overthink everything.

Consultant: Those situations can definitely be challenging. It seems your mind is racing with thoughts about judgment and expectations. Can you recall a specific moment during a social encounter where you felt judged? 

User: Yes, I remember at a party last month, I tried to join a conversation, but it felt like I didn’t fit in. I kept thinking everyone was looking at me awkwardly.

Consultant: That sounded uncomfortable. Those feelings of not fitting in can be really tough. When you think about that moment, can you identify any specific thoughts that went through your mind?

User: I just thought they might think I’m boring or awkward. So, I ended up leaving early because I felt embarrassed.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts led to a strong emotional reaction. Let's explore this together. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that they thought you were boring or awkward? 

User: I guess I don't really know for sure. It was just a feeling. I didn’t actually talk to anyone about it.

Consultant: That’s insightful! Often our feelings can mislead us, especially in social situations. If you were to think about a friend in a similar position, how might they interpret the same situation?

User: They would probably say it’s normal to feel awkward and that people might not judge as harshly as we think they do.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re already starting to challenge some of those thoughts. Let’s consider practicing some alternatives to that anxious thinking. How might you reframe your thoughts during similar situations in the future?

User: I could tell myself that it's okay to feel nervous and that most people might be focused on themselves rather than judging me.

Consultant: That’s a great reframe! Acknowledging your feelings is important, and shifting your focus can help reduce anxiety. Let’s practice this idea. Imagine you’re at a large gathering—what could you say to yourself to set a positive tone before entering?

User: I could say, "I’m here to enjoy myself, and it’s okay to just be myself." 

Consultant: Yes, that’s very empowering! Let’s take this a step further. How about we simulate a situation where you approach a group of people? I can play the part of a few attendees. This way, we can practice in a supportive environment!

User: That sounds interesting! I think I could benefit from that.

Consultant: Great! Let's set the scene. Imagine you’re walking into a gathering where people are already chatting. How do you want to approach the group?

User: I guess I could walk over confidently and introduce myself. I could say something like, “Hi! I’m Xiaoyou. What are you all talking about?”

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! It’s friendly and open. Now, let’s pretend I’m in the group. I'll respond as if it's a normal conversation. 

User: Okay, let's do it.

Consultant: (as group member) “Hey Xiaoyou! We were just talking about our favorite movies. What about you?”

User: Well, I really enjoyed the latest superhero movie. It had great action scenes!

Consultant: (as group member) “Oh nice! I love those too! Which part did you like the most?”

User: I liked the part where the hero fights against all odds. It was so inspiring.

Consultant: (as group member) “Definitely! It’s always amazing to see how they overcome challenges. Do you watch many superhero films?”

User: Not a lot, but I enjoy a good story!

Consultant: Excellent job! You kept the conversation flowing. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt good! Simulating it made me less anxious. I realized I can contribute without overthinking.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! This practice can help reinforce your confidence in real situations. Remember, each time you step out, you can apply these skills. 

User: I will definitely try to remember these techniques. 

Consultant: Fantastic! As we wrap up today, let’s review what you’ve learned and how to apply it moving forward. What strategies do you plan to use in your next social event?

User: I want to use my reframe about people focusing on themselves and practice starting conversations like we did today.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Xiaoyou! You’re making wonderful progress. Looking ahead, how will you keep encouraging yourself during challenging situations?

User: I’ll remind myself that it’s okay to feel nervous and focus on enjoying the moment. 

Consultant: Yes, maintaining that self-compassion is key. Remember, growth takes time and practice. Well done today! 

User: Thank you! I feel more optimistic!

Consultant: I’m really pleased to hear that! You’re doing great work on your journey. If you ever feel the need to adjust your strategies or just want to talk, I’m here for you.

User: I really appreciate it. See you next time!

Consultant: See you then, Xiaoyou! Take care until our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaoyou! It's great to see you again. I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good overall. I’ve been getting used to my new study and life routine, and it seems like I’m making some progress. However, there are still moments when I feel a bit overwhelmed, especially with my coursework.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear that you're adapting to your new routine! It sounds like you're experiencing some growth. Can you share more about the moments when you feel overwhelmed? What specifically triggers those feelings?

User: Well, sometimes when I look at the amount of work I have to do, it just feels like too much. I start worrying that I won’t be able to finish everything on time or do it well enough.

Consultant: It makes sense that looking at a big workload can feel daunting. It's common to feel that way when there's a lot on your plate. What thoughts go through your mind when you start to feel overwhelmed?

User: I often think that if I can’t do everything perfectly, then I’ll fail. I also imagine my friends doing better than me, which makes me feel even worse.

Consultant: I can see how those thoughts can add pressure. It sounds like you're putting a lot of expectations on yourself. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit. Do you have any evidence that not doing everything perfectly would mean failing?

User: Not really. I guess I just feel that way because I’ve dealt with these feelings for a long time. It’s hard to shake them off, especially when I compare myself to others.

Consultant: You're absolutely right; it's very challenging to change feelings and thoughts that have been ingrained. Let’s take a moment to consider if you would feel the same about a friend experiencing similar thoughts. What would you suggest they do?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay not to be perfect and that everyone has their challenges. I would encourage them just to do their best and to focus on what they’ve accomplished.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective you have for your friend! It sounds like you recognize the importance of self-compassion. How might you apply that same kindness to yourself when you’re feeling overwhelmed?

User: That’s a good point. I guess I should remind myself that it’s okay to just do my best, even if it’s not perfect. Maybe I can make a list of all my accomplishments to help me see how far I’ve come.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Creating a list can serve as a tangible reminder of your progress and achievements, which can help shift your focus from perfectionism to celebrating successes. How about we work on setting monthly goals together? This will help you manage your workload without feeling overwhelmed.

User: I would like that! Focusing on smaller, more manageable goals sounds like it could help me feel more accomplished without stressing out.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s outline some specific goals for the upcoming month. What’s one area of your coursework where you would like to feel more confident or achieve something specific?

User: I think I’d like to set a goal for my study schedule. I want to dedicate specific hours to studying for each subject and stick to it.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! By allocating specific study hours, you’re creating a structure that can help you minimize feelings of being overwhelmed. How many subjects do you think you can realistically manage each week?

User: I have four main subjects, so maybe I can dedicate one study session to each subject per week.

Consultant: That sounds doable! So, if you allocate a session for each subject weekly, you should feel less pressure during your study periods. Let’s also consider incorporating some relaxation or self-care time into your schedule. What do you think?

User: Yes, I think taking breaks for self-care will be important too. Maybe I can set aside time for a walk or doing things I enjoy, like reading.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Balancing study with enjoyable activities can really help maintain your motivation and reduce stress. As we wrap up, how do you feel about the goals we’ve set today? 

User: I feel really good about them! I think having specific goals and planned breaks will help ease my anxiety and make studying feel less overwhelming.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Xiaoyou! It's important to recognize and embrace your journey. Keep practicing the strategies we've discussed, and remember to be kind to yourself. You’ve made great progress. Would you like to set a date for our next check-in to see how things are going?

User: Yes, I’d really like that! Let’s set a date for a month from now to review my progress.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I’ll look forward to hearing about how you’ve implemented the goals we set today. Remember, you’re making strides in your growth. Take care until then!

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your support. I’ll see you next month!
