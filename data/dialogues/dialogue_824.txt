Consultant: Hi Chenchen! I'm really glad you came in today. How have you been feeling lately, especially after the mid-term exams?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious and a bit down since my exam results weren't good. I keep blaming myself for not doing well, and it makes me nervous about the upcoming high school entrance exams.

Consultant: It sounds like those results hit you pretty hard, and it's understandable to feel that way. Can you tell me a bit more about how you're dealing with those feelings right now?

User: Well, I just feel really inadequate. I see my classmates doing well, and I can't help but compare myself to them. It's frustrating and it makes me anxious to think about those exams.

Consultant: I hear you. Comparing ourselves to others can be really tough, especially when we feel we don’t measure up. What kind of thoughts cross your mind when you compare yourself to your classmates?

User: I think things like, “I’ll never be as good as them,” or “I’m just going to keep failing.” It’s like a loop that I can’t get out of.

Consultant: That sounds very overwhelming. It seems like those thoughts are quite negative and they’re really affecting how you see yourself and your abilities. How do those thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: They make me feel really sad and anxious. I worry a lot, especially about what others think of me. I feel ashamed of my results.

Consultant: Feeling sad and anxious based on those thoughts is completely understandable. Have you noticed any physical sensations when those thoughts come up, like tension or restlessness?

User: Yes, I often feel a knot in my stomach and my heart races. Sometimes, I just don’t want to be around people because I feel so judged.

Consultant: That’s a powerful reaction, Chenchen. It’s important to recognize and acknowledge those feelings and sensations. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit more—do you think there might be any evidence that challenges those negative beliefs about yourself?

User: I guess I did do well in some subjects before, and I could improve if I tried harder. But it’s hard to focus when I feel this way.

Consultant: That’s a good insight! Acknowledging past achievements can help counter the negative beliefs. What might happen if you tried to focus on those past successes instead of just the failures? 

User: I would probably feel a bit more hopeful, but my anxiety is still there, especially about social situations and the judgments from others.

Consultant: That’s understandable. How about we work on becoming more comfortable with those social situations? Would you be willing to try some gradual exposure exercises to face those fears together?

User: I think I could try that. I just need to find the courage to start. It’s just so daunting.

Consultant: It's definitely a big step, but we can take it one small step at a time. What are some manageable social situations you could consider facing first?

User: Maybe starting with speaking up in class or joining a group study session could be small enough steps. 

Consultant: Those sound like excellent starting points! They’re achievable steps. How about we come up with a plan for how you would approach those situations? 

User: Sure! I could prepare a question to ask before my next class, to make it easier to speak up.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Having a prepared question can really ease the pressure. How do you feel about this plan? 

User: I feel a little bit more confident thinking about it, but I’m still scared about what others will think.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel scared, but let’s focus on your effort and the bravery it takes to try. We can also come up with some techniques to manage your anxiety when those moments arise. How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful. I’d like to learn some ways to calm myself down.

Consultant: Perfect! We can discuss relaxation techniques like deep breathing or visualization. Would you like to try a quick deep breathing exercise now?

User: Yes, I’d like that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in together... (pause) and out... (pause) How does that feel?

User: It feels nice to focus on my breathing for a moment. It kind of helps.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Practicing this regularly can help reduce anxiety. We will integrate this into our future sessions.  

User: I think that would really help me to stay calm.

Consultant: Absolutely. I’m here to support you through this process, and it's okay to take it slow. We can keep building your confidence step by step. 

User: Thank you. I appreciate that. It’s nice to know I’m not alone in this.

Consultant: You’re definitely not alone, Chenchen. You’re taking important steps forward. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed and outline your plan for next time.

User: Sure! I’ll focus on my past successes, prepare a question for class, and practice some deep breathing.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I look forward to hearing how those steps went for you. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. 

User: I’ll keep that in mind. Thank you so much for today!

Consultant: You're welcome! I'm really proud of the effort you're putting in. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support before our next session. Take care!

User: I will, thank you!
###################
Consultant: Hello Chenchen! I'm glad to see you again today. I know we've talked about some of the challenges you've been facing. Can you share how you've been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious. I still feel afraid to go back to school after the final exams. I worry a lot about what my classmates think of me. It feels overwhelming.

Consultant: It sounds like you're still dealing with a lot of anxiety regarding your classmates' opinions. This is completely understandable. Can you tell me more about what thoughts come to mind when you think about returning to school?

User: I keep thinking that they might judge me or that I won't fit in anymore. I feel like they are all talking behind my back, and it makes me really anxious.

Consultant: That must be incredibly stressful for you. It’s common for people to worry about how others perceive them, especially in social situations. What specific feelings arise when you think about this judgment?

User: I feel really ashamed, and it makes me want to hide away. It’s like I can't face them. I also feel a bit jealous of my sister because she seems to find making friends so easy while I struggle.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. It seems like you’re feeling not only anxious but also a sense of shame and jealousy. Can we explore those feelings further? How does thinking about your sister's ease with friends affect your own feelings about social situations?

User: Well, it's discouraging. I feel like I should be more outgoing but I’m not. It makes me feel inadequate, like I'm letting myself and my family down.

Consultant: It’s tough to feel that way. You're not alone in this; many people struggle with similar feelings of inadequacy. When you think about your family, what specifically makes you feel you're letting them down?

User: I think my parents expect me to do well academically and socially. But right now, I can’t even face going back to school. I feel like I'm disappointing them.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that pressure from your family. What if we could reframe how you view your performance? Remember, going back to school isn't just about academics—it's also a process, and it's okay to take small steps. How does that sound to you?

User: That might be helpful. I need to remember it's okay to take small steps, but I'm still really scared of facing everyone.

Consultant: That’s completely normal. Perhaps we could start with some gradual exposure techniques. How about we identify a very small situation in which you could interact with someone at school that feels manageable? 

User: Like what? I'm not sure how to approach that.

Consultant: How about starting with something simple, like saying hello to a classmate you feel comfortable with? Just a quick interaction to ease back into social situations. Would that feel okay to you?

User: I think I could try that. But what if they ignore me or don't respond well? 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. One way to challenge this fear is by asking yourself—what evidence do you have that they will ignore you? Often, our minds jump to the worst-case scenario. What do you think?

User: I guess I don’t have any strong evidence that they will ignore me. It’s just how I feel.

Consultant: Exactly! Those feelings can trick us into thinking they are the reality. By questioning these thoughts, we can start seeing things more clearly. What if we practice this method of questioning together over the next few sessions?

User: That sounds like a good plan. I think I need help to change those thoughts in my head.

Consultant: Great! I’m here to support you. Another step could be to focus on what you can control—like your own reaction to these feelings. How do you feel about using techniques to manage your anxiety in the moment?

User: I’m open to that. I need something to help me cope when I'm feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: We can explore some strategies to calm yourself during those anxious moments. One effective technique is deep breathing or grounding exercises. Would you be comfortable trying one of those right now?

User: Sure, I can try some deep breathing.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s take a moment to do that together. Inhale deeply through your nose for four counts, hold for four, then exhale slowly through your mouth for six. Ready? 

User: Okay. (Breathes slowly) 

Consultant: Great job! How do you feel after doing that?

User: I feel a bit calmer. Maybe I can use this in school.

Consultant: Absolutely! This can be a powerful tool for you. Remember, practicing these techniques will help you manage anxiety when it arises. How do you feel about setting a goal for our next session?

User: I think I can try to say hi to someone at school before we meet again.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! I’m proud of you for committing to that. Each small step counts, and I believe in your ability to reach it. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Chenchen. We’re taking it one step at a time together. Let’s check in on your progress next session and see how it went.

User: Sounds good to me. I appreciate your help!

Consultant: You’re really putting in the effort, and that’s commendable. Remember, it’s okay to take things at your own pace. Until next time, take care!

User: You too! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Chenchen! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling pretty overwhelmed. I failed my mock exams, and it just made me doubt my abilities more than ever. I feel like I’m letting my family down, especially my little sister.

Consultant: I understand how difficult this must be for you. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure, both academically and within your family. Can you describe what thoughts or feelings come up when you think about your exams and your family?

User: I just keep thinking that I'm not good enough and that everyone else is doing better than me. At home, I feel like I should be setting an example for my sister, but I don't feel like I can even take care of myself right now.

Consultant: It makes sense that you're feeling this way given the pressures you’re under. Let’s take a moment to explore those thoughts more deeply. What specific thoughts go through your mind during moments when you feel you're not good enough?

User: I often think, "I’ll never be able to catch up" or "My parents must be embarrassed of me." It’s like a loop that keeps playing in my head.

Consultant: That sounds very distressing. Those thoughts seem really heavy. If you were to try and see things from a different perspective, could there be any alternative thoughts that might be more helpful?

User: I guess I could tell myself that everyone struggles and that my parents might actually understand. But it just feels so hard to believe that in the moment.

Consultant: It’s definitely easier said than done. Let’s challenge those automatic thoughts together. For example, what evidence do you have that your parents are embarrassed? Have they communicated that to you?

User: No, they haven't outright said that. They actually seem supportive. I guess I’m just assuming how they feel based on my own insecurities.

Consultant: That’s a really important realization. Sometimes we project our feelings onto others. What if you chose to communicate with your parents about how you’re feeling? 

User: I’ve never really thought about talking to them about it. I’m just afraid they might not understand.

Consultant: I hear your concern, and it’s completely natural to feel that way. But communication could open up a space for them to show you support. Would you be open to trying it?

User: Yeah, I think I could try. But what if they don’t respond the way I hope?

Consultant: It can be scary to think about that. However, practicing how to express your feelings openly may help you feel more in control. What do you think your first step could be?

User: Maybe just saying that I've been feeling really stressed about my exams and my worries about school. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great starting point. Now, let’s talk about how you can manage the anxiety when you study. What are your current study habits like?

User: I mostly just sit at my desk and try to study, but when I look at the material, I just freeze up.

Consultant: It sounds like there may be some avoidance happening. Have you tried creating a more structured plan or breaking your study material into smaller, manageable parts?

User: No, I usually just try to tackle everything at once. That could explain why I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Exactly. Let’s create a small, manageable study plan together. How much time do you think you could dedicate to studying each day without feeling overwhelmed?

User: Maybe about an hour. I think I could manage that.

Consultant: That’s a good choice! During that hour, try to focus on one topic at a time. What if we also included some short breaks to keep your mind fresh?

User: That sounds helpful. I often forget to take breaks and just sit there feeling stressed.

Consultant: Breaks are essential! Perhaps after each 20 minutes of studying, you could take a 5-minute break to stretch or relax. How does that sound to you?

User: I like that idea. It seems manageable.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As you move forward, remember to practice some relaxation techniques. Have you tried any before?

User: I haven’t really tried anything like that. I mostly just deal with it silently.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Deep breathing or mindfulness exercises can be useful and don’t take much time. Would you like me to guide you through a simple breathing exercise right now?

User: Yes, I’d like that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose slowly, hold it for a moment, and then breathe out gently through your mouth. Let’s do that a few times together.

User: *Breathes deeply while following along.*

Consultant: How do you feel after that exercise?

User: I feel a bit more relaxed. It felt good to take a moment for myself.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Integrating moments of mindfulness can enhance your emotional regulation. How do you think you can remind yourself to practice this daily?

User: Maybe I can set a daily alarm to remind me. I could use that time to breathe and refocus.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Making intentional time for yourself will help you deal with stress more effectively. As we wrap up our session, how are you feeling about everything we discussed?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I see that I can communicate better and approach my studies in a different way.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’ve taken great steps today toward managing your anxiety and enhancing your communication. Remember, it’s okay to feel unsure at times. How confident are you that you can implement these changes?

User: I feel like I can really try. I just need to keep reminding myself that it's okay to not be perfect.

Consultant: Absolutely! Progress over perfection is the goal. When we meet next time, we can discuss your experiences and see how things are going. You’re doing great, Chenchen, and I believe in your ability to grow from here.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and understanding. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome. Take care, Chenchen, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Chen Chen! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better about my studies, but I'm still worried about whether my family truly understands me. I don't know how to talk to them about my feelings sometimes.

Consultant: I understand that you're feeling a mix of improvement in your studies and concerns about family communication. Let's explore how you might approach those feelings. What aspects of your family relationships do you find most challenging?

User: I feel like my parents expect a lot from me, especially with my studies. I want to succeed, but sometimes I wish they would just ask how I'm feeling instead of focusing only on grades.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It’s understandable to want both success and emotional support. How do these expectations make you feel, and do they affect your confidence in your abilities?

User: Yes, they make me anxious sometimes. I worry that I might disappoint them if I don’t do well. But at the same time, I want them to acknowledge my efforts, not just my grades.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re caught between wanting to meet their expectations and needing them to acknowledge your feelings. Can you think of a specific instance where you felt this way recently?

User: Last week, when I got my test scores back, my parents only asked about the numbers. I was happy with my improvement, but I felt like they didn’t see how much effort I had put in.

Consultant: I see. That situation must have felt frustrating for you, especially after your hard work. Have you ever had a chance to express these feelings to them?

User: Not really. I don’t want to upset them. I’m just not sure how to start that conversation.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel hesitant. Starting a discussion about feelings can be tough. What if we think about a way to express your feelings that might feel safe and comfortable for you?

User: Maybe I could write them a letter? I find it easier to express myself in writing rather than face-to-face.

Consultant: Writing a letter sounds like a great idea! It allows you to share your thoughts without feeling the immediate pressure of their reaction. What key points would you want to include in that letter?

User: I’d want to tell them about my progress, how their support means a lot to me, and that I hope they can see my efforts beyond just the grades.

Consultant: Those are wonderful points to share! By expressing your progress and the importance of their support, you open up a pathway for better understanding. How do you feel about taking this step to communicate?

User: I think it might help! Writing it down might make me feel less anxious about their reactions.

Consultant: Absolutely. It’s a positive step toward improving communication. Once you write the letter, how do you plan to follow up with them after they read it?

User: Maybe after they read it, I could ask them how they feel about what I wrote. That way, it opens a dialogue.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! It creates space for conversation. How does thinking about this make you feel about your relationship with them?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. If I can get them to understand me better, maybe things would change for the better.

Consultant: Hope is a great feeling to hold onto. As you work on this, remember to acknowledge your emotions too. What other methods might help you feel confident while you communicate?

User: I could practice what I want to say, or even talk to a friend about it first. It might make me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Practicing with a friend is a great way to build confidence! It can help you refine your thoughts and reduce anxiety. Are there any particular feelings you’re experiencing as you think about these ideas?

User: I feel a little less anxious now, maybe even excited to try this out.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Excitement is a positive emotion that can fuel your actions. Let’s also consider how to maintain this optimistic mindset as you prepare to speak with your family. What might help you stay grounded?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it’s okay to express my feelings. Their reactions don’t define me.

Consultant: Exactly! Affirming your right to express yourself is crucial. How might you incorporate that reminder into your daily routine?

User: I could write it down somewhere I can see it often, like on my wall or in my notebook.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Visual reminders can reinforce positive thoughts. In the future, when you face similar situations, you'll have that reassurance in front of you. What are your next steps after our session today?

User: I will start drafting the letter, and putting a reminder on my wall sounds good too!

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Chen Chen! I’m really proud of the steps you’re taking towards better communication with your family. As we conclude, how do you feel about your progress today?

User: I feel like I've made a lot of progress! I’m excited to try out what we discussed.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, taking these steps is important. Keep nurturing that excitement, and don’t hesitate to reach out again if you need more support. Good luck with your letter and communication!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Chen Chen! Take care, and I look forward to hearing how it goes next time we meet!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Chenchen! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I'm starting to open up more about my expectations for myself and others. I don’t feel as anxious in social situations as I used to.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re making progress in managing your social anxiety. Can you tell me about any specific situations where you felt more comfortable or supported recently?

User: Well, during a group study session, I found that I was able to express my thoughts more freely and my classmates were really supportive. It felt good to be part of a team.

Consultant: Being part of a supportive team is a valuable experience. How did that support make you feel about both your studies and your relationships with others?

User: I feel more motivated to study, and it’s nice to know others are there to help. I also realized that my family’s support is important, and I want to communicate better with them.

Consultant: It's great that you're recognizing the importance of both school and family support. How do you think communicating better with your family might help you in your academic journey?

User: I think it would relieve some pressure. I’ve been hesitant to share my struggles with them, thinking they might not understand. But now I feel like they could be a part of my support system.

Consultant: Opening up to your family could indeed foster better understanding and support. What specific challenges do you feel hesitant to share with them?

User: I sometimes struggle with keeping up with schoolwork, especially with the upcoming graduation exams. I don't want them to worry too much.

Consultant: It's understandable to not want to worry your parents, but sharing your challenges can also help them understand your feelings and perhaps ease some of that pressure. What are some ways we could approach this communication with your family?

User: I could try to have a calm conversation with them about what I'm feeling. Maybe I could explain my study plan and where I need help.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach. Preparing what you want to say can make the conversation smoother. How do you feel about initiating that talk with them?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I'm also excited. I think it would feel good to share my thoughts instead of holding them in.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous, but it also sounds very empowering to express your needs. Remember, they want to support you. Let's focus on strategies for that conversation. How about we role-play how it might go?

User: That would be helpful! I can practice what I want to say.

Consultant: Great! Let's imagine you’re starting the conversation. What would you say first?

User: I might say, “I've been feeling overwhelmed with my studies, especially with the exams coming up. I want to talk about how we can work together to make this easier.”

Consultant: That’s a solid start! It clearly expresses your feelings and invites cooperation. How do you think they might respond to that?

User: I hope they would be understanding. I think they’ve noticed I’ve been a bit off lately.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re aware of their concern, which can further encourage openness. If they respond supportively, how would that make you feel?

User: It would make me feel relieved and more connected to them.

Consultant: That connection is powerful. Moving on from this conversation, what other positive steps can we take to maintain this momentum in your communication and support network?

User: I could look for study buddies in my classes—people I can collaborate with and share ideas.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Collaborating with classmates not only helps your studies but also strengthens your support network. What qualities do you think are important in a study buddy?

User: I think someone patient and open-minded would be great. I want someone who wouldn’t judge me if I struggle with something.

Consultant: That’s a wise choice! Seeking those qualities in others will create a supportive studying environment. Given what we've discussed, how will you take steps to find such a study buddy moving forward?

User: I can ask around in my class and see if anyone is looking for a study partner. Maybe I could start a group chat to coordinate study sessions.

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive step! How do you feel about reaching out to your classmates to get that started?

User: I’m starting to feel more confident about it. I think I can do it. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember, each step you take builds your confidence and connection with others. Let’s check back in next time to see how all these plans work out for you.

User: I’m looking forward to it! Thank you for your help today.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Chenchen! I believe in your ability to manage these challenges. Until next time, take care!
###################
Consultant: Hi Chen Chen! Welcome back to our session. I'm really glad to see you. How have you been feeling lately with your studies and at home?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling pretty good actually! My grades have improved, and I feel more confident about the upcoming exams. My relationship with my family is also getting better, especially with my sister.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made some significant progress. Can you tell me what specific changes you’ve noticed that have contributed to this improvement?

User: Well, I’ve started to manage my time better and set small goals for my studying. Also, I’ve been spending more quality time with my family, which helps me feel more relaxed and supported.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Managing your time and setting goals can definitely help reduce stress. How do you feel when you accomplish these small goals?

User: I feel really proud of myself. It boosts my confidence a lot! I used to feel overwhelmed, but now I can see my progress step by step.

Consultant: That’s such a positive change. It’s important to recognize your achievements, no matter how small they may seem. What do you think you could do next to maintain this positive momentum as you approach your exams?

User: I think I should keep following my study plan and maybe incorporate some relaxation techniques to help with any last-minute anxiety.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Incorporating relaxation techniques is an excellent way to manage anxiety. Have you tried any techniques before, like deep breathing or mindfulness?

User: I’ve heard a bit about mindfulness but haven’t really tried it. I usually just take deep breaths when I’m stressed.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a great start! Mindfulness can be a little different; it involves being present and fully engaging with the moment without judgment. Would you like to explore that a bit more together?

User: Sure, that sounds interesting. I’d like to know how I can practice mindfulness effectively.

Consultant: One simple way to practice mindfulness is through mindful breathing. You can take a few minutes to focus solely on your breath—notice how it feels as you inhale and exhale. This can help ground you in the present moment. Would you be willing to try that?

User: I would love to try that! I think it could really help lessen my anxiety just before studying or during exams.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset to have! We can also discuss some other activities to help you unwind, like journaling or taking short walks. What do you think about those options?

User: I actually enjoy writing. Journaling could be a good way to express my thoughts and feelings.

Consultant: Absolutely! Journaling is a wonderful way to reflect and process emotions. You might find it helpful after your study sessions or when you're feeling overwhelmed. What kind of things would you like to write about in your journal?

User: I think I’d like to write about my daily experiences, my goals, and sometimes just how I’m feeling. It would help me sort through my thoughts.

Consultant: That sounds like a meaningful approach. It can create space for you to explore your feelings without judgment. How about setting a specific time each day to write, perhaps before bed?

User: Yes, that would be great! I could take 10 to 15 minutes each night to reflect on my day.

Consultant: Perfect! Establishing that routine can be very beneficial. Let’s also check in about your family relationships. How have things been with your sister lately?

User: We’ve been getting along much better. I make time to play with her, and I think she appreciates our time together. It makes me happy too.

Consultant: That's lovely to hear! Spending quality time with each other can strengthen your bond. In what ways do you think this improved relationship has impacted you?

User: It just feels comforting to have that connection, knowing that I have someone to rely on. It also helps me feel less lonely.

Consultant: Connection is so vital for our emotional well-being. It's great to hear that your family dynamics are improving. As we discuss planning for your future, what are some areas you’d like to focus on in the coming months?

User: I want to keep improving my grades, but also think about what I want to study in high school. I've been curious about science and literature.

Consultant: Those are both excellent fields! It’s great that you’re considering your future educational path. Have you done any research, or spoken to anyone about these areas of interest?

User: I’ve looked up some interesting science projects and read a couple of books in literature. It’s exciting to think about the possibilities.

Consultant: That's a wonderful way to explore those interests! It's important to feel excited about your future. If you could envision your ideal path in high school, what would that look like for you?

User: I see myself joining clubs related to science and literature, maybe even participating in competitions. I’d like to be involved and meet others who share my passions.

Consultant: That sounds fantastic! Engaging with others who share your interests can be incredibly rewarding. We can also explore how to handle any anxieties you might face in those new settings. Does that sound okay?

User: Yes, that would be really helpful! I sometimes get nervous meeting new people, especially in clubs.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous in new situations. We can work on some strategies to help you feel more comfortable. One approach could be to set small, achievable goals for yourself, like speaking up once in a meeting or introducing yourself to one new person.

User: That makes sense! I think I could manage that. It sounds less intimidating.

Consultant: Exactly! Taking small steps can lead to big changes over time. Before we wrap up today, let’s review what strategies you feel most confident about implementing as you move forward.

User: I feel good about practicing mindfulness, journaling, and setting small goals for my studies and clubs. I think these things will really help me.
