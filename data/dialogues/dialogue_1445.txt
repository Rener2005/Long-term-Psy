Consultant: Hello, Xiaoning! I'm glad you're here today. I understand that you’ve been experiencing some difficult feelings lately. Can you share a bit more about what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I can't shake off the memories of the death events I’ve witnessed. I feel so scared and helpless. Since that incident at school, I keep remembering those moments, and sometimes it leads to insomnia. It’s just overwhelming.

Consultant: I hear you, Xiaoning. That kind of experience can be incredibly distressing. You mentioned feeling scared and helpless, especially after seeing that incident. Let’s talk about what specific thoughts or feelings come to you when you remember those moments. 

User: I often think about how fragile life is. Seeing someone trying to jump was traumatic, and I wonder if I could do anything to help. It makes me feel worthless that I couldn’t save anyone.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, Xiaoning. Witnessing such events can really shake one's sense of security and worth. Can you tell me what kinds of thoughts go through your mind when these memories come back? 

User: I think a lot about what I could have done differently. Sometimes I even feel guilty for just being alive while that person isn't. It's like a heavy weight on my chest.

Consultant: That guilty feeling can be quite burdensome, and it’s not uncommon to feel that way after witnessing something so traumatic. What are some emotions that accompany these thoughts of guilt or worthlessness?

User: I feel a mix of anxiety and sadness. It's hard to focus on anything else, including studying. I feel like I'm stuck in this loop of negative thoughts.

Consultant: Feeling trapped in negative thoughts is really challenging, especially since it affects your studies. Let’s explore this loop a bit more. How do these feelings influence your daily life or your approach to studying?

User: I just find it really hard to sit down and study. The anxiety makes it seem pointless, and I sometimes avoid it altogether. I end up lying in bed just thinking about those events. 

Consultant: That makes sense, Xiaoning. It may feel easier to avoid studying when you’re feeling this way. Let's think about how we might break that cycle. Can you recall any times when you were able to focus on studying, even if just a little?

User: There were a few times when I went to the library. It helped a bit, but I still felt distant and distracted. The memories would creep back in.

Consultant: It’s good that you have identified a time when studying felt manageable. Even if it was brief, that’s a positive step. What if we focus on that experience? What might help you recreate that environment or feeling at home?

User: I think being in a quieter space helps, but I still struggle with those intrusive thoughts. If I could just silence them... 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be persistent, can’t they? One approach we can explore is challenging those intrusive thoughts when they arise. We might look for evidence that counters those negative beliefs. What do you think?

User: That sounds like it could help, but part of me feels like it wouldn’t work. 

Consultant: It's completely normal to doubt such strategies at first. If a friend were experiencing similar thoughts, what perspective might you offer them?

User: I think I would tell them that it's okay to feel scared but that they shouldn’t let it take over their life. I would encourage them to share their feelings, too.

Consultant: That's a compassionate perspective, and it shows that you can recognize it in others. Now, let’s consider applying that same kindness to yourself. If you had to give yourself advice, what would you say?

User: I would probably say that I need to be kinder to myself and remember that it’s not my fault. I just need to take it one step at a time.

Consultant: That’s a great realization, Xiaoning! Taking it one step at a time can make challenges feel less overwhelming. Maybe we can establish a small, achievable goal for you this week—would you like to try that?

User: Yes, I think a small goal sounds good. Maybe I can set a specific time each day to study for a short period? 

Consultant: Absolutely! A short, focused study session could help. How about starting with 20 minutes? We could combine that with a brief relaxation exercise beforehand to ease your mind.

User: That could work. I often feel more relaxed after some deep breathing. 

Consultant: Deep breathing can be very effective for calming anxiety. How about this: before you start studying, take five minutes to focus on your breath, and then dive into your study for those 20 minutes. How does that sound?

User: That sounds doable. I’m willing to give it a try. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, what are some key takeaways for you from our session?

User: I think recognizing my feelings and learning to challenge my thoughts are important. Also, having a small goal makes me feel more hopeful about studying.

Consultant: That’s excellent, Xiaoning! Being aware of your feelings and having a plan can empower you. Keep practicing self-compassion as you move forward, and remember, it’s okay to reach out again if you need support. 

User: Thank you for your help! I feel a bit lighter and more resilient now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of you for opening up and working on these challenges. Remember, you have the tools to manage your feelings, and I believe in your ability to move through this. Take care, and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Ning! I'm glad you're here today. I understand that you’ve been feeling quite a bit of pressure with your studies. Can you share a bit more about how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Yeah, I've been really stressed out about my studies. My grades in science have been pretty low, and I'm starting to feel overwhelmed by everything.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, especially considering the pressures of high school. Can you tell me more about how that pressure is affecting you day to day?

User: I find it hard to concentrate, and sometimes I just freeze up when I sit down to study. I can’t focus at all, and that makes me anxious. I keep thinking about how if I fail, it could ruin everything.

Consultant: It sounds like that fear of failure is adding to your anxiety and making it difficult to study. What thoughts go through your mind when you sit down and find it hard to focus?

User: I keep thinking that I won’t be able to remember anything or that I’ll fail my exams, and that just makes me want to avoid studying altogether.

Consultant: These thoughts seem to create a cycle of anxiety. It can be so discouraging. Have you noticed if any specific moments or situations make you feel this way more intensely?

User: I think it gets worse when I see others doing well, or when I remember those past experiences with death. It just reminds me of how fragile everything is, and I worry that I won’t have a future.

Consultant: It's really significant that these past experiences influence your present feelings. It seems like the fear of losing control over your future is connected to both your studies and those memories. Can we talk about how we might challenge those negative thoughts?

User: Sure. I just don’t know how to change my way of thinking. It feels so real to me when I think about failing.

Consultant: It's important to acknowledge how real those feelings can be. But, let’s explore together—what evidence do you have that supports these thoughts of failure? Are there past successes you can recall?

User: I guess I have done okay in some subjects before, but it feels like that was a long time ago. Lately, it’s all been bad.

Consultant: Yes, focusing on recent struggles can overshadow your past successes. What if we try to reframe that thought? Instead of thinking, "I always fail," what could be a more balanced way to view your efforts and capabilities?

User: Maybe I could think, "I've struggled recently, but I've done well in the past and can improve again"?

Consultant: That's a great alternative! It recognizes past achievements and allows room for growth. Balancing those thoughts could help lessen anxiety surrounding your studies. How does that feel for you?

User: It feels a bit better, actually. I guess I need to remind myself that it’s not entirely hopeless.

Consultant: Absolutely! It can be really empowering to recognize that. Let's also discuss what specific methods you can use to tackle your studying more effectively. Are there any techniques you’ve found helpful in the past?

User: I used to use flashcards, but now I just feel too anxious to even start. 

Consultant: Flashcards can be a great tool. What if we broke down your study sessions into smaller, more manageable tasks? For example, can you commit to just studying with flashcards for 10 minutes a day at first?

User: I could try that. Just ten minutes seems doable, I think.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Starting small can help reduce that initial anxiety. Let's also explore what to do if you start feeling anxious during study time. Would you be open to a simple breathing exercise?

User: Yeah, I’d be willing to try that.

Consultant: Great! When you start feeling anxious, try taking a deep breath in for four counts, hold for four counts, and breathe out for four counts. This can help calm your mind. Would you want to practice that right now?

User: Sure, let’s do that.

Consultant: Okay, let’s take a deep breath in... and hold it... now breathe out slowly. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt calming. I think I can use that when I start to panic.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Ning! It gives you a practical tool to manage those anxious moments. As we approach the end of our session, let’s reflect on what you’ve learned today and how you're feeling about your upcoming studies.

User: I feel a little more hopeful. Thinking differently about my situation and using breathing techniques might really help.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re starting to build a toolkit for managing your anxiety! What specific steps do you think you'll take before our next session?

User: I’ll try to use the breathing exercise whenever I feel overwhelmed and stick to the ten-minute flashcard sessions. 

Consultant: Perfect! Setting those intentions is a great way to begin. Remember, it’s completely normal to feel pressure, but you have strategies to cope with it. Before we conclude, do you have any final thoughts or questions?

User: No, I’m just thankful for the help. I feel less alone in this.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. Remember, you can always reach out if you need support. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoning! I'm glad you're here today. You've been under a lot of pressure with the upcoming mock exams. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Yes, with the exams coming up, I feel really anxious. I can't sleep well at night and I just keep thinking about how much I need to study, but it feels overwhelming.

Consultant: I understand that it sounds really tough for you right now. It’s completely normal to feel this way before exams. Can you share what specifically makes you feel overwhelmed when you're studying?

User: Well, I keep recalling my previous experiences during exams, and it brings back memories of the stress I felt. I worry about not doing well again.

Consultant: It sounds like those past experiences are casting a shadow on how you view your current situation. Let’s explore those feelings. What kind of thoughts go through your mind when you remember those past exams?

User: I think about how I struggled to answer questions and how disappointed I was afterward. It makes me fear that it will happen again.

Consultant: That fear of disappointment is understandable, especially after having gone through that. It's vital to acknowledge those feelings. Have you noticed how these thoughts affect your emotions and behavior, like during study time?

User: Yes, when I start feeling anxious, I find it difficult to get started on my study plan. Sometimes I just avoid it altogether.

Consultant: Avoiding study might feel like a temporary relief, but it can also increase anxiety later. Let’s brainstorm together—what could help you manage that anxiety to make studying less daunting?

User: I think if I could manage my anxiety better, I might be able to focus more on my studies. Maybe some exercises or techniques could help?

Consultant: Absolutely! There are various techniques we can try. How about we start with some relaxation methods, like deep breathing? Have you tried that before?

User: I haven't really tried deep breathing. I’ve heard about it but never took it seriously.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a simple yet effective method. It can help calm your mind when you're feeling anxious. Want to give it a try together right now?

User: Sure, that sounds okay. What should I do?

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a comfortable seat. Now, close your eyes gently, and take a deep breath in through your nose, filling your belly with air. (pause for a moment) Hold it for a moment, now slowly release the breath through your mouth. Let’s do that a few times together.

User: (follows along) Okay, I feel a bit calmer now. It’s nice to take a moment like this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! This kind of practice can help you in stressful situations like exams. How do you feel about incorporating deep breathing into your study routine?

User: I think that could actually help! I can take breaks to do it if I feel too stressed.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Besides breathing exercises, what else do you think could support you in your preparation for the exams?

User: Maybe I can set shorter study goals for each day? Like manageable chunks, instead of trying to cover too much at once.

Consultant: Yes, breaking tasks into smaller, achievable goals can indeed reduce overwhelm. How about we work on a study schedule together that includes those shorter goals?

User: I’d like that! It would help me stay organized and hopefully reduce my anxiety.

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s divide your study topics into daily tasks. How many days do you have until your exams?

User: I have about two weeks left.

Consultant: Perfect! We can split the subjects over those days. Which subjects are you most concerned about?

User: Math and Chemistry. They have always been tough for me.

Consultant: Let’s allocate more time for those subjects in your schedule. How many hours can you commit to studying each day?

User: I can dedicate about three hours a day.

Consultant: That’s a good amount! We can distribute your study hours across different subjects. Would you consider reviewing Math in the morning when your mind is fresher and Chemistry in the afternoon?

User: I think that would work well! I often feel more alert in the morning.

Consultant: Great! Remember to also include small breaks and a little time for deep breathing between subjects. How does that sound for your plan?

User: It sounds really good! I feel more confident about studying now.

Consultant: I’m so pleased to hear that! You’re already taking steps towards managing your anxiety better. Remember, it’s also okay to reach out if you feel overwhelmed. 

User: Thanks, I appreciate that. I feel like I have some strategies now.

Consultant: Absolutely! As we wrap up today, let’s reflect quickly. What do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I think learning to breathe and setting a clear study plan are my biggest takeaways. I feel more equipped to tackle the exams now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! You’ve made great progress today. If you encounter challenges, remember these strategies we've discussed. You’re doing great, Xiaoning. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome. I believe in you! If you need any more support, don't hesitate to come back. Good luck with your studies!

User: Thanks! I will. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoning! I'm glad to see you back for another session. It sounds like you've made some progress with your social interactions. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I've been trying to talk more with my classmates during group activities, but sometimes I still feel nervous about sharing my thoughts.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're engaging more with your classmates! Feeling nervous can be completely normal, especially when you're stepping out of your comfort zone. Can you tell me more about what makes you feel nervous when sharing your thoughts?

User: I guess I worry that my ideas aren’t good enough and that people will judge me. Sometimes, I just freeze and don’t know what to say.

Consultant: That sounds tough, feeling like your ideas might not be valued can make it harder to speak up. Let's explore this further—what type of judgments do you fear others might have about your ideas?

User: I’m afraid they might think I’m not smart or that I don’t understand the topic well enough. It makes me hesitate to speak up.

Consultant: I understand that fear of judgment can weigh heavily on you. It's understandable to want to be perceived positively. In those moments when you feel hesitant, what thoughts come to your mind? 

User: Often, I think things like "What if I'm wrong?" or "Why would anyone care about what I think?" 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite challenging. It's important to notice how they can affect your willingness to share. Let's examine those thoughts—what evidence do you have that supports or contradicts these beliefs about your contributions?

User: I suppose sometimes my classmates actually respond positively to my ideas, and we've had good discussions. But I'm usually stuck thinking of the worst-case scenarios.

Consultant: It sounds like you have some positive experiences that contradict those anxious thoughts. What might happen if you tried to focus on those positive experiences instead when you feel nervous?

User: Maybe I could feel more confident and remind myself that I have something valuable to share. But it’s hard to switch that mindset in the moment.

Consultant: It's definitely a practice to shift those thoughts. How about we work on creating some alternative thoughts you can use? For example, instead of "What if I'm wrong?" you might say, "It's okay to share my thinking; I can learn from this." How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds helpful! I could remind myself that contributing is a learning process rather than a test.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on learning rather than perfection can ease the pressure. Let's role-play a situation where you might share an idea. I’ll act as a classmate—what would you want to say?

User: Okay, let’s try it. I might say, "I think we could approach this problem by considering...".

Consultant: Great start! Now, I’ll respond as if I’m a classmate. "That’s an interesting idea, Xiaoning! Can you explain a bit more about that?"

User: I could respond with, "Sure! I thought about it because...". 

Consultant: That’s excellent! You're already practicing how to articulate your thoughts. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt a bit scary but also exciting! I think I could get used to this.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Remember, every small step forward counts. Before you know it, sharing your thoughts will become easier. How else can you practice this outside our sessions?

User: I can try to contribute more during group projects and even during casual conversations with friends. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic plan! Regular practice in different contexts will help build your confidence. What specific situations or opportunities do you have coming up soon where you might be able to practice?

User: We have a group assignment next week, and I’ll be working with a few classmates. 

Consultant: Perfect! That's a great opportunity for you. Remember to focus on sharing your input and noticing any positive responses. How will you remind yourself to use those alternative thoughts we've been discussing during that assignment?

User: Maybe I can write them down and keep them nearby while we work together.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Having a reminder can help reinforce your new mindset. As we wrap up today, what key takeaway do you feel is most important for you moving forward?

User: I think the most important takeaway is to focus on sharing without being too hard on myself. Also, using alternative thoughts to challenge my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! You’re making significant strides in your journey toward building confidence. As you face challenges, remember your progress, and keep practicing those new strategies. We will meet again to review how it went and continue working on this. You’ve got this!

User: Thank you! I appreciate the help, and I’m looking forward to trying this out.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaoning! I'm proud of your hard work today. We’ll touch base soon, and I’m excited to hear about your experiences. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ning! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. After getting praise from my teacher in class, I feel more confident about my abilities. But I also worry that this boost might not last.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more confident! That praise must have been very encouraging for you. Let's talk about your concerns. What do you think might happen that would make that confidence fade away?

User: I'm worried that once the exams come, I might revert to my old self-doubt. I sometimes feel overwhelmed when I have to study for multiple subjects.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. It’s common to feel anxious about upcoming challenges. Can you tell me more about those moments of overwhelm? What thoughts go through your mind when you're studying for multiple subjects?

User: I often think that I won’t perform well, or that I’ll forget everything I studied. It makes me want to avoid studying altogether.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy, and I can see how they could lead to wanting to avoid studying. Let's take a moment to examine those thoughts. When you think, “I won't perform well,” how does that make you feel emotionally?

User: It makes me feel anxious and kind of hopeless. Like I'm stuck in a cycle of negativity.

Consultant: It’s tough when negative thoughts create a cycle of anxiety. What if we tried to challenge that thought together? What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts the idea that you won't perform well?

User: Well, I did get good marks in some practice tests, and the teacher's compliment shows that I can do well. But I still can't shake off the fear of failing.

Consultant: That’s a great observation! You have evidence of your abilities. Let’s remember those positive experiences and think of them as proof that you can succeed. What alternative thought could you replace “I won’t perform well” with?

User: Maybe I can think, “I have prepared well and I am capable.” 

Consultant: That sounds like a much more empowering thought! How might that change your feelings when you sit down to study?

User: I think it would make me feel calmer and give me a little more motivation to start studying. 

Consultant: Excellent! It’s all about shifting your mindset to a more positive frame. Now, let’s talk about setting small goals for your study sessions. What kind of goals could help you stay on track while also boosting that confidence?

User: I could set a goal to study for just 25 minutes at a time and then take a short break.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Breaks can really help maintain your focus. How do you feel about implementing this new study strategy for the next week?

User: I think I can manage that! I’ll try to stick to studying for 25 minutes and then taking breaks.

Consultant: That's great to hear! As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on how you’ve progressed and how you can maintain that confidence moving forward. What do you see as your biggest achievement since we started this journey?

User: I think it's recognizing that I can do well in my studies, especially after the feedback from my teacher. It feels good to see that.

Consultant: That's such a powerful realization! Keeping that in mind will be important as you approach your exams. How will you remind yourself of this achievement in the future?

User: I can write it down and read it whenever I'm feeling doubtful. 

Consultant: That's an excellent strategy! Writing it down makes it tangible and reinforces that positive feeling. Remember, you've built up skills to manage these feelings, and I believe you can continue to grow. As we conclude our sessions for now, know that you have the tools to cope with challenges. If you ever need support in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you! I appreciate everything we’ve worked on together. I feel more ready to face my exams now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Ning! I'm proud of the progress you’ve made. Keep believing in yourself, and I wish you all the best with your upcoming exams!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ning! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling a lot better. My class ranking has improved recently, and I've become more positive about the upcoming college entrance exams.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some significant progress. Can you tell me more about how you feel regarding the upcoming exams now?

User: I feel more confident. I think my study habits are improving, and I'm pushing through my study plan more consistently. But sometimes I still get a bit anxious.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re feeling more confident and finding a rhythm in your studies. Can you describe what kind of situations or thoughts trigger your anxiety lately?

User: Sometimes, when I think about the possibility of failing or not doing well, it makes me really nervous, especially during practice tests.

Consultant: I can understand how thinking about the possibility of not doing well can create a lot of anxiety. When those thoughts come up during practice tests, how do you feel physically and emotionally?

User: I usually feel my heart racing and a tightness in my chest. Emotionally, I just feel overwhelmed and worried.

Consultant: That sounds very uncomfortable. It seems like those thoughts impact your body and emotions. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit more. What specific thoughts go through your mind when you're feeling that anxiety?

User: I often think, “What if I don’t get the scores I need?” or “What if my improvement isn’t enough?”

Consultant: Both of those thoughts can definitely increase your anxiety. Let's look at those ideas together. How likely do you think it is that you won’t get the scores you need based on the work you’ve put in?

User: I guess it’s not very likely since I’ve been improving, but my mind still goes there sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a very important realization. Your improvement is a strong indicator of your potential success. How might you challenge that anxious thought the next time it appears?

User: I could remind myself of the progress I've made and that I've been consistently studying. Perhaps I could also tell myself that it's okay not to be perfect.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reminding yourself of your progress and being kind to yourself can really help. How does thinking this way make you feel about your studies?

User: It makes me feel calmer and more in control. I can focus better instead of being overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s so encouraging to hear! As you prepare for the exams, let’s also talk about some strategies you can use if you feel that anxiety creeping back in during your study sessions or tests.

User: Yes, I’d like that! I want to be prepared.

Consultant: Great! One approach could be creating a relaxation routine. This could include deep breathing or even taking short breaks. Have you tried anything like that before?

User: No, I haven’t really thought about that. I usually just keep pushing through my study sessions.

Consultant: That’s understandable, but taking breaks can actually enhance focus. What if we brainstorm some specific activities you could do during those breaks to help you relax?

User: I think some light stretching or maybe listening to music could work.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent options! Stretching can help reduce physical tension, and music can be a great mood booster. How do you feel about integrating these into your study routine?

User: I feel good about it! It seems manageable, and I like the idea of taking breaks.

Consultant: Perfect! We can also discuss other strategies for managing your time and maintaining balance as you study. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great. I want to make sure I’m not just studying all the time and actually enjoying some time off too.

Consultant: That’s a wise approach! Finding balance is key. What kinds of activities do you enjoy doing during your free time?

User: I like playing video games and hanging out with friends. It helps me unwind.

Consultant: Those are wonderful activities to relax and recharge! Would you be willing to schedule some time for these activities while also keeping up with your studies?

User: Yes, I think that would help me a lot. I can set specific times for studying and then reward myself with some gaming afterwards.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! By rewarding yourself with something you enjoy, it can motivate you to stick to your study goals. Let’s review your goals for the upcoming weeks to make sure you stay focused and balanced.

User: I want to make sure I stick to my study plan, remember to take breaks, and not get too anxious. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful goals! How will you remind yourself of these commitments as you prepare for exams?

User: Maybe I can write them down and put them on my desk. That way, I’ll see them every day.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Visual reminders can be very effective. How do you feel about our session today and the strategies we've discussed?

User: I feel much more prepared and less anxious. Thank you! I really appreciate your support.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’ve worked hard to reach this point, and your positive mindset will serve you well. Remember, you can always return for support if you need it. 

User: I will. Thank you for everything!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiao Ning! I wish you all the best as you prepare for your exams. You've got this!
