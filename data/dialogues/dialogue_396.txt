Consultant: Hello, Li Ming! I'm glad to see you today. I remember from our last session that you've been feeling anxious and down due to your recent job loss. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling even more anxious. I've had a few interviews, but I didn't get the jobs, which just reinforces that I'm not good enough. I'm also struggling to connect with people; I feel really isolated.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that things have been tough for you. It sounds like the struggle with job interviews and connecting with others has made you feel even more uncertain about yourself. Can you tell me more about the thoughts or feelings that come up during those interviews?

User: Well, during the interviews, I keep telling myself that I'm going to mess up. I focus on all the things that could go wrong, and then I feel embarrassed afterward when I think about how I performed.

Consultant: It seems like those thoughts are quite negative and might be impacting how you see yourself. When you think about messing up, what specific feelings come up for you?

User: I feel really anxious, and sometimes I even feel nauseous. It makes me doubt my abilities more than I already do. 

Consultant: That sounds really overwhelming. Let's explore those anxious feelings further. When you think about the possibility of messing up, do you find yourself jumping to any extremes or making assumptions about the outcomes?

User: Yeah, I guess I assume that if I mess up, I won't get any job offers, and then I'll be stuck forever. 

Consultant: That's a significant assumption, and it can create a lot of pressure. What evidence do you have that supports this thought? Is there a chance that it might not be as catastrophic as it feels?

User: Well, I mean, there are lots of jobs out there, but I just keep thinking that I’m not fit for any of them.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially after facing rejection. However, it's also important to recognize that many candidates undergo multiple interviews before landing a job. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I think I would tell them not to take it personally and to keep trying. 

Consultant: That's a great perspective. It’s easier to be compassionate towards our friends than towards ourselves, isn’t it? What if you tried to apply that same kindness to your own situation? 

User: I see your point. I need to be a little nicer to myself, but it’s really hard to shift my mindset.

Consultant: It can definitely be challenging. How about we try a small experiment? In your next interview or social situation, try to remind yourself of your strengths and the qualities that make you a good candidate. What do you think?

User: I could give that a shot, but I'm worried I'll forget in the moment.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Perhaps you can jot down a few affirmations or strengths on a card and keep it with you. You can glance at it before the interview to remind yourself. What strengths would you like to include?

User: I would put down that I have strong communication skills and that I'm adaptable. 

Consultant: Those are excellent strengths to have! Remembering those can help mitigate some of the negativity during those situations. Let’s also talk about how you’ve been connecting with others. Has it been difficult to reach out to friends or family?

User: Yes, I haven't reached out to anyone. I just feel like I don’t want to bother people with my problems.

Consultant: That’s a common feeling. However, opening up to someone can help relieve some of the burdens you're carrying. What do you think about reaching out to someone this week, even just for a casual chat?

User: I could try. There's a friend I haven't spoken to in a while. Maybe I can send them a message.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan! Connecting with someone might help you gain a different perspective and remind you that you're not alone in this. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think I could do it. 

Consultant: It’s okay to feel nervous. Just remember that taking that small step can lead to positive changes. What would be the first thing you’d like to say to your friend when you reach out?

User: I think I’d just start by asking how they’ve been and if they want to catch up.

Consultant: That’s a great start! It keeps things light and open-ended. As you begin to reconnect, you might find that it opens up new opportunities for support. How do you feel about your progress so far?

User: I feel a little optimistic. Maybe talking about this has helped a bit.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it's perfectly okay to take things one step at a time. Let's review what we've discussed today and how we can continue moving forward. You’re taking positive actions by identifying your thoughts, reaching out to friends, and planning to remind yourself of your strengths. How do you feel about these strategies?

User: I feel hopeful that they might help. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear. Moving forward, continue to practice those strategies, and remember that it’s a process. If you find yourself struggling, don't hesitate to revisit these discussions. How are you feeling about our conversations so far?

User: I appreciate this, it helps me see things a bit differently. 

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that. Building confidence takes time, and you’re making significant strides. For our next session, let’s check in on how your outreach to your friend went and any new thoughts you may have had regarding interviews. Does that sound good?

User: Yes, that sounds great! Thank you for your help today.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Li Ming! I look forward to hearing about your progress. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. Take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li Ming! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty down. I just can’t shake off the disappointment from those recent job interviews. They went poorly, and I keep questioning if I'm cut out for this career.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re really struggling with feelings of disappointment and self-doubt right now. Can you share more about what specifically made you feel that way after the interviews?

User: Well, I thought I prepared well. But during the interviews, I stumbled over my words and completely blanked out when I was asked certain questions. It felt embarrassing, and now I think maybe I just wasn’t good enough.

Consultant: I can see how those experiences would leave you feeling embarrassed and questioning your abilities. Let’s explore what thoughts were going through your mind at that moment. What were the exact thoughts you had during the interviews?

User: I kept thinking, “I’m going to mess this up” and “I don’t think they’ll choose me.” Those thoughts were just racing through my head.

Consultant: It sounds like those negative thoughts really took over your mind. How did those thoughts make you feel emotionally during the interviews?

User: They made me feel really anxious and panicky. I felt like I couldn’t think straight.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Anxiety can cloud our thinking and make it difficult to perform at our best. Let’s try to identify how these thoughts might be distorting your perception of the situation. Would you say those thoughts are always accurate?

User: I guess not. I mean, I do have some experience and educational background. But because I failed, I just feel like I've lost everything.

Consultant: It’s good that you can recognize that there are other aspects to consider. What evidence do you have that suggests you are not capable or not worthy of a job?

User: I suppose there are some positive things in my past, like good grades in school and successful projects at work. But it feels like those don’t matter now.

Consultant: Those accomplishments absolutely matter, Li Ming. They indicate that you have the skills and potential. Could we explore a different way to view these failed interviews? What might you tell a friend if they experienced the same situation?

User: I’d probably tell them that it happens to everyone and that it doesn’t define their worth. They need to keep trying.

Consultant: Exactly! Can we use that perspective for yourself? Your worth isn’t defined by one or two unsuccessful interviews. Let’s focus on those skills and achievements you mentioned. How can we remind you of those strengths moving forward?

User: Maybe I could write down my accomplishments and remind myself of them before I go into any future interviews.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Creating a list of your successes can help reinforce your confidence. Now, let’s turn our focus toward communication. You mentioned wanting to improve your interaction with others. What specific skills do you feel you struggle with during these conversations?

User: I tend to forget what I want to say or say the wrong things, especially when I’m nervous.

Consultant: It’s common to feel that way when anxiety kicks in. We could work on some communication strategies. How about practicing responses to potential interview questions? This could build your confidence. What do you think?

User: That sounds helpful. Practicing might make me feel more prepared and less anxious.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s start with a common question like “Tell me about yourself.” How might you respond to that, based on your experiences?

User: I’d start with my education and then talk about my previous job and the projects I worked on.

Consultant: Great start! What if we refine that to highlight specific achievements and how they relate to the position you’re applying for? Would you like to give it a try?

User: Sure, I can give that a shot. I worked on a team project that improved sales by 20% last year, so I could mention that.

Consultant: That’s an excellent point to include! It shows tangible results. By focusing on achievements like this, you can present a strong case for yourself. Let’s keep practicing until you feel comfortable.

User: I appreciate this. I feel like I’m already seeing some light through the fog.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. As we move forward, let’s also address that feeling of isolation you mentioned. How do you typically feel in social situations, especially when talking to new people?

User: I feel really out of place and worry that they’ll judge me for stumbling over my words.

Consultant: It’s tough to feel that way. Let’s try to change that narrative. What would happen if you approached a conversation with curiosity instead of fear—maybe focus more on the other person?

User: I suppose that could take the pressure off me. I could ask them questions and genuinely listen.

Consultant: Exactly! Shifting the focus can relieve some pressure. This will also make conversations feel more interactive and enjoyable. What’s one small step you can take to practice this before our next session?

User: I could try to start small conversations with coworkers or neighbors, focusing on asking them about themselves.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan, Li Ming! Engaging in small talk can gradually build your confidence. How do you feel about that goal?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but excited at the same time. I think it’s a good step forward.

Consultant: That’s a positive sign! Embracing those mixed feelings is part of growth. Let’s summarize what we’ve worked on today and ensure you’re set for the coming weeks. What do you think your main takeaway is?

User: I think recognizing my strengths and practicing responses are key. Plus, shifting how I view social interactions will help a lot.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve made great insights today. Keep using your list of strengths and practice those communication skills. When challenges arise, remember this progress. You can always build from here.

User: Thank you for all the help today! I feel more equipped to handle the challenges ahead.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li Ming! I believe in your ability to manage these feelings and grow. Remember, if you ever need support again, I’m here for you. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li Ming! I'm glad you could join me today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I still feel anxious, especially in social situations. Since I lost my job, I feel even more out of place when I'm with friends.

Consultant: It sounds like the recent changes have heightened your anxiety during social interactions. Can you share a bit more about what specifically makes you feel uncomfortable in those situations?

User: I often feel like I don't know what to say, and I worry that others are judging me. It makes me feel isolated and unsure of myself.

Consultant: That feeling of isolation and self-doubt can be really tough to deal with. Let's explore this together. When you think about a recent social event, what thoughts ran through your mind during that experience?

User: I remember thinking that everyone was better than me and that I didn't belong. It just felt like I was invisible.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially during challenging moments. Those thoughts can create a cycle of anxiety. What emotions do those thoughts trigger for you?

User: I feel embarrassed and frustrated with myself. It's like I can't escape from those feelings.

Consultant: Those emotions can be overwhelming. Let's try to break this down a bit. When you think everyone is better than you, can you recognize if there's a specific belief or assumption that's supporting that thought?

User: I guess I assume they all have their lives figured out, while I'm just lost.

Consultant: That's a common assumption. Let's challenge that a little. Do you have any evidence that supports the idea that other people's lives are completely perfect or figured out?

User: Not really. I know everyone has their struggles, but in the moment, it’s hard to remember that.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Li Ming. It might help to remind yourself that everyone has their challenges, even if they aren't visible. If a friend were feeling this way, what would you say to them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has ups and downs and that they shouldn't be so hard on themselves.

Consultant: Exactly! You have that compassion for others. Now, how can you apply that same kindness to yourself in social situations?

User: Maybe I should try to remind myself of that during social gatherings. It might help reduce my anxiety.

Consultant: That sounds like a good strategy. Along with this, let's consider some practical steps. Is there a specific social scenario coming up where you'd like to practice these skills?

User: Yes, I'm meeting some friends this weekend. I'm nervous about it.

Consultant: Perfect! This is a great opportunity to apply what we've discussed. How about we brainstorm a few small steps you could take to feel more at ease during that gathering?

User: I could prepare some simple questions to ask them, so I don't feel pressured to come up with topics on the spot.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Preparing questions can help ease the pressure. What kind of questions do you think you could prepare?

User: Maybe I could ask them about their jobs or any recent activities they've been involved in.

Consultant: Those are relatable topics that could encourage a good conversation. What if you also allowed yourself to share a little about your experiences, even if they feel difficult to talk about?

User: I guess sharing a bit about my job situation could help. It might make me feel less alone.

Consultant: That's a brave step, Li Ming. Sharing personal challenges can foster deeper connections. How might this change your experience in social interactions?

User: It could make me feel more genuine and connected rather than just pretending everything is fine.

Consultant: Absolutely, and being authentic can often resonate with others. How do you feel about approaching your upcoming gathering with these strategies in mind?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful about it. It still scares me, but I think I can manage it better.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Before we wrap up today’s session, is there anything specific you want to set as a goal for this gathering?

User: I’d like to focus on just starting one meaningful conversation and not getting too anxious about it.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, Li Ming. As you work toward this, remind yourself that it's okay to experience some anxiety; it doesn't define you. How do you plan to reinforce that mindset?

User: I’ll try to remind myself of the things we talked about, like thinking of socializing as an opportunity rather than a threat.

Consultant: Great approach! Your perspective can change how you approach these situations. As we conclude today, reflect on what you’ve learned and consider ways to celebrate your efforts, no matter the outcome. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I feel a little more prepared now.

Consultant: You're welcome, Li Ming! I'm proud of the steps you're taking. Remember, it's a journey, and I'm here to support you. We can continue working through this together. Looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li Ming! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite anxious because of the skills retraining course. I'm worried about keeping up with the material and managing my time effectively.

Consultant: I understand you're experiencing anxiety related to this new learning pressure. Let's talk more about what exactly feels challenging for you right now. What aspects of the course do you find most difficult to manage?

User: I feel overwhelmed by the amount of information I need to absorb. Sometimes, it seems impossible to keep up, and I start doubting my ability to learn.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling a lot of pressure to perform and that’s creating self-doubt. Let’s explore the thoughts that come up for you during these moments. What thoughts are going through your mind when you feel overwhelmed?

User: I often think that if I don't master everything quickly, I won't find a good job. It's like I’m putting all this pressure on myself to excel.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. You're setting high expectations for yourself related to job security. Can you tell me how these thoughts make you feel emotionally when they arise?

User: They make me feel frustrated and anxious. I start to lose motivation and feel like giving up sometimes.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way given the pressure you’re under. Let's look at those thoughts more closely. Do you think there's evidence supporting the idea that you have to master everything right away to succeed?

User: I guess not really. People often say that learning takes time, but I just can’t shake off the fear of failing.

Consultant: It’s common to have that fear, but considering what you just said, it seems there might be a different perspective we can take. If a friend was in your shoes, what might you tell them about learning and handling pressure?

User: I would probably remind them that it's okay to take their time and that everybody learns at their own pace.

Consultant: Exactly! So, learning doesn't have to be a race. Let’s consider setting some smaller, achievable goals for your studies. What do you think might be a beneficial first step?

User: Maybe I could break down the material into smaller sections and focus on one section at a time instead of trying to learn everything at once.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! By breaking it down, you can reduce the overwhelm. How do you feel about setting a specific time each day to focus on just one section?

User: That could work. I think having a clear structure would help me feel more in control.

Consultant: I agree. Having a structure can provide a sense of control and accomplishment. Would you like to create a simple study schedule together for this week?

User: Yes, I’d really appreciate that! I think it would make it easier for me to stick to my goals.

Consultant: Great! Let’s outline a daily plan that includes small study sessions. We can also incorporate breaks to allow yourself some downtime. How does that sound?

User: That sounds perfect! I think I’ll really benefit from having some breaks in between. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Also, it could help to share this plan with a friend or family member for accountability. Do you have someone in mind who could support you in this way?

User: Yes, I have a friend who is also studying. I could ask him to check in with me regularly.

Consultant: That sounds like a supportive idea! Connecting with others can significantly reduce anxiety. How do you feel about reaching out for support?

User: I feel good about it! It’ll be nice to share this experience with someone who understands what I’m going through.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Li Ming. As we wrap up our session today, let's recap the strategies we've discussed. What key takeaways do you have regarding managing your learning pressure?

User: I need to break down the material, create a daily study schedule, take regular breaks, and reach out to my friend for support.

Consultant: Exactly! Those steps can help ease your anxiety and make learning more manageable. As you continue, remember to be kind to yourself and allow room for mistakes. How are you feeling about moving forward?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful now. I think I can handle this with a plan in place.

Consultant: That’s excellent to hear! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. I believe you have the ability to navigate this successfully. For our next session, we can discuss how it’s been going and make any necessary adjustments. 

User: Yes, I look forward to it. Thank you for your help today!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li Ming! Take care, and I believe in your ability to manage this journey. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li Ming! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve actually been feeling a bit better. I’ve met some new friends in the skills training course, and their support has really helped me feel more recognized. 

Consultant: That sounds encouraging! It’s great to hear that you’re experiencing a positive shift through your social connections. Can you tell me more about how their support has impacted your feelings?

User: Well, I don’t feel as alone anymore. When we share our experiences, it helps me see that I’m not the only one facing challenges. I sometimes feel a bit hopeful about the future now.

Consultant: It's wonderful to know that you’re feeling less isolated and that sharing experiences is bringing you some hope. What specific thoughts or feelings come up when you think about your future now?

User: I still feel uncertain about my career path since losing my job, but I try to focus on those small moments of connection with my friends. It makes me feel like I can manage things better.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel uncertain during times of transition. Focusing on those positive connections is a meaningful step. How can we build on this feeling of connection to help you navigate your future plans?

User: I think I need to keep nurturing these friendships. They give me a sense of belonging, which feels really important right now.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. How about we explore ways you can strengthen these friendships further? What actions could you take to deepen these connections?

User: Maybe I could invite them out more often or plan group activities. I feel like we enjoy each other's company, which can help us all.

Consultant: Those are great ideas! Planning group activities can foster further support. How does it feel when you think about taking these steps?

User: I feel excited but also a bit nervous. What if they don’t want to hang out or if I feel awkward initiating things?

Consultant: It’s natural to feel a bit anxious about reaching out. Let’s take a moment to identify those thoughts. What specific thoughts run through your mind that make you feel nervous about initiating these meet-ups?

User: I often think they might be too busy for me or that I shouldn’t bother them, you know?

Consultant: Those thoughts can really hold you back. Let's challenge those beliefs. Can we seek evidence for those thoughts? Have your friends indicated that they would be too busy for you?

User: No, actually. They've mentioned they enjoy spending time together. I guess I just worry about being a burden.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but it sounds like they value your company. What would you tell a friend who shared such a concern about reaching out?

User: I’d probably tell them that friends are there to support each other and that it’s okay to ask for time together.

Consultant: Exactly! You would encourage your friend to maintain those connections. So, how can you apply that same understanding to your situation?

User: I suppose I can remind myself that it's okay to reach out. I mean, everyone needs support from time to time. 

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset! It’s about balance and mutual support in friendships. What would be a small, manageable step you could take this week to reach out to them?

User: I could send them a message suggesting we meet up for coffee. It’s simple but might help me feel more connected.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect first step! How do you feel about making that invitation?

User: I’m feeling a bit more confident about it now. I think I can go for it!

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear, Li Ming! Confidence grows through action. How will you handle any nervous feelings that arise when you send that message?

User: I can remind myself that they enjoy my company, and that it’s okay to feel a bit nervous. Taking the step is what matters.

Consultant: Exactly! And it’s okay to acknowledge those nervous feelings. They don’t need to control your actions. After you send the message, how will you reflect on the outcome?

User: I’ll remind myself that taking the initiative was the win, regardless of their response. I need to focus on the positive actions rather than just the outcome.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Celebrating your proactive steps is key. As we wrap up today, is there anything else you’d like to discuss regarding your social connections or feelings about the future?

User: I think I’m good for now. I feel more motivated to reach out and keep building this support network.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s been a pleasure to see your progress. Don’t hesitate to share your experiences in our next session. You’ve made some excellent strides toward maintaining a positive outlook. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. I'm looking forward to our next meeting.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li Ming! Keep nurturing those connections, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li Ming! It’s great to see you for our session today. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi! I’ve actually been feeling quite good. I started my new job, and I really like the team atmosphere. It’s such a relief after being laid off.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful to hear! Transitioning into a new job can be quite a process. Can you share more about what specifically makes you feel good in your new role and team?

User: Well, my new coworkers are very supportive, and the projects actually align with my interests. I feel more motivated and engaged compared to my last job.

Consultant: It’s great that you’ve found supportive colleagues and engaging projects. How does this motivation impact your daily work routine?

User: I’ve noticed that I’m more productive and I actually look forward to going to work. It feels like I’m finally getting back on track.

Consultant: That’s an encouraging sign! Let’s talk about any potential challenges you might face in this new environment. Do you foresee anything that might cause you some stress?

User: I guess I’m still a bit anxious about fitting in fully and meeting the expectations of my new role. I’m worried about making mistakes or not living up to my colleagues.

Consultant: Those feelings are completely understandable, especially with a fresh start. Can you remember a specific situation where you felt this anxiety about fitting in or meeting expectations?

User: Yesterday, during a team meeting, I hesitated to share my ideas because I felt my suggestions might not be valued. I ended up just listening.

Consultant: It’s common to feel that way in new settings. What thoughts crossed your mind during that meeting that contributed to your hesitation?

User: I thought, “What if they think my ideas are silly?” or “What if I sound inexperienced?” 

Consultant: Those thoughts can certainly create pressure. Let’s explore those feelings a bit. Do you think there’s evidence that supports those thoughts, or could there be alternative perspectives?

User: I suppose my ideas aren’t silly; I've been in this industry for a while. But during the moment, the fear of judgment overwhelmed me. 

Consultant: That's an insightful realization, Li Ming. If a friend were in your shoes, how would you encourage them to think about their contributions in that meeting?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone brings unique perspectives and that they shouldn’t hold back. I’d remind them it’s a learning process.

Consultant: Exactly! You deserve to treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding. How can you remind yourself of that in future situations at work?

User: I think I could write down positive affirmations or remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes while learning.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Writing affirmations can help shift your mindset. Have you tried any coping strategies since you started your new job?

User: I’ve been keeping a diary, and it helps to reflect on my thoughts. I'm thinking of incorporating some mindfulness techniques too.

Consultant: Mindfulness can be a great tool to stay grounded in the moment. How about we develop a simple mindfulness practice you can use before meetings to help reduce that anxiety?

User: That sounds helpful. I could take a few deep breaths and focus on the present moment. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing deep breathing can ease anxiety. Let’s also consider setting some small goals for yourself in this new job, like contributing at least once in each meeting. What do you think?

User: I like that idea! Setting small goals will make it feel less overwhelming. I can definitely aim to share at least one thought in each meeting.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! It’s all about small steps to build your confidence. How does it feel to have this approach to work?

User: It feels reassuring. I believe taking small steps will help me gradually overcome my fears.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we continue, let’s reflect on some progress you’ve made since starting this role. What achievements are you proud of so far?

User: I was able to complete my initial tasks ahead of schedule, and I received positive feedback from my manager.

Consultant: That’s a significant accomplishment! Recognizing your successes is key to maintaining a positive outlook. What do you think will help you prevent any potential setbacks in the future?

User: I think maintaining open communication with my manager and colleagues will be crucial. I also need to remind myself to celebrate my successes.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Regular check-ins with your team can help you feel more integrated, and celebrating your wins reinforces positive behavior. 

User: Yes, I agree. I’m genuinely feeling optimistic about my future now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Li Ming! As we wrap up today, what are your key takeaways from our discussion? 

User: I’ve learned that I need to practice self-compassion and set small, manageable goals to boost my confidence at work.

Consultant: That's a wonderful insight! Remember, it’s a continuous journey, and you’re already making great strides. If challenges arise, you have tools to manage them.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate the support. I feel more equipped to handle things now.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that. This is our closing session for now, but you’ve learned so much. Remember that you can always reach out if you need support in the future. 

User: Thank you very much! I’ll definitely keep in mind everything we discussed.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care of yourself, and know that your progress is something to be proud of. Goodbye for now, Li Ming!

User: Goodbye!
