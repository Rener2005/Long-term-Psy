Consultant: Hi, Hang Hang! I'm glad to see you today. Before we dive into our discussions, I'd like to hear how you've been feeling since our last session. What’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. I've been thinking a lot about the argument I had with my classmates. Honestly, I don’t feel that bad about it. I think they just don’t understand me.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a bit disconnected from your classmates. Can you share more about what happened in that argument and what thoughts you had during that moment?

User: Well, they were making fun of me for something unrelated to school, and I just snapped. I didn't care how they felt. It felt good to stand up for myself, even if it caused drama.

Consultant: I see. It seems like that moment gave you a sense of empowerment. But it also seems to have contributed to feelings of isolation. How do you feel about these classmates overall? Do you think there’s a reason you don't feel understood by them?

User: I don't know, maybe I just don’t fit in with them. They seem to have their own little groups, and I don’t really connect with anybody. I feel like an outsider.

Consultant: Feeling like an outsider can be really tough, especially at school. If you could picture a scenario where you felt more connected with your classmates, what might that look like for you?

User: I guess it would be nice if we could just talk about things we all enjoy. But I don’t have much in common with them. I watch videos online that are totally different from what they like.

Consultant: It sounds like those differences contribute to your feeling of disconnection. What do you think those videos say about how you might cope with your feelings? Do they provide a source of comfort or escape for you?

User: Yeah, I think they do. I like watching them because it distracts me from feeling alone. But sometimes, I feel like it’s maybe not a healthy way to deal with things.

Consultant: It’s insightful of you to recognize that. While distracting ourselves can provide temporary relief, it's also important to address the underlying feelings. What emotions do you feel when you're watching those videos, and how do they affect your interactions at school?

User: I feel entertained and sometimes empowered, but then I go back to feeling lonely at school. It’s like a cycle. I don’t know how to break it.

Consultant: That cycle sounds quite frustrating. Recognizing it is the first step. Let's explore your feelings when you're with your classmates. Are there moments when you’ve felt a connection or any positive interactions, despite feeling generally isolated?

User: There was one time when a classmate shared a joke that I actually found funny. I laughed, and for a moment, it felt nice. But then I just went back to feeling like I didn't belong.

Consultant: It’s great that you had that moment of connection! It shows that there are opportunities for positive interactions, even if they are rare. What do you think you could do to create more of those moments and potentially connect better with your classmates?

User: Maybe I could try to find common interests. Like, if they’re into certain games or shows, I could try to engage in those conversations. But I’m not sure if I’d enjoy it.

Consultant: That’s a valid point. Exploring their interests could be a way to bridge that gap. It doesn't mean you have to completely change who you are, but it can help you find some common ground. How do you feel about gently trying this approach?

User: I guess I could give it a shot. I just don’t want to seem fake or like I’m forcing myself to fit in.

Consultant: I understand your concern. Authenticity is important, and you don’t have to change who you are. It's more about showing interest and being open to new experiences. What do you think would make you feel comfortable exploring these interactions?

User: Maybe if I just approach it like a way to know them better instead of trying to impress them. I could start small, like just asking about what they’re interested in.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful approach! Starting with genuine curiosity can help ease those interactions. How does that make you feel about engaging with your classmates moving forward?

User: It feels less daunting when I think of it that way. I actually might try talking to someone next time I see them.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Taking it one step at a time can really help. Let's also think about how you can manage feelings of loneliness when they arise. Do you have some strategies in mind to cope with those feelings, even if things don’t change right away?

User: Not really. I usually just swallow my feelings. But maybe I can find other activities I enjoy outside of school.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Engaging in activities you enjoy can provide a sense of fulfillment and distract you from loneliness. What kinds of activities do you think you could explore?

User: I like drawing and playing video games at home. I could look for clubs that do that kind of stuff. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Joining a club centered around your interests can not only make you feel more engaged but also help you meet like-minded people. How does that idea resonate with you?

User: That sounds good. I think I might feel more comfortable meeting people when we're doing something together.

Consultant: Absolutely, shared activities can create a more relaxed atmosphere for connecting. As you explore these changes, let’s also consider how you could reflect on your experiences. How will you know if these strategies are working for you?

User: I guess if I start feeling less alone or if I can talk to more classmates, that would be a good sign.

Consultant: Those sound like solid indicators. Always give yourself credit for every small step. How are you feeling about everything we've discussed today? 

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I have some ideas to try that might really help. 

Consultant: That's a tremendous shift! As we wrap up today's session, let's summarize the steps you've decided to take. You talked about finding common interests and exploring clubs related to your hobbies. How do you plan on keeping this hope alive as you move forward?

User: I’ll write down my goals and remind myself that it’s okay to take baby steps. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Remember, I’m here to support you whenever you need guidance again. You’ve made some great insights today, Hang Hang, and I believe you're on the right path.
###################
Consultant: Hi Hang Hang! I’m really glad to see you today. I know you've been feeling a bit isolated in your class activities. Can you share how you've been feeling about those activities since our last session?

User: Hi! I guess I’ve been avoiding participating. The class activities seem uninteresting to me, and I often feel like I don’t connect with my classmates.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling disconnected from the activities and your classmates, which can be tough. Can you tell me more about why the activities feel uninteresting to you?

User: Well, I think I just don’t share the same interests as them. They talk about stuff like sports and video games, but I’m not really into those. I just feel like an outsider.

Consultant: That must be really frustrating, feeling like you don't belong. Let’s explore this a bit. Are there any activities or topics that you enjoy and could share with them?

User: I like watching videos online, especially the funny ones. But I’m worried they won’t find it interesting.

Consultant: It's great that you have something you enjoy! Sharing your interests might actually help you connect with others. Have you thought about how you could introduce your interests in a way that might engage them?

User: I haven’t really thought about it. I just feel shy about suggesting things because I think they’ll just ignore me.

Consultant: I understand that feeling of shyness. It's common to worry about being ignored. What if we brainstorm some ways you could bring up your interests casually, maybe during a break or group activity?

User: Maybe I could mention a funny video I saw and see if anyone has watched it too? I guess that could work.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! It opens the door to a conversation. How do you feel about trying that out the next time you’re with your classmates?

User: I think I could try that. It sounds a bit less intimidating.

Consultant: That's a positive step forward! Let’s also think about how to build your confidence further. What kind of support do you think you need from me or others to feel more comfortable in these situations?

User: I guess I’d need some practice or tips on how to start conversations, especially since I’m not used to it.

Consultant: Absolutely, practicing can help a lot! We can role-play a conversation where you introduce your interests to a classmate. How does that sound to you?

User: I think that would help! I can see how that would make it easier.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s start with a scenario where you approach a classmate. You could say something like, "Hey, have you seen any funny videos recently?" How would that feel to say?

User: It sounds okay. I just hope they don’t think it’s silly.

Consultant: It's natural to worry about how others perceive us, but remember, everyone has their interests. If they don't respond as you hope, it doesn’t reflect your worth. How does that realization make you feel?

User: I suppose it gives me a bit of confidence. I just need to remind myself that not everyone will think it's silly.

Consultant: That's a good mindset to adopt! Confidence often comes from accepting that not everyone will react the same way. How about we prepare for some other responses you might get?

User: That could be helpful. What if they do laugh at my suggestion?

Consultant: If they laugh, you could remember it’s okay to laugh along as well; humor can be a great way to bond. You might say, "I guess it’s not everyone’s cup of tea!" This shows you’re light-hearted about it. What do you think?

User: That sounds good! It feels less pressured like that.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we prepare for this, let’s also think about your feelings at home. You mentioned a slight improvement there. How have things been going with your family?

User: Well, they seem to be trying a bit more to include me, but I still feel uncertain about it. I hope it lasts.

Consultant: It's positive to hear you're noticing their efforts. What specific actions have you seen from them that make you feel this way?

User: They’ve started asking about my day more often and listen when I talk about school.

Consultant: That’s significant! Engaging in conversations is a great way to build connection. How do you feel about sharing your thoughts on school with them further?

User: I think it would be nice. Sometimes I feel like they don’t really know what’s going on with me.

Consultant: It’s understandable to want them to know you better. Could you come up with some questions you might ask them to promote that conversation?

User: Maybe I could ask them about their work and share how I’m doing at school. That might start something.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic approach! Sharing your experiences while showing interest in theirs can really strengthen your bond. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I’d feel more comfortable knowing I’m also interested in their lives. It sounds good!

Consultant: Wonderful! Combining both parts can foster understanding and connection. Remember, it’s about building a two-way street in communication. Before we wrap up, what strategies will you take away to build your confidence at school and with your family?

User: I’ll try to suggest my interest in funny videos and also ask my parents about their day while sharing mine.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! It seems you're on the right path to connecting more both socially and with your family. Just remember, take it step by step. What are you feeling right now after our discussion?

User: I feel hopeful! I think I have some ideas to try out, and it doesn’t sound as scary anymore.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Hang Hang! You’ve made great progress today. Just remember that it's a journey, and each small step counts. I'm here to support you whenever you need.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Hang Hang! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! Well, I think there's been a slight improvement in how my parents respond to me. They seemed to understand my feelings during the family gathering, but I still wonder if it will last. 

Consultant: It's nice to hear that you felt some improvement in your relationship with your parents. Can you tell me more about what specifically made you feel that way during the gathering?

User: They listened to me when I expressed my disappointment about their attention. For the first time, it felt like they actually cared about what I said.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant step! Feeling heard by your parents can be really comforting. What would you like to see happen next to maintain this communication with them?

User: I hope we can talk like that more often. I want to express how I feel without fear of being criticized or ignored.

Consultant: That's a great goal, and expressing your feelings is important for building trust. How comfortable do you feel about talking openly with your parents right now?

User: Still a bit nervous. I don't want to push them away or make them angry again.

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel nervous about these conversations, especially when you've had difficult experiences. What if we practiced some ways to express your feelings in a way that feels safe for you?

User: That could help, I think. I'm just not sure how to start those conversations.

Consultant: Let's use an example. Imagine a situation where you feel neglected. How might you describe your feelings without blaming them?

User: I guess I could say something like, "I feel sad when I don't get to spend time with you," instead of saying they're ignoring me.

Consultant: That's a wonderful approach! It focuses on your feelings rather than placing blame. How do you feel about stating your feelings in this way?

User: It sounds easier, but I still worry about their reaction.

Consultant: I understand. You want to be honest but also protect your relationship. What if we brainstorm a few specific phrases you could use when you talk to them?

User: Like what?

Consultant: For example, you might say, "I really enjoy our time together, and I miss it." This way, you're expressing a desire for connection rather than focusing on what’s lacking.

User: I like that! It feels positive.

Consultant: Good to hear! Focusing on positivity can help foster a more open dialogue. Would you feel comfortable using this kind of language next time you talk to your parents?

User: I might try it. It seems safer than just saying I’m upset.

Consultant: Exactly! It's a constructive way to share your feelings without it feeling confrontational. What other situations do you think might come up where you could use this approach?

User: I often feel left out when they focus on the baby. I think it would help to talk about that too.

Consultant: That's an important topic to discuss. Using the same positive language, you might say, “I feel left out when we focus a lot on the baby. I’d love to share some time together as a family.” How does that sound?

User: I can try saying that. It feels a bit vulnerable, but I want to try.

Consultant: It’s definitely a step outside your comfort zone, but that’s how we grow. What kind of support would you like from me as you prepare for this conversation?

User: Maybe you could help me role-play it so I can practice?

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s role-play a scenario where you share your feelings. You can start with the phrase we discussed, and I will respond as if I were your parent.

User: Okay, here goes. “I feel left out when we focus a lot on the baby. I’d love to share some time together as a family.”

Consultant (as parent): "Oh, I didn't know you felt that way, Hang Hang. We can definitely plan some family time. What would you like to do?"

User: Um, I think I would say, “Maybe we could play a game together?”

Consultant (as parent): "That sounds great! Let’s set up a game night this weekend."

User: That feels nice! They sound supportive!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It shows that you can encourage positive responses through your approach. How did practicing feel for you?

User: It made me feel more confident. I think I can do this.

Consultant: That’s excellent!Confidence is key. What else can we do in our remaining time today to further enhance your feelings of readiness for these conversations?

User: Maybe we could talk about how to keep the conversation going if they have questions.

Consultant: Definitely! If they ask questions, it’s a great opportunity to explain your feelings more. For example, you can say, “I appreciate your questions, and I feel this way because…” 

User: That sounds helpful. I’ll keep that in mind!

Consultant: Perfect! It seems like you’re developing some great strategies for communication. As we wrap up, how do you feel about what we’ve worked on today?

User: I feel more prepared to talk to my parents and express my feelings. It seems less scary now!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You’ve made significant progress today. Remember, you’re building a stronger connection with your parents, and it’s okay to express how you feel. How do you envision using what you’ve learned in future conversations?

User: I think I can use these phrases and keep it positive. I really want to keep improving my family’s relationship.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! You’ve developed a solid foundation, and I’m proud of how far you’ve come. Remember, practice makes perfect. If you need further support, don’t hesitate to reach out. You’ve got this!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help a lot.

Consultant: It’s been a pleasure working with you today, Hang Hang. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time we meet!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Hang Hang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, especially with your participation in the club activities?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good. Joining the club has been a positive change for me. I'm starting to enjoy interacting with my classmates more.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Being in a setting where you can interact more with others can really make a difference. Can you tell me more about what you enjoy about the club activities?

User: I really like the projects we do together. We collaborate and share ideas. It feels good to contribute and be part of a team.

Consultant: It sounds like you're finding a sense of belonging in the group. How does being part of the team make you feel about yourself?

User: I feel more accepted and valued, which is nice. I think I can share my thoughts better than before.

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress! It seems like your confidence is growing. What specific achievements in the club have made you feel proud?

User: I helped organize a small event last week. It was nerve-wracking, but it turned out well, and my classmates said they appreciated my effort.

Consultant: Organizing an event is a significant accomplishment! How did that experience impact your feelings about other school activities or social interactions?

User: I think it encouraged me to participate even more. I want to be more involved and meet new friends.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset to have! Setting that intention to meet new people can open up more opportunities. What are some specific goals you have in mind for expanding your social circle?

User: I'd like to join more clubs and maybe even invite some classmates to hang out after school. I think it would be fun.

Consultant: Inviting classmates and joining more clubs can be exciting! It sounds like you’re ready for new experiences. How do you think you can prepare yourself for those invitations or new interactions?

User: I guess I could practice what to say and try to be more open. Sometimes I'm worried that no one will want to hang out with me.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel that way, but remember, your recent experiences show that you're valued by your peers. What are some ways you could challenge that worry before it holds you back?

User: Maybe I could remind myself of the positive feedback I received from my classmates about the event I organized.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflecting on that positive feedback is a powerful strategy. It can help you see that people appreciate your contributions. How do you feel about using that approach when you're in social situations?

User: I feel more confident thinking about it. It makes me realize that I do have something to offer.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! Building on that confidence is key. What small steps will you take this week to reinforce that feeling and connect with others?

User: I plan to ask a few classmates about joining the basketball club this Friday. I really like basketball, and I think it’d be fun to play together.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Engaging in activities you enjoy can really help foster connections. What do you hope to achieve by participating in the basketball club?

User: I hope to make new friends and get better at basketball. It interests me, and I think playing together can help.

Consultant: Those are wonderful goals! Making friends while doing something you love is a great approach. If you face any challenges this week, how can you remind yourself of your strengths and achievements?

User: I'll keep a journal of my experiences and the good things I’ve done. I can look back on them whenever I feel uncertain.

Consultant: Keeping a journal is a brilliant way to reflect on your progress. It will help you see just how far you've come. How do you feel about the journey you're on now?

User: I feel really good about it! I'm excited to see where these new friendships and activities will lead.

Consultant: That’s an incredible outlook, Hang Hang! As we wrap up, let’s take a moment to reflect on all the progress you’ve made. What do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our sessions?

User: I think it’s realizing my worth and the value I bring to others. I feel more optimistic about connecting with people.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway! Remember, the skills you’ve developed will serve you well as you move forward. What are some ways you can maintain this positive mindset?

User: I’ll keep reminding myself of my successes and practice being open to new experiences.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan. It’s been inspiring to see your growth. As we conclude our time together today, know that you have the tools to manage your emotions and take on new challenges. Remember, if you need support in the future, you’re always welcome back.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help and guidance. It has made a big difference for me.
###################
Consultant: Hi there, Hang Hang! I'm really glad to see you today. How are you feeling about things lately, especially after the recognition you received from the club teacher?

User: Hi! I'm feeling really good, actually. Getting that praise made me so happy and gave me a boost in my confidence. I never thought I could be a role model for others.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like that recognition has significantly uplifted your self-esteem. What aspects of your experience did you feel contributed most to that success?

User: I think it was because I participated actively in the activities and tried to help my teammates. I also felt more comfortable speaking up and sharing ideas.

Consultant: It seems like your willingness to engage and support your teammates played a crucial role. How do you think you can carry this sense of confidence and achievement into your studies and social interactions outside the club?

User: I want to try to be more proactive in class and maybe join more activities. But sometimes I still feel nervous talking to my classmates.

Consultant: Acknowledging that nervousness is important. Can you think back to a moment in the club where you felt nervous but still succeeded? What helped you overcome that anxiety?

User: Yes, during one of the presentations, I was really anxious. But I just focused on the topic and tried to ignore everyone else. I think focusing on what I was saying helped a lot.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Hang Hang! Focusing on the task at hand can really help reduce anxiety. Could you apply that same strategy in class or when approaching new social situations? 

User: I think I could try that. Just focusing on what I have to say and not worrying so much about what others think.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s all about shifting your focus. What are some specific situations in school where you’d like to apply this approach?

User: Maybe during group discussions or when I want to ask a question. I usually just keep quiet because I'm worried.

Consultant: That’s a perfect example. For those group discussions, how about setting a small goal for yourself? Perhaps aim to contribute at least one idea per session?

User: That could work! If I just think of one thing to say, it might be easier to start.

Consultant: Absolutely! Setting manageable goals makes it less overwhelming. How do you feel about making that commitment to yourself?

User: I’m feeling optimistic about it. I want to build on this confidence I've gained.

Consultant: That's a wonderful attitude! Reflecting on your achievements will help you recognize your strengths. Let's consider another way to consolidate this. Do you have any other areas where you feel you would like to grow?

User: I'd like to be more confident making new friends. It’s hard to approach people I don’t know well.

Consultant: Making new friends can be daunting, but it sounds like increasing your confidence is key. What are some steps you could take to introduce yourself in a relaxed way?

User: Maybe I could start with a simple greeting or compliment when I see someone I want to talk to.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Simple interactions can lead to more significant conversations. What would be a small, practical step you could take this week towards meeting someone new?

User: I can try to say hi to a classmate I haven’t talked to yet. Maybe in the hallway or during lunch.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan, Hang Hang! Taking that initiative will definitely help. How do you think you’ll feel after doing that?

User: I think I’ll feel proud of myself. It might be scary at first, but it’s a step forward.

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing your bravery in taking that step is so important. Now, as we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what we've discussed. What do you feel are the key takeaways for you from this session?

User: I think I learned how to focus on what I'm saying and set small goals for myself. Plus, I should remember my successes in the club as a boost for other areas in my life.

Consultant: Those are fantastic insights, Hang Hang! You’ve made significant progress here today. As you continue to build on your achievements, how do you see yourself maintaining this momentum in the future?

User: I’ll keep reminding myself of my achievements and push myself to take small steps toward being more social.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! And remember, it’s perfectly okay to feel a bit nervous. Just take it one day at a time. If you ever need to revisit our conversations, I’m always here for you.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support and guidance. I feel more confident now!

Consultant: You’re welcome, Hang Hang! I’m really glad to see you feeling more confident. Keep going with your goals, and know that you have the skills to adapt. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. 

User: I will! Thank you for everything!
