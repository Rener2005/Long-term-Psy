Consultant: Hello, Ms. Zhang! I’m glad you’re here today. How are you feeling right now regarding the situation with your children and the hearing?

User: Hi. Honestly, I feel really anxious and confused about everything. The pressure to show that I'm capable of getting my kids back is overwhelming.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of pressure and uncertainty. Can you tell me more about what's been going through your mind as you prepare for the hearing?

User: I keep thinking that if I don’t perform perfectly, I might not get the chance to have my kids back. It’s terrifying to think that my past mistakes could define my future.

Consultant: That’s understandable. The fear of your past impacting your future can be really distressing. What specific thoughts come to mind that contribute to this anxiety?

User: I often remind myself of the times I struggled with alcohol and managing my emotions. I think they’ll see me as unfit, no matter how hard I try now.

Consultant: It sounds like you have some strong negative beliefs about how others see you. Can you tell me how those beliefs make you feel in terms of your anxiety?

User: They make me feel hopeless and like I'm already failing before I even start. It’s like I'm stuck in a cycle of worry and fear.

Consultant: Let’s explore those feelings a bit more. When you think about feeling hopeless and stuck, what physical sensations do you experience? 

User: My heart races, and I feel this tightness in my chest. Sometimes, I just want to avoid everything because it feels too much to handle.

Consultant: I see. It seems like your body is reacting strongly to those feelings. When you feel that tightness or the urge to avoid, do you notice any specific thoughts that accompany those sensations?

User: I think a lot about how I can’t do this, that I'm not strong enough or smart enough to change things.

Consultant: Those thoughts are quite harsh and can definitely add to your anxiety. Let’s try to challenge those. What evidence do you have that you are not strong enough or smart enough?

User: I guess I don’t really have evidence. It just feels that way because of what I've been through.

Consultant: That’s a crucial insight! It’s often our feelings that distort our thoughts. How would you feel if you replaced those thoughts with something more compassionate, like recognizing some of the progress you’ve made?

User: I think it would help, but it’s hard to change the way I feel about myself sometimes.

Consultant: Absolutely, changing those thoughts takes practice. What if we worked on acknowledging your efforts instead of focusing solely on the mistakes? How might that shift your perspective?

User: I guess if I could focus on my recovery and what I’ve done to improve, it might ease some of my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization. Let’s think of a few things you’ve accomplished recently, no matter how small. What comes to mind?

User: Well, I’ve been attending support groups regularly, and I haven’t had a drink in over six months.

Consultant: That’s incredible! Those are significant achievements. How do you feel about recognizing these positive steps you’ve taken?

User: It makes me feel a little more hopeful. Maybe I can use that strength to face the hearing.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on your strength can help build your confidence. What can we do to ensure you carry that sense of hope into the hearing?

User: I could remind myself of my improvements and maybe even make a list of positive affirmations to read before the hearing.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea, Ms. Zhang. Having a list of affirmations can be a powerful tool. How about we work on crafting a few together right now?

User: Sure! I think something like "I am capable of change" would be a good start.

Consultant: That’s a great affirmation! Let’s add more—how about “I deserve a second chance” or “I am making progress every day”?

User: I like those! They resonate with me.

Consultant: Wonderful! We can create a few more that resonate with you. As you think about the hearing, keep these affirmations in mind to help manage that anxiety. 

User: I will. I can see how focusing on these can change my mindset up until the hearing.

Consultant: I believe so too. This shift in thinking can empower you. Let’s discuss how we can maintain this focus as the hearing approaches. 

User: I could set reminders on my phone to read these affirmations regularly and maybe practice some deep breathing to calm my nerves.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Deep breathing can be very effective. Would you like to practice a brief breathing exercise together now?

User: Yes, I would appreciate that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in for four seconds... hold for four... and exhale for four. Let’s do it together a few times.

User: Okay. In… hold… out… It feels nice to take a moment to breathe.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Ms. Zhang. Remember to use these techniques whenever you start feeling overwhelmed. How do you feel now after our session?

User: I feel a bit lighter and more hopeful. I still have worries, but I have tools to manage them.

Consultant: That's fantastic progress! Remember, it's okay to feel worried; what's important is how you respond to it. I'm proud of your willingness to work through this.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support and guidance.

Consultant: You're very welcome! We’ve made great strides today. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything before we meet again. 

User: I will. Thank you once again, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ms. Zhang! I'm really glad to see you today. I understand that you've been feeling quite anxious about the upcoming court hearing regarding your custody case. Can you share a bit more about what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. Yes, I’ve been feeling extremely anxious about the hearing. I'm really afraid that my past mistakes will come back to haunt me and affect the outcome. It's hard to focus on anything else.

Consultant: That sounds really overwhelming, and it's completely understandable to feel that way given the situation. It seems like there’s a lot of pressure on you right now. How do you think this anxiety is impacting your preparation for the hearing?

User: Well, I find it hard to concentrate when I try to prepare. I keep thinking about all the things that could go wrong and how I’m not good enough as a mother.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are really weighing you down. When those negative thoughts come up, what feelings do they bring with them?

User: I feel hopeless and defeated. I start to doubt if I can be the kind of mother my child needs.

Consultant: Those feelings must be really tough to carry around. It seems like you're stuck in a cycle of thinking negatively about yourself. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit more. You mentioned feeling like you’re not good enough—can you tell me what specifically makes you feel that way?

User: I’ve made mistakes in the past with my drinking and emotions. Sometimes I just think, "How can I possibly be trusted to care for my child?"

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Zhang. It’s important to recognize those feelings, but I also want to challenge the idea that your past defines your abilities as a mother. What evidence do you have that supports a different perspective or a more positive view of your parenting?

User: I do try my best every day to be there for my child. I love my child and I've stopped drinking. I want to be better.

Consultant: That's a great start! You’re showing dedication and a desire to improve. Let’s focus on that progress. If a friend came to you with similar worries, what would you tell them about how they are doing as a parent?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that what matters is that they are trying to improve.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s easy to be harsh on ourselves, yet you provide such kindness and understanding to others. How might you apply that same understanding to your own situation?

User: I guess I can try to be more forgiving of myself for my past. It’s just really hard to change how I feel about myself.

Consultant: It’s definitely a process, and it takes time. What are some small steps you might take to start building a more positive view of yourself as a mother?

User: Maybe I could start focusing on the things I do well and set small goals to keep improving.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan. Setting small, achievable goals can boost your confidence. What’s one specific goal you can set for this week related to your relationship with your child?

User: I think I could plan a fun activity, like going to the park or doing a craft together. Something that allows us to bond more.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Spending quality time like that can strengthen your connection. How do you think you’ll feel after setting and accomplishing that goal?

User: I think it might help me feel closer to my child, and hopefully boost my confidence a little.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on building that relationship can bring about positive feelings. As we continue discussing this, is there anything else that would help you feel more prepared for the hearing?

User: I also feel I need more support, like some resources or classes to help me become a better parent.

Consultant: That’s a great insight. There are many resources available that can strengthen your parenting skills and boost your confidence. Would you be interested in exploring some parenting classes or resources that focus on building those skills?

User: Yes, I would definitely want that! I believe learning more would help.

Consultant: Perfect! Learning can empower you and provide additional tools for your parenting. As we start wrapping up our time today, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think I’ve realized that I need to be kinder to myself. Also, focusing on bonding with my child is important, and seeking help through classes is a good idea.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization, Ms. Zhang! Remember, you’re making strides forward by recognizing these areas. What strategies will you keep in mind moving forward to maintain this growth?

User: I’ll remind myself of my progress and that it’s okay to seek help. I also want to celebrate the small wins with my child as we go along.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. I believe you can apply these insights and continue to grow. Remember, if you need help in the future, you’re always welcome to come back. 

User: Thank you so much for your support! I feel more hopeful after this session.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Ms. Zhang! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time.

Consultant: Hello, Ms. Zhang! It's great to see you today. I'm excited to talk about your experiences in the parenting course. How are you feeling about it?

User: Hi! I'm feeling pretty good about it. I learned some useful techniques, and I really want to improve my relationship with my child. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Improving your relationship with your child is such an important goal. What specific techniques from the course stood out to you the most?

User: I found the techniques about positive reinforcement quite interesting. I think they could really help encourage my child’s good behavior.

Consultant: Positive reinforcement can be very effective! It helps children feel appreciated and motivated. How do you envision using that with your child?

User: I can give praise whenever my child does something good, like when they help around the house or finish their homework.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Encouraging your child with praise can build their confidence and strengthen your bond. Have you had a chance to try any of these techniques since the course?

User: Not yet, honestly. I guess I feel a little overwhelmed with everything else happening in my life right now.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, especially as a single mother. Would you like to explore ways to make it easier to apply these techniques in your daily routine?

User: Yes, I think I need some help with that. I'm not sure where to start.

Consultant: Let's break it down into small, manageable steps. Perhaps you can set a specific time during the day to focus on positive interactions with your child. What time might work best for you?

User: Maybe during dinner? We usually have some time to talk then.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Dinner can be a great time for connection. You could start by sharing something positive about your child's day. How does that sound?

User: I like that idea! It would start our conversation on a good note.

Consultant: Absolutely! Setting a positive tone can really influence the rest of the conversation. What else do you think might help you feel more confident in using these techniques?

User: I guess practicing what to say would help. Sometimes I worry I won't say the right thing.

Consultant: Practice can definitely make a difference. Perhaps you could even role-play those scenarios in your mind. If a friend were in your position, how would you advise them to encourage their child?

User: I would tell them to just be genuine and show that they care. 

Consultant: Exactly! Approaching it with authenticity can create a warm atmosphere for your child. How do you feel about trying out those techniques next week during your dinners?

User: I’m feeling a bit nervous but also excited about it! I think it could really make a difference.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset! Feeling nervous can be normal, but it’s great that you’re excited. Remember, even small steps count as progress. If things don’t go perfectly at first, how might you remind yourself that it’s okay?

User: I guess I could tell myself that every effort counts and that I'm learning, just like my child is.

Consultant: Absolutely! That self-compassion is key, both for you and your child. Is there another area of parenting you'd like us to focus on today?

User: I would love to learn how to better manage my emotions when my child misbehaves. It’s so hard not to react.

Consultant: That's a great topic! Managing your emotions is crucial, especially in challenging moments. What usually goes through your mind when your child misbehaves?

User: I often feel frustrated and overwhelmed, which makes me reactive. I worry I'm not handling situations well.

Consultant: Valid feelings, Ms. Zhang. It’s common to feel that way. When those emotions arise, how do you currently cope with them?

User: Sometimes I raise my voice, which I know isn’t helpful. I just feel so stressed out.

Consultant: It’s understandable that stress can lead to those reactions. We can explore some strategies to manage that stress in the moment. Perhaps taking a few deep breaths before responding could help. What do you think?

User: That might work! I usually forget to breathe when I’m upset.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be an effective technique to regain a sense of calm. Would you like to practice a simple breathing exercise together now?

User: Yes, I'd like that!

Consultant: Great! Let’s try this: Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four… hold for a count of four… and exhale gently through your mouth for a count of four. Ready? 

User: Okay, let’s try it.

Consultant: Inhale… one, two, three, four… hold… one, two, three, four… and exhale… one, two, three, four. How did that feel?

User: It felt nice! I could feel my tension easing just a bit.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Incorporating this exercise during difficult moments can really help you feel more grounded. How confident do you feel about trying this next time you face a challenging situation with your child?

User: I feel more confident now that I have something to try.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Just remember, it’s a process. You’re learning and growing, and that’s what matters most. How do you envision yourself feeling after implementing these new strategies?

User: I hope to feel more in control and better about my parenting.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! Feeling in control can contribute to a more positive atmosphere for both you and your child. As we wrap up today, how are you feeling about what we discussed?

User: I’m feeling hopeful and a bit more empowered. I think I can definitely give these strategies a shot.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Ms. Zhang! Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. I believe in your ability to create positive changes. If you ever feel like you need more support, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today. I feel much better about everything.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad we could work through things together. I look forward to hearing how your dinner conversations go next time we meet. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ms. Zhang! I'm glad to see you today. It sounds like you've been making some positive strides recently. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I feel like I've been doing a bit better. Engaging with other parents at the community event felt good, and it made me realize I’m not alone. It’s just that sometimes I still struggle with reaching out.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you felt supported during the community activity! Building connections can be challenging, but it sounds like you're making progress. Can you tell me what specific aspects of reaching out feel difficult for you?

User: I think it’s just the fear of rejection. When I try to start a conversation, I worry that they won't be interested in talking to me. It makes me hesitate, and I feel anxious.

Consultant: That’s a very understandable concern. It's common to worry about how others will respond. Can you recall a moment during the community event where you felt hesitant to engage? What thoughts crossed your mind?

User: Yes, there was a moment when I saw a few parents chatting, and I wanted to join in. But then I thought, “What if they don’t want me there?” That thought really held me back.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that. It sounds like that thought made you feel anxious and prevented you from connecting. Let’s explore that idea a bit more. How much evidence do you think exists that they would have rejected you if you had approached them?

User: Honestly, I guess I don’t have much evidence. Most of the time, people seem friendly and welcoming.

Consultant: That's a good insight, Ms. Zhang. Sometimes we can get stuck in negative thoughts that aren't grounded in reality. If you were to approach those parents, what alternative thought could help you feel more confident?

User: Maybe I could think, “They probably would be glad to talk to someone new." That might help me feel less anxious about joining the conversation.

Consultant: That’s an excellent reframe! Focusing on the possibility of a positive interaction can significantly reduce anxiety. How about we practice this mindset for your next social activity? 

User: That sounds good. I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Wonderful! Now, let’s think of a specific action you can take to build on the connections you’ve started. Are there any upcoming community events you could attend and practice engaging with others?

User: Yes, there’s a parent meetup this weekend. I could go and try to speak to someone new.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! Before the meetup, perhaps you could write down some positive affirmations or thoughts that you can remind yourself of to combat any anxious feelings. How does that sound?

User: I like that idea. I can see how reminding myself of those positive thoughts could really help.

Consultant: That's great to hear, Ms. Zhang! Let's also set a goal for yourself during the meetup. How about aiming to have a brief conversation with at least one new parent?

User: I think I can do that. Just starting small feels more manageable.

Consultant: Exactly! Taking small steps can lead to significant changes over time. After the event, I’d love for you to share how it went during our next session. How are you feeling about the plan we’re discussing?

User: I'm feeling excited yet a bit nervous, but I think it’s a good challenge for me.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mix of emotions, and it’s completely normal! Embrace the excitement as a positive sign. Remember, it’s all about practice and gradually building your comfort level. 

User: Yes, I’ll remind myself of that. I really want to improve my connections with others.

Consultant: You’re doing wonderfully, Ms. Zhang. As we continue, let’s make it a goal to explore not only the social connections but also how you can nurture the relationship with your child. How has that been feeling for you lately? 

User: It’s actually been a lot better. I’ve tried to spend more time with my child, and I see them smiling more, which makes me happy.

Consultant: That is fantastic news! Enjoying time together can strengthen your bond and allow you both to grow. Is there a particular activity that you both enjoy doing together? 

User: We both like drawing, and I’ve started sitting with them more during that time. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful activity to share! Drawing can be a great way to express feelings. Perhaps you could create a little art project together during your next drawing session to deepen your engagement.

User: I love that idea! It could be something we both look forward to.

Consultant: Absolutely! It can be a fun bonding experience as well. Remember to celebrate those little moments together. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about your progress with social interactions and your child?

User: I feel hopeful and excited about both. I can’t wait to see how things go!

Consultant: That’s the spirit, Ms. Zhang! I truly believe this is the start of a positive journey for you. Keep focusing on building those connections, and I look forward to hearing all about your experiences in our next session!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’ll see you then!

Consultant: You're welcome! Have a wonderful time at the meetup and with your child. Until next time, take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ms. Zhang! I’m really glad to have you here today. It sounds like you've had an important milestone with your child recently. How are you feeling about your time spent together?

User: Hi. Yes, seeing my child for the first time was overwhelming—so many emotions! I felt so happy and excited, but now I wonder if I can maintain that connection.

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel a mixture of joy and apprehension after such a significant experience. You mentioned wanting to maintain and strengthen your relationship with your child. What specific aspects of your time together made you feel excited?

User: We played games and talked a lot. I really felt a connection. But I’m worried about when we meet next; what if it doesn’t go as well?

Consultant: I hear your concern. It's common to fear the unknown, especially following a positive experience. Let’s explore what worked during that time. Were there any specific activities or moments that felt particularly meaningful to you?

User: Definitely! The games helped us bond. I felt like I was genuinely connecting with my child, and we were having fun together.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Engaging in play is such an effective way to connect with children. How do you think you can incorporate more of these playful moments into your future interactions?

User: I can plan more game nights and maybe even some outdoor activities. I just want to keep the positive vibes going.

Consultant: Planning those fun activities is a great step towards strengthening your bond! Let’s focus on how you can ensure these moments happen. What are some specific games or activities you think your child would enjoy?

User: I know my child loves drawing and crafts. Maybe we could have a craft session together, or I could encourage them to draw something special.

Consultant: Crafts and drawing could be lovely ways to connect! They allow for creativity and help express feelings. How do you feel about setting up regular craft sessions together?

User: That sounds great! I think it will help establish a routine and keep our bond strong.

Consultant: A routine can provide comfort and stability, both for you and your child. Alongside these fun moments, it might also help to discuss any challenges that could arise in your interactions. What worries do you have about the future?

User: I worry about falling back into old habits. I used to cope with stress in unhealthy ways, and I'm concerned if I face difficulties again, I wouldn’t know how to handle them.

Consultant: It’s commendable that you recognize these concerns. Being proactive about potential stresses is an essential part of maintaining stability. How might you prepare yourself for those moments, should they arise?

User: I could create a list of healthier coping mechanisms that I can turn to—things like going for a walk or practicing deep breathing.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Having a list of positive coping strategies handy can really help ground you during stressful times. Would you like to work together to identify a few more possible strategies?

User: Yes, I think that would help. I want to make sure I’m in the right frame of mind for my child.

Consultant: Absolutely! What if we looked at situations that trigger stress for you? Once we identify them, we could develop tailored coping strategies for each scenario.

User: Well, I sometimes feel overwhelmed when there's too much noise or chaos around me. It can trigger my anxiety.

Consultant: Acknowledging this trigger is vital, and there are several strategies we can employ when facing that kind of chaos. For instance, finding a quiet space or practicing grounding techniques can be beneficial. How do you respond to that idea?

User: That sounds like a good plan. I could use those techniques when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: It’s so encouraging to see you embrace these strategies! As you practice these new skills, how do you think you can maintain your commitment to them over time?

User: Maybe I can keep reminding myself that I need to prioritize my mental health, especially for my child’s well-being.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Prioritizing your mental health is not just beneficial for you, but it also significantly impacts your relationship with your child. Let’s talk about how to reinforce that commitment. Would setting reminders or having regular check-ins with yourself be helpful?

User: Yes, setting reminders could help. I could even journal about my feelings to track my progress.

Consultant: Journaling can be an excellent tool for reflection and tracking your emotional journey. It allows you to see how far you’ve come and what areas still need attention. Can we outline a simple journaling practice for you to follow?

User: Sure! I could write about my daily experiences and feelings after my interactions with my child. 

Consultant: That sounds like a meaningful practice. By documenting these experiences, it can help you recognize your growth and any patterns you want to address. As we wrap up our session today, how are you feeling about the steps you've identified?

User: I’m feeling hopeful! I think I can create a better environment for my child and myself. I still have some fears, but I feel more equipped to handle them.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you feel more hopeful and equipped! Remember, it’s a process, and reaching out for help shows strength. You're already taking essential steps towards a brighter future. If you ever feel overwhelmed again, know you have a solid plan to rely on.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’m looking forward to applying these ideas.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Ms. Zhang! I believe in your ability to make these positive changes. Let's keep building on this in our future sessions. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ms. Zhang! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I'm feeling a mix of emotions. I'm really happy that the court granted me temporary custody of my child, but I also feel uncertain and nervous about what the future holds.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a lot going on right now. The joy of temporary custody is big, but I can understand how the uncertainty might be weighing on you too. Can you share more about what worries you regarding this period of observation?

User: I'm just worried that I might fall back into old patterns. I want to create a stable environment for my child, but sometimes I feel overwhelmed and don't know if I can manage it.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to have those concerns. You’ve faced challenges before, and wanting to provide a stable environment is a significant and admirable goal. What specific feelings do you experience when you think about managing everything on your own?

User: I often feel anxious and sometimes even a bit hopeless. There are days when I wonder if I have what it takes to be a good parent, especially given my past struggles.

Consultant: It makes sense that you are feeling anxious about your capacity to parent effectively, especially after facing those challenges. Recognizing this is an important step. What do you think would help you feel more confident in your ability to create that stable environment for your child?

User: Maybe having a plan or structure to follow? If I could keep things organized, it might help me feel more in control.

Consultant: Creating a structured plan sounds like a great idea! Organization can definitely provide a sense of control and reduce anxiety. Let’s discuss what elements you think should be included in this plan to keep your daily life on track.

User: I think I need to set specific routine times for things like meals, activities with my child, and some personal time for myself. It’s hard to think about everything at once, though.

Consultant: That’s a good start! Establishing a routine can help create stability for both you and your child. Personal time for yourself is also very important. How do you envision that personal time fitting into your daily routine?

User: I was thinking maybe I could have an hour in the evening to read or relax. I really need a break sometimes to recharge.

Consultant: That sounds beneficial! Taking time for yourself each day is essential for your well-being. How would you feel about setting aside that hour just for you? 

User: I think it would really help me. I often feel guilty taking time for myself, but I know I need it to be a better parent.

Consultant: It's natural to feel that way, but remember, taking care of yourself ultimately helps you care for your child better. Would you like to establish some self-monitoring techniques to help you stick to this new routine?

User: Yes, that sounds good! I could maybe keep a journal to log how I spend my time and how I feel each day.

Consultant: Keeping a journal is an excellent idea! It can provide insights into your feelings and help you notice any patterns over time. What do you think you would write about in your journal?

User: I could note my thoughts during personal time, how my child is doing, and any moments when I feel overwhelmed or stressed.

Consultant: That sounds like a comprehensive approach. Reflecting on those moments will help you address challenges as they arise. Are there any specific tools or strategies you’ve used in the past that have helped you cope with stress or stay on track?

User: I used to have meditation apps and breathing exercises that helped when I felt anxious. I should probably use those more often.

Consultant: Those tools can be very beneficial for managing anxiety! Incorporating them into your routine might help you handle stressful moments better. How do you feel about making that part of your plan?

User: I feel good about that. I want to be proactive rather than reactive when it comes to stress.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset to have! Being proactive can greatly influence your feelings of control and well-being. Are there any other areas in your life where you would like more support or skills to manage during this observation period?

User: I think I might also need help with setting boundaries with friends and family, especially if they offer unsolicited advice or try to push their opinions on me.

Consultant: Setting boundaries is crucial, especially when you're trying to focus on creating a stable environment for your child. Would you like to discuss some approaches for communicating your needs effectively?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful. I sometimes struggle with saying no without feeling bad about it.

Consultant: It's common to struggle with that. Focusing on your needs is a priority right now. We can explore some phrases or methods that allow you to express yourself clearly while maintaining your relationships. How does that sound?

User: That sounds perfect! I want to ensure I can stand my ground without breaking ties with loved ones.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can find a balance that works for you. It's important to maintain healthy relationships while prioritizing your and your child's needs. Let’s role-play some scenarios where you might practice these boundaries. How does that sound?

User: Yes, I'd like to practice that.

Consultant: Great! I’ll set up a couple of scenarios, and you can respond how you would in those situations. This will help you feel more prepared when they arise in real life. Ready to give it a try?

User: Definitely!

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s imagine a situation where a friend comes to you with suggestions on how to parent. How would you like to respond if you feel overwhelmed by their input?
