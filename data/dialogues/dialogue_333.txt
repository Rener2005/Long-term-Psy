Consultant: Hi there! I'm really glad you're here today. I'd love to hear about what’s been on your mind lately, particularly regarding your family dynamics.

User: Hi. I've been feeling incredibly anxious and overwhelmed. My son, Michael, is frequently coming home late, and I worry about his school attendance. It feels like every day there's more chaos, and I'm just so stressed.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure and worry about Michael's behavior. Can you tell me more about how this situation has been affecting you and your relationship with your children?

User: I feel like I'm constantly yelling at him, which only leads to more arguments. My daughter, Janine, and my son, William, seem to get caught in the crossfire as well. It’s heartbreaking to see our family so divided.

Consultant: That must be really hard to witness. It’s understandable that you’re feeling frustrated. How do you think Michael feels about the arguments at home? Have you noticed any changes in his behavior lately?

User: I think he feels resentful towards me. He doesn’t really talk much anymore, and when he does, it's usually in anger. I just want us to have a calm and happy home, but it seems impossible right now.

Consultant: You’re hoping for a peaceful environment, which is completely reasonable. Let’s explore what might be going on with Michael. What are some of the thoughts that come to you when you think about his situation?

User: I often think maybe I’m not doing enough as a parent. I feel guilty for being a single mom and worry that I’m failing him. I sometimes find myself wondering if I should be stricter or more lenient, but then nothing seems to work anyway.

Consultant: It’s evident you care deeply about your children and want to do your best. Recognizing those feelings of guilt can be important. Have you considered how those thoughts impact your feelings and behavior towards Michael and the family?

User: Yes, it’s like I spiral into anxiety and frustration. When I feel guilty, I end up snapping at him more instead of calmly addressing the issues. I want to stop that cycle.

Consultant: You're recognizing a crucial pattern here—your guilt and anxiety leading to frustration and conflict. Let's talk about how we might start to change that pattern. When you feel yourself becoming anxious, what do you usually do?

User: I usually just try to ignore it or distract myself, but that doesn’t help in the long run. I know I need to face it, but I feel so overwhelmed.

Consultant: Ignoring those feelings is a common response, but you're right; it doesn’t address the underlying issues. What would it look like for you to face these feelings head-on, perhaps by discussing them openly with your children?

User: I think if I could express my feelings to them, maybe they’d understand where I’m coming from. But I fear they'll just shut down or tell me I'm being overdramatic.

Consultant: Your worry about their reactions is valid. How about starting with a smaller, less intense conversation? Perhaps sharing how you feel without placing blame might open the door for better dialogue.

User: That sounds doable. I guess I could say something like, "I'm feeling really anxious about our family situation," instead of pointing fingers.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a great way to begin fostering open communication. By expressing your emotions without blame, you may find it encourages them to share without feeling defensive. How do you feel about trying this approach?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It’s less about attacking and more about sharing feelings, which seems less scary. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! What steps can we outline together for you to prepare for this conversation with Michael?

User: I could write down what I want to say, and maybe practice it a little before actually talking to him. That way, I can stay calm.

Consultant: Practicing your thoughts sounds like an excellent strategy. What’s something positive you hope might come from this conversation?

User: I really hope he will open up and we can start to understand each other better. I want him to know I care and want to help him.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful intention. As you gear up for this conversation, how can you remind yourself of this goal in moments when you might feel anxious or frustrated?

User: Maybe by telling myself that this is an opportunity to connect, rather than a confrontation. Keeping that in mind might help me stay grounded.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach! Remember, this is about creating understanding. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what steps you’re going to take moving forward.

User: I’ll prepare what I want to say, practice it, and focus on sharing my feelings without being confrontational. I’ll remind myself that I want to connect with Michael.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. You are taking important steps to improve communication with him, and I admire your commitment. We’ll touch base on how it went next time. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I feel a bit more empowered to face this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in your ability to foster a positive change in your family dynamics. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling about your communication with Michael lately?

User: Hi. I've been really frustrated. It seems like whenever I try to talk to him about his late nights and attendance, it just turns into an argument. I feel powerless.

Consultant: I can sense how overwhelming that must be for you, feeling stuck and unable to reach him. Let's explore that situation together. What emotions do you feel during those conversations?

User: I feel anxious and upset. It's like I'm trying to get through to him, but he just shuts down or reacts defensively. It leaves me feeling hopeless.

Consultant: It sounds like those interactions are quite emotionally charged for you. With these feelings of hopelessness, it might be helpful to identify the specific thoughts that arise during these conversations. What goes through your mind when he reacts that way?

User: I often think that I'm failing as a parent. I fear that I’m losing control over him, and that makes me even more anxious.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It’s tough when we feel responsible for our children’s choices. Let’s question that thought a bit. What evidence do you have that you're failing as a parent because of this situation?

User: Well, I guess I can't say for sure. I mean, there are things I’ve done right, and he has good qualities. But in moments like these, it's hard to see that.

Consultant: It's great that you can recognize those positive aspects about him. Perhaps there's an opportunity to focus on those strengths instead. How might reframing that thought help you communicate differently with him?

User: I suppose if I focus on his strengths, I could approach conversations from a more positive standpoint. But I struggle to maintain that mindset in the heat of the moment.

Consultant: That’s a common challenge. It might help to prepare some key phrases or questions in advance that highlight his strengths. For example, starting with positive observations could set a different tone. What positive traits do you really appreciate in Michael?

User: He is really smart and has a good sense of humor. I often see him helping his sister and being responsible in other areas.

Consultant: Those are wonderful attributes! Using those in your conversations might remind both you and him of the good qualities he possesses. What sorts of things do you think you could say to start a dialogue that emphasizes those traits?

User: Maybe I could tell him that I recognize he's a good brother and that I admire how smart he is. I could frame my concerns around that, rather than just focusing on the problems.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic approach! You’re shifting the narrative to one of support rather than criticism. How do you think that might influence his response?

User: I think it might help him feel more understood and less attacked, which could lead to a more productive discussion.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about creating a safe space for him to share rather than feeling defensive. Are there any specific situations you plan to apply this new approach in?

User: I think I’ll try it tonight when he gets home. I’ll start by sharing something positive before bringing up the late nights. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. I encourage you to be patient with yourself and him as you try this new approach. How are you feeling about trying it out?

User: I feel a little more hopeful about it. I've been so stuck in negativity that this feels like a breath of fresh air, but there’s still some doubt.

Consultant: That’s totally normal. Change takes time, and it's okay to have some skepticism. Let’s focus on a small goal for tonight. What would you consider a success in your conversation?

User: If I can get him to listen without immediately shutting down, I’ll consider that a success.

Consultant: That’s a realistic and positive goal. Remember to take a deep breath and approach it calmly. You’re learning and growing in this process. How would you like to celebrate your effort, regardless of the outcome?

User: I think I’ll just give myself a pat on the back for trying something new! 

Consultant: Absolutely! Acknowledging your efforts is so important. As we start to wrap up today, let’s reflect on what you’ve gained from our session. What stands out to you?

User: I really appreciated the focus on communication strategies and how I can shift my mindset. It gives me hope.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! I’m glad you found the strategies helpful. It’s about taking one step at a time, and I truly believe you’re on the right path. Do you feel more equipped to tackle your conversations now?

User: Yes, I do. I feel a bit more empowered to handle it, which is a change for me.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, and I’m really proud of you! Remember, progress is a journey. As you move forward, keep practicing those skills and revisiting those positive thoughts about your parenting. If you need support again, I’m here for you.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you, and I look forward to hearing how things go next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to have you here today. Let's take a moment to discuss how you're feeling in relation to your family situation. What's on your mind lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a mix of relief and worry. Michael has been doing a little better with his homework, but he still comes home late sometimes, which leads to arguments. I'm not sure how to keep him motivated.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of accomplishment with Michael's progress but still feeling concerned about his late arrivals and the conflicts that arise. Let's explore what motivates you to want to support him more effectively. What would you like to see change in his behavior?

User: I wish I could see him consistently do his homework and come home on time. I think if he felt more connected to us, it might help, but I’m not sure how to create that connection.

Consultant: That's a great insight. Creating that sense of connection can be crucial. One way to foster that is through positive reinforcement. What do you think about establishing a reward system for positive behaviors, like completing homework on time or coming home earlier?

User: That's an interesting idea! I haven’t thought about rewards in that way. What kind of rewards do you suggest?

Consultant: Rewards can vary based on what attributes Michael enjoys. Perhaps you could consider offering special family activities, extra screen time, or even a small treat for meeting those goals. What do you think would motivate him the most?

User: Michael loves video games, so maybe extra gaming time would work. But what if he doesn’t follow through?

Consultant: It's natural to feel uncertain about how he might respond. It's important to communicate your expectations clearly and consistently reward any small progress he makes. Would you be comfortable discussing these rewards with him?

User: Yes, I think I could do that. I’ll try to explain why it's important for us all to work together and how he can earn those rewards.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! By involving him in the conversation, you're allowing him to feel more invested in the process. Have you noticed any specific moments recently when Michael showed commitment or positivity?

User: A few days ago, he actually finished some homework without me asking him! I thought that was a good sign, but I also worry it won’t last.

Consultant: That's a wonderful development! Acknowledging those moments is key. You can reinforce this behavior by praising him specifically for that achievement, such as, "I really appreciate that you took the initiative to finish your homework." How does that sound?

User: I think I can do that. I guess I need to be more positive about when he does something right instead of focusing only on the negatives.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on the positives can build a more encouraging atmosphere at home. How do you think shifting your focus might impact your interactions with Michael?

User: Maybe it will help him feel more supported and less pressured. I hope he’ll respond better if he knows I notice his efforts.

Consultant: That's a crucial insight. When he feels recognized, it can strengthen his motivation. Would it help to create a list of specific behaviors you want to encourage, along with the corresponding rewards?

User: Yes, having a plan might make it easier for me to follow through with it.

Consultant: Definitely! A plan can provide clarity. If you were to list them out, what positive behaviors would you want to prioritize for Michael?

User: I’d prioritize finishing his homework, coming home on time, and even helping out at home more, like doing chores.

Consultant: Those sound like great priorities. Assigning a reward to each behavior can help emphasize what you value, such as earning time for video games or family outings. How do you feel about that idea?

User: I like that. It gives him clear goals and reasons to achieve them.

Consultant: Exactly! As you implement this system, it might be helpful to check in regularly about how he's feeling about the rewards and the overall process. How do you feel about keeping the communication open?

User: I think open communication will be important. I want him to feel comfortable coming to me with any challenges.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach. Making sure that he knows you’re there to listen can help foster that connection you desire. Is there anything you feel you might struggle with when implementing these changes?

User: I guess I worry that I might become frustrated if he doesn't respond as I hope. 

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way. If setbacks occur, it's important to remember that change takes time. Consistency and patience are key. How can we prepare you to deal with those moments when they arise?

User: Perhaps I can remind myself that even small steps are progress and that I shouldn’t give up if he doesn't respond immediately.

Consultant: That's a wise perspective. Reminding yourself of the importance of every small victory can help keep you motivated. Would you be open to reminding yourself of these ideas during challenging moments?

User: Yes, I think I can keep a journal or something to track our progress and remind myself of those positives.

Consultant: That's a brilliant idea! Tracking progress in a journal can create a tangible representation of changes, making it easier to stay motivated. How do you feel about setting some time each week to review these entries?

User: That sounds like a good plan. It’ll help me stay focused and reflect on how things are going.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflecting on progress can enhance your feelings of connection with Michael. As we wrap up today, what are some key takeaways you hope to remember moving forward?

User: I hope to remember the importance of positive reinforcement and open communication. And keeping a journal to track progress should really help.

Consultant: Those are excellent takeaways! You have a great plan in place, and it sounds like you’re feeling more empowered. Remember, fostering a supportive environment takes time but can lead to wonderful changes. If you ever need to talk again, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your guidance. I feel more hopeful about working things out with Michael. 

Consultant: It's my pleasure! I'm glad to hear you're feeling hopeful. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time.

Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. I'm here to support you. How have you been feeling about your family activities lately?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling a bit anxious but also hopeful. I've been trying to introduce new activities for us to do together, but I'm not sure if we can keep it up.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel anxious about maintaining these new activities. You’ve made a step forward by wanting to strengthen your family connections. Can you share a bit more about the activities you planned?

User: Sure! I’ve been trying to set up regular family dinners and some weekend outings, hoping that it will bring us closer together. But I worry that everyone will lose interest.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve put a lot of effort into creating opportunities for connection. What do you think is the most significant challenge in keeping everyone engaged in these activities?

User: I think it’s mostly about my son's interest. He tends to stay out late with friends and seems less interested in family time. That really worries me.

Consultant: It’s tough when one family member isn’t as involved, especially when you’re trying to foster connection. Have you had a chance to talk to him about how he feels regarding family activities?

User: Not really. I feel like he might just brush it off or say he’s too busy. I don’t want to pressure him, but I also want him to care.

Consultant: It’s a delicate balance between wanting to connect and respecting his space. Perhaps you could approach it from a different angle. What if you asked him what activities he would enjoy? 

User: That’s a good idea! I haven’t considered that. I’ll definitely try to involve him in the planning next time. 

Consultant: That sounds promising! Involving him could help him feel more invested in the family time. How about your younger kids? Have they responded positively to these activities?

User: Yes, they seem excited! They look forward to our dinners and outings, but sometimes, it feels like the excitement doesn’t build for everyone. 

Consultant: It’s wonderful that your younger children are enjoying it. Maybe you can think of some activities that would be fun for your son too—ones that also include his interests. What do you think he'd like?

User: He loves football, so maybe a family game could work. I’ll suggest that! 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Engaging in activities that align with his interests could make a big difference. Would you be willing to try planning a football outing soon?

User: Yes! I’ll plan it for this weekend and see how it goes. 

Consultant: Fantastic! After the outing, we can talk about how it went and whether it helped bring everyone together. How are you feeling about the upcoming family time now?

User: I feel more hopeful. Just thinking about involving him in planning boosts my confidence a little.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s encouraging to see you taking proactive steps. Are there any other concerns about your family interactions you’d like to explore today?

User: I guess I just want to ensure we keep the momentum going. I don't want it to feel forced or temporary.

Consultant: That’s an important point. Sustainability can be more challenging than starting. We could devise a plan together to maintain the family activities. How does that sound?

User: Yes, I’d love that! What kind of plan do you suggest?

Consultant: One strategy is to set specific days for family activities in advance. Consistency can help everyone adjust their schedules. How often do you think you could realistically do this?

User: Maybe once a week? That feels manageable. 

Consultant: Once a week sounds great! You could even rotate who chooses the activity each week. That way, everyone gets a say and feels involved. What do you think?

User: I like that idea! It gives everyone a chance to contribute. 

Consultant: Awesome! How about we set a goal for the next few weeks to revisit how this plan is going? 

User: Yes, that sounds good. It’ll help keep me accountable. 

Consultant: Absolutely. You’ve made fantastic strides today. Before we finish, let’s reflect on how you can support your son during these activities. What might that look like?

User: I think I need to be more open and listen to him. I want him to feel comfortable sharing his thoughts.

Consultant: That’s a valuable approach. Regular communication will help you understand his needs better and may encourage him to participate more. 

User: I agree. I’ll try to have casual conversations before our activities.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! Being open can create a more inviting environment. How are you feeling about this progress you’re making?

User: I feel relieved. It’s nice to have a clearer plan and to know I can involve my kids more effectively.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! You've done a wonderful job today, and I believe these changes can lead to a more cohesive family atmosphere. Would you like to set any final thoughts or goals before we wrap up?

User: I’ll work on planning the football outing and set our family activity day for next week. I feel more motivated now.

Consultant: That sounds excellent! I believe you have the capability to create meaningful connections with your family. Remember, it’s okay to have ups and downs along the way. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and the ideas you've given me.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Keep up the great work!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm happy to see you today. You mentioned last time feeling a bit more reassured after receiving positive feedback about Michael's school performance. How have you been since then?

User: Hi! Yes, I do feel a bit more at ease. I've been actively engaging with Michael's school and talking to his teachers. It's been a lot, but I'm trying to stay positive.

Consultant: It sounds like you're making great efforts to support Michael. What specific feedback have you received from the teachers, and how has that impacted your feelings about the situation?

User: The teachers mentioned that he's showing improvement in his participation, which is encouraging. It's nice to hear that my efforts are starting to pay off.

Consultant: That’s fantastic news! It seems like your involvement is making a difference. What do you think prompted this change in Michael's behavior at school?

User: I believe it might be my increased communication with his teachers. They’ve really been supportive, and I think Michael notices that I'm involved in his education.

Consultant: That's a powerful insight. Engaging with the teachers can really create a sense of support for both you and Michael. How has this involvement influenced your relationship with him at home?

User: Our communication has improved. We talk more about school, and I feel he's opening up to me about his challenges. I’m really trying to encourage him to express himself.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Encouraging open communication is essential. Have you noticed any changes in his mood or attitude at home as a result?

User: Yes, he seems a bit more relaxed and willing to share his thoughts with me. However, sometimes I still sense his anxiety about schoolwork.

Consultant: It’s normal for kids to feel anxious, especially regarding schoolwork. Have you explored any strategies to help him cope with that anxiety when it arises?

User: I’ve suggested he take breaks during homework and talked about the importance of staying organized. I'm not sure if he’s fully on board with it yet.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re providing good suggestions! Maybe we can brainstorm some additional techniques or activities that could make the process feel less overwhelming for him. Would you like to explore that?

User: Yes, that would be helpful! I want to ensure he feels supported without pressure.

Consultant: How about introducing short, fun study sessions where you can work together? This might help him feel less isolated with his work and more motivated. What do you think?

User: That sounds like a great idea! I think he would respond well to that. I just want to create a positive atmosphere for him.

Consultant: Creating that kind of environment is so important. In addition to study sessions, encouraging him to do enjoyable activities after studying could help him balance work and play. 

User: Yes, I agree! Balancing work with relaxation is key. I’ll suggest some fun activities that we can do together once he finishes his homework.

Consultant: That sounds fantastic! It’s great to see you thinking creatively about how to help him. How are you managing your own feelings around his school experience during this time?

User: It's been a rollercoaster! Some days I feel hopeful, and other days I'm anxious about whether I’m doing enough to help him.

Consultant: Those fluctuating emotions are totally understandable, especially as a parent. Have you considered reflecting on the progress you’ve made with him and focusing on those positives when feeling anxious?

User: Yes, I’ve been trying to remind myself of the progress. I think I just need to be kinder to myself during this process.

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate approach. Acknowledging your efforts and progress is a crucial part of maintaining your own well-being. What practices could you incorporate to help yourself feel more grounded?

User: I think scheduling some personal time for myself would help. Maybe I could take a few moments each day just to breathe and relax.

Consultant: Absolutely! Prioritizing self-care is important for parents, too. Even small moments of relaxation can make a big difference. How can I help you stay accountable to this self-care practice?

User: Maybe check-ins about what I’ve done for myself during our sessions would help. I want to ensure I’m taking time to recharge.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! We can start each session by discussing your self-care activities. This way, you’ll have a specific reminder to focus on your well-being as well. 

User: I like that! It gives me something to look forward to discussing and keeps me motivated to take care of myself.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, what do you feel is the most valuable takeaway from our session?

User: I think the importance of maintaining open communication with Michael and making time for myself is crucial. I also feel optimistic about our study sessions.

Consultant: That’s an excellent realization! You’ve made significant progress in fostering a supportive environment for Michael and yourself. As you continue this journey, remember to celebrate those small victories along the way.

User: Thank you! I appreciate all the support. I'm feeling more confident about the changes we’re making together.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been wonderful to see your progress. I believe you’re on the right path. I look forward to our next session, and remember, you’re doing a great job!

User: Thank you! I’ll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling about your family dynamics lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty hopeful, actually. Michael has been showing noticeable improvements in his attendance and behavior. The atmosphere at home feels more positive, and interactions with my kids seem more natural now.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful shift! It must feel rewarding to witness these changes. Can you tell me more about what specific improvements you've noticed in Michael?

User: Well, he's been coming home on time more often, and when he does, he's more willing to talk about his day. It feels like he's becoming more responsible, which is a relief for me as a single parent.

Consultant: It sounds like you're seeing a lot of progress in Michael's behavior, which is great. How does this change affect your feelings as a parent?

User: I feel less anxious and a bit more in control. Before, I was so worried about his choices and his future. Now, I feel like we’re moving in the right direction, and it’s definitely uplifting.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift! Feeling more in control can greatly improve your overall well-being. What do you think contributed to these positive changes in your family?

User: I think we’ve all been working on our communication. I've made an effort to listen more, and I try to connect with each of them, including my younger kids. I believe that focusing on positive interactions helps a lot.

Consultant: That's an excellent strategy. Open communication can strengthen relationships. Have there been any specific instances that stand out to you as successes in this area?

User: Yes! Just the other evening, I sat down with William and Janning to help them with their homework. They were really engaged, and it led to some fun conversations afterward. I felt closer to them.

Consultant: That sounds delightful! Engaging in activities together can foster closeness. Going forward, how can you maintain this positive momentum within your family?

User: I think I should schedule regular family time—maybe game nights or movie nights. Keeping up that connection is important, I realize.

Consultant: Great idea! Creating regular family bonding moments can reinforce these positive dynamics. Are there any challenges you anticipate when trying to maintain this routine?

User: I worry about conflicting schedules, especially with Michael's school commitments and my responsibilities. But I believe we can make it work if we plan ahead.

Consultant: Planning ahead is key! It sounds like you are proactively considering how to keep things positive. What other strategies can you think of that might support this family time?

User: Perhaps setting reminders for family events in our calendars and encouraging everyone to participate could help. I could ask the kids for their input on activities too, so they feel involved.

Consultant: Involving them in decision-making is a brilliant approach! It helps them feel valued. How do you think these strategies might impact your family dynamics?

User: I believe it will keep us connected and allow us to express our thoughts and feelings more openly. It could also reduce any feeling of disconnection that may arise from busy schedules.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. Keeping those lines of communication open can help everyone feel supported. As we summarize our discussion, what would you identify as your biggest takeaway from today's session?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is the importance of maintaining communication and planning family time. I feel more equipped to handle potential challenges now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You’ve already made significant progress, and it seems you have a clear plan moving forward. Before we end, do you have any additional thoughts or concerns you’d like to address?

User: No, I feel good about the direction things are going. I just want to keep our relationship strong and continue fostering this positivity.

Consultant: That's a wonderful mindset! It’s clear you are committed to nurturing a healthy family environment. If you ever need to revisit these themes or address any new challenges, don't hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your guidance and support throughout this process.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure to work with you. I'm confident you will continue to thrive in your role as a parent. Take care, and best of luck with your family activities!

User: Thank you! I’ll keep you posted on our progress. Goodbye!

Consultant: Goodbye! Take care and all the best!
