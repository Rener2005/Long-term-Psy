Consultant: Hello, Li Zhi! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I think about what happened in class a lot. I feel down and afraid of Zhao's mockery. It makes me feel sick sometimes, and I just don't want to face it.

Consultant: I can sense that this experience has been really challenging for you. It sounds like the shame and fear from the incident are quite overwhelming. Can you tell me more about what thoughts come to your mind when you think about Zhao's reaction?

User: When I remember it, I think that everyone is laughing at me, and I feel really ashamed. I worry that I'll embarrass myself again if I speak up in class.

Consultant: That sounds painful, feeling like everyone is laughing at you. It's understandable to feel anxious in that situation. Let's explore these thoughts together. How do those beliefs about embarrassment feel in your body when you're thinking about them?

User: My heart races a lot, and I feel a tightness in my chest. It's like I want to disappear when I think about speaking in class.

Consultant: It's tough to experience those physical sensations along with the fear. What if we try to identify the exact thought you have in those moments? What do you tell yourself when you start feeling that way?

User: I think, “I'm going to mess up again, and everyone will think I'm stupid.” 

Consultant: That’s a very strong thought, and it sounds like it’s contributing to your fear. How much evidence do you think supports this idea that everyone would think you're stupid? Is there any possibility that some classmates might actually be understanding?

User: I guess not everyone would think that. But I remember Zhao laughing, and that just sticks with me.

Consultant: It makes sense that Zhao's laughter left a mark. Sometimes, one negative comment can overshadow many positive ones. Can we challenge that thought a bit? If a friend were in your position, what advice would you give him regarding Zhao’s reaction?

User: I would tell him not to let one person define how he feels. Maybe others didn’t think the same way.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a wise perspective. You have the ability to separate one person's actions from the overall opinion of your classmates. What if we reframe your thought to something more balanced? For example, “Zhao's mockery does not represent everyone’s view of me.”

User: That sounds a bit better, but I still feel anxious when thinking of class.

Consultant: It’s okay to still feel anxious. Acknowledging that feeling is part of the process. Let’s explore what actions can help you face this situation. Could we identify some small steps that you could take to gradually become more comfortable in class?

User: Maybe I could start by answering a question correctly? But what if I mess up again?

Consultant: That’s certainly a valid worry. How about we start even smaller? What if you simply raised your hand to be part of the discussion without the pressure of answering every question perfectly?

User: I think I could try that. Just raising my hand feels easier than answering directly.

Consultant: That's a great first step! You’ll be gradually exposing yourself to the environment while managing your anxiety. Let’s also think about some techniques you can use to calm yourself before class. What have you done in the past to ease your anxiety?

User: Sometimes I listen to music that calms me down or take deep breaths.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let's incorporate those techniques into your routine before class. You can listen to calming music or practice deep breathing to help ease your heart rate. How do you feel about trying that?

User: I think it might help to listen to music. I can control my breathing better that way.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s all about finding what works for you. As we continue, let’s keep working on understanding those fears and challenging any negative thoughts. Remember, your value is not defined by one moment. How do you feel about our discussion today?

User: I feel a bit lighter. It's nice to think that maybe Zhao isn't as important as I made him out to be.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization! You’re making progress in recognizing the impact of that moment on your feelings. Let's focus on building your confidence in class moving forward. What are your thoughts on that?

User: I think I want to feel less scared and just be able to speak up without worrying. 

Consultant: That's a great goal, Li Zhi! We can work on techniques to help you achieve that. Over the next sessions, we’ll keep exploring these feelings and reinforcing your strengths. Remember, it’s a journey, and you’re not alone in this.

User: Thank you! I appreciate the support. I'm looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Li Zhi! I'm proud of the steps you're taking. Keep practicing those strategies we've talked about, and we'll meet again soon to continue this journey together. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Li Zhi! I'm glad you're here for our session today. How have you been feeling about participating in class lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious. I worry about making mistakes in class and being laughed at, so I've started avoiding participating. It's frustrating because I know I should be able to speak up.

Consultant: I can see how that would be tough for you. It sounds like there’s a lot of pressure to perform, and you're worried about the judgment of others. Could you tell me more about what specifically makes you anxious when you think about participating in class?

User: Well, I often imagine that if I answer a question wrong, everyone will look at me and laugh. It's like my mind just jumps to the worst-case scenario.

Consultant: That’s a common feeling—your mind is taking you to that worst-case scenario. It seems like those thoughts create a lot of anxiety for you. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. When you have those fears about being laughed at, what feelings come up for you?

User: I feel embarrassed and really small, like I want to hide. It's hard to think clearly when I'm in that state.

Consultant: I completely understand. Feeling embarrassed can be very overwhelming, especially in a classroom setting where others are watching. Can you think of any specific moments when you felt this way? What kind of thoughts were going through your mind at that time?

User: There was this one time when I attempted to answer a question, but I got it wrong. I could feel the heat on my face, and it felt like everyone was staring. After that, I didn’t want to raise my hand anymore.

Consultant: That must have been a really difficult experience for you. It’s okay to feel vulnerable, but it seems that this one event has led you to avoid participating altogether. Let’s take a look at that thought: “If I get it wrong, everyone will laugh.” How might we challenge that belief? What evidence do we have that supports or contradicts that idea?

User: I suppose not everyone laughed last time, some just moved on. But it felt like such a big deal at that moment.

Consultant: That’s a very insightful observation. It seems that while it felt intense in the moment, the reality may not be as harsh as you perceived. If a friend were in your shoes—saying something wrong in class—what would you tell them?

User: I would probably say it’s okay to make mistakes and that it’s normal. Everyone is there to learn, right?

Consultant: Exactly! It’s a learning environment, and everyone makes mistakes. Now, let’s think of ways to practice participating in a less stressful way. Perhaps we could come up with a small goal for you to try in the next class. What do you think you could do?

User: Maybe I could just try to answer one question, even if I'm not sure. That feels a bit less scary.

Consultant: That sounds like a great starting point! Answering one question can gradually help you build confidence. How about we also think of a positive affirmation you can tell yourself right before you raise your hand? Something reassuring?

User: Maybe I could say to myself, “It’s okay to make mistakes. I’m here to learn.”

Consultant: That’s a wonderful affirmation! It reinforces the idea that learning comes with mistakes. Would it be helpful if we role-played a situation where you might raise your hand in class? This could give you a chance to practice in a supportive environment.

User: Sure, that could help. I’ll try to imagine the situation as you guide me.

Consultant: Great! Imagine you’re in class, and the teacher asks a question. Take a deep breath, remember your affirmation, and raise your hand. What would you say?

User: I would say, “I think the answer might be...” It feels a little real thinking about it.

Consultant: It’s a step in the right direction! Just focus on speaking slowly and staying calm. How would it feel to be able to say that in class?

User: I think it would feel pretty good. But there’s still a part of me that is worried.

Consultant: That’s completely normal. It’s okay to feel worried, but remember, it’s about taking one small step. Can we agree to check in next session on how it went? You might surprise yourself with what you accomplish!

User: Yes, I will try to answer at least one question, but I may still feel nervous.

Consultant: That’s perfectly fine! Feelings of nervousness can come and go. The key is to act despite them. Let’s also discuss what you can do if anxiety creeps in during the class. Would you like to brainstorm some quick coping strategies?

User: Yes, I think that would help me feel more equipped.

Consultant: Awesome! Some strategies could be deep breathing techniques, grounding exercises, or even just reminding yourself of your affirmation. Which one do you think you might want to try?

User: I’d like to try deep breathing. It seems simple enough to do without drawing attention.

Consultant: Perfect choice! Deep breathing can be very effective in reducing immediate anxiety. Remember, it's all about finding what works best for you. As we near the end of our session, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed and plan for next time.

User: Okay. I’ll work on participating by answering one question and use deep breathing if I feel anxious.

Consultant: You’re making such great progress! You have a clear plan in place. Do you feel more empowered to take these small steps, despite your anxiety?

User: Yes, I do. I’m still a bit scared, but I feel more prepared.

Consultant: That’s all we need—preparation and a willingness to try. I’m really proud of you for committing to this. Remember, taking small steps is key. If you encounter difficulties, we’ll tackle them together in our next session.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li Zhi! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li Zhi! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit anxious still, especially when thinking about participating in class. I practiced answering questions at home, but once I’m in school, I feel nervous.

Consultant: It sounds like you've been putting in a lot of effort to prepare at home, which is great! Let’s talk about those feelings of nervousness a bit more. When you think about participating in class, what thoughts go through your mind?

User: I often worry that I will say the wrong thing and embarrass myself in front of my classmates. It's like my mind just goes blank.

Consultant: That’s a common concern, Li Zhi. It can be tough to put yourself out there in front of others. What emotions do you experience when those thoughts pop up during class?

User: I feel a mix of anxiety and fear. My heart races, and I just want to disappear. 

Consultant: I understand. Those physical reactions can be quite overwhelming. Let’s explore this further—can you identify any patterns in your thinking when you feel this way? For example, do you notice if you have specific negative thoughts that contribute to your anxiety?

User: Yes, I often think that everyone is judging me, and I remember past times when I felt embarrassed.

Consultant: Recognizing those patterns is a powerful step. It sounds like you’re caught in a cycle of negative thinking. What if we worked together to challenge those thoughts? How could we reframe those judgments into something more supportive?

User: I guess I could remind myself that my classmates are probably not paying as much attention to me as I think, and they might even be nervous themselves.

Consultant: That sounds like a more balanced thought. It's great that you can see that perspective. How would that realization change the way you feel when you raise your hand in class?

User: I think it would make me feel a lot less pressured and maybe a bit more confident to speak up.

Consultant: Wonderful! Now, let’s consider some practical steps you can take next time you're in class. Have you thought about any small actions you could take to build your confidence gradually?

User: Maybe I could start by answering easier questions or just making comments, instead of trying to answer everything.

Consultant: That’s a great plan, Li Zhi! Starting small can really help ease that anxiety. It’s also a way to build up your confidence over time. How does it sound to practice this in our next session or even before then?

User: I think practicing sounds good. It might help me feel less anxious about speaking up.

Consultant: Excellent idea! You might also want to visualize yourself succeeding in those interactions. Can you try imagining yourself confidently answering a question in class?

User: Yes, I can try visualizing that. It might help me feel more positive about it.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Visualization can be a powerful tool. Now, what else can we do to reinforce your sense of self-worth? You mentioned doubting your value earlier. 

User: Sometimes, I just feel like I don't deserve to speak up or that I won't add anything meaningful to the discussion.

Consultant: It’s important to challenge those beliefs. What if we list a few things you like about yourself or things you've accomplished? Those affirmations can remind you of your value.

User: I guess I study hard, and some teachers say I'm a quick learner. I also really enjoy helping my friends when they have questions.

Consultant: Those are wonderful qualities! You have a lot to offer, and your voice deserves to be heard. Can you use those affirmations as a reminder when you start feeling anxious in class?

User: Yes, I will try to remember those positives when I'm feeling nervous.

Consultant: Perfect! This could help counteract those self-doubts. As we wrap up today, what are your thoughts on what we discussed? Do you feel more optimistic about participating in class?

User: I do feel a bit better. I have some ideas to work on, and I appreciate the support.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Li Zhi! Remember, it's a journey, and you're taking important steps. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. If you encounter any challenges, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to our next session. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! Take care, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li Zhi! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hello! I've been trying to join my classmates more in activities, but I'm still worried about what they might think of me. Sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough to be part of the group.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're making an effort to connect with your classmates, but the fear of judgment is holding you back. Let's explore that a bit more. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you worry about being judged?

User: I often think that they might laugh at me or think I'm weird. It makes me hesitate to join in.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite daunting. It's understandable to feel anxious about being judged. Can you tell me how those thoughts affect your feelings and actions when you're around your classmates?

User: When I think that they might laugh at me, I feel really anxious, and sometimes I just avoid joining discussions or activities altogether.

Consultant: That avoidance can feel like a safe option at the moment, but it can also keep you from connecting with others. What if we tried to identify if there are any patterns in these thoughts? Do you notice any cognitive distortions, like assuming the worst about what your peers think?

User: Yes, I guess I do tend to assume that things will go badly without any real evidence. I just jump to conclusions about how they will react.

Consultant: It’s really insightful that you recognize that pattern! Let’s practice challenging those automatic thoughts. If a friend told you they were worried about being laughed at, what might you say to help them see things differently?

User: I would tell them that it’s unlikely everyone is judging them and that they should just be themselves.

Consultant: That’s a supportive perspective! Now, let’s apply that same thinking to your situation. What evidence do you have that your classmates would laugh at you if you joined them?

User: I don’t have solid evidence; it’s just a fear of mine. In fact, some classmates have been quite friendly lately.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re beginning to recognize that your fears might not be based on reality. Let's focus on some experiences that validate your positive interactions. How did you feel after those friendly experiences with your classmates?

User: I felt relieved and happy that they were nice to me.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Let’s use that relief as a foundation. What could be a small step you could take to further engage with your classmates using those positive experiences as encouragement?

User: Maybe I could join the next group project or approach someone to chat during lunch. 

Consultant: Those are fantastic ideas! Engaging in group activities could allow you to build connections. Would setting a goal for yourself, like initiating a conversation at lunch, feel manageable for you?

User: Yes, I think I could try that. 

Consultant: Great! Remember that each positive interaction can reinforce your belief in yourself. Before our next session, try to take that step. How do you think it would feel to approach a classmate?

User: I think it would be encouraging if they responded positively. But I'm still a bit nervous.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous, but remember that nervousness often signals growth. You might want to prepare a simple question or comment to break the ice. How does that sound?

User: That sounds doable. I can think of something to say.

Consultant: Wonderful! And after you’ve initiated those interactions, let’s reflect on how that goes in our next session. It could be a great opportunity to reinforce your self-esteem and recognize your social skills. How do you feel about that?

User: I feel a bit more confident thinking about it. Maybe it's not so bad!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Confidence tends to grow with practice. Before we wrap up today, let's summarize what we've discussed and the positive steps you are planning to take.

User: I’m going to approach my classmates more and try to engage in group activities. I’ll remind myself that they might not judge me as harshly as I think.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve made excellent progress in recognizing your thoughts and planning positive actions. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember, you have the ability to foster connections! 

User: Thank you! I feel better about trying now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Keep building on those positive feelings, and I’ll see you in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li Zhi! I’m really glad to see you again. How are you feeling today, especially after your recent success in the extracurricular activity?

User: Hi! I'm feeling quite good, actually. It was nice to get positive feedback from my peers. But I still feel a bit anxious about social situations.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling good and enjoyed the positive feedback! That can really boost your confidence. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you anxious in social situations?

User: I often worry about what others think of me. I feel like I don’t know how to engage in conversations, and that makes me want to avoid social gatherings.

Consultant: I understand. It’s common to feel worried about how others perceive us. You’ve already taken a significant step by participating in the activity, which shows bravery. What was it about the feedback you received that made you feel joyful?

User: The compliments from my classmates made me realize that maybe they actually appreciate my efforts and enjoy having me around. It felt nice to be recognized.

Consultant: That's a wonderful realization! Acknowledgment from peers can really reaffirm your value in social settings. How can we build on that experience to help alleviate some of your anxiety in future situations?

User: Maybe if I remind myself of that positive feedback, I can feel more confident to join activities and chat with my classmates.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Focusing on positive reinforcement can help reduce anxiety. Can we explore some possible goals for your social interactions? What would be a small, achievable step you could take next?

User: I’d like to try talking to at least one classmate during lunch this week. It would be a good start.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Engaging with one person during lunch is a realistic and manageable step. How do you feel about the idea of initiating a conversation with them?

User: It seems a bit intimidating, but I think reminding myself of their positive reactions could help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remembering those positive responses can serve as encouragement. What kind of topics do you think you could discuss to make the conversation flow more easily?

User: I could ask about schoolwork or their favorite subjects. Those seem like safe topics to start with.

Consultant: Great choice! Those topics are relatable and can open up the conversation further. As you prepare for this interaction, how do you want to handle any feelings of anxiety that might come up?

User: I guess I could take a few deep breaths before talking to someone and remind myself that it’s okay to be a little nervous.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Deep breathing can help calm your nerves, and it’s perfectly normal to feel a bit anxious. After you try this out, how will you reflect on the experience?

User: I can think about what went well and how I felt during and after the conversation. Maybe I could journal about it.

Consultant: Journaling can be a wonderful way to process your feelings and track your progress. What are some feelings you hope to identify after the conversation?

User: I hope I feel proud for having tried, and maybe even more confident for future interactions.

Consultant: Feeling proud is an essential part of building confidence. No matter the outcome, taking that step is a success in itself. What strategies might you use to reward yourself after achieving this little goal?

User: I could treat myself to something I enjoy, like a nice snack or some time playing video games after lunch.

Consultant: That sounds rewarding! Treating yourself after achievements can reinforce positive behavior. How do you think this small success might influence your attitude toward social situations in the future?

User: If I succeed in talking to just one classmate, I think I’ll feel more comfortable trying to talk to others later on.

Consultant: Exactly! Each small success can build your confidence gradually. Let’s establish a follow-up plan. When do you think we should check in on how this experience went for you?

User: We could meet again next week. That way, I’ll have time to try it out and reflect on it.

Consultant: Perfect! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress. Always remember, every step you take, however small, brings you closer to your goals. Is there anything else you would like to discuss today?

User: I think that’s all for now. I feel motivated to try my goal for the week.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, I’m here to support you. Have a great week, and I’m excited to hear how it goes when we meet again!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li Zhi! Take care, and see you next week!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li Zhi! Welcome to our session today. How have you been feeling since our last meeting? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling less anxious about interacting with Zhao. Talking to him helped me quite a bit. I'm hopeful about building a better friendship with him.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It sounds like you’ve noticed some positive changes. What specific thoughts or feelings do you think helped reduce your anxiety about interacting with Zhao?

User: I used to think he wouldn’t want to talk to me, but after our conversation, I realized he's friendly and easy to talk to. That really changed my perspective.

Consultant: It’s interesting how a single positive interaction can shift your thoughts. Can you share what emotions or thoughts came up for you before that conversation, and how they changed after?

User: Before, I felt really nervous and avoided him. Afterward, I felt relieved and even excited to talk to him more. I guess I realized it's okay to be myself around him.

Consultant: Those feelings of relief and excitement are wonderful! They suggest that you’re beginning to build confidence in social situations. What would it look like for you as you aim to develop a stronger friendship with Zhao?

User: I want to be able to start conversations more easily and not overthink things. Just to feel comfortable chatting with him about everyday stuff.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid goal. It’s good to want to engage in casual conversations. Have you thought about how you might start those conversations with him in a natural way?

User: Maybe I could ask him about his hobbies or interests, like what shows he watches? I think that could break the ice.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Asking about interests is a great way to connect. What are some hobbies or interests that you could share with him to keep the conversation going?

User: I like gaming and reading, so I could mention that. I think he might have similar interests.

Consultant: Perfect! Bringing up shared interests can really help establish a connection. How do you feel about taking that first step to initiate a conversation?

User: I feel a bit nervous about it, but also kind of excited. I want to try it.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous before a new interaction. It means you care about the outcome. What strategies do you think you could use to manage that nervousness before you talk to him?

User: Maybe I could take a few deep breaths and remind myself that it's just a conversation. I don't need to put too much pressure on myself.

Consultant: Deep breathing is an excellent strategy! It can help ground you in the moment. Remember, it’s about enjoying the conversation rather than focusing on a perfect outcome. What will you focus on during your first chat with him?

User: I think I’ll focus on listening and just having fun. I want to see where the conversation leads instead of worrying so much.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Focusing on the flow of the conversation can really take some pressure off. What do you think could be some possible outcomes of this new approach?

User: I guess we could become better friends, or at least I’d feel more comfortable around him. It’s nice to think that could happen.

Consultant: Absolutely! Building a friendship is often about taking small steps. How will you celebrate even the smallest progress you make in these conversations?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to something I enjoy, like getting my favorite snack or spending some time gaming after a successful chat.

Consultant: Rewarding yourself is a fantastic way to reinforce positive experiences! It can encourage you to keep going. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you’ve gained from our discussion about your social confidence?

User: I feel more prepared to talk to Zhao and more optimistic about our friendship. It’s encouraging to hear that my feelings and strategies can help.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! You're making strides, and it's clear you’ve reflected positively on your journey. Remember, building relationships takes time, and that’s okay. If you continue to apply these strategies, I believe you’ll see even more improvement. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. I feel more confident about moving forward now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li Zhi! I’m proud of your progress. If you ever need more support or want to share how things are going, I’m here for you. Good luck with your next conversation with Zhao!

User: Thank you! I’ll keep you updated.

Consultant: I look forward to hearing about your experiences! Take care and see you next time.
