Consultant: Hello, welcome to our session today, Xiaowang. Before we dive in, I’d like to hear about how you’re feeling right now, especially regarding your experiences living in the dormitory. What’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really frustrated and helpless. It's been hard to get along with my dorm mates since I moved in. Just recently, one of my roommates intentionally locked me out. It made me so angry and made me question if I can even fit in here.

Consultant: I can see why you’d feel that way—it sounds really challenging to navigate a new social environment, especially when you're facing situations like being locked out. Let’s explore how this situation has affected you. Can you share more about your feelings during that incident? 

User: I felt really alone and angry. It seemed like they were deliberately trying to exclude me. I don’t understand why they would do that. It feels like no matter what I try, I just can’t connect with them.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly hurtful. Feeling excluded can evoke such strong emotions. Let’s take a moment to reflect on that anger. What thoughts went through your mind when you were locked out? 

User: I thought that they must not like me or that I’m a burden. It just reinforced the feeling that maybe I don’t belong anywhere.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really tough to carry. It seems you’ve connected your roommates’ actions to your self-worth and sense of belonging. Can we explore that connection a bit? How do these thoughts impact your mood and interactions with them? 

User: It’s like I get so angry that I start to avoid them even more. I’m tired of feeling like this, but I don’t know how to change it.

Consultant: It makes sense to want to avoid a situation that feels painful. However, avoiding could also strengthen those negative feelings. What would you like your interactions with your roommates to look like instead? 

User: I want to be able to talk to them without feeling so tense and angry. I’d like to be able to handle conflicts better if they come up.

Consultant: That’s a great goal—wanting to improve your communication and conflict resolution skills. Let’s break this down. Can you recall a time when you managed to communicate well with someone, perhaps before you moved in? 

User: Back in high school, I could talk to my classmates easily. There weren’t any issues like this. I guess I just feel overwhelmed now.

Consultant: It’s helpful to remember those times when you felt more at ease socially. It shows you have the ability to connect with others. Would it help if we looked at some strategies to build those skills again? 

User: Yes, that would be good, but I worry about whether I can really change anything.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have doubts, especially when facing new challenges. What if we started with small steps? For instance, identifying one specific situation to address directly with your roommates. What do you think about that?

User: That sounds manageable. Maybe I could start with the issue of being locked out? But I’m scared of how they might react.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel scared, but addressing the situation directly might help clarify misunderstandings. How could you approach that conversation in a way that feels safe for you?

User: I guess I could calmly express how that made me feel and ask why it happened. But what if they don’t care?

Consultant: That is a possibility, and it’s valid to feel apprehensive. However, sharing your feelings might lead to a productive conversation. What evidence do you have that suggests they wouldn’t care? 

User: I don’t really have any evidence. It’s just how I feel based on their actions so far.

Consultant: Sometimes our feelings can be shaped by our previous experiences but don’t always reflect the reality. If a friend were in your position, what advice would you give them?

User: I would tell them to give it a chance and not assume the worst.

Consultant: Exactly! That perspective can be valuable for you too. What’s one small step you can take today towards having that conversation?

User: I could write down what I want to say first. That might help me feel less anxious about it.

Consultant: That sounds like a helpful strategy to organize your thoughts and approach the conversation with more confidence. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit more reassured. Writing it down makes it seem less daunting.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time. As we wrap up, what do you feel will be your biggest challenge moving forward with this plan?

User: I think just putting it into action will be a challenge for me. I might overthink it and avoid the situation again.

Consultant: It’s possible, but by preparing and taking that initial step, you’re already on a positive path. How can you remind yourself of this progress next time you feel hesitant?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal about my feelings and progress. That way, I can reflect on how far I’ve come.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea, Xiaowang! Reflecting on your journey can provide you with motivation. As we conclude today, let’s acknowledge how far you've come already and the tools you have to build stronger connections with your roommates. 

User: Thank you. I feel a bit less overwhelmed and more ready to tackle this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome. Just remember you’re not alone in this process, and it’s okay to reach out again if you need support. Best of luck with your conversation—I believe you can do it!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Wang! I’m glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling quite overwhelmed. The situation with my roommate has left me feeling even more downcast. I try to reach out, but things just seem to get worse.

Consultant: I’m sorry to hear that. It sounds really challenging to navigate those interactions with your roommate. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened during your last conversation with her?

User: Well, I thought I was being friendly, but it turned into an argument. I just wanted to understand her better, but it ended up causing more tension. Now, I feel like I’m walking on eggshells around her.

Consultant: That sounds frustrating and upsetting. It’s difficult when you try to make a connection, and it backfires. What thoughts cross your mind when you think about your communication with her?

User: I start to doubt my ability to communicate. I wonder if I just don’t know how to talk to people anymore. What if she never wants to be friends?

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way, especially after a difficult interaction. Let’s explore those thoughts. What evidence do you have that you’re incapable of communicating well?

User: Well, I guess there have been a few misunderstandings lately. But I also remember times when I’ve connected with others, like in high school. Maybe it’s just that I’m not in my comfort zone anymore.

Consultant: You’ve pointed out some valid experiences. Transitioning to university life can indeed disrupt familiar patterns. How about we work on recognizing some of those positive past experiences and building on them? What do you think?

User: That sounds good! I’d like to feel more confident in my interactions.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start by identifying specific examples from your past interactions that went well. Can you recall a particular moment when you felt confident while talking to someone?

User: Yes, there was this group project in high school. I contributed ideas, and everyone appreciated them. I felt like my voice mattered.

Consultant: That’s a powerful example! You had a positive role in the group, and it affirmed your communication skills. How can we take that experience and apply it to your current situation with your roommate?

User: I guess I could focus on being more assertive and sharing my thoughts clearly, just like I did back then.

Consultant: Absolutely! Assertive communication can help you express yourself without causing conflict. Let’s practice how you might initiate a conversation with your roommate next time. What would you say?

User: Maybe I could start by saying, “Hey, I’d really like to talk about how we can make things better between us.” 

Consultant: That’s a great start. It’s open and shows your willingness to improve the situation. How do you think your roommate might respond to that?

User: She might be surprised, but hopefully it will encourage her to be more open too.

Consultant: Exactly, it could open up a dialogue. Remember, it’s about creating a safe space for both of you to express your feelings. What other strategies could you use to stay calm if the conversation starts to get tense?

User: I could take deep breaths and remind myself to listen without interrupting.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Deep breathing can really help you remain grounded. How do you feel about trying to implement these strategies in your next encounter with her?

User: I feel somewhat hopeful. It seems manageable to try these techniques.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! It sounds like you’re ready to take small steps. As we move forward, it might also help to reflect on your feelings after the conversation. How can you check in with yourself afterward?

User: I could write down how I felt after talking to her, both the good and the challenging parts.

Consultant: Fantastic! Journaling can provide insights and help you track your progress. Let’s also discuss how you might cope if things don’t go as planned. What would you tell yourself in that case?

User: I might remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes. It doesn’t mean I won’t improve over time.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset, Xiao Wang. Mistakes are part of the learning process. Lastly, as we prepare to wrap up today, what are your biggest takeaways regarding your communication skills?

User: I feel like I have more tools now to handle conversations, and I see that I can learn and grow from my experiences.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Remember, building relationships takes time and practice. You’ve already made strides today! If you find yourself needing support in the future, I’m here for you.

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help and guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Wang! I’m proud of your efforts. Take care and remember to be kind to yourself in this process. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaowang! It's great to have you here for our session today. I'm eager to hear about your progress and any thoughts you might have since our last conversation.

User: Hi! I'm feeling a bit better about my communication with my roommate. We had a positive chat recently, but I'm still unsure about how to maintain that improvement over time.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you felt some progress in your communication! It’s completely natural to feel a bit uncertain about sustaining those changes. Let’s explore how you can build on that positive interaction. What aspects of your discussion do you think made it go well?

User: I used some new techniques that I learned. I tried to listen more and express my thoughts clearly without getting overwhelmed. It felt good, but I'm still worried about how it will go the next time.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Using those listening skills and expressing yourself clearly are great steps toward improving your communication. When you think about the next time you interact, what specific concerns are coming to your mind?

User: I’m worried that my roommate might not respond positively again. What if I get nervous and can’t use those techniques as effectively as last time?

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel anxious about future interactions, especially when you want things to go well. Let’s think about how you can prepare for those conversations. How about we role-play a typical conversation you might have with your roommate? This way, you can practice and build your confidence.

User: That sounds helpful! I could try that. I just hope I don’t mess it up.

Consultant: No pressure, Xiaowang! Remember, this is a safe space to practice. It’s okay to make mistakes; that’s part of learning. Let’s imagine a scenario where you want to discuss something important with your roommate. What might that topic be?

User: I think I might want to talk to her about sharing chores. I feel like I’m doing more than my fair share.

Consultant: That’s a great topic to discuss! How would you start the conversation? You can use your new skills here.

User: I could say something like, "Hey, can we talk about how we’re handling the chores? I feel a bit overwhelmed."

Consultant: That’s a nice way to approach it! You’re being clear about the issue while also keeping it open for dialogue. How do you think your roommate might respond to that?

User: I’m not sure. What if she feels attacked or gets defensive?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It might help to frame your feelings using “I” statements, like, “I feel overwhelmed when I take on more chores.” This focuses on your experience rather than placing blame. Do you think that could work?

User: Yes, I think that would help. It sounds less confrontational.

Consultant: Exactly! By communicating your feelings this way, it encourages a more constructive conversation. Let’s practice that—try saying your statement again, incorporating the “I” feeling component.

User: Okay. "I feel overwhelmed when I take on more chores, and I’d like to find a way for us to share the work more evenly."

Consultant: That’s a fantastic way to express your feelings! It’s clear and invites collaboration. If she responds defensively, what might you do?

User: Maybe I could ask her how she feels about the chores and see if we can work it out together.

Consultant: That’s a thoughtful approach! Encouraging her to share her perspective can help ease tension. Remember, the goal is to have a dialogue, not a confrontation. How confident do you feel about implementing this strategy in your next chat?

User: I feel a bit more confident after practicing with you. I still worry about her reaction, but I think I can try it.

Consultant: That’s a positive step, Xiaowang! It’s key to keep pushing through those worries. How about we discuss ways to handle any rejection or pushback from your roommate, just in case it happens?

User: Yes, that would be really helpful. I just don’t want to feel discouraged.

Consultant: Absolutely, managing the feelings of disappointment is important. If she reacts negatively, remind yourself that it’s not a reflection of your worth or effort. You can say something like, “I understand this may not be easy for you to discuss, but I really want us to find a solution together.” How does that resonate with you?

User: That makes sense. It feels supportive rather than confrontational. 

Consultant: Exactly! Supporting each other opens the door to better communication. What other situations do you think you could apply these techniques to?

User: Maybe with other friends in the dorm? I feel like I could use them in group activities as well.

Consultant: Great insight! Applying these skills in various scenarios will help solidify your confidence. Would you like to try discussing a situation with a friend where you could use these techniques?

User: Sure! I sometimes struggle with group projects. It would be good to ask for others’ opinions.

Consultant: Let’s practice that. How would you approach your friends about contributing to a group project?

User: I could say, "I really value your ideas, and I’d like to know what you think about how we can divide the work."

Consultant: That’s an excellent way to invite their input! By emphasizing their ideas, you’re encouraging collaboration. How do you feel about using this approach?

User: I feel more ready to engage with them now. I think I can do it! 

Consultant: Wonderful! Building this dialogue with your friends will help strengthen your connections. Before we finish our session, what are your thoughts on the progress we've made today?

User: I’m glad we practiced together. I feel a bit less anxious about conversations and how to handle potential difficulties.

Consultant: I’m so happy to hear that! Remember, progress takes time, and it's okay to feel a mix of emotions along the way. Keep using those effective communication strategies, and know that you have the ability to navigate any challenges that arise. If you need to discuss anything further, I’m here for you.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I’ll keep practicing what I’ve learned.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaowang! I believe in your ability to make these changes. Just remember to be patient with yourself as you continue to grow. I look forward to hearing how things go in our next session. Take care!

User: Bye! I will try my best!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Wang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit down because I tried to invite my roommate to hang out, but she turned me down. It really disappointed me. 

Consultant: I see, that sounds tough. Experiencing rejection, especially when you're trying to reach out, can be quite disheartening. What did you feel when she declined your invitation?

User: I felt really disappointed and a bit discouraged. I thought I was making an effort, but it seemed like it didn't matter. 

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. Rejection can make us question our efforts and even our self-worth. Despite that, there’s a part of you that wants to keep trying, right?

User: Yes, I do want to keep trying. I just need some tips on how to handle rejection better and continue making friends.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! We can definitely work on that. Let's first explore what thoughts came to your mind when your roommate said no. Can you share those with me?

User: I kept thinking that maybe she doesn't like me or that I’m not interesting enough to hang out with.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really difficult to deal with. Let’s challenge them a bit. Do you think that one rejection necessarily means you’re not likable or interesting?

User: I guess not, but it still feels that way sometimes.

Consultant: I can see why it would feel that way, but it’s important to remember that rejection can happen for a variety of reasons—sometimes it has nothing to do with us personally. How about considering other explanations for her response? 

User: Maybe she was busy or just not in the mood to hang out. I didn't think of that before.

Consultant: Exactly! Sometimes, the reasons might be unrelated to you. What if you reframe your thoughts about rejection this way: "It's not about me, it's about her situation”? How do you think that could affect your feelings?

User: That would help me not take it too personally. I think I can handle it better if I see it that way.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! Remember, every attempt to reach out is a step forward, regardless of the outcome. Now, can we brainstorm some other strategies for reaching out to new people?

User: Sure! I’d like to hear some suggestions.

Consultant: Great! One approach is to join activities or clubs that interest you. This way, you can meet people with similar hobbies. What interests you?

User: I like reading and painting. I could look for a book club or an art class.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful options! Engaging in activities you enjoy can help foster connections more naturally. Have you considered inviting multiple people to an activity instead of just one?

User: I haven't, but that could work! If some can't make it, there might still be others who will come.

Consultant: That’s a smart idea! It reduces the pressure on any one interaction and maximizes your chances of meeting new friends. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds much better! I'm feeling a bit excited about the possibilities now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s important to stay open to different possibilities. How about we establish some specific goals for reaching out this week?

User: I could look for a book club online and send a message to see if they’re meeting soon.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Setting this goal can help build your confidence and practice resilience. How do you feel about trying this?

User: I feel good about it! I’m ready to take that step.

Consultant: Fantastic! Remember, it’s all about the journey and learning along the way. After this week, we can discuss how it went and what you learned from the experience. 

User: I’m looking forward to it. I hope to have something positive to share.

Consultant: I believe you will! You have the right mindset, and that’s crucial. Can we also talk about ways to celebrate your small victories, even if they’re just reaching out?

User: Yes! I think I could treat myself to something nice after each time I try to meet someone new.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful way to reinforce positive behavior! Celebrating small successes can really boost your confidence. How do you feel about invoking that kind of self-reward system?

User: It seems motivating! I think I’ll enjoy the process more if I have something to look forward to.

Consultant: Absolutely! Making it enjoyable is key. Before we wrap up, what else would you like to address or solidify today?

User: I think we’ve covered a lot! I feel more confident about facing rejection now and exploring social opportunities. 

Consultant: That’s great to hear, Xiao Wang! You've made substantial progress today. Remember, building connections takes time, so be patient with yourself. We’ll revisit these strategies in our next session.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and I’m excited to see how things go.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep that positive attitude, and remember to celebrate each step along the way. I’m looking forward to hearing your updates in our next meeting. Take care!

User: You too! Bye!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaowang! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling more confident lately, especially after meeting someone in a group activity. I’m excited about my new social life at university. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like making that connection really impacted your feelings positively. Can you tell me a bit more about your experience in that group activity?

User: Sure! I joined a volunteer group and met a girl who shares my interests. We had a lot of fun discussing our hobbies, and it felt great to relate to someone. 

Consultant: That sounds like a very enriching experience! Building connections like that can definitely boost your confidence. What do you hope to achieve in your social life moving forward?

User: I want to make more friends and feel comfortable in different social settings, not just in my dorm. 

Consultant: That's a good goal. It can help broaden your social network. What do you think might help you engage more in social situations outside your dorm?

User: Maybe if I could join more clubs or activities, that would help. I'm just a bit nervous about meeting new people again. 

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel nervous about meeting new people. Can we explore what thoughts go through your mind when you think about joining new activities?

User: I often think, what if I don't fit in or what if no one talks to me? Those thoughts make me hesitate. 

Consultant: Those thoughts can definitely create a barrier. Have you considered how likely those situations are or if there might be other outcomes?

User: I guess I haven't really thought about it that way. It feels very real, though, when I think about it. 

Consultant: It’s common for those thoughts to feel real and overwhelming. Let's challenge them a little. Do you think it’s possible that others might be feeling just as nervous or would be open to making new friends too?

User: That’s true! Everyone is in the same boat, right? Maybe I’m not the only one feeling anxious about meeting new people.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sometimes realizing that you’re not alone can help alleviate some of that anxiety. What might be a small step you could take to put yourself out there?

User: I could start by attending a club meeting. Just one meeting to see how it goes.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Setting a small, manageable goal can make it less daunting. How do you feel about committing to that?

User: I feel a bit excited—and nervous. But I think I can do it!

Consultant: That’s a good mix of emotions to have! It means you’re pushing your comfort zone but still feeling hopeful. If you do decide to go, what’s your game plan for that meeting?

User: I think I’ll try to introduce myself to at least one person. Just start a simple conversation.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! A simple introduction is a great way to break the ice. What’s something about yourself you could share that would be approachable?

User: I could talk about my hobbies, like painting. I think people respond well to that.

Consultant: Great choice! Sharing a hobby is an excellent conversation starter. How do you think you could follow up if the conversation goes well?

User: If we hit it off, I could suggest hanging out again or maybe attending another group event together.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! It encourages forming a deeper connection. How does this all make you feel about your ability to socialize moving forward?

User: I feel more confident. It seems more achievable now, like it’s not just a far-off goal.

Consultant: That's excellent progress! Remember that each positive interaction reinforces your social skills. Is there anything specific you want to work on before our next session to help maintain this momentum?

User: I could keep a journal of my social experiences, especially noting any positive interactions or feelings.

Consultant: That would be a valuable tool! Reflecting on your experiences can enhance your self-awareness and reinforce positive thoughts. When we meet next, we can review those insights together. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good to me! I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiaowang! You’re making significant strides in your journey. Keep focusing on those positive interactions, and we’ll build on it together next time. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'll see you in our next session, and I can't wait to hear about your experiences. Take care! 

User: See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaowang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially regarding your new social interactions?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling really good. I've connected with some new friends from campus activities, and I've received positive feedback on my social skills. I feel more confident.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! It sounds like you've made meaningful connections and your confidence has grown. Let’s take a moment to reflect on those experiences. What specific aspects of your social interactions have you enjoyed the most?

User: I liked participating in group discussions and feeling comfortable sharing my thoughts. I also enjoyed making plans to hang out with my new friends. It felt great to be included.

Consultant: Being involved in discussions and making plans is a wonderful sign of social progress. It must feel rewarding to be included. Have you encountered any challenges at all in these new interactions, or is it mostly positive?

User: Honestly, it’s mostly positive, but sometimes I worry about whether I’m saying the right things or if they actually enjoy my company.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to have those concerns when you start forming new relationships. Let's explore those worries a bit more. Can you share a specific situation where you felt uncertain about your interactions?

User: Well, there was one time during a group project when I felt like I was talking too much. I wondered if I was annoying my teammates.

Consultant: I see. It’s understandable that you would feel that way. What were your thoughts at that moment? How did that make you feel about yourself in the group?

User: I thought I might be overwhelming them, and it made me feel anxious. I was worried about ruining our teamwork.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Xiaowang. It's essential to recognize those feelings of anxiety. Let’s think about it critically—how much evidence do you have that your teammates found you overwhelming? Could there be another perspective?

User: I don’t really know. They didn’t mention anything, and they seemed engaged. I guess I just assumed I was too much.

Consultant: That’s a great realization. Sometimes, our thoughts can lead us to an exaggerated conclusion. If a friend were in your situation, what would you advise them to consider about their contributions to the group?

User: I would probably tell them that as long as everyone is participating and enjoying the collaboration, it’s okay to share thoughts openly.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a supportive perspective. It sounds like you’re already aware of how to approach these situations positively. How might you apply this understanding in future interactions?

User: I could remind myself to focus on the group dynamic and trust that if something bothers them, they’ll let me know. I should also be more confident in my contributions.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy strategy! Building that trust in your interactions will help you feel more at ease. To help sustain your connections, do you have any specific activities or plans with your new friends coming up?

User: We’re planning a study session next week, and I’m excited! I want to contribute ideas on how we can organize our study time.

Consultant: That’s an excellent opportunity! It sounds like you’re taking a leadership role in that context. What strategies might you use to ensure everyone feels included and valued during that study session?

User: I could ask for everyone's input before we start and make sure everyone gets a chance to share their thoughts.

Consultant: Perfect approach! Engaging everyone in the planning will not only include them but also reinforce your confidence in leading discussions. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel really good! It feels empowering to take charge, but I’m still a little nervous.

Consultant: It's great to acknowledge that you’re feeling empowered yet a bit nervous. That’s perfectly okay! Remember, feeling nervous is part of stepping out of your comfort zone. Would you like to practice some positive affirmations or thoughts you could use before the session to calm those nerves?

User: Yes, I think that would help. Maybe reminding myself that I’m capable and that it’s okay to make mistakes could be good.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reassuring yourself of your capabilities and embracing the idea that mistakes are natural can be very freeing. Let’s set a few affirmations to consider—would you like me to help you craft those?

User: Yes, please! 

Consultant: How about something like, “I am confident in my ability to contribute, and I welcome feedback from my peers”? Does that resonate with you?

User: Yes, that sounds really nice! I can say that to myself before the study session.

Consultant: I'm glad you like it! In addition to this affirmation, what other steps could you take to prepare for your upcoming social interactions?

User: Maybe I could think of a few fun conversation starters to help ease any awkward moments.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Preparing some conversation starters can alleviate pressure and promote enjoyable dialogues. What are some starters you might consider?

User: I could ask about everyone's favorite study techniques or share tips that have worked for me.

Consultant: Those are fantastic starters! They invite sharing and can lead to helpful discussions. As we wrap up today, what do you feel has been your most significant insight or takeaway from our session?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is to trust in my abilities and remember that it’s okay to be myself while engaging with my friends.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, Xiaowang! You've made significant progress toward maintaining your social connections. I'm confident that you have the skills to navigate your future interactions. If you encounter challenges, you now have strategies to help you along the way. How do you feel about everything we discussed?

User: I feel really positive! I’m grateful for your help in shaping my thoughts and strategies.

Consultant: You’ve done all the hard work, and it’s been a pleasure to support you. Remember, you can always reach out if you need guidance in the future. This session is a wonderful conclusion to our work together for now. Take care, and I wish you all the best with your social experiences!

User: Thank you! I’ll keep practicing and stay in touch!
