Consultant: Hello Xiaoma! I'm really glad you decided to come back for another session today. It seems like you've been going through a tough time recently. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling regarding school and your studies?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling really overwhelmed and frustrated. With the upcoming class split for junior year, I can't help but compare myself to my classmates who are doing much better than me. It makes me question if school is even worth it sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure and doubt about your place in school. I understand how those feelings can be overwhelming. What do you think has contributed to this sense of questioning the value of your education?

User: I think it's the pressure to perform well, especially with my friends. I feel like I'm just not good enough, and sometimes I wonder if I should just drop out. I felt confused after thinking about that but decided to return to school anyway.

Consultant: It seems like you’re caught in a cycle of comparison and self-doubt, and returning to school might have felt like a difficult decision. Can you share more about what led you to ultimately decide to come back to school?

User: I realized that despite my struggles, I didn't want to give up on my goals of joining the art program. I still have a passion for it, but it feels hard to keep that motivation when I can't see my grades improving.

Consultant: That's a positive insight! Recognizing your passion for art is important. It sounds like your motivation is being overshadowed by the pressure of achieving certain grades. Can we explore some of the thoughts you have about your current study situation?

User: Sure, I often think that no matter how hard I try, it's never enough. I feel like my efforts don’t reflect in my grades, so I just end up feeling defeated.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that—feeling like your efforts aren’t translating into results can be so discouraging. Can you recall a specific moment recently where you felt particularly hopeless about your studies? What thoughts were going through your mind?

User: Last week, during a study session, I felt completely lost. I thought, "Why am I even trying? It's useless anyway." I ended up playing video games instead.

Consultant: That sounds like a tough moment for you. It’s understandable that you turned to something that brings you joy when studying feels overwhelming. Let’s dig into that thought of “it’s useless.” How much evidence do you think supports that belief? Are there instances where your efforts did lead to positive outcomes?

User: Well, there have been times when I did better on tests after studying, but those moments feel few and far between compared to all my struggles.

Consultant: So, while it feels like your struggles are more prominent, you do have some evidence of success. Let’s challenge that belief. If a friend were feeling the same way you do, how would you encourage them to think about their efforts?

User: I would probably tell them that they're not defined by just one test or grade, and that their efforts can still lead to growth over time.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! You clearly have a compassionate way of thinking about others. Now, how can we translate that same kindness to yourself? What could be a more balanced thought to hold about your situation right now?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that it's okay to struggle and that progress doesn't always show in grades. I just need to focus on my love for art and keep trying my best.

Consultant: Absolutely! Emphasizing your love for art and acknowledging that effort is part of the journey can provide you with a healthier mindset. How does it feel to shift your focus from just grades to your passion?

User: It feels a bit relieving, actually. I think by concentrating on what I enjoy, I might find it easier to engage in my studies.

Consultant: That's a great realization, Xiaoma! Engaging more with what you love can definitely make a difference. Could we explore some activities related to art or school that might help reignite your passion while also easing some pressure?

User: I’d love to join an art club or maybe work on a project that relates art to my school subjects. That might make things more fun.

Consultant: Joining an art club sounds like a fantastic idea! It could provide you with the support of peers who share your interests, and working on a project could help connect your studies with your passion. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds really promising! I think it would help me see the purpose in what I’m learning.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that you’re feeling more hopeful! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we've discussed. It seems you’ve recognized the need to be kinder to yourself and to focus on your passion for art as a motivator for your studies. 

User: Yes, I feel more equipped to handle my feelings about school now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s important to continue recalling those positive moments when you felt successful. As we go forward, think about ways to implement what we discussed. You’re capable of creating a balanced approach. 

User: I will definitely try to remember that!

Consultant: Great! If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed again, know that it’s okay to seek support. You have a lot of potential, and I believe in your ability to manage these feelings. This has been a productive session, and I look forward to hearing how things go for you next time.

User: Thank you! I'm feeling a bit better already. See you next time!

Consultant: See you next time, Xiaoma! Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Little Ma! I'm really glad you came in today. I understand you’ve been feeling some pressure with school and your mother's expectations. Can you tell me a little more about how you're feeling right now?

User: Hi! Yeah, I've been feeling really overwhelmed. My mom expects a lot from me, especially since I’ve been home for a week and playing video games instead of studying. It just feels like I'm stuck and have no freedom at school.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling trapped between your mom's expectations and your own interests. The pressure you're under can really make things difficult. What do you think contributes most to your feelings of being overwhelmed?

User: I think it's mainly the pressure to perform well at school. I see my friends doing really well, and it just makes me feel worse about myself and my goals.

Consultant: That comparison can definitely add to your anxiety. You mentioned that you want to explore your interest in art. How do you think exploring art might help you feel differently about school and your goals?

User: I guess art is something I really enjoy, and I sometimes think about how much I want to be in the art class. But with my grades, I don't think that's possible.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you have an interest in art! Let’s take a moment to reassess your goals. What if we found a way to incorporate your love for art into your learning? How would that feel?

User: I’d like that! But I still worry that I won’t be able to keep up with the academic part, you know?

Consultant: That’s understandable. Balancing interests and responsibilities can be tricky. How about we set some small, manageable goals related to your art while also allowing you to improve your academic standing? What do you think?

User: That could work… maybe I can set aside some time each week just for art without feeling guilty about my schoolwork?

Consultant: Exactly! By dedicating time to something you enjoy, you can relieve some of that pressure. What if we turned that into a specific goal for the week—like spending an hour or two on art each week?

User: That sounds doable. But I worry I won’t be able to focus on my studies unless I do everything perfectly.

Consultant: Perfection can be a heavy burden to carry. Let's explore that thought a bit more. What would happen if things didn't go perfectly? Can you think of someone who could remind you that it's okay to have a mix of achievements and setbacks?

User: I guess my friends are more supportive. They understand when I struggle. Maybe I need to remind myself that it’s okay to not be perfect at everything.

Consultant: That's a great insight! It’s really important to have that support and to treat yourself with kindness. How can you remind yourself of that when you start feeling anxious about schoolwork?

User: I could write it down or talk to my friends more about it when I’m feeling low.

Consultant: Writing it down sounds like a solid plan! Keeping those reminders visible could help you shift your mindset. As you look at balancing your art and studies, have you thought of any small steps you'd like to take this week?

User: I think I could start by setting a specific time for both art and studying. Maybe after school, I could take an hour to draw before hitting the books.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfectly balanced approach! Dedicating time to your passion will balance the stress from academics. If you find this beneficial, what might be your next step after this week?

User: Hopefully, I could do the same next week and gradually extend my art time if I feel okay with it.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! You’re already showing positive changes in how you think about learning and your responsibilities. How do you feel about the progress we've talked about today?

User: I feel lighter. It’s nice to think about blending what I love with school instead of just feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! You'll be more likely to enjoy both the art and your studies this way. Remember it's all about progress, not perfection. Before we wrap up, what strategies will you keep in mind to deal with any pressure you feel from your mom or school in the future?

User: I’ll try to remind myself that it’s okay not to be perfect. I’ll also talk with my friends and maybe set some boundaries with my mom about studying, so I can focus on what I need.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies, Little Ma! You’re already taking important steps towards managing your feelings. Our journey together has been fruitful, and you’re moving in a positive direction. If you need more support down the road, feel free to come back anytime!

User: Thank you! I really appreciated our conversation today. I feel more hopeful now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of you for recognizing these changes. Have a great week ahead, and keep nurturing that spark for art!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ma! I'm glad to see you in today's session. I remember from our last conversation that you were starting to explore your interest in artistic performance. How have you been feeling about that since then?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more curious. I actually attended a club meeting, and I enjoyed it! But I'm still struggling with my schoolwork. It feels like I don’t have freedom there, and I often question whether it's worth it.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you enjoyed the club meeting! It sounds like your experience with artistic performance is sparking some interest. However, I understand that you still feel frustrated about school. Can you share more about what specifically makes you feel like you don't have freedom there?

User: Well, I often feel pressured to get good grades, but it just seems so pointless. I just want to explore things I enjoy, like art, instead of focusing so much on studying subjects I find boring.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling trapped between your desire to pursue art and the pressure to perform academically. That must be quite challenging for you. Let's discuss what aspects of art you enjoy the most. How do you think they could connect with your studies?

User: I really like expressing myself through art. It feels freeing to create something that reflects my thoughts. I wish I could do more of that in school, instead of all the tests and homework.

Consultant: That's a wonderful insight, Xiao Ma. Art allows you to express yourself, which is something that's very important. What if we could find ways to incorporate that creativity into your studies? How do you think art could make learning more enjoyable for you?

User: Maybe I could use art projects to help with school assignments? Like, instead of just writing papers, I could create visual presentations?

Consultant: Absolutely! That's a fantastic idea. Using art to express your understanding of a subject could make your learning experience much more engaging. How do you feel about starting to approach your assignments in this way?

User: I think it could be fun! But I’m worried that teachers won’t appreciate it or that it won’t be seen as serious.

Consultant: It's natural to feel that way, but remember, you can always communicate your ideas to your teachers. You might be surprised by their reactions! Have you considered discussing your ideas with them? 

User: Not really. I guess I haven't thought about how they'd respond. What if they just tell me to stick to traditional methods?

Consultant: That's a valid concern, but expressing your thoughts is part of growing as a student. If a teacher sees your passion for integrating art, they may be more open to it than you expect. You can always present it as a way to deepen your understanding. What do you think?

User: Yeah, that does make sense. I should at least give it a try. I dislike just following the same old routines anyway.

Consultant: Exactly! Trying new approaches shows that you're eager to learn and adapt.It's also a way to make learning feel more aligned with your interests. What steps do you think you could take to present this idea to your teachers?

User: I guess I could prepare a small example of how I might blend art with one of my subjects and then talk to my teacher about it.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Preparing a small example will help you demonstrate your ideas clearly, and it also shows your initiative. What subject would you like to start with?

User: I think I’ll start with history. I could create an artwork that represents a historical event or figure. 

Consultant: That's an excellent choice! Art can really bring history to life. Also, how would that make you feel about engaging with your history lessons?

User: It makes me feel a little excited! I think I could actually enjoy studying the topic if I can see it through an artistic lens.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Harnessing your artistic interest could help you develop a more positive connection with your studies. What other ways could you use your interest in art to motivate yourself academically?

User: Maybe I could set mini-projects for myself in different subjects that let me use my creativity. 

Consultant: I love that idea! Setting mini-projects could help you stay motivated while also giving you that creative outlet you enjoy. How do you think accomplishing these projects would affect your feelings towards school?

User: I think it could really boost my motivation. If I can see the connection between what I love and school, it might feel worth it.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! It’s all about finding ways to connect what you love to your academic responsibilities. As we wrap up today, what’s one thing you feel more confident about pursuing your interests now?

User: I feel more confident about reaching out to my teachers and showing them my ideas. I’m excited to give it a shot!

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Xiao Ma! Remember to celebrate your efforts and the progress you make. I believe in your ability to create that balance between your interests and academics. We'll continue to build on this in our next session. Take care!

User: Thank you! I'm looking forward to it!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ma! I'm really glad to see you again. How have things been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better lately. I got some positive feedback in my art class, and it made me feel good about my efforts. 

Consultant: That sounds wonderful, Xiao Ma! Receiving positive feedback can really boost your confidence. Can you tell me more about how that feedback made you feel?

User: It made me feel like I actually have talent and that I can do something right. It’s nice to hear that from my teacher, especially after feeling lost about school.

Consultant: I can see how that validation would be encouraging for you, especially since you’ve been grappling with feelings of doubt about school. How has this new confidence affected your approach to learning or studying?

User: I've started to feel a bit more motivated to actually try in my other classes, not just art. But sometimes, I still wonder if all this studying is really worth it.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling more motivated, but I understand that uncertainty can still linger. What specifically makes you question the value of studying?

User: I just feel like there are so many things I could be doing instead, like playing games or working on my art. Sometimes school feels restrictive and pointless.

Consultant: That makes sense. Balancing what you enjoy with your academic responsibilities can be challenging. Let’s explore more about what you enjoy and how we can connect that with your schoolwork. Can you recall a situation where studying felt particularly challenging for you lately?

User: Yeah, during math class, I just couldn’t focus. I kept thinking about how much I’d rather be drawing or gaming.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that. It sounds like there’s a conflict between your interests and the subjects that feel like obligations. Let’s try to pinpoint what aspects of math specifically are making it hard for you to sit through. What thoughts go through your mind when you’re in that class?

User: I keep telling myself, "This is so boring, I'll never use this anyway." It just feels pointless.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts create a barrier for you. What if we challenged that idea? How often do you think you might actually use some math skills in your art or future projects?

User: I guess some math could help with things like measuring or proportions in drawing, but it still feels tedious when I’m in class.

Consultant: That's a valid point. Math can be relevant in ways you might not immediately see. Let's consider how incorporating art into your learning could reshape your perspective. Would it help if there were art-related projects that required some mathematical skills? 

User: That could be interesting! If math was tied into an art project, I’d probably find it more engaging.

Consultant: Absolutely! Finding ways to connect your interests with academic subjects could help enhance your overall experience. What kind of art projects do you think would combine both math and creativity?

User: Maybe something like designing a mural, where I’d need to calculate sizes and proportions. That sounds fun!

Consultant: That does sound like a fun project! Working on something that excites you while applying mathematical concepts could help diminish that sense of pointlessness. Let’s also think about your study mindset—what small steps can you take to integrate this approach into your study habits?

User: I could ask my art teacher for some advice on projects that include math. That way, I can learn while doing something I like.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Reaching out for guidance can open up new avenues for learning. How does that make you feel, knowing you can create a bridge between your interests and your studies?

User: It makes me feel more hopeful! I like the idea that school could be more enjoyable if I focus on what I care about.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization, Xiao Ma. Balancing your interests with school is essential for finding enjoyment in both. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what we discussed. What are the main takeaways for you?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is that I can find ways to make school more connected to my interests, like combining math with art. It feels like a way to regain some freedom.

Consultant: Exactly! And remember, it’s crucial to see the value in both your passions and academics. As you pursue this art-related approach, how do you feel about your ability to navigate your studies moving forward?

User: I feel more confident! Knowing I can connect the two makes me excited to try.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Keep building on that confidence, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need support along the way. I believe you have what it takes to thrive both in art and your studies. Until next time, take care!

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ma! I'm glad you're here today. Last time we talked about your experiences in the drama team and how it’s affecting your view on schoolwork. How have you been feeling since we last met?

User: Hi! I've actually felt a bit better after joining the drama team. It’s nice to work with others, but I still struggle with my motivation for school. Sometimes I think all the studying is just a waste of time.

Consultant: It's great to hear that being part of the drama team has had a positive impact on you! It's understandable to feel that school can be overwhelming and not as enjoyable. Can you share more about what specific thoughts make you feel that way about studying?

User: I just feel like I’m not good at it. No matter how much I try, my grades aren’t improving. I wonder if I should just focus on things that make me happy, like acting and hanging out with friends.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Focusing on what makes you happy is important! However, it might be beneficial to explore the connection between those feelings and your thoughts about studying. What do you think those thoughts are telling you about your abilities or the importance of studying?

User: I guess they make me think I’m not smart enough. Like, if I can’t get good grades, what’s the point? But when I'm acting, I feel really capable and in control.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a big difference in how you view yourself in acting compared to studying. What if we examined those negative thoughts about studying? Do you think they might be a bit extreme or not entirely true?

User: Yeah, sometimes I feel I’m not smart at all, but other times I think maybe I just need to find a way to make studying more interesting.

Consultant: That's a fantastic insight! How might you make studying feel more engaging for yourself? Are there ways to connect your interests in acting or teamwork to your studies?

User: I could try studying with friends or maybe drama-themed study sessions where we act things out. That might be more fun!

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Using your interests and social connections can definitely make studying more enjoyable. How do you feel about setting up a plan to try this out in the coming week?

User: I think that's a good plan! It sounds fun and less boring than just sitting alone.

Consultant: Great! How about we think of some specific subjects or topics you could tackle together? What comes to mind?

User: Maybe English, since we have to analyze plays, and math because I really struggle with it.

Consultant: Perfect choices! Analyzing plays in a group could relate well to your drama experience. And for math, perhaps you can create a fun challenge or game with your friends. What do you think about that?

User: That could work! I could ask my friends to help me out. It feels less like studying when we’re together.

Consultant: Exactly! Working together can make a significant difference. As you think about this plan, how do you feel about your mindset towards studying now?

User: It's shifting a bit. I feel like I have more control. Maybe it won't be so bad if I incorporate things I enjoy.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! It seems like you’re beginning to see studying as something that can be part of your interests rather than just a chore. How might this change your perspective on school as a whole?

User: I think it could help. If I can keep finding ways to enjoy studying, I might feel different about going to school.

Consultant: Yes, absolutely! This positive approach can lead to a healthier view of school. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you've learned and what steps you'll take next.

User: I’ll try to set up study sessions with friends and relate them to my interests. I feel more motivated to do that.

Consultant: Sounds like a solid plan! Remember, it’s a journey, and every small step counts. What will you do if those negative thoughts about studying try to creep back in?

User: I think I’ll remind myself that I’m not just a student – I’m also an actor and a team player. I want to make studying fun.

Consultant: That’s an excellent perspective! You’re learning to challenge those thoughts actively. I believe you’re on the right path to balancing your interests with your studies. Thank you for sharing today, Xiao Ma. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!

User: Thank you! I feel more confident and ready to tackle this now.

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ma! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I've been thinking a lot about my future and school. After talking to my mom, I understand I need to have more realistic goals.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear. It sounds like the conversation with your mom helped you gain some clarity. What specific goals have you been considering for your studies and future?

User: I want to try to get into the art class. I really love drawing and painting, but my grades are not where they need to be. I feel stuck sometimes.

Consultant: Pursuing your passion for art sounds exciting! Let's explore your current study situation. What challenges do you face that make it hard for you to improve your grades?

User: I guess I just feel like school is a hassle. I often wonder why I even need to study. It feels like I can’t be free.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when you're not enjoying your subjects. Let's work together to find ways to make your studies feel more meaningful to you. What subjects are you most engaged with, besides art?

User: I like music a lot and I enjoy physical education. But the academic subjects just seem boring to me.

Consultant: That's a good insight! Music and physical education might give you some motivation. How about we think of ways to incorporate those interests into your study routine? 

User: I haven't thought about that. Maybe listening to music while studying could help me focus more or even draw things out, like sketching my homework?

Consultant: Those are fantastic ideas! Combining what you love with your studies can certainly make them more enjoyable. What would be a small, achievable goal you could set for this week to start?

User: I think I could try to set aside a little bit of time each day to draw while listening to music or maybe even try doing an art project related to my school subjects.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan, Xiao Ma! Drawing can help you express what you learn in a creative way. What do you think would be a good art project to relate to one of your subjects?

User: Maybe I could create a poster for a history topic? It would be fun to illustrate the events I like.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect way to blend learning with your artistic skills! How do you feel about breaking down that project into smaller tasks to keep it manageable?

User: I like that idea! I can sketch some ideas first, then start adding color and details each day. That makes it less overwhelming.

Consultant: Exactly! By breaking it down, it becomes easier to approach. How do you feel about your progress in managing your feelings toward school now?

User: I feel more hopeful. Having a plan makes it seem less stressful, and I can focus on something I actually enjoy.

Consultant: I'm proud of you for taking steps towards a more positive outlook. It's a big shift when you turn your focus to what you enjoy. How can you maintain this positive attitude when challenges arise in your studies?

User: I think if I remind myself of my goals and keep doing things I like, like art, it might help. Also, talking to my mom about my feelings really supports me.

Consultant: Communication is key! It sounds like you have a good support system in place. What else can you do to seek support or stay motivated as you work towards your goals?

User: I could ask friends who like art too to share ideas or maybe work on projects together. That could be fun!

Consultant: Collaborating with friends is a fantastic idea, Xiao Ma! Sharing your experiences and learning together can really motivate you. How do you feel about setting a time to check in on your progress next week?

User: I’d like that! It’ll keep me accountable and help me see how I’m doing. 

Consultant: Great! We can reflect on your achievements and anything that's challenging you. Let's make sure to celebrate your progress together. What are you most looking forward to this week?

User: I'm really excited about starting my art project. I want to make it something I'm proud of!

Consultant: That's a wonderful mindset to have! Focusing on what you're passionate about will drive you to succeed. Remember to give yourself grace as you learn. How will you remind yourself to stay on track throughout the week?

User: I’ll write down my goals and hang them up in my room. That way, I’ll see them every day.

Consultant: That's a smart strategy! Visual reminders can be powerful motivators. It sounds like you have everything set up for a productive week ahead. How do you feel about your overall progress today?

User: I feel really good! I’m excited to dive into my plans and see where it takes me.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! It sounds like you're embracing your potential and are ready to take on your academic challenges. Just remember, it's okay to ask for help if you need it. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xiao Ma! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. I look forward to hearing all about your progress next time. Remember, you are capable of achieving great things! 

User: Bye! I’m looking forward to our next session too!
