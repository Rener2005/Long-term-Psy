Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling lately, especially regarding your studies and internet use?

User: Hi. I feel really lost and frustrated. I recently failed all my courses and I didn't even attempt the retakes. I just can't stop gaming, and it's ruining everything for me. 

Consultant: I can see how overwhelming that must feel for you. You mentioned that you've been gaming excessively—what do you think drives you to spend so much time on it?

User: I guess it’s just an escape for me. It feels good to be in a different world, and I don't have to think about my problems. But I know it's not helping me at all. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to seek comfort in something that offers distraction. Let's explore that feeling a bit more—when you choose to play games, what thoughts or beliefs come up about why you prefer it over your studies?

User: I think I believe I can't succeed in studying anymore. I used to be good, but now it seems impossible. Gaming feels easier and more rewarding, while studying feels like a chore that leads to failure.

Consultant: It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of negative beliefs about your abilities. What do you think could be different if you viewed studying as something rewarding rather than just a chore?

User: I don't know… maybe I could find it enjoyable? But right now, I really can’t imagine that happening. 

Consultant: It makes sense that you feel stuck in that perspective. What if we worked on identifying some smaller steps that could help shift that view? For instance, can you think of any subjects or topics in your major that might actually interest you?

User: Well, I've always found programming a bit fun in the past, but these days, it just feels too daunting. 

Consultant: That’s a good starting point. How about we think about ways to reconnect with that interest? What if you set aside a small amount of time each week to explore programming projects or tutorials that excite you, without the pressure of grades?

User: I guess I could try that, but I’m not sure if I’ll stick to it. The temptation to game is so strong.

Consultant: That is a valid concern. Creating a structure can help. What if you combined gaming with learning? For example, you could reward yourself with gaming time after completing a small study session. How does that sound to you?

User: Mixing them sounds like a good idea, but I worry I might still spend too much time gaming. 

Consultant: It’s definitely something we can monitor. How about we set some clear boundaries for gaming time initially? For example, limit gaming to weekends only at first. Would that seem manageable for you?

User: Limiting it to weekends could work, but I might struggle with the urge during the week.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. What if we find some alternative activities to fill that time during the week? Is there anything you've enjoyed doing outside of gaming, like playing basketball or other hobbies?

User: I used to love playing basketball, but I've lost interest in that too. I think I forgot how much I enjoyed it.

Consultant: Rekindling that interest might be helpful! How about setting a goal to play basketball even just once this week? Engaging in physical activity can improve your mood and reduce some of that anxiety.

User: I guess I could try that. It might help me feel better, but I still worry about everything else.

Consultant: Those worries are valid. Let’s take it step by step. As you try these small changes, how do you think you might feel about yourself and your situation over time?

User: I hope I’d feel more in control and maybe regain some motivation. But it’s hard to believe that could happen.

Consultant: It’s a journey, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. Every small effort counts and contributes to building a new routine. What are your thoughts on sharing these small goals with someone who can help keep you accountable, like a friend or family member?

User: Having someone to check in with might help. I’ll think about who I could ask.

Consultant: That's a great idea. Accountability can make a difference. Let’s also recap what we’ve discussed today. You’ve identified your struggle with gaming and your desire to reconnect with your studies, particularly programming and basketball. What strategies do you feel ready to implement this week?

User: I’ll try to limit gaming to weekends, explore programming again, and play basketball at least once.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, it's important to be kind to yourself if things don't go perfectly. As we prepare to move forward, how do you envision our next steps together?

User: I want to figure out how to keep these habits going and maybe learn some new ways to deal with stress and boredom without gaming.

Consultant: Absolutely! Next time, we can focus on building those coping strategies and ensuring that the changes feel sustainable. Do you feel like there’s anything else you’d like to address before we wrap up today?

User: No, I think that covers it for now. I appreciate this session; it felt good to talk things out.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that. Keep in mind that progress takes time. I look forward to checking in on your journey next time. You’re not alone in this. Take care until we meet again!

Consultant: Hello, Z! It's great to see you here today. I understand you've been feeling some guilt and anxiety about your current situation compared to your classmates. Can we start by talking about what’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. Yeah, I’ve just been feeling really lost. I see my classmates studying hard for exams, and here I am, stuck playing games. It just makes me feel even worse about myself.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling quite frustrated and concerned about where you are compared to them. Can you tell me more about how that makes you feel and what thoughts come to mind when you compare yourself to your classmates?

User: I feel guilty and anxious. I keep thinking that I should be studying too, but I don’t know how to get myself to do it. Sometimes I think, "Why can’t I just be like them?"

Consultant: I hear you. It seems like this comparison is adding a lot of pressure on you. What do you think prevents you from studying?  

User: I think I just lack motivation. Even when I sit down to study, I can’t focus on anything. I end up just going back to gaming because it feels easier.

Consultant: That makes sense. It sounds like the games are providing a temporary escape from your feelings of anxiety and guilt. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come up when you try to study?

User: Yeah, I often think, “What’s the point?” It feels so overwhelming to catch up, and I doubt I can do it.  

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite powerful and can definitely make taking action feel more daunting. Let’s explore that for a moment. What evidence do you have that supports those thoughts, and what evidence might contradict them?

User: I guess I’ve done well in the past before when I studied hard. So maybe I could do it again? But it just feels so far from where I am right now.

Consultant: That's a valid point! You have succeeded before, and that shows you have the ability to achieve your goals. When you think about starting to study again, what steps do you think you could take to make it less overwhelming?

User: Maybe I could start with smaller goals, like studying just one hour a day or something. But I’m worried I won’t stick to it.

Consultant: Setting smaller goals is a great strategy! It's less intimidating and can help build your confidence. How about we brainstorm some specific, achievable goals that you’d feel comfortable starting with?

User: Okay, well, I could try to study one chapter of a subject each day. That sounds doable. 

Consultant: That does sound like a good plan! Now, let’s also think about your gaming. How much time do you spend on games each day, and what might happen if you cut that down a bit?

User: I usually spend around four to five hours a day playing games. If I cut it down, I guess I might have more time to study.

Consultant: It sounds like reducing your gaming time could give you the space to work on your studies. What hobbies or activities do you enjoy that you could also include during that time?

User: I used to play basketball a lot, but I stopped when I started gaming more. I think I’d like to pick it up again.

Consultant: Basketball sounds like a wonderful activity that could help you relieve stress and have some fun. How about integrating basketball into your weekly routine, along with your study goals?

User: That sounds great! Maybe I could go play on the weekends and fit in the studying during the week.

Consultant: That sounds balanced! By mixing physical activity with study times, you can create a routine that helps both your mental and physical health. Now, what are your thoughts on finding a way to communicate your feelings and plans with your family?

User: I haven’t really talked to them about this before. I'm worried they won’t understand how I feel or what I want to change.

Consultant: It can be tough to open up, especially if you're unsure about their reactions. Perhaps we can think about some ways you might express how you’re feeling and your desire to improve your situation? 

User: Maybe I could start by telling them I’m struggling with my studies and seeing if they have any advice. 

Consultant: That’s a good approach! Sharing your struggle could open the door for a supportive conversation. What would feel most comfortable for you when initiating that talk?

User: I think just being honest about my feelings is key. I hope they can see I want to make a change.

Consultant: Honesty is important, and it sounds like you're ready to take that step. Remember, it's about expressing your desire to improve, not just about the problem itself. How do you feel about our session today and the steps we’ve discussed?

User: I feel a bit hopeful actually. I think I have some ideas on how to start changing things and that makes me feel a little better.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Change can be a gradual process, but it sounds like you’re feeling more motivated to take control of your situation. Just remember to be kind to yourself along the way. We'll continue exploring these ideas in our next session. 

User: Yes, thanks! I appreciate our talk today. 

Consultant: You’re welcome, Z! I'm here to support you. Remember to take those first small steps, and I look forward to hearing how it goes next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. I understand there's been some pressure lately, particularly regarding your studies and family expectations. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling even more pressure, especially after talking to my parents recently. They asked about my academic progress, and it made me feel guilty and anxious because I know I haven't been doing well.

Consultant: It's understandable that the conversation with your parents would heighten those feelings. You want to improve your situation but feel stuck. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts went through your mind during that conversation?

User: I kept thinking about how disappointed they must be in me. I felt like a failure, and that made me even less motivated to study. It’s like I want to change, but I also don’t know where to start.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy burden of guilt and pressure. Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. Let’s explore them further. When you think about failing in your studies and your parents' disappointment, what emotions does that evoke for you?

User: I feel a mix of anxiety and sadness. Sometimes I even feel angry at myself for not being able to study effectively. It’s frustrating.

Consultant: That frustration is important to acknowledge. It seems like there are conflicting emotions at play—wanting to succeed but feeling held back. If you had to describe the beliefs driving these feelings, what would they be?

User: I believe that if I don’t succeed, I’m letting my family down. I think they expect me to achieve a lot because they sacrificed so much to get me to college.

Consultant: Those beliefs can certainly create immense pressure. You might be thinking that your worth is tied to your academic performance. Have you considered any evidence that might counters these beliefs?

User: I guess part of me knows that my parents love me regardless of my grades, but it’s hard to separate that love from their expectations.

Consultant: That's a valuable realization. Love and expectations can often feel intertwined. Let’s challenge that thought—if you were to tell a friend who feels similarly, what would you say to help them reframe their thinking about their situation?

User: I would probably tell them that their worth isn’t just based on their grades and that it’s okay to struggle sometimes. Everyone goes through tough periods.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective. Now, how can you apply that same kindness and understanding to yourself? What alternatives can you consider to support your mental well-being?

User: Maybe I can focus on improving a little each day instead of worrying about big expectations. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Small steps can lead to significant progress. What kind of small actions could you take this week to make studying feel more manageable?

User: I could set aside just 30 minutes a day to study or even just to review some materials, and try to reward myself afterward.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Setting a small, achievable goal and rewarding yourself afterward can help reinforce a positive mindset. What type of reward would you find motivating after your study sessions?

User: I love playing video games. I think I could play for a bit as a reward after I finish my study time.

Consultant: That sounds like a fun incentive! Balancing something you enjoy with your responsibilities can create a healthier routine. How do you feel about starting this approach and communicating with your parents about your current study plan?

User: It sounds reasonable to me. I think I could explain to them that I'm working on a plan to improve, even if it's gradual.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Clear communication can help ease some of the pressure you feel. How do you feel about having that conversation with your parents?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also relieved, because it might take some pressure off if they understand I'm trying.

Consultant: That's a natural feeling. Nervousness often comes with stepping into new territories. If you find the conversation challenging, remember to remind yourself of your goal to improve gradually, and that it's okay to seek their support rather than try to meet expectations alone. 

User: Yes, that makes sense. I can approach it more like a team effort rather than facing this alone.

Consultant: Exactly! Collaborative communication can often foster understanding. Let’s take a moment to practice some relaxation techniques. Have you tried any before?

User: Not really. I haven’t had the chance to focus on anything like that.

Consultant: How about we try a simple deep breathing technique together? It can help manage anxiety. Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and then slowly exhale through your mouth for a count of four. Ready?

User: Okay, I’ll give it a try.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start together. Inhale... hold... exhale... How did that feel?

User: It felt calming. I think I could benefit from doing that more often.

Consultant: It’s wonderful you felt that way! Incorporating breathing exercises into your routine can help you manage stress effectively. As we wrap up today, what are the key takeaways or strategies you want to focus on until we meet again?

User: I want to set small study goals each day and use that breathing technique when I start feeling anxious. Also, I hope to talk to my parents about my study plan.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals, and I’m proud of you for being proactive! It sounds like you’re beginning to find a sense of direction. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. If you ever find the pressure overwhelming, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you. I really appreciate your support today. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to hearing how your efforts go in our next session. Take care and keep practicing those techniques!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you are here for our session today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've actually been feeling a lot better recently. I've started playing basketball again and it's been really fun. I'm trying to reduce my time on video games too.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step! Engaging in basketball can be a great way to find joy and connectedness. What specific changes have you noticed since you started playing basketball?

User: I feel more energized and it's nice to be around other people again. I also feel a bit more accomplished than I did sitting at my computer all the time.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that. Feeling energized and accomplished can really boost your self-esteem. How do you think this new activity might impact other areas of your life, such as your studies or social interactions?

User: I think it could help me feel more focused in my studies because I’m taking breaks to do something I enjoy. Plus, I've made some new friends through basketball, which is great.

Consultant: That's a fantastic insight! Finding balance between activities you enjoy and your responsibilities is crucial. What short-term goals would you like to set to help you maintain this positive momentum with basketball and your studies?

User: I want to make sure I attend basketball practice at least three times a week and also set aside some time each day to study.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! Committing to basketball practice three times a week can definitely reinforce that sense of achievement. How do you feel about having a structured study schedule alongside it?

User: It sounds good, but I sometimes struggle with sticking to plans. I worry that I might end up playing video games instead.

Consultant: It's common to have those concerns. What strategies could you put in place to help you stick to your study schedule and resist the temptation to fall back into gaming? 

User: Maybe I could set specific times for studying and use a timer. Once I finish studying for the day, I can reward myself with playing some games.

Consultant: That sounds like a smart approach! Using a timer can create a sense of urgency and help you focus. Plus, rewarding yourself afterward is a nice incentive. How confident do you feel about sticking to this plan?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. I want to prove to myself that I can do this.

Consultant: Feeling a mix of nerves and excitement is completely natural. Remember, you're building new habits, and it's okay to have some ups and downs along the way. What will be your first step to implement this plan?

User: I think I will write down my schedule for the week and plan when I'll study and when I'll go to practice.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Writing it down not only helps with accountability but also allows you to visualize your commitment. How do you plan to adjust if something comes up and you can't stick to your schedule?

User: I guess I could allow myself to be flexible. If I miss a study session, I could make it up the next day rather than giving up completely.

Consultant: Flexibility is key in maintaining your progress! It’s great to hear you’re willing to adapt your plans rather than feeling like it’s all or nothing. What other activities might you include to enhance your routine without falling back into excessive gaming?

User: I’d like to read more books or maybe even learn something new online. That way, I’m still using my computer for something productive.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Redirecting your time on the computer towards learning can help satisfy your curiosity and prevent the urge to game too much. Which book or subject interests you the most right now?

User: I’ve been really interested in learning about artificial intelligence. I think it’s fascinating.

Consultant: Artificial intelligence is indeed a fascinating field! Perhaps you could set a small goal for the week, like reading a chapter or completing an online course lesson. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I think I can manage that along with my basketball practice and studies.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Balancing various interests can lead to significant personal growth. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I feel more confident about setting goals and know that I have a plan to manage my time better. I recognize my potential to improve.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! Acknowledging your potential is a big step forward. Remember, the progress you’ve made is commendable, and I encourage you to keep building on that. If you encounter challenges, just remember that you’ve developed strategies to help you along the way. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate the support and guidance.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm excited to hear how things go in our next session. Remember, take it one step at a time. Looking forward to our next conversation!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're here today. Let's talk about how you're feeling lately and about the progress you've made. How has everything been for you?

User: Hi! I’m feeling pretty good, actually. I recently completed a course project and got some really positive feedback from my teacher. It helped boost my confidence a lot.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It sounds like the feedback was a significant affirmation for you. How do you feel this success has changed your view on your abilities in general?

User: I feel more capable now. I used to think I was just falling behind and couldn’t catch up, but now I believe I can achieve more if I keep trying.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re feeling more capable! Recognizing your potential is an important step. How do you think you can maintain this positive momentum moving forward?

User: I guess I could try to focus more on my studies and set some new goals for myself. Maybe even keep a record of my achievements like a success diary?

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Keeping a success diary can really help in reinforcing your positive experiences. What kind of entries do you think you would want to include in your diary?

User: I could write down my assignments, achievements, and any positive feedback I receive. It could also help me reflect on how I approached tasks and what worked well.

Consultant: That sounds like a rewarding practice! Reflecting on your efforts can help you build on your successes. Have you thought about any specific goals you’d like to set for yourself in the coming weeks?

User: Yes! I want to aim for better grades this semester and maybe even join a club to meet new people. I think that could help balance my academic and social life.

Consultant: Those are great goals! Balancing academics with social activities can enrich your university experience. What steps do you think you can take to start working towards those goals?

User: For my studies, I could create a schedule to manage my time better. As for joining a club, I need to research what’s available on campus and attend a few meetings.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Creating a schedule can definitely help you manage your time more effectively. Have you thought about how you might keep yourself motivated while pursuing these goals?

User: I think reminding myself of the positive feedback I’ve received can help. Also, writing in my diary about my progress might reinforce my motivation.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflecting on positive feedback can be a powerful motivator. What would you say is your biggest concern about pursuing these new goals?

User: I sometimes worry that I might get overwhelmed or fall back into bad habits like before. I don’t want to end up neglecting my studies again.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It’s important to recognize those feelings. What strategies do you think you could use to prevent feeling overwhelmed while balancing your goals?

User: I could start with small, manageable tasks and gradually increase the difficulty. Also, if I feel stressed, I could talk about it or take short breaks.

Consultant: Great approach! Starting with small tasks and taking breaks can help you avoid burnout. How about tracking your feelings in your diary as well? This might help you better understand when you're feeling overwhelmed.

User: That’s a good idea! If I write about my feelings, I can spot patterns and maybe address them earlier. 

Consultant: Yes! By tracking your feelings, you'll be able to recognize when you might need a break or when you’re pushing yourself too hard. How confident are you feeling about starting this process?

User: I feel quite confident, actually! The feedback really helped, and I want to keep this positivity going. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Confidence is key in this journey. As you move forward, remember to celebrate every little success. How do you plan to celebrate your achievements?

User: Celebrating might be as simple as treating myself to something I enjoy, like a movie or a game night with friends. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fun and healthy way to reward yourself! Having something to look forward to can keep your spirits high. As we wrap up today, what do you think will be your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think realizing that I can set goals and record my progress is key. It's about building on what I’ve achieved and staying positive. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Building on your achievements is vital to maintaining that positive mindset. You have the skills to accomplish your goals. Remember, it's a journey, and I'm here to support you along the way.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. I feel more hopeful about the future now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad you’re feeling hopeful. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support. You've got this!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Z! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite hopeful lately. My counselor has been supportive, and I've started thinking about my future academic goals.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! You mentioned feeling hopeful and receiving support. Can you tell me more about the academic goals you've been considering?

User: Sure! I want to improve my grades and maybe even explore internships related to computer science. I feel like I can do better now.

Consultant: It's great that you're motivated to improve your grades and think about internships. Have you thought about specific steps you want to take to achieve those goals?

User: Well, I plan to create a study schedule to keep myself on track. I think I also need to limit my gaming time more strictly.

Consultant: A study schedule sounds like a solid plan! Limiting gaming time could really help you focus better. What motivates you to stick to this new schedule?

User: I really want to prove to myself that I can succeed in my studies and not just coast by. Seeing my improvements makes me feel good about myself.

Consultant: That's a powerful motivation! Acknowledging your improvements can be really encouraging. How do you plan to celebrate your achievements along the way?

User: I was thinking of rewarding myself with some leisure time or maybe playing games only after achieving certain study milestones.

Consultant: Rewarding yourself is a great way to stay motivated! Setting milestones can help you track your progress. What kind of milestones do you think would be helpful for you?

User: Maybe I could set goals for completing assignments or mastering certain topics in my courses. That seems manageable.

Consultant: That sounds very achievable! Setting specific goals can give you a clear direction. How do you feel about reaching out to your counselor or other resources at school if you need support?

User: I feel more open to it now. I realize it's okay to ask for help when needed. I think I will utilize those resources more.

Consultant: That’s an excellent mindset! Using available resources can enhance your learning experience. Do you have any concerns about the upcoming semester?

User: I worry a bit about managing my time effectively between studying and my personal life. Sometimes, I can get overwhelmed.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when balancing different aspects of life. How might we work on strategies to help you manage your time better?

User: Maybe I can break down tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces. That way, it wouldn't feel as daunting.

Consultant: Absolutely! Breaking tasks down can make them less intimidating. Would you like to outline a small step you might take this week to practice this approach?

User: I think I will start by outlining my study plan for one of my subjects. Just one subject to begin with sounds feasible.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic starting point! Focusing on just one subject allows you to channel your energy effectively. What do you hope to achieve by outlining your study plan?

User: I hope to gain a clearer understanding of what I need to study and how to allocate my time better. I think it will help reduce my anxiety.

Consultant: Having a clear study plan can indeed help ease anxiety. Once you complete it, how will you feel about your progress?

User: I think I’ll feel accomplished! It’ll be a step in the right direction, and I’ll be one step closer to my goals.

Consultant: Feeling accomplished is an important motivation! As we conclude our session, what are some key takeaways or strategies you plan to remember moving forward?

User: I’ll remember to outline my tasks, reward myself for milestones, and utilize school resources when I need guidance.

Consultant: Those are all excellent strategies! It sounds like you’re well on your way to achieving your goals. I’m really proud of the progress you’ve made. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. It feels good to have a clearer path ahead.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Z. It's truly inspiring to see your determination. Remember, you can always reach out if you need further assistance. Good luck with your studies, and take care!

User: Thanks again! I will. Goodbye!
