Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad to see you today. Last time we spoke, you mentioned feeling quite distressed about others' opinions after a disagreement with a colleague. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I've been thinking a lot about that situation. I still feel really sensitive about what others think of me, especially after that comment. It just lingers in my mind.

Consultant: I understand. It seems that the comment really stuck with you and impacted how you view yourself in relation to others. Can you share what specific thoughts or feelings have been coming up since that incident?

User: I keep wondering if my colleagues really think I'm incompetent. I feel like they don't understand me or my efforts, and that makes me anxious in social situations.

Consultant: It sounds really tough to feel misunderstood and anxious around your colleagues. When you have these thoughts, how do they make you feel emotionally? 

User: They make me feel really low. I start questioning my abilities and begin to doubt myself. Sometimes I feel like I shouldn't even be in the same workplace as them.

Consultant: That's a heavy burden to carry. It sounds like these feelings significantly affect your self-esteem. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come to mind during these moments of doubt?

User: Yes, I often think, "I'm not good enough," or "They must think I'm failing at my job." It's like a cycle of negativity that I can't escape.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Zhang. It appears that these thoughts are quite critical and harsh on yourself. What do you think would happen if you challenged those thoughts? 

User: I'm not sure how to challenge them. I sometimes feel like they’re just true. 

Consultant: That’s a common reaction, but remember, our thoughts can be unhelpful and distorted. What if we explore the evidence supporting those thoughts? What are some examples of situations where you did well at work?

User: Well, I have received positive feedback from my manager on a few projects. And I know my team values my input.

Consultant: That’s excellent! It sounds like there is evidence that contradicts your initial beliefs. If a friend was in your position and thinking those critical thoughts, what would you advise them to consider?

User: I would tell them to remember their successes and not to focus so much on a single negative comment.

Consultant: Exactly! You already have the insight to challenge that negativity. Let’s try to apply that to your own situation. How could you use that advice to reframe your thoughts about yourself?

User: Maybe I can remind myself of the positive feedback more often and not let one comment define my worth.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Focusing on the positive can help shift your mindset. Are there any specific affirmations or reminders you could use to help reinforce your self-worth?

User: I could make a note of my accomplishments and keep it at my desk. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Looking at your accomplishments regularly can serve as a powerful reminder of your self-worth. Would you be willing to commit to that for this week?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. 

Consultant: Fantastic! Additionally, let's also discuss how you can prepare yourself emotionally for interactions with your colleagues. How do you usually feel before socializing with them?

User: I usually feel anxious and worried about what they might think of me.

Consultant: Let’s work on some techniques to manage that anxiety. Have you ever tried grounding exercises or breathing techniques to calm yourself before such situations?

User: I haven't really tried that, but I'd be open to it.

Consultant: Great! A simple technique is to take a few deep breaths, focusing on inhaling slowly through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. Would you like to try it together now?

User: Sure, that sounds helpful.

Consultant: Let's take a deep breath in… and out. Great! If you practice this regularly, it can really help ground you when you start feeling anxious. How do you feel after doing that exercise?

User: I feel a bit more relaxed. It’s nice to focus on my breathing.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Consistently practicing this can create a positive habit. As we continue, are there specific scenarios where you anticipate feeling particularly sensitive about others' opinions that we could work on together?

User: Yes, there’s a team meeting coming up where I always dread sharing my ideas. 

Consultant: Let’s focus on that meeting then. What do you believe is the worst that could happen if you share your ideas?

User: I guess I’m afraid they might not take me seriously or think my ideas are silly.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those fears. However, let’s consider the possibility that your ideas might actually contribute positively. Can you think of ways to prepare yourself ahead of the meeting to feel more confident?

User: Maybe I could write down my points to discuss and practice what I want to say.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Preparation can significantly enhance your confidence. When you visualize yourself sharing your ideas effectively, how does that make you feel compared to your initial fears?

User: It feels empowering, like I could actually do it without being overwhelmed.

Consultant: That empowering feeling is what we want to encourage. As a follow-up to our previous discussions, what would be your next steps to reinforce that feeling of empowerment this week?

User: I’ll focus on my accomplishments, practice my breathing, and prepare for the meeting. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process. Lastly, as we move towards concluding our session, what is one takeaway you'd like to remember from our discussion today?

User: I think I want to remember to challenge my negative thoughts and to keep my successes front and center. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway. Being aware of your negative thoughts and recognizing your achievements can pave the way for a more positive self-view. If these challenges arise again, know you have strategies to address them. How are you feeling about everything we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel more hopeful and confident that I can manage my sensitivity to others’ opinions better. 

Consultant: I'm thrilled to hear that, Zhang! Remember, it’s a journey, and you’re making great strides towards self-acceptance. Thank you for sharing today, and I look forward to seeing your progress in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to process my feelings about what my colleagues said. I thought I was making progress, but I still feel pretty sensitive to their comments.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you’ve put in some effort to work through these feelings, but the impact of those comments is still lingering. Can you share more about what specifically triggered that sensitivity recently?

User: Yes, there was a meeting where one of my coworkers referred to me in a way that felt like I was being labeled. It brought back all those feelings of being judged and misunderstood. 

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, Zhang. It’s understandable why that would affect you. When you heard that comment, what thoughts went through your mind at that moment?

User: I felt like I was being called a “gossip,” like the character "Xiang Lin Sao." It made me think that everyone sees me that way, and I just felt so uncomfortable.

Consultant: It seems like that label really hit you hard and made you doubt how others view you. In moments like that, it can be easy to assume the worst. Can we explore what thoughts or beliefs you have about yourself when you hear such labels?

User: I guess I start thinking that maybe I am not good enough, or that I can't be trusted. I feel like I'm failing to show the best side of myself to my coworkers.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy and critical. I want to help you challenge them. Can we identify some evidence that contradicts those negative beliefs? For instance, have there been times when you've felt competent or valued by your colleagues?

User: Occasionally, yes. I mean, there are projects where I've received positive feedback, but they feel overshadowed by these negative comments. 

Consultant: That's important to acknowledge—the positive feedback you’ve received from your colleagues. It sounds like you have evidence of your competence. How might you reframe your self-talk in situations where you feel judged?

User: I guess I could remind myself that I've succeeded before and that one negative comment doesn’t define me entirely. But it's tough to keep that in mind when I'm feeling low.

Consultant: It is tough, especially when emotions run high. Perhaps we can practice a positive self-statement that you can turn to in those moments. What’s a statement you could tell yourself that reflects your worth despite others' opinions?

User: Maybe I could say, “I am capable, and not everyone sees me as they think.” That feels a bit empowering.

Consultant: That’s a great start! It’s empowering and affirming. Let’s think about how you can incorporate this into your daily life. Would setting small reminders or affirmations help you practice this mindset?

User: Yes, I could put notes in my workspace or even set reminders on my phone. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Creating physical reminders can reinforce that positivity. Moving forward, what are some achievable goals you could set for yourself to help you build confidence in those challenging social situations?

User: I could aim to participate more in meetings and share my ideas, even if I feel nervous. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful goal! Taking small steps can really build your confidence over time. How do you think engaging more in meetings might change your feelings towards those negative comments?

User: I think it would help me focus on what I bring to the table instead of worrying about what others think. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on your contributions can help shift your attention away from negative perceptions. How do you feel about setting a goal to speak up in the next meeting?

User: I think I could try that. It makes me a bit nervous, but I understand that practice will help.

Consultant: That’s completely normal to feel nervous. Remember, it’s a process, and each step you take builds your self-esteem. Let’s also discuss coping strategies for when those nagging negative thoughts arise. 

User: I’d like that. What can I do in the moment when I start feeling overwhelmed?

Consultant: Breathing exercises can be really helpful. Taking deep breaths and grounding yourself can create a moment of calm and help clear your mind. Would you be comfortable trying that next time you feel overwhelmed?

User: Yes, I can try that. I hope it helps settle my nerves.

Consultant: I’m confident it will help! And remember, you’re not alone in this. Would you like to recap some of the strategies we’ve discussed today?

User: Sure! I’ll work on positive self-talk, set reminders, participate more in meetings, and practice breathing exercises when I feel stressed.

Consultant: Exactly! Those are fantastic strategies that align with building your confidence and managing those external pressures. How are you feeling about everything we covered today?

User: I feel more hopeful. I believe I can start making progress. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Zhang! You’ve made great strides today. Remember, it’s all about consistent practice. As we wrap up, what will be your first step toward implementing these strategies?

User: I think I’ll create those positive notes tonight.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! I’m looking forward to hearing how that goes in our next session. Remember, you’re capable of navigating this journey, and I’m here to support you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Have a great week, and I look forward to seeing you again.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to practice positive self-talk in social situations, but I still feel anxious when I receive negative comments. I know I’ve improved a bit, but it’s tough sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like you're recognizing some progress, which is excellent! But facing those negative comments continues to be a challenge for you. Can you share a specific recent experience where you felt anxious about someone’s judgment?

User: Just last week, I was at a gathering and overheard someone saying that I was too quiet. I felt really uncomfortable and started doubting myself again.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable to feel uncomfortable when you hear comments like that, especially when you’re trying so hard to improve your self-talk. What thoughts ran through your mind when you heard that?

User: I immediately thought I should be more outgoing, but then I felt embarrassed and wished I could just disappear.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. It seems like they lead you to a place of self-doubt and frustration. Let’s pause and explore those thoughts—what evidence do you have that being outgoing is the only way to be accepted in social situations?

User: I suppose there’s no real evidence. Some people don’t talk much and are still liked. I guess I just equate being quiet with being less likable.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight, Zhang. It shows you’re aware of the cognitive distortion there. How about we practice rephrasing that thought? If you saw a friend in the same situation, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that being quiet doesn’t mean they are not interesting or likable.

Consultant: Exactly! You can apply that same logic to yourself. So let’s try it together: how might you frame that thought positively when you feel anxious about others’ opinions?

User: Maybe I could say, “I might be quiet, but that doesn’t mean I’m any less valuable in this group.”

Consultant: I love that rephrasing! It’s empowering and affirming. How did it feel to come up with that statement?

User: It feels a bit freeing, actually. I can see how that could help me calm down.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Practicing these reframed thoughts can make a significant difference. Let’s think of another scenario where you can apply this technique. Can you recall a recent social event where you felt confident?

User: Yes, I attended a friend’s birthday party, and I managed to engage in conversations without overthinking so much.

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress! What strategies did you use that night to help you feel more at ease?

User: I reminded myself to just enjoy the moment and tried to focus on the people I was talking to rather than worrying about what they thought of me.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Focusing on interaction rather than self-judgment can help ease anxiety. Moving forward, how can you incorporate that mindset into future gatherings?

User: I can tell myself to concentrate on the conversation and keep practicing positive self-talk, especially if I start feeling anxious.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a solid plan. Let’s also consider some practical exercises. Would you be open to role-playing a social situation together now?

User: Yes, I think that could be helpful.

Consultant: Great! Let's imagine you’re at another gathering and someone makes a comment about you, perhaps about being quiet again. How might you respond, using that positive self-talk we practiced?

User: I could say something like, “I like listening; it helps me connect better with others,” and then redirect the conversation back to them.

Consultant: That’s an excellent response! You’re promoting your value while asserting yourself. How do you feel about using that approach in real life?

User: I feel more confident just imagining it! It seems practical and less confrontational.

Consultant: Exactly! Remember, it’s about balancing self-advocacy and kindness. If you face negativity, it’s good to respond with positivity. Do you think you’d be comfortable trying out this approach in your next social event?

User: Yes, I think I can. I feel more prepared now.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Before we wrap up today, let’s discuss how you can maintain this progress. What strategies can you put in place to reinforce your newfound confidence?

User: I can keep practicing positive affirmations and maybe even write them down to remind myself. 

Consultant: Writing them down is a great idea! Reflecting on your achievements is also key. As we conclude today’s session, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is that I can change my thoughts and, in turn, my feelings about myself in social situations. 

Consultant: That's a powerful realization, Zhang! You’ve made remarkable progress. Remember, facing challenges does get easier with practice, and I believe in your ability to continue growing. If you ever feel overwhelmed, I’m here to support you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’m looking forward to applying what we talked about.

Consultant: It’s my pleasure! I’m excited to hear about your experiences in our next session. Take care, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident lately. I've started to express my opinions in public, and it feels really good when some colleagues acknowledge me.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re beginning to enjoy the positive feedback from your colleagues. How do you think this newfound confidence has affected your interactions?

User: I feel like I'm more willing to speak up and share my thoughts. It makes me feel valued, but sometimes I'm still worried about negative feedback.

Consultant: It's completely natural to have those worries, especially when you're putting yourself out there. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that come to mind when you think about possible negative feedback?

User: Well, I often think that people will judge me harshly or disagree with my ideas. It makes me hesitate before I speak up.

Consultant: I see. Those thoughts are understandable, but let's take a moment to examine them. How true do you think those fears are? Have you experienced any harsh criticism so far?

User: Not really, most of the time I get positive responses. But it's just that fear in the back of my mind that lingers.

Consultant: That’s an important observation. You seem to have evidence that contradicts your fear. How might you remind yourself of those positive experiences when that fear starts to creep back in?

User: I guess I could keep a journal of the positive things people say to me. It might help me focus on those moments instead of the negative thoughts.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Writing down positive feedback can help you build a reference point for your achievements. Let's explore what other strategies might help you stay focused on your progress. What do you think about practicing self-affirmation? 

User: I haven’t really tried that before. What does it involve?

Consultant: Self-affirmation is simply the practice of acknowledging your strengths and achievements. It can be as simple as reminding yourself of your positive qualities and what you've accomplished. Would you be open to trying this technique together?

User: Yeah, I think I'd like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let's start by identifying a few positive traits about yourself that you acknowledge. What do you think are some strengths you possess?

User: I believe I'm a good listener, and I care deeply about others' feelings. Plus, I’ve been brave in communicating my views lately.

Consultant: Those are wonderful strengths! Caring about others and being brave are qualities that can enhance both your confidence and your relationships. How does it feel to acknowledge those strengths?

User: It feels nice to think about my positive qualities. I rarely take the time to recognize them.

Consultant: That’s an important step! Now, let’s create a simple affirmation you can use. How about something like, “I am a good communicator, and my opinions matter”? How does that resonate with you?

User: I think that works! It's short and to the point.

Consultant: Perfect! I encourage you to repeat that affirmation to yourself daily. How do you think this practice could impact your confidence over time?

User: I hope it boosts my confidence and makes me less anxious about speaking up. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Regularly practicing self-affirmation can reinforce your sense of self-worth. Now, let’s talk about how you could apply your confidence in future social interactions. Are there any upcoming situations where you'd like to practice this?

User: Yes, I have a team meeting next week where I want to share my ideas.

Consultant: That sounds like a great opportunity! How do you plan to approach sharing your ideas in that meeting?

User: I think I’ll remind myself of my strengths and say my affirmation before the meeting. That way, I can feel more grounded.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Preparing yourself with positive reminders is key. Let's also think about how you can handle any negative feedback you might receive in that meeting. How do you feel you could respond if someone disagrees with you?

User: I could try to stay calm and listen to their perspective, instead of getting defensive.

Consultant: That's a mature approach! Listening can help you respond constructively rather than reactively. It also shows that you value others' opinions. How does that perspective make you feel?

User: It makes me feel more confident that I can handle disagreements without losing my cool.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re developing a healthy mindset. Remember, it’s all about progress. Celebrate every small success you have in these interactions.

User: I will try to remember that. It feels good to see it as progress instead of perfection.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on progress can reduce the pressure to be perfect. As we wrap up today, what’s one key takeaway you want to remember from our session?

User: I want to remember to practice my self-affirmation and focus on my progress in social situations.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic takeaway! You’re doing a great job, and I believe in your ability to apply these strategies. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session.

User: Thank you! I feel more optimistic now about my next meeting. I'll keep you updated!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m glad to hear that. Remember, each step you take is valuable. See you next time, and take care!
###################
Consultant: Hi Zhang! I'm glad to see you again. Last time we spoke, you mentioned feeling more relaxed in your social interactions. How are you feeling about that now?

User: Hi! I feel a bit better, actually. I've been trying to share more of my feelings with my colleagues, and it’s been quite rewarding, but sometimes I still worry about their reactions.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're making progress in sharing your feelings. It’s understandable to have concerns about how others might react. Can you tell me more about those worries? What specific thoughts come up for you when you think about sharing with them?

User: Well, sometimes I just feel like they might judge me or think I'm overreacting. It makes me hesitate before I say anything.

Consultant: That hesitation is really common, especially when you care about how others perceive you. Let's explore those thoughts a bit deeper. When you think, "They might judge me," what emotions do you experience?

User: I usually feel anxious and a bit nervous. It’s like my heart races, and I start second-guessing myself.

Consultant: That sounds really uncomfortable. It's interesting how that thought leads to some physical responses. Can you remember a specific instance where you felt that way before sharing your thoughts? What was going through your mind at that moment?

User: Yes, there was a time when I wanted to voice my opinion during a team meeting. I kept thinking about how they would react. I eventually kept silent, which made me feel frustrated with myself.

Consultant: I can understand why that would be frustrating, especially when you want to share your feelings. In that moment of hesitation, did you notice any cognitive distortions—like thinking the worst would happen or generalizing the situation?

User: Definitely! I was imagining that if I spoke up, they'd all think I was silly or that my opinions didn't matter. I guess I was catastrophizing the situation.

Consultant: That’s an insightful recognition. Catastrophizing can create a lot of unnecessary anxiety. How would you challenge that thought now that you recognize it?

User: I suppose I could remind myself that everyone has different opinions and that my feelings are valid, too. Not everyone will judge me harshly.

Consultant: Absolutely! That sounds like a healthier perspective. Let’s practice a shift in those thoughts. If a friend came to you feeling similarly, what would you advise them in that situation?

User: I would tell them that it's okay to express their feelings and not to worry too much about what others think. They deserve to be heard.

Consultant: Exactly! You showed empathy towards your friend, and you can offer that same kindness to yourself. Could you try that when you feel anxious about sharing in the future?

User: Yes, I think I could do that. It makes it easier to switch my focus from worrying about judgment to just being honest with myself.

Consultant: That’s a powerful strategy! Let’s talk about some new positive experiences you can create in social situations. What are some activities you enjoy that might also encourage connection with others?

User: I love art, and I’ve been thinking about inviting some colleagues to a painting workshop. I believe it could be a great way to bond.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Engaging in enjoyable activities can definitely foster deeper connections. How can we set some small steps for you to initiate this invite?

User: Maybe I could start by discussing the workshop casually with them and gauge their interest before formally inviting anyone.

Consultant: Perfect! That way, you can ease into it without feeling too much pressure. What could you say to start that conversation?

User: I could mention how I’ve been wanting to try painting and ask if anyone else would be interested in joining me.

Consultant: That’s a great opener! It keeps it light and gives colleagues the chance to join in. How does that make you feel about taking this step?

User: I feel hopeful! It sounds less intimidating when I frame it like that.

Consultant: Hope is a fantastic emotion to carry with you! Let’s think about how you can build on that hope after this workshop. What can you do to reflect on the experience—whether it turns out as you expect or not?

User: I could keep a journal of my feelings before and after the workshop. I think writing would help me process everything.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea, Zhang! Journaling can provide clarity and really help reinforce your progress. Moving forward, how do you feel about your ability to manage your social interactions now?

User: I feel much more confident. I realize that I have tools and strategies to face my anxiety, and I’m excited to keep trying!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You've made significant strides in ensuring your feelings are expressed and valid. Remember, the more you practice, the easier it will become. As we wrap up today, what do you think has been your biggest takeaway from our sessions?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is understanding that I can challenge my negative thoughts and approach social situations with more confidence, which feels empowering.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization! As you continue to practice these strategies, remember to be kind to yourself. If you ever feel overwhelmed, know that you can always return for support. I’m really proud of the progress you've made!

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your guidance. I’ll do my best to keep applying what I've learned.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in your ability to manage challenges ahead. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! It's great to see you again. I hope you're feeling well today. Let's start by reflecting on our previous discussions. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty stable. I had that honest conversation with my friend about my past negative experiences with feedback, and it really helped. I felt understood and supported.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant step forward! It's wonderful to hear that you felt understood. Can you share more about what specifically made that conversation helpful for you?

User: I think it was just having someone listen and validate my feelings. It reminded me that I'm not alone in dealing with these things and that others have shared similar experiences.

Consultant: Validation can be incredibly powerful. It sounds like that conversation reinforced your ability to manage social influences. How have you been feeling about feedback from others since then?

User: I feel more empowered. Before, I would dwell on negative comments, but now I remind myself that not everyone’s view defines who I am. I think I’m becoming more confident in social situations.

Consultant: That's excellent progress! Recognizing that external feedback doesn't define your worth is a crucial part of building self-confidence. What strategies have you found helpful in maintaining this new perspective?

User: I've started to distance myself from negative self-talk. Whenever I receive feedback, I try to evaluate it objectively rather than just reacting emotionally. 

Consultant: That's a great technique! Evaluating feedback objectively allows you to discern what's constructive and what's just noise. Have there been any challenges or situations where you found it difficult to apply this strategy?

User: Sometimes, if feedback is particularly harsh or unexpected, I catch myself slipping back into that old habit of overthinking. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those moments. The important thing is that you’re aware of it and can recognize when it’s happening. What do you think could help you during those times to stay on track?

User: Maybe I could create a list of positive affirmations or reminders that I can look at when I start to feel that way. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Positive affirmations can serve as a powerful reminder of your self-worth. Would you like to brainstorm some affirmations together?

User: Sure! I think something like “I am enough and my worth isn’t determined by others’ opinions” would be good.

Consultant: That's a strong affirmation! How about adding one that focuses on your strengths? For instance, you could say, “I am capable and resilient in facing challenges.”

User: I like that one! It feels empowering to think that way.

Consultant: Great! We can encourage you to integrate these affirmations into your daily routine. How would you feel about setting aside a few moments each day to repeat them?

User: That sounds manageable. I think I could do that in the morning to start my day with a positive mindset.

Consultant: Perfect! Starting your day positively can set the tone for maintaining that self-confidence. As we look ahead, do you feel ready to face any upcoming social situations, knowing that you have these strategies in place?

User: Yes, I feel more prepared. I think I can approach any feedback with a better mindset now.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Would you like to discuss any specific events that are coming up where you might apply these strategies?

User: I have a team meeting next week where I'll be presenting. I usually feel a bit anxious about how people will perceive my presentation.

Consultant: Presenting can be nerve-wracking, but given your progress, it might be helpful to focus on the preparation and your expertise in the topic. What steps can you take to feel more ready for your presentation?

User: I plan to practice my presentation and maybe even ask for feedback from a trusted colleague before the meeting.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Practicing will boost your confidence, and seeking feedback from someone you trust can also provide constructive insights. How would you feel if you encountered tough questions in that meeting?

User: I think I’d feel okay. I can remind myself that it's just part of the process, and I have my affirmations to lean on.

Consultant: Exactly! Embracing the possibility of questions rather than fearing them can make such a difference. As you conclude this session, what do you feel is your most significant takeaway today?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is how much my mindset can change the way I experience feedback and social interactions. I feel more in control.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization, Zhang! It seems you've made amazing strides in managing your self-perception and confidence. If you ever feel the need for further support, remember that I’m here for you.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I feel ready to take on challenges now.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! You've done a wonderful job. Best of luck with your upcoming meeting, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. Take care!

User: Thank you! I will.
