Consultant: Hello Dean! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I’ve been trying to implement the wake-up schedule we discussed, but I still can’t shake off the fear that I’ll oversleep. It’s like it haunts me, even though I wake up on time now.

Consultant: I see. You're continuing to feel that fear of oversleeping, despite successfully waking up on time. Let's explore that fear further. What do you think triggers these anxious thoughts when it comes to waking up?

User: I think it’s just this long-standing belief that I am not disciplined enough. I feel like I don’t deserve to succeed, especially after everything that’s happened in my past.

Consultant: That sounds really heavy, Dean. Feeling a lack of discipline and self-worth can create a lot of stress. Can you share an example of a time when you woke up on time, despite worrying you might not?

User: Well, there was this one time last week. I set my alarm, and I woke up right when it went off. But even then, I had this nagging thought in my mind that it was just luck. 

Consultant: It’s fantastic that you woke up on time! However, it's understandable that you're attributing it to luck rather than acknowledging your effort. What do you think it would take for you to recognize that you can indeed wake up as planned?

User: I guess I’d have to start believing that I’ve changed since going through recovery and starting IT classes. Maybe I can keep a record of my wake-up times?

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Keeping a record can help you see the facts more clearly. Would you be willing to track your wake-up times and how you feel about them each morning?

User: Yes, I can do that. I actually like the idea; it feels proactive.

Consultant: Excellent! Tracking those moments can also serve as a reminder of your successes. When you reflect on the evidence, how do you think it might change your perception of yourself?

User: Maybe I’ll start to see that I can be responsible and that I am making progress. But, I still fear that old belief is too strong.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, considering your experiences. Let's challenge that fear a bit. Can we brainstorm ways to combat that negative thought when it crops up—perhaps even with some affirmations about your achievements?

User: Sure! I think I could say something like, “I am making progress and I can wake up on time.”

Consultant: That’s a great affirmation! Repeating that daily can help reinforce the change in your mindset. How would you feel about using that affirmation when you wake up in the morning?

User: I’d feel a little silly at first, but I think it’ll help. It’s better than telling myself I’m a lazy person.

Consultant: That’s a very positive approach. Starting your day with a supportive message can set the tone for the rest of it. How do you think monitoring your progress and using affirmations will influence your feelings about waking up over time?

User: I hope I start feeling more confident and less anxious about it. It might take time, but it would feel great to trust myself more.

Consultant: That’s a healthy goal! Trusting yourself takes practice, and it seems like you’re on the right path. As you monitor your feelings and wake-up times, you might also notice patterns. Are there specific thoughts that pop up before bed that contribute to your fear?

User: Sometimes, I think about all the things I could be missing out on if I don’t wake up on time, like classes or meeting friends. That just makes me worry more.

Consultant: It's understandable to have those thoughts, as they can create pressure. Let's think about how rational those fears are. What’s the worst that could happen if you overslept occasionally?

User: I guess I’d miss a class, but that’s not the end of the world. I could always catch up, right? 

Consultant: Exactly, understanding that missing a class isn’t catastrophic can help diffuse some of that anxiety. Reflecting on how minor that outcome is may help lessen the fear. How does that realization make you feel?

User: It really helps; it feels like I’m putting things into perspective. I guess I just need to remind myself that it’s okay to miss things sometimes.

Consultant: Absolutely, and it demonstrates how we can challenge those intense fears with evidence. You're learning to give yourself permission to be human, which is crucial. How does this new perspective influence your thoughts on the upcoming week?

User: I feel a bit lighter. If I remind myself that if I do miss something, it’s not the end of the world, I think I might be able to handle mornings better.

Consultant: That’s a huge step forward! As you apply this perspective, keeping track of your successes and practicing affirmations will reinforce your new thinking. I believe you're capable of making these changes.

User: Thanks! It feels nice to have some strategies to work with. I’m really going to try this.

Consultant: I’m proud of you, Dean. Just remember to be kind to yourself through this process. We can discuss your progress in our next session. Until then, how do you feel about what we’ve talked about today?

User: I feel optimistic! It's nice knowing I have tools to work with now, and I’m excited to see how I do with this wake-up plan.

Consultant: Fantastic! Remember, progress takes time, and every small step counts. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care, Dean!

User: Thanks! I appreciate your support. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Dean! Welcome back to our session. I remember last time we discussed your wake-up schedule and how it surprised you. How are you feeling about that now?

User: Hi. Yeah, I still find it hard to believe that I could actually follow a schedule. I often think of myself as lazy, and I think that perception hasn't changed much since our last session.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re struggling with that self-perception despite having some evidence of your progress. What specific thoughts do you have about yourself when you follow the schedule?

User: I guess part of me feels like I’m just faking it. Even when I wake up on time, I can’t shake the idea that I’m still not good enough or that I’m just pretending to be productive.

Consultant: I see. So, even when you have this evidence of following a schedule, your mind still tells you that you’re not doing enough. Can we explore what thoughts you have right before you wake up or begin your day?

User: Sure. Right when I wake up, I often think about all the things I haven't accomplished. I also have this thought that I’m not really qualified to succeed in my IT course, given my past.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite heavy and critical. What emotions do you feel when those thoughts come up? 

User: I feel anxious and kind of defeated, like I'm just going to fail again like I did before.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel anxious with those thoughts. However, it seems like you might be getting stuck in a negative cycle. Can we question whether these thoughts are fully accurate? For instance, what evidence is there that supports or contradicts these beliefs about your qualifications?

User: Well, I guess I have made some progress in my IT course, and I've passed a few tests. But it feels like a small victory compared to where I want to be.

Consultant: You’re right. Those small victories are significant steps. What if we looked at these accomplishments differently? Instead of seeing them as small, how could we redefine them into a more empowering narrative?

User: Maybe I could see it as proof that I'm capable and learning? But it's hard to change my mindset overnight.

Consultant: It does take time, Dean. But acknowledging your progress is key. What if we created a list of your achievements in the IT course, no matter how small? This way, you would have something tangible to reference when those negative thoughts arise.

User: That makes sense. I think writing it down might help me visualize it better and remind me of what I’ve done.

Consultant: Great! Let’s focus on that for our next steps. What are some specific achievements you’ve made in your course lately that you could write down?

User: I completed a project and got good feedback from my instructor. And I’ve actually learned a few new programming concepts that I didn't think I’d get.

Consultant: Excellent! Those are two significant accomplishments. Remember, each step you take counts, and it’s these little victories that lead to bigger changes. How do you feel reflecting on those achievements?

User: I feel a little proud, actually. Maybe I'm not as lazy as I think?

Consultant: Yes! That's the spirit! Starting to acknowledge those moments is essential. As you embrace these positives, what can you do this week to remind yourself of this progress?

User: I think I could start my day by reviewing my achievement list. That might help set a positive tone for the day.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! And how about the thoughts that come up during the day? If you catch yourself thinking negatively, do you feel ready to challenge those thoughts?

User: It’ll be tough, but I think I can give it a try. Maybe remind myself of my achievements when those thoughts pop up?

Consultant: Absolutely! Having a counter-narrative can be incredibly powerful. As we wrap up today, what are your biggest takeaways from our conversation?

User: I realize that I have made progress, even if I have issues adjusting my mindset. I also want to focus on writing down my achievements to help combat those negative feelings.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic insight, Dean. You’ve shown great willingness to challenge your thoughts and reflect on your journey. As we move forward, remember to be kind to yourself. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss before we conclude?

User: No, I think we’ve covered a lot. Thank you for your help. I feel a bit more hopeful.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about taking it one step at a time. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care, Dean!

Consultant: Hello Dean! It's great to see you again. It sounds like you’ve made some progress recently with your studies. How are you feeling about the new learning goals and the transition you’re experiencing?

User: Hi! I’m feeling okay overall. I’ve done well in some exams, but I still feel a little anxious about what lies ahead. I want to make sure I adapt well to this new chapter in my life.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel a mix of emotions during a transition. Acknowledging your progress is a significant step. What specific feelings or concerns are coming up for you about the future?

User: I guess I’m worried about not living up to the expectations I’ve set for myself. Sometimes I doubt whether I can meet the new challenges effectively.

Consultant: Those doubts can be tough to handle. It sounds like you’re putting a lot of pressure on yourself. Let’s explore those expectations a bit. What kinds of expectations are you setting, and how do they make you feel?

User: I want to do well in the IT course. I feel like everyone is counting on me to succeed, which just adds to my anxiety.

Consultant: It’s commendable that you have high expectations for yourself. However, it’s important to remember that it’s okay to take things step by step. Let’s break down what success looks like for you in your course. What smaller, manageable goals could you set to help alleviate some of this pressure?

User: Maybe I could focus on completing one assignment at a time instead of stressing about the entire course. That could help, I think.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Dean! Setting smaller goals can make the process feel less overwhelming. How does the idea of breaking down your tasks into smaller parts help you feel about your progress?

User: It feels more achievable. I think if I take my time and focus on one thing at a time, I won’t feel as anxious.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on one task can help you build confidence with each accomplishment. What would be the first small goal you’d like to set for yourself this week regarding your studies?

User: I think I’ll plan to finish one assignment by the end of the week. That sounds doable.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Committing to finish one assignment is a good start. As you work on this, what do you think you might feel when you complete it?

User: I would feel a sense of relief and maybe even a bit of pride. It would show me that I’m on the right track.

Consultant: That pride and relief can be really motivating! Let’s also address your concerns about teamwork since you mentioned feeling uncertain about collaborating. Why do you think teamwork feels a bit challenging for you right now?

User: I think I’m just not used to working with others. I often feel like I might mess things up.

Consultant: It’s common to feel anxious about teamwork, especially if you’re not used to it. However, teamwork can also be a great way to learn from others. What are some positive experiences you might anticipate when engaging with a team?

User: I suppose I could learn new perspectives and maybe make some friends along the way. It could be a good experience.

Consultant: Those are fantastic possibilities! It sounds like you’re open to the idea of team collaboration. What small step could you take to ease into working with others?

User: Maybe I could participate in a study group for my course. That seems like a friendly way to start.

Consultant: Joining a study group sounds like an excellent step forward! It allows you to connect with peers while focusing on your studies. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I’m nervous but also kind of excited about the idea. It feels like a good opportunity for growth.

Consultant: That mix of nerves and excitement is completely normal. Remember, you’re exploring new territory, and it's okay to feel a bit uncertain. What strategies might you use to help manage any anxiety when you join that group?

User: I could remind myself that everyone is there to learn, just like me. And I could focus on contributing what I know instead of worrying about being perfect.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Shifting your focus from perfection to participation can make the experience much more enjoyable. As you prepare to engage with others, how can you celebrate your small successes along the way?

User: I think I’ll reward myself after each group session, like treating myself to something I enjoy. That could help me feel good about joining in.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Celebrating your efforts can reinforce positive experiences and help build your confidence. As we wrap up today, what do you feel your biggest takeaway is from our conversation?

User: I feel like breaking down my goals into smaller tasks and being kinder to myself about teamwork will really help. I’m ready to embrace this transition with some new strategies.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Dean! You’ve made significant progress today, and I’m confident you’ll manage this transition with your new mindset. Remember, it’s a journey, and I’m here to support you along the way. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your successes in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Dean! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session, particularly regarding teamwork?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling curious about working in teams. I want to give it a try, but there's still a little anxiety when I think about collaborating with others.

Consultant: That’s a good start, acknowledging both your curiosity and your unease. Could you share what aspects of teamwork excite you and what specifically causes you to feel anxious?

User: Well, I think it’s exciting to share ideas and learn from others. But I get anxious about not being good enough or worrying that my ideas might not be valued.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re really interested in the positive aspects of teamwork, but there’s that fear of judgment holding you back. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit. When you think about not being good enough, what evidence do you find for that belief?

User: I guess there’s not a lot of concrete evidence. Just past experiences of feeling overlooked in group settings.

Consultant: That's understandable. Reflecting on past experiences can shape our beliefs. But it’s essential to question if those past moments truly define your potential in new situations. How do you think this fear might impact your approach to collaborating with your peers?

User: I think it might make me hold back from participating or sharing my ideas. I don’t want to feel rejected again.

Consultant: That makes sense. Let’s look at a way to gradually shift that mindset. If a friend were in your position, feeling anxious about sharing their ideas, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone has something valuable to contribute, and their perspective is worth sharing.

Consultant: Exactly! You have that knowledge for others—now it’s about applying it to yourself. What if you began affirming that your contributions are valuable too? How might that change your experience in group settings?

User: I guess if I started believing that, I might feel more confident in speaking up. But it’s hard to change how I feel quickly.

Consultant: Absolutely, and it’s normal for change to take time. How about we explore some small steps or techniques you could try to build that confidence gradually? 

User: That sounds good. I think I could start by preparing a few thoughts before meetings.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Preparing in advance can boost your confidence. How about also practicing speaking those thoughts out loud, even if it’s just to yourself? 

User: I could try that. Practicing that way might help me feel less anxious when it’s time to actually share in the group.

Consultant: Definitely! And as you practice, consider reflecting on how those contributions are received. If your ideas are valued, how might that influence your self-perception in the group?

User: It could really help me feel more included and appreciated. I’d like that.

Consultant: That’s a positive perspective! Now, let’s think about your role in teamwork. Are there any elements of leading you’ve thought about, given your interest in contributing?

User: I haven’t really considered leadership, but now that you mention it, it could be interesting. I guess I’d like to influence my team positively.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful aspiration! Leadership doesn’t mean you have to know everything; it’s about guiding and supporting others. What qualities do you think are important in a leader?

User: I think a good leader should listen well, encourage others, and help resolve conflicts.

Consultant: Those are excellent qualities! Let’s practice scenarios where you can embody those traits. How would you handle a situation where a team member feels left out?

User: I would probably check in with them, ask how they feel, and see if there’s a way to involve them more.

Consultant: That’s a thoughtful approach! By acting in a supportive way, you not only help your team but also build your own leadership skills. Would you be comfortable trying out a role-play where you lead a team discussion?

User: Yes, I think that could be useful. I would like to try that!

Consultant: Great! We can role-play different scenarios in our upcoming sessions. Remember, building confidence takes time, but each effort is a step toward strengthening your abilities. 

User: I appreciate that! It’s really encouraging to have these strategies.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we continue, let’s set some specific goals for your participation in upcoming projects. What’s one actionable step you’d like to focus on this week?

User: I’d like to openly share one idea in the next group discussion. That feels manageable!

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect goal! Sharing one idea is a great start. We can discuss how it goes in our next session. Reflect on how it felt, and we can adjust our strategies as needed.

User: I will! I’m feeling more capable already.

Consultant: I’m delighted to hear that, Dean! Remember, it's a process, and you’re doing wonderfully in exploring these opportunities. Until next time, take care!

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to coming back and sharing my progress.
###################
Consultant: Hi Dean! It’s great to see you today. I’m looking forward to our session. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hey! I’ve been feeling a mix of excitement and uncertainty. I recently started taking on a bit of a leadership role in our team project, and it's both thrilling and intimidating.

Consultant: It sounds like you've had some positive experiences but also some doubts about your role. Can you tell me more about what aspects of leading have excited you, and what uncertainties you have?

User: Well, it felt amazing to see my teammates looking to me for guidance. But at the same time, I worry if I’m really up to the task, or if I’m just pretending to know what I’m doing.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way when stepping into a leadership position. You’re recognizing your potential, but also questioning it. What specifically makes you doubt your abilities as a leader?

User: I think it’s just a lack of experience. Sometimes, I doubt whether my decisions are right or if I should be more assertive in our discussions. I fear letting my team down.

Consultant: Your feelings of anxiety are understandable, especially when leading a team. Let's explore your thoughts during those moments when you doubt yourself. Can you recall a specific instance where you felt uncertain? What were you thinking?

User: One time, during a meeting, I suggested a project approach, but I sensed some hesitation from my teammates. I started thinking that maybe they didn’t believe in my ideas. It felt discouraging.

Consultant: That must have been tough. It seems that their hesitation made you question your ideas. How did that impact the way you felt about yourself as a leader in that moment?

User: I felt small, like maybe I shouldn't be in charge. It really made me second-guess my contributions. 

Consultant: Let’s challenge that thought a bit. What evidence do you have that supports the idea you shouldn’t be in charge? Can there be another perspective on your team's reaction?

User: I suppose it could mean they were thinking about the approach rather than doubting me personally. But in the moment, it felt very personal.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! It’s easy to slip into interpreting others’ reactions as personal judgments. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their capabilities as a leader?

User: I’d encourage them and remind them that everyone has doubts at times. It doesn't mean they aren't capable. 

Consultant: Exactly! You can apply that same thinking to yourself. Let’s consider a small experiment: next time you’re in a meeting, try to present your ideas with confidence and invite feedback openly. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I think I should practice being more assertive and not take hesitation so personally.

Consultant: Great! Let’s discuss possible ways you can invite constructive feedback from your teammates. This could help you validate your ideas and build your confidence. Any ideas how you can do that?

User: Maybe I could ask direct questions after I share my ideas, like “What do you think about this direction?” to involve them more in the discussion.

Consultant: That's a good strategy! Engaging them in the conversation can provide you with helpful input and reinforce your leadership role. How do you feel about trying this approach?

User: I feel more hopeful. It feels easier to think of it this way, like I’m not just making decisions alone. 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Also, consider keeping a journal of these experiences. Note what worked, what didn’t, and how you felt afterward. It can help you track your growth as a leader. 

User: I’ve never thought of that! I like the idea of reflecting on my experiences. It’s a great way to learn.

Consultant: I’m glad you see the value in it! Reflecting can enhance your self-awareness, which is crucial for any leader. How do you envision your leadership style developing in the next few weeks?

User: I’d like to become more confident and open to feedback. I want to create an environment where my team feels comfortable sharing ideas.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! Building a supportive environment will not only help you but also strengthen your team. How will you celebrate small victories along the way?

User: Perhaps acknowledging team efforts in our meetings or setting up fun little rewards for completing project milestones could work.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing achievements fosters team morale and enhances your leadership impact. As we near the end of our time, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from today?

User: I think it’s the realization that I'm capable of leading, and that my doubts are normal. I can manage them and still guide my team effectively.

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress, Dean! You’ve gained clarity on your potential and strategies to enhance your leadership skills. What do you plan to focus on until our next session?

User: I’ll work on being more assertive in meetings and documenting my experiences. It feels good to have a plan.

Consultant: I’m excited for you! Keep up the great work, and remember to be kind to yourself as you grow. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next meeting. Take care!

User: Thank you! I'm feeling more motivated and optimistic about my path forward now. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Dean! I’m really glad to see you today. You've been making progress, and I’d love to hear how you’ve been feeling about your career direction after your recent project presentation.

User: Hi! I feel quite optimistic, actually. Completing that project was a big milestone for me, and the positive feedback from my mentor really boosted my confidence. I’m starting to think about my career path more seriously now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re feeling energized and motivated. What specific thoughts do you have about your career direction now that you’ve received that feedback?

User: Well, I’ve been exploring possible IT fields I might want to focus on, like web development or cybersecurity. I’m trying to weigh what interests me against what’s in demand in the job market.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach! Balancing your interests with market needs is key. Can you share more about what aspects of web development or cybersecurity intrigue you?

User: I find web development appealing because I love building things and being creative. On the other hand, cybersecurity sounds fascinating because it involves solving issues and protecting people’s data.

Consultant: Both options have their unique rewards! It seems like creativity and problem-solving are important to you. How do you envision yourself using those skills in a future job?

User: I’d like to create user-friendly websites that solve real problems for people. In cybersecurity, I imagine myself coming up with strategies to counter threats, which sounds thrilling too.

Consultant: Those are all excellent aspirations, Dean! Let’s focus on how you could start building a path toward one of these careers. What steps do you think you could take next to explore these options further?

User: I could take some online courses in both areas to see which one I enjoy more. Also, I might try to get some internships or volunteer for projects related to each field.

Consultant: That’s a proactive plan! Online courses and internships are great ways to gain experience. How do you feel about setting specific goals for taking those courses or applying for internships?

User: Setting goals sounds good. Maybe I could aim to finish one online course in the next few months and look for an internship by summer.

Consultant: That’s a solid timeline! It sounds manageable and allows you to progress without overwhelming yourself. What resources do you think you might need to achieve these goals?

User: I think I need access to course recommendations, and maybe some guidance on writing a good resume for internships. 

Consultant: Those are great points. I can help you find useful resources for courses and share some tips for crafting your resume. How motivated are you feeling right now about this plan?

User: I feel really motivated! Knowing I have some direction helps a lot, and I want to take action.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s great to see your motivation. As we continue, let’s also think about how to maintain this positive outlook. What strategies could you use to keep your spirits up during challenges?

User: I think I could remind myself of my accomplishments, like the project I completed. I could also talk to friends for support when things get tough.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Reflecting on your achievements and having a support system can make a big difference. How do you feel about reaching out to friends for encouragement regularly?

User: I’ll definitely make it a point to reach out more. I think knowing I have support will keep me motivated!

Consultant: Absolutely! It sounds like you’re on a great path. As we wrap up today, can you summarize what you feel is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: My biggest takeaway is that I have a clear plan moving forward and resources to help me. It feels good to have a direction, and I know I can reach out for support when needed.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Dean! You’ve made great strides today. Remember, maintaining this clarity and support will be essential as you pursue your career goals. If you ever feel lost or need help again, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance. I’ll keep this plan in mind.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here whenever you need support. Good luck, Dean! I believe in your potential and I know you can achieve your goals.
