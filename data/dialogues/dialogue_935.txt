Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you’re here today. Let’s talk about what’s been on your mind lately. How have you been feeling?

User: Hi. I've been extremely anxious. I suspect my husband is having an affair with a female colleague. I can't shake off this feeling, and I've been checking his phone and even following him to work. This has led to a lot of conflict between us.

Consultant: That sounds really distressing, and I can imagine how much that's affecting you. It's understandable to feel anxious in such a situation. Can you tell me more about what you usually feel when these thoughts arise and how it affects your day-to-day life?

User: I feel my heart racing, my hands tremble, and my mind just goes blank. I can't sleep, and I have no appetite. I don’t know what to do to calm down.

Consultant: It seems like your anxiety is really impacting your physical and mental well-being. It's important to address these feelings and try to understand where they come from. Let's explore this together—what leads you to suspect your husband, and how does that influence your emotions and actions?

User: I noticed he’s been coming home later and got a new phone that I can't access. My mind races with thoughts of what he might be doing, and then I feel compelled to check his messages, which just makes things worse.

Consultant: I can see how that would create a cycle of anxiety. Those thoughts seem to drive your behavior, which in turn intensifies your worries. Let’s try to identify some of the specific thoughts you have about this situation that contribute to your anxiety. What do you tell yourself in those moments?

User: I keep thinking that if he really loved me, he wouldn’t do something like this. I also feel like I have to keep an eye on him because if I don’t, I might lose him.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, but it sounds like those thoughts may be a bit extreme. Can we look at the evidence behind those beliefs? How do you think your relationship holds up against these thoughts?

User: I don’t know. We had a good relationship, but now I just see all the worst scenarios. Maybe I’m overreacting, but I can't help it.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel concerned, especially when you’re under stress. It’s important to acknowledge those feelings. But let’s challenge the idea that these extreme scenarios reflect reality. What might another explanation be for your husband’s behavior?

User: Maybe he’s just busy with work and the new phone is to keep his work messages private. But I still can’t shake off the feeling that he’s hiding something.

Consultant: That’s a valid point. It could be possible that there are other explanations for his actions. If a friend were in a similar situation, what advice would you give them about their concerns?

User: I guess I’d tell them to talk to their partner openly instead of jumping to conclusions. But I’m scared to confront him.

Consultant: That fear is quite common. Communication can be challenging, especially under emotional distress. Would you be willing to consider how you might initiate a gentle conversation with him to share your feelings without accusations?

User: Maybe I could just express how I’ve been feeling without making accusations. I’m just really scared of how he’d react.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel scared, but expressing your feelings may help you gain clarity and relieve some of your anxiety. Let’s think of some calming techniques you could use before the conversation to help manage those feelings. What activities help you to relax?

User: I used to enjoy reading or taking walks, but I haven’t had the energy for that lately.

Consultant: It’s understandable, given how intense your emotions are right now. Even small steps like taking a short walk or reading a few pages could help clear your mind. Would you be open to setting aside some time each day for one of those activities?

User: I think I could try taking short walks. It might help calm my mind, even for a little while.

Consultant: That’s a great start! By allowing yourself moments of calm, you may find it easier to approach your husband with a clear mind. Let's also think about how to handle your anxiety in the moment when those fears arise. Are you familiar with any relaxation techniques?

User: I’ve heard of deep breathing but never really tried it seriously.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be very effective in reducing anxiety. It helps ground you and calm your mind. Would you like me to guide you through a simple breathing exercise now?

User: Sure, that would be helpful.

Consultant: Alright, let’s try this together. Find a comfortable position. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four… hold for a count of four… and exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of four. Let’s do this a few times. 

User: Okay, I’m doing it.

Consultant: Great! Keep focusing on that breath. Inhale… hold… and exhale. This can help bring a sense of peace whenever those anxious thoughts come creeping back.

User: I feel a bit calmer already. I really appreciate this.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a practice, and the more you do it, the easier it will become. As we wrap up our session, let’s summarize your progress. What are some steps you feel ready to take moving forward?

User: I think I’ll try to communicate with my husband and take those walks. I’ll also practice deep breathing when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Those are fantastic steps, and I believe they can lead you toward feeling more in control of your emotions. Just remember, any progress is meaningful. If you start to feel overwhelmed again, remember those tools we discussed. I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session!

User: Thank you so much for your support. I will definitely make an effort.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: Hi! I'm glad to see you today. I remember we discussed the tensions in your marriage last time, and I'm here to help you work through your feelings. How have you been since we last talked?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite anxious, especially with the ongoing tension between my husband and me. It's hard for me to understand why everything has escalated recently. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells all the time.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging for you. It’s understandable to feel anxious when there’s ongoing tension at home. Can you tell me a bit more about what specifically triggers these feelings of anxiety for you?

User: I think it’s our arguments. They always start over small things, but they escalate quickly. I get overwhelmed and I feel like I can't express my own thoughts without causing more conflict.

Consultant: It sounds frustrating to feel that way. You want to express yourself, but it seems like you're worried that it will lead to more arguments. What thoughts go through your mind when these situations arise?

User: I often think that my words will be twisted against me, or that I’ll be blamed for everything. I'm scared of saying something wrong.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really distressing. It seems like you're feeling trapped by the fear of being misunderstood. Let’s look more closely at those thoughts. What evidence do you have that your words will be twisted or that you will be blamed?

User: Well, during many of our arguments, my husband does seem to focus on what I say and turns it into accusations. It makes me doubt myself and my intentions.

Consultant: It’s understandable that those experiences would lead you to feel anxious about speaking up. However, have there been instances where your communication didn’t lead to conflict, or where your husband responded differently?

User: Yes, sometimes when we talk calmly about neutral topics, he listens well. But when we get into more sensitive areas, it just spirals out of control.

Consultant: That’s a valuable observation! It shows that there are moments of positive communication. What do you think would help you navigate those sensitive conversations more effectively?

User: I suppose if we could both take a step back and breathe, maybe if we set some ground rules for our discussions… But it’s hard to remember that in the heat of the moment.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Setting ground rules could really help. Perhaps you could even practice it when both of you are calm. What are some specific rules you think might be useful to establish?

User: Maybe we could agree to listen to each other without interrupting and to take a pause if things get too heated. I just worry if he will be open to it.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel apprehensive about his willingness. What if you approach him with this idea when you’re both in a good mood? How do you think he might respond to a more structured discussion?

User: He might be open to it if he doesn't feel attacked. I guess it would help if I frame it as a way for us to improve our communication together.

Consultant: That’s a thoughtful approach! Framing it positively could really make a difference. How would you feel about bringing this up to him?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also hopeful—like I have a realistic plan. I just need to remind myself to stay calm.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel nervous, especially when approaching sensitive topics. Remember, practice can help you feel more confident. Is there anything specifically you’d like to work on today related to this plan?

User: I’d like to explore how I can manage my anxiety when I’m talking to him and how to effectively express what I’m feeling without becoming defensive.

Consultant: That’s a great focus. Can you share a recent situation where you felt defensive? What was happening, and what thoughts were going through your mind?

User: Last week, I felt defensive when he complained about the house being messy. I took it personally, thinking he didn’t appreciate my efforts, and I snapped back at him.

Consultant: It sounds like that situation triggered some strong feelings for you. Let’s break it down—what were you thinking when he pointed that out? 

User: I thought he was implying that I’m not doing enough. It made me feel undervalued and criticized.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It feels hurtful to think you’re being criticized. What if you could reframe that thought? Instead of assuming he's focusing on what you haven't done, could it be that he’s just expressing his feelings about the situation?

User: That makes sense. I often jump to conclusions. Maybe I should ask him what he means rather than assuming the worst.

Consultant: Absolutely! Asking open-ended questions could help you gain clarity and reduce misunderstandings. How do you feel about practicing that in your next conversation?

User: I think I could try that, but I still worry about how he might react.

Consultant: It's normal to have those concerns, but remember that you’re taking a proactive step towards improving the communication. What could help you manage your anxiety before you engage in this conversation?

User: Maybe I could take a few deep breaths beforehand and remind myself that my intentions are good.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Mindfulness techniques like deep breathing can create a calmer mindset. Would you like to explore more techniques to help ground yourself in those moments?

User: Yes, that would be helpful. I want to feel more in control of my emotions.

Consultant: Perfect! We can work on some grounding techniques together. This can help you feel more centered during challenging conversations. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate this. It’s nice to have a plan moving forward.

Consultant: You’re more than welcome! It’s wonderful to hear you’re feeling more hopeful. Remember, changes take time, but each step you take is important. As we wrap up, what are some key takeaways you’d like to remember from today’s session? 

User: I want to remember the importance of communication rules, reframing my thoughts, and using grounding techniques to manage my anxiety. 

Consultant: Those are excellent takeaways! You’ve made great progress today. Keep practicing these strategies, and I believe you will see positive changes. I'm here for you whenever you need support. 

User: Thank you! I feel a sense of relief to have a clear direction. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. Take care, and I look forward to our next meeting!
###################
Consultant: Hello, welcome to our session today! I'm glad to see you again. Last time, we talked about your feelings regarding communication with your spouse, and I noted you were feeling a bit frustrated but hopeful. How have things been since then?

User: Hi! It’s been a bit challenging. I've tried to improve my communication with my husband, but it feels like I’m still missing the mark. Sometimes, my kids even express their dissatisfaction about the atmosphere at home.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve been putting in some effort, which is a positive step. However, it can be disheartening when the results aren’t what you hoped for. Can you share specific instances where you felt your communication didn’t go as planned?

User: Well, just the other day, I tried to tell him about my feelings regarding our family dynamic, but he seemed distracted and didn’t really engage. I felt like I was talking to a wall.

Consultant: That must have been frustrating for you. It’s understandable to feel disheartened when your partner doesn’t respond the way you hope. What thoughts went through your mind during that conversation?

User: I thought maybe he doesn’t care about what I think or that I’m just not being clear enough. It made me doubt whether I should even try anymore.

Consultant: Those thoughts certainly can be heavy to carry. It sounds like you’re feeling a mix of doubt and disappointment. What emotions did you experience while having that conversation?

User: I felt really anxious and a bit sad. I didn’t want to come off as pushy, but I felt that my concerns were important.

Consultant: It's completely valid to want to be heard and regarded for your feelings, especially when you see a need for change in your family dynamic. Let's explore some strategies that might help you convey your thoughts more clearly. How do you usually prepare for such conversations?

User: I try to organize my thoughts beforehand, but once I sit down to talk, it feels like I lose my words. I need to find a way to communicate better.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re preparing; that’s an excellent first step. Perhaps we can practice some specific techniques together today. One method is to use "I" statements. For example, instead of saying "You never listen to me," you might say, "I feel unheard when I try to share my feelings." How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds helpful. I guess it makes it less confrontational.

Consultant: Exactly! It focuses on your feelings rather than placing blame. Would you like to try role-playing a conversation where you express your feelings using this technique?

User: Sure, I’d like that. It might help me feel more confident.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you’re starting a conversation with your husband. You could begin with “I feel…” What would you like to express to him today?

User: I would say, “I feel anxious about how we communicate, and I want us to work together to improve our family atmosphere.”

Consultant: That's a strong start! It clearly shares your emotion and your desire for collaboration. If he responded with curiosity or concern, how would you like to continue the conversation?

User: I might say, “I appreciate your concern. It means a lot to me. I think we can create a more positive space for our kids together.”

Consultant: Wonderful! You’re reinforcing the idea of teamwork, which can be very motivating. How do you feel about that approach now that you’ve practiced it?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Practicing helps me find my voice, and it feels good to express myself like that.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s important to feel empowered in these conversations. What strategies do you think you can put in place to help you maintain this confidence when the time comes?

User: Maybe writing down my thoughts again before I talk and reminding myself that it’s okay to express how I feel.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Writing things down can definitely help organize your thoughts and reduce anxiety. Keeping that reminder to focus on your feelings is also essential. Let’s talk about how you can take care of yourself amidst this situation; how do you usually recharge emotionally when things feel overwhelming?

User: I usually enjoy chatting with friends or taking a walk. It helps me clear my mind.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent ways to recharge! Engaging in those activities can help you maintain balance and perspective. Is there a particular activity you feel you could prioritize more regularly?

User: I think I should make more time for my walks. They really do help me feel better.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect commitment. Small self-care activities can significantly impact your emotional well-being. As we wrap up today’s session, how do you feel about the progress you’ve made in terms of communication and self-care?

User: I feel more empowered, actually! I have some tools now, and the role-play made me realize I can express myself better.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic takeaway! It’s been a pleasure helping you work towards these goals. Remember, it’s all about practice, and you’re already on the right path. If challenges come up, how do you think you’ll use these strategies?

User: I’ll try to remind myself of our discussions and practice what we talked about. I feel like I can face this now.

Consultant: I believe in you! Remember, you’re not alone in this journey, and it’s okay to reach out for support when you need it. I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for today's session. I remember that you've been working on expanding your social activities to build a support system. How are you feeling about that lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident since I started engaging with others. However, whenever I face issues at home, I still feel overwhelmed by the pressure.

Consultant: It's great to hear that your confidence has improved! Facing family issues can be really challenging, especially when you've made strides in building a support network. What kind of family issues are currently on your mind?

User: Mostly, it's communication problems with my husband. I feel like we often misunderstand each other, and it leads to arguments. I want to improve our interaction, but I’m not sure how to start.

Consultant: That sounds tough. It’s normal to want better communication, especially when it can impact your overall well-being. Can you recall a recent situation where there was a misunderstanding?

User: Yes, just the other day, we had a disagreement about how to handle our children's schooling. I thought I was sharing my thoughts, but he seemed to take it as criticism.

Consultant: I see. Misunderstandings like that can certainly create tension. What were some of the thoughts running through your mind during that conversation?

User: I felt frustrated because I thought I was just expressing my concerns. Instead, it felt like I was being dismissed, and that made me anxious.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when you want to be heard. This sounds like a situation where both your and his perspectives might be leading to some cognitive distortions. For instance, feeling dismissed can amplify negative thoughts. What if we explored some alternatives to those thoughts?

User: That sounds helpful. I think I initially thought, “He never listens to me,” which makes me feel even more upset.

Consultant: That thought certainly adds to your frustration. Let's challenge that belief. Can you think of any instances where he has listened to you, perhaps in a different context? 

User: Well, now that I think about it, he does listen when I talk about my social activities or my feelings. I guess I focus too much on the negative moments.

Consultant: Exactly! It can be easy to focus on the negatives. By recognizing the instances where he does listen, you might be able to adjust your perspective. How can you use this insight to approach future conversations?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that he listens in other situations, which could help me feel less defensive when discussing our children.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! It sounds like a positive step forward. Would you like to think of a specific approach or phrase you could use when discussing sensitive topics with him?

User: Perhaps I could start by expressing appreciation for when he does listen before diving into the issues at hand.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Beginning with appreciation can set a positive tone. How do you feel about implementing that in your next conversation?

User: I feel hopeful about it! It feels more constructive, and I think it may help ease the tension.

Consultant: Wonderful! As you practice this approach, it can empower both of you to communicate effectively. What are some potential challenges you think you might face when trying this out?

User: I might struggle if I feel overwhelmed in the moment, though. Sometimes my emotions get the better of me.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Remember to take a moment for yourself if you feel overwhelmed. Deep breaths or counting to ten can help regain your composure. Would you like to develop a plan for handling those moments?

User: Yes, having a plan for those moments sounds reassuring!

Consultant: Let’s outline a simple plan. First, if you feel overwhelmed, pause the conversation if possible. Second, take a few deep breaths or step away for a moment to gather your thoughts. How does that sound so far?

User: That sounds manageable. I think a small break could really help me process my feelings without saying something I might regret.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s always okay to take a moment for yourself. Additionally, practicing affirmations about your value and abilities outside those discussions can help bolster your confidence. Would you be interested in exploring some affirmations?

User: Sure! I think having some positive reminders would be beneficial.

Consultant: Let’s create a couple together. How about something like, “I am skilled at expressing my feelings” or “I am worthy of being heard”? 

User: I like those! I think they can really help me shift my mindset before conversations.

Consultant: That's great to hear! Regularly affirming your worth can significantly enhance your communication. As we wrap up, how are you feeling about the strategies we've discussed today?

User: I feel more empowered now, like I have practical tools to improve my communication with my husband.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a process, and every step you take matters. What are your thoughts on continuing to practice these strategies until our next session?

User: I think I will focus on this. I really want to improve our relationship. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I look forward to hearing how it goes for you. You’ve made some important shifts today. If you encounter difficulties, remember to be kind to yourself. 

User: Thank you for your support! I appreciate all the advice.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in your ability to navigate these challenges. Until next time, take care and keep practicing those new strategies!

User: Thank you! I’ll do my best.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. The communication with my husband has improved a little after my friend's advice, but I still think I need to work on it more.

Consultant: That’s great to hear that there has been some improvement! It sounds like you're feeling hopeful but still want to refine those communication strategies. What specific changes have you noticed in your interactions with him?

User: Well, we’ve been talking more openly about our feelings. I try to listen more and respond calmly, but sometimes I still feel my emotions taking over.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when emotions run high. It appears that you’re actively trying to implement these strategies. Can you share more about when those emotions tend to take over?

User: Most of the time, it happens when we talk about the kids or household responsibilities. I sometimes feel overwhelmed and then I snap without thinking.

Consultant: It seems like discussing those topics triggers strong feelings for you. Let’s explore that further—what thoughts go through your mind in those moments before you react?

User: I often think that my husband doesn’t understand how much I do for the family. I feel unappreciated, and then I just get frustrated.

Consultant: That sounds tough. Feeling unappreciated can definitely lead to frustration. What if we try to rewrite that thought—can you think of any evidence that suggests your husband does appreciate your efforts?

User: Yes, he does help with the kids when I ask, and he says thank you. I guess I just let my emotions cloud my judgment sometimes.

Consultant: Recognizing those moments is a significant step! It’s all about balancing those emotions with the positive evidence of appreciation. How do you think you can remind yourself of his support next time you feel frustrated?

User: I could remind myself of the moments he helps out and perhaps take a deep breath before responding.

Consultant: That sounds like a helpful strategy. Taking a deep breath can create a pause, allowing you to reflect rather than react immediately. Is there anything else you think would be useful to prepare for those conversations?

User: Maybe I could write down specific things that I appreciate about him, so I have a clearer mindset when we talk.

Consultant: Absolutely! Having a list of positive aspects can really help shift your focus. Let’s outline those key points together. What might be some things to include?

User: He’s a great dad and always tries to make time for the kids. He’s also supportive when I have personal challenges.

Consultant: Those are wonderful qualities to highlight. It sounds like he is a caring partner and parent. Moving forward, how would you like to incorporate these positive reflections into your dialogue with him?

User: I could share my appreciation for him during our conversations, especially when discussing difficult topics. It might help balance things out.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant approach! Expressing appreciation can foster a more constructive environment. How confident do you feel about trying this strategy in your next conversation?

User: I feel pretty confident. It’s all about the mindset, and I’m starting to see things more positively.

Consultant: That's great to hear! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize your progress. You’ve recognized your emotions, identified helpful strategies, and plan to express appreciation. How do you feel about this direction?

User: I feel good. I believe I can keep improving. It’s nice to have a plan in place.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It seems you’re making significant strides. Before our next session, what’s one thing you’d like to focus on or practice?

User: I want to practice expressing appreciation and possibly journal my interactions to see how I respond.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Journaling can help you reflect on your feelings and responses over time. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next meeting. 

User: Thank you! I'm excited to continue working on this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep up the excellent work, and remember you’re making progress each step of the way. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today's session. It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good actually. My relationship with my husband is improving, and I'm more optimistic about our future together. I feel more confident in managing my emotions.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you have made significant progress in your emotional management and family relationships. Can you share more about what changes you've noticed in your relationship with your husband?

User: Yes! We've been communicating better, and I think we're starting to rebuild trust. We even had some fun moments together, like going out for dinner. It felt nice to just enjoy each other's company again.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that you've been able to enjoy time together and that your communication has improved. What do you think contributed to this positive change?

User: I think I've been working on my own feelings and trying to approach our discussions with more understanding. I'm also learning not to take things too personally.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really taking an active role in nurturing your relationship. Recognizing and managing your own feelings is a big step. How do you plan to maintain this positive momentum moving forward?

User: I want to keep practicing effective communication and also set aside more time for us as a couple. Maybe we can plan regular date nights or simply talk more openly.

Consultant: Planning regular date nights and prioritizing open communication are great strategies to strengthen your connection. Let's talk about how you can make these plans a reality. What might be some specific steps you can take?

User: Maybe I should start by scheduling a weekly date night in advance. We could also agree on certain topics to discuss weekly, so we both feel heard.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! How do you think you will feel once you start implementing these strategies?

User: I think it will make me feel more connected and secure in our relationship. Plus, it'll give us both something to look forward to.

Consultant: Feeling more connected and secure is certainly an important goal. Now, is there anything that you might be concerned about that could potentially disrupt this progress?

User: There are still some moments when I feel anxious about past issues cropping up, but I'm trying to focus on the present instead of worrying too much about them.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those concerns, especially when you’re working on rebuilding. What strategies have you been using to manage those anxious thoughts when they arise?

User: I’ve been trying to remind myself of the progress we've made and the positive interactions we’re having. I also practice deep breathing when I start to feel anxious.

Consultant: Those techniques sound very effective. Reminding yourself of the positive changes and using deep breathing can help ground you during challenging moments. Do you think there are additional methods you could explore?

User: Maybe I could try journaling to express my feelings more clearly. Writing it down might help me sort through my thoughts.

Consultant: Journaling is a fantastic tool for emotional expression and clarity. It can help you process your feelings and track your progress in managing your emotions. When do you think you might start doing that?

User: I could start tonight after dinner. I think it would be a good way to reflect on my day and my emotions.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! As we wrap up today, what would you say has been your biggest takeaway from our sessions so far?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is that I have the tools to manage my emotions effectively and that I'm capable of improving my relationships by putting in the effort.

Consultant: Absolutely! You've shown tremendous growth and understanding. As you continue this journey, what strategies will you keep in mind to prevent any setbacks?

User: I'll remind myself to communicate openly and keep practicing self-care techniques like journaling and deep breathing.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies to maintain your progress. Remember, it's all about being kind to yourself and aware of your feelings. This will help you navigate any challenges that might arise. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate the support and guidance throughout this process.

Consultant: It has been a pleasure to work with you. Continue to stay positive and apply what you've learned. If you ever feel the need for support in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: I will! Thank you so much. Goodbye!

Consultant: Goodbye! Take care!
