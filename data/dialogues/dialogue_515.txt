Consultant: Hello, Xiaohao! I'm glad you could join me today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really low and overwhelmed. I often feel like crying and just don't know why my emotions keep dropping like this. It's frustrating because I want to understand what's happening.

Consultant: It sounds really tough, and I'm here to help you through it. Can you share more about what kinds of situations make you feel this way? Are there particular moments or triggers that you notice?

User: Lately, during class, I suddenly feel restless. My mind gets foggy, and I even feel dizzy and hear ringing in my ears. It feels like I can't think straight at all.

Consultant: That sounds quite distressing, especially when you're trying to focus in class. It seems like these physical sensations make your emotional state even harder to manage. How do you usually cope when you start feeling this way?

User: I don’t really cope well. I just try to push through it, but I often end up feeling even more helpless and isolated. It's hard for me to talk about it with others since they wouldn't understand.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel isolated, especially when you think others might not understand your experiences. I'm here to provide a space where you can talk openly. Have you had anyone to share your feelings with, like friends or family?

User: I live with my grandma and cousin, but I don’t really talk to them about my feelings. My parents are rarely around, and when they are, I feel like they wouldn't get it either.

Consultant: It seems like that adds to your feeling of loneliness. Your parents being away probably makes it hard for you to connect with them about what you're going through. Can we explore what feelings come up for you when you think about discussing these emotions with them?

User: I feel a lot of resistance. I guess I don't want to worry them or hear their expectations. It just makes me feel even more pressure.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. It’s natural to want to shield your loved ones from worry and to avoid additional pressure. Let’s focus on understanding your feelings and finding ways to help you cope. What would it look like for you to have some tools to manage these emotions without involving your parents?

User: I think it would help if I could learn to calm down on my own. Maybe having some techniques to deal with anxiety could give me a bit of control.

Consultant: Absolutely! Gaining some techniques for calming and managing anxiety can definitely help you feel more in control. How about we start by identifying some of the feelings you experience when you're anxious? What are you typically thinking at those moments?

User: When I'm anxious, I often think that I’m a failure or that I won't be able to handle the pressure. It makes me feel even more hopeless.

Consultant: Those negative thoughts are heavy to carry. Let’s work on challenging those thoughts together. Can you recall a specific instance where you felt like a failure? What evidence do you have that supports that thought?

User: There was a recent test I didn't do very well on, and that just confirmed my fears. I keep thinking that if I can't do well in school, I'm not going to have a future.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel this way after a setback, but it's also important to find a more balanced perspective. Many people do poorly on tests and still find success later in life. Can you think of any times when you succeeded or felt proud of yourself, even if they were small achievements?

User: I remember finishing a project that I worked hard on, and I felt proud of that. But now I just feel like those moments don’t matter.

Consultant: Those moments do matter, even when it feels overshadowed by the tough times. We can focus on recognizing those achievements as valid. Let’s practice reframing that negative thought. Instead of thinking "I’m a failure," how about we try "I haven’t done well on one test, but that doesn’t define my entire academic journey"? What do you think?

User: I guess that sounds better, but it's still hard for me to believe that sometimes.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way; changing thought patterns takes time. We can practice this over time. Let’s also think about some small, enjoyable activities you could engage in to help lift your mood when you’re feeling low. Any ideas?

User: Maybe spending time outside or drawing. I used to enjoy that.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Engaging in activities you enjoy can definitely help improve your mood. Let’s set a small goal for you to draw for at least 10-15 minutes a day this week. How does that sound?

User: I think I can try that. Drawing does seem relaxing.

Consultant: Great! Small steps can lead to big changes. I’ll be here to support you as you explore these activities and new thought patterns. Before we wrap up, let’s also talk about how you can maintain this progress in the future. What strategies do you think could help you keep these skills going when you face challenges?

User: Maybe reminding myself I can always draw or take a walk when I feel anxious would help.

Consultant: Absolutely, and it's great that you've recognized these strategies. You can create a little reminder for yourself. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey, and I’m here to help you whenever you need. Would you like to schedule another session to follow up on your progress?

User: Yes, I'd like that. This has been helpful, thank you.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiaohao. Let’s continue to work on this together next time. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaohao! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling recently, especially after your conversation with the school doctor?

User: Hi. Honestly, it's been tough. I understand I need help, but I really don't want my parents involved. I feel like they wouldn't understand or would just get upset.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like there's a lot of concern about how your parents might react if they find out you're seeking help. Let's discuss that a little more. What do you think would happen if your parents knew about your situation?

User: I think they would worry a lot. They already have enough on their plate with their work. Plus, I don't want them to think I'm not handling my life well. It feels like more pressure.

Consultant: That makes sense. You want to protect them from stress and also manage your own feelings. It's important we find a way to address your feelings without involving them if that’s what you prefer. What do you think help might look like for you, outside of involving your parents?

User: I just want to feel better—like I can cope with school and not feel so heavy all the time. Maybe talking to someone who gets it, without involving my family.

Consultant: Absolutely, talking things through with someone who understands can be very helpful. Have you thought about other resources at school or support groups where you could find that kind of understanding?

User: I haven't really considered it. I don't know much about the options available. I sometimes feel like nobody really understands what I'm going through.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. There are often support systems in schools, like peer support groups where you can connect with others who might be feeling similar to you. Would you be open to exploring that idea?

User: Maybe. But I'm worried about opening up to strangers. What if they don’t take me seriously?

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel apprehensive about sharing personal feelings with new people. But these groups are typically designed to create a comfortable and safe space. Would it help to know that many students feel the same way initially, and it often gets easier over time?

User: I guess that makes sense. I just don’t want to feel judged or misunderstood. 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, and it’s important to feel safe in those environments. One step we can take is to discuss what you’re comfortable sharing. This way, you can set the pace for how much you want to disclose. How does that sound?

User: Yeah, that sounds better. I just want to feel like I have some control over what I share.

Consultant: Exactly! It's about maintaining that control for yourself. As we talk about your feelings, we can also identify some coping strategies that work for you. What are some things that have helped you cope in the past, even if just a little?

User: I like drawing, it helps calm my mind sometimes. But it's been a while since I felt like doing it.

Consultant: Drawing sounds like a great outlet for expression. Maybe we can explore incorporating that back into your routine? It could provide you with a helpful break when you feel overwhelmed.

User: That could be nice. I used to really enjoy it, but I just feel too foggy to start.

Consultant: I understand that feeling foggy can make it hard to get started. How about we design a small, achievable plan? Perhaps setting aside just 10 minutes a day to draw? It could be a simple way to ease back into it.

User: That doesn’t sound too bad. I think I could manage 10 minutes.

Consultant: Fantastic! That’s a great start. Let’s also think about what kind of themes or subjects you might want to explore in your drawings. What appeals to you?

User: I used to draw landscapes, but right now, I don’t know if I have the focus for that. Maybe just doodling could work.

Consultant: Doodling is a perfect idea! It’s about freedom and not putting too much pressure on yourself. How do you feel about using doodling as a method to express yourself without any expectations?

User: I feel more relaxed just thinking about it. It sounds like something I can handle.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s important to find activities you feel comfortable with. As we continue, let’s keep this focus on small steps. Meanwhile, would you like more information about peer support groups at school, or do you want to take time to think it over?

User: I think I’d like some information. It might be good to know what’s out there, even if I’m not sure I want to join right away.

Consultant: Of course! I’ll help you gather some information about those groups, and we can discuss your thoughts on them next time. How do you feel about the progress we’ve made today?

User: I feel a bit lighter, I think. I’m still unsure, but it’s nice to talk about these things.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable, and it's okay to take your time. I'm proud of you for opening up today, and remember, you’re not alone in this. We can keep going at your pace in the next sessions. 

User: I appreciate that. I’m starting to feel like maybe I can do this.

Consultant: That's a great insight! You've taken some important steps already. Let’s wrap up today with the thought that you’ve got the tools and support to keep moving forward. How does that sound?

User: Sounds good. Thank you for helping me feel less overwhelmed.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaohao! I’m looking forward to our next session, and we’ll continue to build on these steps together. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaohao! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling since our last consultation?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really overwhelmed. My emotions have been all over the place, especially with school. I can't seem to trust my teachers anymore and it makes everything difficult.

Consultant: I understand that you're feeling overwhelmed and struggling with trust in your teachers. It sounds like there's a lot on your mind. Can you tell me more about what's been bothering you at school?

User: Well, I just feel like they don't understand me. I wanted to keep my parents out of it, but my teacher tried to contact them anyway. It just made me feel really angry and helpless.

Consultant: It must have been really frustrating to feel like your privacy was violated. It's understandable that you want to handle things on your own. What do you think would help you feel more in control of the situation?

User: I don’t know... maybe if I could just handle my emotions better without feeling like I need to escape or hide.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Xiaohao. Learning to manage your emotions is important. What specific emotions do you find most challenging to deal with right now?

User: Mostly anger and sadness. I feel like they just come out of nowhere and I don’t know how to stop them.

Consultant: It sounds tough to have those feelings come on so suddenly. Have you noticed any particular thoughts or situations that trigger those emotions for you?

User: When I think about school or when my classmates talk about their support from their parents, I just feel really isolated and sad.

Consultant: Feeling isolated can be very heavy. It seems like comparing your situation to others’ can amplify your feelings of sadness. Can you recall any specific thoughts that come up when you feel this way?

User: I usually think, "Why don’t my parents care?" or "I must be doing something wrong." 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really hard to carry. Let’s explore them a bit. What evidence do you have that your parents don’t care, or that you're doing something wrong?

User: I guess I just feel that way because they are always away. It makes me feel like I don’t matter to them.

Consultant: That feeling of not mattering is painful. But let's reflect on that together. What are some things your parents have done that show they care for you, even if they’re not physically present?

User: Well, they do send me money to help with school, and my mom does call occasionally. 

Consultant: Those actions show that they are thinking of you and want to support you in their own way. It can be useful to remind yourself of these when you start to feel like they don’t care. Would you be open to trying to challenge those negative thoughts?

User: I guess that could help. I just don’t want to feel like I’m lying to myself.

Consultant: I understand your concern about not wanting to deceive yourself. It’s not about lying; it's about finding a more balanced perspective. We can work together to reframe those thoughts into something more constructive. 

User: Okay. That makes sense. I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take one of those negative thoughts, like "I don’t matter to my parents," and think of a more balanced statement. What could that be?

User: Maybe something like, "My parents care about me, even if they aren't here all the time."

Consultant: That’s an excellent reframe! It acknowledges their care while also recognizing the reality of your situation. How does it make you feel to hold onto that thought instead?

User: It feels a bit lighter. I think I can hold onto that when I feel down.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let’s discuss some practical strategies to help you when those emotions arise. Have you considered keeping an emotional record to track how you feel and what triggers those feelings?

User: I haven’t really thought about it, but it sounds helpful. 

Consultant: Keeping an emotional record can help you see patterns and understand your emotions better. We can start by jotting down your feelings daily, along with triggers and how you responded. Would you like to give it a try?

User: Yes, I think that could be really helpful. 

Consultant: Excellent! You can start small, maybe aim to write a few sentences each day. As we continue our sessions, we can discuss what you discover. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good to me!

Consultant: Great to hear, Xiaohao! Stepping into this process of awareness and sharing your feelings is an important part of your journey. Before we wrap up, how are you feeling about our conversation today?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful, actually. I think I can start to open up more.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! It’s a big step to start sharing and exploring your feelings. I believe this will help you connect with others more. 

User: Yes, I hope so too. Thanks for the support!

Consultant: You’re welcome! Remember, it’s okay to take your time. I look forward to our next session, and you can always reach out if you need to talk before then.

User: I will, thank you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaohao! I'm really glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling lately, especially with your interactions in the peer support group?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better since joining the support group. It feels good to share my feelings, but sometimes I'm still anxious about speaking up in front of everyone.

Consultant: That’s a great step forward! Sharing feelings is not always easy. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts come to you when you feel anxious about speaking in the group?

User: I often think that what I say might not be important or that others will judge me. It makes me hesitate.

Consultant: It sounds like these thoughts are really holding you back. When those thoughts come up, how do they make you feel emotionally?

User: I feel nervous and sometimes even a bit embarrassed, which makes me want to keep quiet.

Consultant: I understand. It’s tough to feel that way. Let's explore this together. Can you think of a time when you spoke up and it went well? What was that experience like for you?

User: Yeah, there was a moment when I shared a story about my family, and some people reacted positively. It felt nice to be heard.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like there are moments where you can connect with others. What do you think made that experience different from the times when you feel anxious about speaking?

User: I guess I was just more comfortable that day. I felt like I could relate my story to others.

Consultant: That connection seems important for you. If we took that feeling of comfort and thought about applying it to your future sharing, what might you do differently next time?

User: Maybe I could focus on how I feel about the topic instead of worrying about what others might think.

Consultant: That sounds like a very helpful strategy! Putting your feelings at the forefront can help make your experience personal and engaging. How do you think that might change how you express yourself in the group?

User: I think it would make me feel more confident. If I focus on my feelings, maybe I won’t worry so much.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on your feelings fosters authenticity. Let’s think about how you can practice this. What are some feelings you could identify and share in your next group meeting?

User: I might try sharing how I feel about missing my parents sometimes. It's something that weighs on me.

Consultant: That sounds like a meaningful topic. How do you think sharing that will help you in the group, and what do you hope to gain from it?

User: I hope other people can relate to it, and maybe it will make me feel less alone. 

Consultant: That’s a great goal! Feeling less alone can significantly enhance your emotional connection. What might you do if you feel anxious before sharing this in the group?

User: I guess I could take a few deep breaths and remind myself that it’s okay to be open about my feelings.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a great technique to help you center yourself. Alongside that, reminding yourself of the positive feedback you've received in the past might help boost your confidence, too. 

User: Yeah, thinking about the positive moments makes sense. I can do that.

Consultant: Fantastic! It seems you’re starting to develop new ways to approach sharing. How would you feel about setting a small goal for yourself regarding this for the next group meeting?

User: I think it’s a good idea. Maybe my goal can be to share at least one feeling, regardless of how I think it will be received.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal to aim for! Being brave enough to share is a growth step. How will you celebrate this small achievement once you accomplish it?

User: I could treat myself to something nice, like a favorite snack or a movie afterward.

Consultant: That sounds like a rewarding way to acknowledge your success! As we wrap up today, what has stood out to you the most from our conversation, and how do you feel about your journey moving forward?

User: I feel hopeful. Recognizing that I can focus on my feelings makes it seem less daunting. I’m excited to try sharing more.

Consultant: I’m happy to hear that, Xiaohao! You’re making great progress, and remember that every step, no matter how small, is important. I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hi there, Xiaohao! I’m glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been trying to use some of the emotional expression skills I learned, but it still feels a bit challenging for me. I want to share more with others, but sometimes I freeze up.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable, and I'm proud of you for trying to implement those skills. Can you tell me about a specific situation where you felt challenged to express your feelings?

User: Well, just last week I tried to join a group discussion at school. I really wanted to share my thoughts, but when it was my turn, I just felt really nervous and couldn’t say anything.

Consultant: It sounds like you had the desire to participate but felt overwhelmed in the moment. What thoughts were going through your mind when you felt nervous?

User: I kept thinking they wouldn’t care about what I had to say, or that I might say something dumb.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite powerful, and it’s common to worry about what others think. Let’s explore these thoughts further. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts the idea that they wouldn’t care about your input?

User: I guess... they seemed engaged in what others were saying. But sometimes, I’ve heard them ask questions to people, so maybe it wouldn’t be so bad if I spoke up.

Consultant: That’s a great observation, Xiaohao. It seems there’s a part of you that recognizes that your contributions could be valued. How would you feel if you told yourself that your thoughts are important too, just like everyone else's?

User: I think I would feel a bit more confident. It might help me talk more freely.

Consultant: Absolutely! Building that self-belief is crucial. What if we practice a little role-playing exercise? I can pretend to be a fellow student, and you can practice sharing an idea. Would you be open to that?

User: Yeah, I think that might help! 

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine we’re discussing a recent movie. You can share your thoughts about it as if we were in class. Whenever you feel ready, go ahead!

User: Alright... I recently watched a movie about friendship and... um, I thought it showed how important it is to be there for each other. It made me think about my own friendships.

Consultant: That was a fantastic start! You brought in a personal connection, which is great for engaging others. How did that feel for you? 

User: It felt good to say that! It’s like... I was sharing a part of myself.

Consultant: Exactly! Sharing personal experiences can foster connection. If you practiced this more, how do you think it could change your experiences in social situations?

User: I think I'd feel more included and maybe even make some new friends. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight, Xiaohao. Let’s discuss strategies to help you practice outside our sessions. How about setting a small goal for the week, like sharing a thought during another discussion or even just with a friend?

User: I can try to share at least one thought in our next group discussion. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. Reflect on your feelings afterward to see what worked well and what might be improved. How do you feel about this goal?

User: I feel excited, but a little nervous too, honestly.

Consultant: That’s a natural feeling when stepping out of your comfort zone. It means you’re challenging yourself, which is a positive sign! Would you like to have a backup plan in case you feel nervous again?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone has valuable thoughts and that it’s okay to be nervous?

Consultant: Excellent! Affirming your worth can be a powerful tool. When you feel nervous, remember those affirmations. 
Let’s also think about ways to celebrate your efforts after you share, regardless of how it goes. How do you see yourself celebrating this achievement?

User: I could treat myself to something nice, like my favorite snack or a little time playing a video game.

Consultant: That sounds like a fun way to reward yourself! Creating positive associations with sharing your thoughts can reinforce your progress. I'm really proud of you for setting these goals. 

User: Thanks! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaohao. Through our sessions, you’re making fantastic progress. As we wrap up today, how do you feel overall about your journey in improving emotional expression and social interactions?

User: I feel hopeful! I'm starting to see that sharing doesn’t have to be scary. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Recognizing your progress is a huge step. Before we end, let’s quickly review what strategies will help you maintain this momentum moving forward.

User: I’ll keep practicing sharing in discussions, remind myself of my worth, and celebrate my efforts.

Consultant: Perfect! And remember, it's okay to feel nervous along the way. I believe you can navigate these challenges! 

User: Thank you. I’m looking forward to our next session. 

Consultant: Me too, Xiaohao. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support before then. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hi, Xiaohao! I'm glad to see you again for our session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty stable overall. I've been participating more in social activities and expressing my feelings in a healthier way. It's nice to have those interactions, and I'm starting to feel hopeful about the future.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like you've made some positive changes. What specific activities or interactions have contributed to this stability and hope?

User: I've been hanging out with friends more often, and we discuss our thoughts and feelings openly. It really helps to share my experiences and listen to others.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful way to build connections and manage emotions. Reflecting on our previous sessions, do you see any particular strategies or insights that have enabled these improvements?

User: Yes, I think learning to express my feelings and challenging my negative thoughts has been really valuable. It's like I can recognize when I'm feeling down and address it instead of letting it take over.

Consultant: That's a significant achievement! Recognizing those feelings and addressing them proactively is a crucial skill. What specific strategies have you found most helpful in this process?

User: I’ve been practicing journaling my thoughts and feelings. Writing them down helps me clarify what I'm going through, and it often leads to some insights on how to tackle those feelings.

Consultant: Journaling can be an effective tool for understanding your emotions and reducing their intensity. Have there been any particular entries or reflections that stood out to you recently?

User: There was one entry where I wrote about a time I felt really anxious before a group project. I realized that most of my fears were exaggerated, and just talking to my friends helped me feel better.

Consultant: It's insightful that you identified those exaggerated fears. Recognizing cognitive distortions like those can empower you to challenge them. How did you feel after making that connection?

User: It was relieving! I felt that I had more control over my anxiety. I didn't let it stop me from participating, and I think that experience has made me braver in similar situations.

Consultant: That's a fantastic takeaway! It sounds like you're starting to build a stronger sense of resilience. As we look to consolidate your progress today, what do you think would help you maintain this momentum moving forward?

User: I think having regular check-ins with myself about how I'm feeling would be helpful. Maybe setting small goals for myself to keep growing.

Consultant: Setting those small goals sounds like a solid plan. What types of goals do you envision for yourself in the coming weeks to maintain your emotional health and progress?

User: I’d like to focus on continuing social interactions and maybe even try new activities, like joining a club at school. Also, I want to keep journaling and reflecting on my growth.

Consultant: Those are all excellent goals! Engaging in new activities can provide fresh experiences and further foster social connections. It also sounds like you have a good framework with journaling to support your self-reflection. Is there anything else you'd like to focus on or any concerns you have moving forward?

User: No major concerns right now. I feel more confident and ready to take on these new goals. I just want to make sure I don’t slip back into negative thought patterns.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling confident! To prevent slipping back, you might consider creating a 'thought record' that helps you spot negative patterns when they arise. Would you be open to trying that as a tool?

User: Yes, that sounds like a useful idea. I can track my thoughts and see patterns more clearly. I just want to keep my progress in check.

Consultant: Absolutely! That proactive approach can empower you significantly. Don't forget to celebrate your successes, no matter how small. What would you consider a success in your journey over the next month?

User: I think simply feeling more balanced in my emotions and engaging in social settings would qualify as success for me. If I can maintain that, I'd be happy.

Consultant: Those are wonderful benchmarks! As we wrap up today’s session, let's summarize your progress and strategies. You’ve expressed a strong desire to maintain your emotional health through journaling, engaging socially, and setting small goals. Does that sound right to you?

User: Yes, it does! I feel like I have a solid plan in place to keep going.

Consultant: I'm really pleased to hear that! It’s important to recognize how far you've come. Always remember that if challenges arise, you can reach out for support. It’s been a pleasure having you here, Xiaohao. Do you feel ready to conclude our sessions for now, with confidence in your skills?

User: Yes, I do! Thank you for all your help. I feel much more equipped to handle things on my own now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m so proud of the progress you’ve made. If you ever feel you need support again, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care, and I wish you the best on your journey ahead!
