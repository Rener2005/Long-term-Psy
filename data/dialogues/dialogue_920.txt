Consultant: Hello, Tan Bin! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’ve been feeling really anxious, especially in my classes. I can’t shake off the feeling of embarrassment from the incident in math class where I got criticized.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like that criticism has left a strong impact on you. Let’s explore that a bit more. How did it make you feel during and after that class?

User: I felt so embarrassed when my classmates laughed at me. It just brought back all those old feelings of self-doubt. Now I dread being asked questions in class.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult, Tan Bin. It’s understandable to feel anxious in situations where you feel judged. What thoughts run through your mind when you start to feel that anxiety before a class, especially regarding questions from the teacher?

User: I often think that I’ll say something stupid or that everyone will laugh at me again. It's like I’m constantly on edge.

Consultant: Those thoughts are quite powerful and can really heighten your anxiety. Let's try to unpack them. When you think about saying something “stupid,” what evidence do you have for that belief? 

User: I guess... it’s mostly based on my fear of judgment. I can't recall a time when I was praised for speaking up, so I just assume that I’ll mess up again. 

Consultant: That's an important realization. It seems that there’s a fear of negative feedback that’s affecting your confidence. If a friend were in your situation, what would you tell them about their fears of speaking up in class?

User: I would probably tell them to not worry too much about what others think. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate response. Now, let’s apply that same understanding to your situation. What if you allowed yourself to make mistakes and viewed them as learning opportunities rather than failures?

User: I suppose I could try to think about it that way. But it still feels hard to do in the moment.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. It might help to practice some relaxation techniques before class to ease your anxiety. How do you think you would feel if you could calm those nerves beforehand?

User: Maybe I wouldn't feel so panicked. If I could calm down, I might be able to think better during class.

Consultant: That sounds promising. Would you be open to trying some deep breathing exercises before your next class? It's a simple yet effective way to manage anxiety.

User: I think I could do that. I actually learned about deep breathing but never really practiced it.

Consultant: Great! It can be a helpful tool. Let’s say your next class is coming up—what steps will you take to use your deep breathing technique?

User: I’ll remind myself to take a few deep breaths before class starts. I’ll focus on my breathing to ground myself.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Tan Bin. It’s all about taking small steps. Let’s also think about how you can recognize and challenge those negative thoughts you mentioned. When those fears pop up, can you replace them with more balanced thoughts?

User: Yes, like reminding myself that everyone makes mistakes and it’s okay not to be perfect.

Consultant: Exactly! That practice of questioning your thoughts can significantly help. Keep in mind that this process takes time. How do you feel about taking these steps moving forward?

User: I feel a little better about it, actually. I think if I can just be more aware of my thoughts, it might help reduce my anxiety.

Consultant: That's a positive mindset! It's crucial to be patient with yourself. Let’s recap the steps: use deep breathing before class, remind yourself that mistakes are learning opportunities, and challenge those negative thoughts when they arise. 

User: Yes, that sounds good. I’ll try to keep those in mind.

Consultant: Excellent! As we wrap up today, I’d like you to reflect on what you’ve learned about your thoughts and feelings regarding class situations. What’s one takeaway you can hold on to?

User: I think I need to be kinder to myself and recognize that it's okay to feel anxious sometimes. I shouldn’t let it control me.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic takeaway, Tan Bin. Remember, recognizing your feelings is the first step towards managing them. You’re doing great in this process. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I feel a bit more confident now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, progress takes time. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out. Until next time, take care and practice those strategies!

User: I will! See you next time.

Consultant: Hello, Tan Bin! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been struggling quite a bit. With the increasing pressure from my coursework, my anxiety about participating in class has escalated. I often doubt my ability to handle questions, and it's affecting my overall performance.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're facing a lot of anxiety regarding your classroom participation, which is making it hard for you to feel confident. Can you tell me a bit more about what thoughts or feelings come up for you when you think about participating in class?

User: Well, I often worry that if I get called on, I won't know the answer and everyone will look at me. That thought just terrifies me. It makes me feel like I'm not smart enough.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Tan Bin. It seems like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to perform perfectly in front of your peers. What do you think that pressure is rooted in? 

User: I guess it's because I've always expected a lot from myself, especially since I've struggled with self-confidence in the past due to my background. I feel like I have to prove that I can succeed.

Consultant: It's understandable that your past experiences and expectations contribute to your current feelings. Let's explore that fear of not knowing the answer. What evidence do you have that people would judge you harshly if you didn't answer correctly?

User: Honestly, I don't have concrete evidence. It's just this overwhelming fear that they will think less of me. 

Consultant: It's common to have those fears, but it seems like they might be based more on assumptions than facts. If a friend were in your situation and didn't know an answer, how would you encourage them to handle it?

User: I would probably tell them it's okay to not know everything, and that everyone makes mistakes sometimes. 

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! It sounds like you can be compassionate towards others, but it’s challenging to extend that same kindness to yourself. How can we begin to shift that thinking for you when you’re in class?

User: I’m not sure. Maybe I could remind myself that it’s okay to not know everything? 

Consultant: Absolutely! That's a good start. We can practice creating a positive affirmation you can use in those moments. How about, “It's okay to not have all the answers, and I am learning every day.” What do you think?

User: I think that sounds helpful. It’s more forgiving than what I currently tell myself.

Consultant: Great! Let’s also think about some strategies you could use when called upon in class. Would you be open to trying some role-play scenarios to practice responding to unexpected questions?

User: Yes, I’m willing to try that. It might help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s envision a scenario where you are asked a challenging question. I’ll ask you a question, and you can respond as if you were in class. Remember, practice will help ease some of that anxiety.

User: Okay, I’ll give it a shot.

Consultant: Imagine I’m your instructor: “Tan Bin, can you explain the main theme of today's reading?” 

User: Uh, I think the main theme was about... um, conflict and resolution? I’m not entirely sure though.

Consultant: That was a good attempt! It's okay to pause and think before answering. You can also say, “That’s a great question, can I take a moment to think about it?” How does it feel to have that option if you’re unsure?

User: It feels less pressuring to know I can take a moment before answering.

Consultant: Exactly! This approach gives you the space to gather your thoughts. Besides practicing responses, do you have any routines or activities that help reduce your stress before class?

User: I usually listen to music or take a few deep breaths, but I still end up feeling anxious.

Consultant: Deep breathing is an excellent technique! Would you like to try a short breathing exercise right now to see how it feels? 

User: Sure, let’s do that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in... hold it for a moment... and now slowly breathe out. Remember, focusing on your breath can help ground you when anxiety rises. How did that feel?

User: It felt calming, a little easier to think. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Using breathing techniques before you enter a classroom could be beneficial. As we wrap up today, what’s one thing you feel more confident about moving into your next class?

User: I feel more confident about trying to remind myself that it’s okay to not know every answer and using deep breaths if I feel anxious.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization! Remember, it’s a process, and being kind to yourself will help on this journey. In our next session, we can discuss how these strategies worked for you in class. Does that sound good?

User: Yes, I’m looking forward to it!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. You've made some excellent progress today. If situations feel challenging in the meantime, practice those affirmations and breathing exercises. Take care, and I'll see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Tan Bin! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, but I still struggle in class. Last time, I tried to answer a question, but I got really nervous and stumbled over my words. It made me feel frustrated and embarrassed.

Consultant: It's great to hear from you, and I appreciate you sharing that experience. It sounds like trying to participate in class brought up some strong emotions for you. Can you tell me a little more about what you felt in that moment?

User: I felt this wave of anxiety right before I spoke. My heart raced, and it seemed like my brain just froze. I was worried about what the teacher and my classmates would think of me if I messed up.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable to feel anxious about being judged in front of others. Let's explore what specific thoughts went through your mind when you felt that anxiety. What were you telling yourself in that moment?

User: I kept thinking that if I mess up, everyone will laugh at me or think I’m stupid. It’s like I couldn't shake off those thoughts.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. They seem to create a cycle of fear and self-doubt. Let’s take a moment to recognize how those thoughts affect your feelings and actions. When you thought you might mess up, how did it make you feel emotionally?

User: It made me feel really small and worthless. I wanted to disappear, honestly. Afterward, I couldn’t concentrate on the class anymore.

Consultant: That sounds like an unsettling experience. It's crucial to acknowledge how these feelings affect your overall performance. Have you noticed any other situations that trigger similar feelings of anxiety or self-doubt in your daily life?

User: Yes, when I have to speak up in group discussions or even during smaller interactions with classmates, I often feel anxious. It keeps affecting my ability to focus on my studies.

Consultant: It seems like this anxiety impacts not just your classroom experience but also your overall educational performance. If we look at the thoughts you previously mentioned, how realistic do you think they are? Are there other possible outcomes that could occur if you did mess up?

User: I guess if I messed up, it’s not the end of the world. Maybe a few people would notice, but they might forget about it quickly. Still, the fear feels so real.

Consultant: You're beginning to see things from a different perspective. It’s important to challenge those negative thoughts. Let’s think about it further: If a friend were in a similar situation and felt that way, what would you tell them to help them cope?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and it’s okay. I’d remind them that they’re not alone and that it didn’t define their worth.

Consultant: Exactly! You showed kindness and understanding to someone else—let's apply that same compassion to yourself. Moving forward, what if we practiced some techniques to help reduce that anxiety before you speak in class? 

User: I’d like that. Hopefully, it can help me feel more relaxed.

Consultant: Great! We can start with some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises. Taking deep breaths can help calm your nervous system. Would you like to try it together now?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful.

Consultant: Let's take a deep breath in for a count of four, hold it for four, and then exhale for four. 1...2...3...4...Hold...1...2...3...4...Now exhale...1...2...3...4. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt nice to focus on my breath. I think doing this might really help during stressful moments.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Practicing these techniques regularly can make a significant difference in your ability to manage anxiety in class. Would you like to discuss other scenarios where you can apply these skills?

User: Sure, I think it would be good to think through potential classroom situations and how I can handle them differently.

Consultant: Let’s consider a situation where you might be called upon to answer a question. What steps could you take to prepare yourself mentally and emotionally before that moment happens?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to take a moment to think before answering, and I can use deep breathing to calm myself down.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Remember, it’s perfectly okay to take a pause. How might you reinforce the idea that making mistakes is part of learning during these moments?

User: I could remind myself that making mistakes doesn’t make me stupid. I could say that everyone makes mistakes and that it's a part of the process.

Consultant: Absolutely! This new understanding is powerful. As we look forward, what do you think will help strengthen your confidence in these classroom interactions?

User: I think practicing my responses and maybe even speaking in smaller groups could help build my confidence over time.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Gradually exposing yourself to speaking more often in smaller, less intimidating settings can build your confidence. Let's brainstorm some smaller group opportunities for you to practice.

User: Maybe I can try sharing during study sessions with classmates, where it feels more relaxed.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Engaging with classmates in a supportive environment can help you gradually acclimate to speaking. As we wrap up, let’s reflect: what is one positive takeaway from our conversation today that you feel ready to implement in your next class?

User: I think using deep breathing before speaking in class and reminding myself that it's okay to make mistakes will really help me. 

Consultant: I’m really proud of you for recognizing those strategies. Remember, it’s a journey, and each small step counts. If you encounter more challenges, I’m here to help whenever you need support.

User: Thank you so much! I feel a bit more hopeful now about dealing with my anxiety in class.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I believe in your ability to tackle these challenges. Looking forward to our next session, where we can continue building on your progress.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Tan Bin! I'm glad to see you today. Last time we spoke, we talked about your progress in group discussions and how you are starting to reassess your self-worth positively. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident after the positive feedback from the group discussions, but I still find myself feeling anxious in some classroom situations, especially when I get critiqued by my teachers.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling more confident after the positive feedback! It’s also very normal to have some anxiety in response to criticism. Can you share what specific thoughts or feelings come up for you when you are critiqued?

User: I usually think that maybe I'm not good enough or that I will fail again. Those thoughts just seem to spiral, and I become overwhelmed.

Consultant: I understand that those thoughts can be really overwhelming. It sounds like they bring a lot of anxiety. Let's explore this together—how do those thoughts make you feel in the moment? 

User: I often feel my heart racing and my palms sweating. It's like I freeze and can't concentrate at all.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, experiencing both the physical symptoms and the inability to focus. Let's try to identify some of these automatic thoughts during those moments. When you feel that anxiety, can you recall any specific thoughts that pop into your head?

User: I often catch myself thinking, “I’m going to mess this up again,” or “Everyone is judging me.” 

Consultant: Those are very strong thoughts, and it's understandable that they would lead to such anxiety. Now, let’s question those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts the idea that you’re going to mess up or that everyone is judging you?

User: I guess I don't really have strong evidence. In fact, when I look back, most of the time, I do fine, and people are usually supportive.

Consultant: That's a really insightful reflection! It seems like there is some disconnect between your thoughts and the reality of your experiences. How might you reframe those thoughts into something more positive or realistic?

User: Maybe I could think, “I’ve done well in the past, and it's okay if I make a mistake this time.”

Consultant: That's a great start! That thought is much more balanced and can help reduce anxiety. Now, what about applying some relaxation techniques when those anxious thoughts arise? Have you been able to practice any since our last session?

User: I tried some deep breathing exercises before class, and it did help a bit, but sometimes I still forget to use them when I need them the most.

Consultant: It's really good to hear you've been trying deep breathing! It's easy to forget in the heat of the moment, though. We can work on ways to remind you to use those techniques. Would you be open to setting a goal to practice before specific situations, like right before class or after receiving feedback?

User: That sounds good. Maybe I can set reminders on my phone to practice before class starts.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Setting reminders can help create a habit. How about we work through a scenario right now? Let’s visualize a situation in class where you might feel anxious and practice the deep breathing together.

User: Sure, that sounds helpful.

Consultant: Great! Close your eyes for a moment and take a deep breath in through your nose... hold it for a count of three... and now exhale slowly through your mouth. Picture yourself sitting in class, feeling that familiar anxiety creeping in. As you breathe in, imagine you are inhaling calmness and confidence. As you exhale, let go of any tension or negative thoughts. How does that feel?

User: That actually feels really good. I can visualize it better now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Visualization combined with breathing can be a powerful tool. It seems like you are on the right track in applying these techniques. As we continue, let’s aim for you to practice this visualization regularly, not just when you feel anxious. How does that sound?

User: That sounds manageable. I think I can do that.

Consultant: Excellent! I believe this practice will aid in building your confidence over time. As we approach the end of our session today, let’s summarize what we’ve learned. What do you think are the key strategies to help you manage your anxiety going forward?

User: I think I need to challenge my negative thoughts, remember my past successes, and practice my breathing techniques regularly.

Consultant: Those are all solid strategies! Remember, you are capable of implementing these changes. Before we conclude, how do you feel about the progress you’re making? 

User: I feel more hopeful and like I have a plan now. It makes me feel more in control of my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Tan Bin! You’ve done a great job reflecting and brainstorming ways forward. As always, if you find any challenges or have any questions in the future, I’ll be here to support you. Looking forward to our next session!

User: Thank you! I feel really thankful for your help. I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Tan Bin! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been trying to use the relaxation techniques we discussed, and I'm noticing some improvements. I feel like my anxiety during classes has decreased a bit.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It's great that you're seeing some positive changes. Can you share a specific situation where you applied these relaxation techniques recently?

User: Sure! Last week, I had a class where the teacher asked me a question unexpectedly. Instead of panicking, I took a deep breath and remembered the techniques we practiced. It really helped me stay calm and respond.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic example of applying what you've learned! How did it feel to handle that situation differently this time?

User: It felt empowering. I usually get really anxious in those moments, but using the technique made me feel more in control. 

Consultant: Feeling in control is very important. It sounds like you’re developing a sense of self-efficacy. What other situations have you encountered where you've attempted to use these strategies?

User: I've also been trying to relax more before studying. I used to feel a lot of pressure to start quickly, but now I take a few minutes to breathe first.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Taking time to relax beforehand can enhance your focus and productivity. How has that impacted your studying?

User: It's made a huge difference. I feel less overwhelmed, and I can concentrate better. I’m not rushing into studying as much.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! It seems like you're finding a rhythm that works for you. Have there been any challenges in maintaining this practice?

User: Sometimes, when I’m really stressed about an upcoming exam, I forget to take those few minutes to relax. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to experience setbacks, especially during stressful times. Have you thought about ways to remind yourself to take a moment to relax before studying?

User: Maybe setting a timer or using a relaxing music playlist might help. 

Consultant: Those sound like effective ideas! Using external cues, like timers or music, can remind you to engage in relaxation. What activities or techniques do you find most enjoyable in your relaxation practice?

User: I like listening to calming music and doing some deep breathing exercises. They really help to clear my mind.

Consultant: Music and deep breathing are great tools! How about we create a specific plan for you to integrate these activities into your study routine? 

User: That sounds good! Having a plan might help me stick to it better.

Consultant: Let’s outline it! We can schedule a few minutes of relaxation before each study session. How about starting with a five-minute session of deep breathing while listening to your favorite calming music?

User: Yes, that should be manageable. 

Consultant: Perfect! And as you get more comfortable, you could gradually increase that time, or even incorporate some mindfulness exercises. How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful! I think I can really do that.

Consultant: I'm glad you feel that way! As you practice this new routine, we can also think about how to apply these relaxation techniques during classroom settings. Have you had further thoughts on that?

User: Yes, I think I could do a quick relaxation technique right before class starts. 

Consultant: Absolutely! That could be especially beneficial. What about a simple breathing exercise you can do discreetly at your desk?

User: I can even do some slow deep breaths while pretending to write notes. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! It’s a discrete method to calm yourself and will go unnoticed by others. How confident do you feel about implementing this during your upcoming classes?

User: I feel quite confident. I’ve been practicing, so I think I can handle it.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Confidence is key. Remember, it’s a skill that takes consistent practice. Let’s also reflect on how far you’ve come in managing your anxiety. 

User: I can see that I’ve improved quite a bit. I feel more optimistic about my studies now. 

Consultant: That’s such a positive mindset! As you continue using your coping strategies, how do you plan to keep reinforcing these skills in the future?

User: I’ll try to set aside time regularly to practice relaxation and remind myself that it’s okay to take a break when I need it.

Consultant: That’s a healthy approach! Scheduling these practices will help cement them as habits. Lastly, as we wrap up today’s session, what do you believe has been your biggest takeaway?

User: I think recognizing that I can manage my anxiety gives me a lot of hope. The techniques really work for me.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Tan Bin. It’s been a pleasure working with you, and I believe you have the tools to manage your anxiety effectively moving forward. If you ever feel like you need extra support, remember you can always reach out.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help.

User: Thank you! I appreciate all the help and guidance you've given me throughout this process.
