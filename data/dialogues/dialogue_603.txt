Consultant: Hello, D! I’m glad you’re here today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really anxious and a bit lonely. Things have been tough at home with my grandpa, and school is just too much right now.

Consultant: I can understand that it must be overwhelming for you. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure both at home and in school. Can you tell me more about what's been happening with your grandpa and how it's affecting you?

User: Well, my grandpa has a lot of expectations for me. He’s very strict and doesn’t really understand how I feel. I just end up arguing with him all the time. It’s really frustrating.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, having to meet high expectations while feeling misunderstood. It makes sense that arguing with your grandpa would add to your frustration. How does this situation make you feel about yourself?

User: I often feel like I’m not good enough. I get angry easily, and sometimes I wish I could just escape everything. 

Consultant: I hear you, D. Feeling like you’re not good enough can be really tough. We can work on ways to better understand and manage those emotions. Can you think of specific moments when you felt this way recently?

User: There was a time when I got a low grade in school, and my grandpa was so disappointed. He didn’t even give me a chance to explain. I felt really upset and just yelled at him.

Consultant: It seems that moment triggered a strong emotional response for you. What were the thoughts running through your mind at that time?

User: I kept thinking that I was a failure and that my grandpa would never be happy with me. I felt like I let everyone down.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem very powerful and negative. Let’s explore them further. How do you think those beliefs about yourself affect your behavior and feelings?

User: They make me feel really anxious, like I can't do anything right. Sometimes, I just shut down and don’t want to do my homework or talk to anyone.

Consultant: That makes sense. The anxiety is likely causing you to avoid situations that might be challenging. Can we challenge that belief a bit? What evidence do you have that you’re a failure?

User: Well, there are times I do well in school, but it feels like those moments are overshadowed by my mistakes.

Consultant: It’s important to recognize those successes alongside your challenges. What if you reframed that thought to acknowledge both your efforts and the areas where you want to improve?

User: I suppose I could say I’m trying my best, even if I mess up sometimes.

Consultant: Exactly! That perspective shift can help you feel more balanced about yourself. Let’s talk about how we can apply this to your everyday life. What steps might you take to acknowledge your efforts, even when they're small?

User: Maybe I could set smaller goals for myself, like studying for just an hour each day and celebrating when I finish.

Consultant: That’s a great idea, D! Setting smaller goals can help you feel a sense of accomplishment. How do you think this change would impact your feelings towards your grandpa’s expectations?

User: If I focus on my own goals, maybe I won’t feel as much pressure from his expectations. I could show him I’m trying, and that might help reduce the tension.

Consultant: That's a fantastic insight! Taking control of your own goals may help improve not only your mood but also your relationship with your grandpa. How about discussing this plan with him when you're ready?

User: I think that could help. Maybe I can explain what I'm doing to improve, and he might see I’m trying.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive approach. Remember, it’s important to express your feelings too. If you feel comfortable, you can also share your struggles with him. That openness might create a better understanding between you both.

User: Yeah, I think it would help. I really want to have a better relationship with him.

Consultant: It's commendable that you want to work on that relationship. As we wrap up today, what is one takeaway you can take into your next week that could help you manage these feelings better?

User: I’ll try to keep track of my small victories and talk to my grandpa about my goals. I want to show him that I’m making an effort.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan, D! Remember, it’s a journey, and it's okay to take small steps. I’m here to support you, and I believe you can make progress. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful about things now.

Consultant: You’re welcome! It’s great to hear you feeling hopeful. Keep focusing on those small steps. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao D! I’m glad you’re here for our session today. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi. I'm still feeling pretty overwhelmed. The pressure from school and my grandpa is a lot, and I'm starting to doubt myself more and more. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of stress from both school and home, which is understandably tough. You mentioned feeling overwhelmed and doubting yourself. Can you share a bit more about some specific situations that have made you feel this way recently?

User: Well, I keep hearing people call me a "bad student" at school. It's like I can’t escape that label. No matter how hard I try, it's always there in my mind.

Consultant: That sounds really frustrating, Xiao D. It seems like that label really sticks with you and affects how you see yourself. I’d like to explore this a bit more. When you hear that label, what thoughts come to your mind? 

User: I think that maybe I really am a bad student. I can’t understand things quickly in class, and I often feel like giving up. It makes me angry and sad at the same time.

Consultant: I hear you. It’s tough when you start to believe those negative thoughts about yourself. What if we take a moment to challenge that label? Can you think of any evidence or examples that might suggest you aren't a "bad student"?

User: I guess there have been times I did well on tests or projects. But those moments feel so small compared to the negative stuff.

Consultant: That’s a great start! It's important to recognize those positive achievements, no matter how small they might feel. What could be a different way to view those moments of success, instead of just focusing on the negative feedback?

User: Maybe I could think of them as proof that I can do it if I try hard enough. But then I worry that it won't last.

Consultant: I understand that worry, but it’s really valuable to acknowledge that you’ve succeeded before. Let’s try to create some positive affirmations or self-statements you can use when those negative thoughts come up. What positive things could you say to yourself instead?

User: I could say, "I can learn and improve," or "I am not just a label." 

Consultant: Those are excellent affirmations, Xiao D! Repeating those can help you reshape how you view yourself over time. How do you feel about using those statements when you find yourself doubting your abilities?

User: I think it might help, but I still feel nervous about talking to others at school. It's like I don’t know how to interact properly.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. Social interactions can be really challenging! What specific situations with your classmates do you find most difficult? 

User: I often feel awkward during group activities. I don’t know what to say or how to join in.

Consultant: It’s common to feel that way. How about we work on some simple conversation starters or skills you could use during group activities? What do you think would make it easier for you to join in?

User: Maybe if I had something to say prepared in advance, it would make things less hard. 

Consultant: That sounds like a practical approach! We can brainstorm a few ideas together. What are some topics or questions that interest you that you could share or ask others?

User: I like video games and movies. Asking people what games they're playing or what movies they've seen might work.

Consultant: Great choices! Talking about interests like games or movies can be a good icebreaker. Let’s practice a little: if you were to ask a classmate about their favorite game, how would you start the conversation?

User: I’d probably say something like, “Hey, have you played any good games lately?” 

Consultant: That’s a perfect start! It’s simple and inviting. With practice, you might find it gets easier to connect with your classmates. How do you feel about trying this out in your next group activity?

User: I feel a bit anxious, but also a little hopeful. It might work.

Consultant: That's a good sign! It's normal to feel anxious about trying something new. Remember, even small steps can lead to progress. How do you plan to remind yourself of your positive affirmations when you feel that anxiety creeping in?

User: I could write them down and keep them in my backpack. Then I can look at them before going to class.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Having those affirmations handy can offer you a boost of confidence. As we near the end of our session today, I’d like to summarize what we’ve talked about. How do you feel about the affirmations and social strategies we’ve discussed?

User: I think they could help me feel more confident. 

Consultant: I believe so too! Remember, it's about practice and giving yourself grace as you navigate these changes. Before we conclude, are there any final thoughts or feelings you’d like to share?

User: I just hope I can really start using these ideas. I don’t want to feel this way anymore.

Consultant: I understand, Xiao D. Change takes time, but you've already taken some important steps today. Keep reminding yourself of your strengths. If you continue to practice these techniques, I believe you’ll see improvements in how you feel and interact with others. Remember, if you ever need support, I'm here. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate you talking to me about this.

Consultant: You’re welcome! It’s my pleasure to support you. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care, Xiao D!
###################
Consultant: Hello, D! I'm glad to see you here today. It sounds like you've had a challenging time lately. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling, especially after trying to participate in the social work activity?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty frustrated. When I tried to work with the team, it didn’t go well. I felt like I didn’t connect with anyone, and that made me feel even more isolated.

Consultant: I hear you, D. It sounds like that experience left you feeling quite alone and disappointed. Can you share what specific moments or interactions during the activity contributed to that feeling?

User: Well, when we were discussing ideas, I tried to speak up, but nobody paid attention. I thought they just didn't care about what I had to say. It’s like I was invisible.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, D. Feeling ignored can be hurtful and might lead you to feel distrustful of others. What emotions did you experience in that moment when you felt ignored?

User: I felt angry and embarrassed. I wanted to shout or just leave the room. It's like I tried hard but only ended up looking silly.

Consultant: Anger and embarrassment can be overwhelming feelings. It’s understandable that you wanted to withdraw. If we think about your efforts to connect, what do you think you could try differently in future activities to help you feel heard?

User: I don’t know, maybe I should just stay quiet next time. It seems easier than being embarrassed again.

Consultant: I can see why you might feel that way, but avoiding speaking up could reinforce that feeling of isolation. Let’s explore how we can prepare you to express yourself in a way that feels safer. What if we practiced some responses or ways to engage with your peers? 

User: That might help, but what if they still don’t listen?

Consultant: That's a valid concern, D. Let’s work together to identify some techniques for speaking up confidently. We can also brainstorm signals or topics to engage with others that might pique their interest. How does that sound?

User: Yeah, I guess that could work. What kind of techniques can we use?

Consultant: One technique we could try is role-playing different scenarios. For example, we can simulate a group discussion where you practice starting a conversation. You can also learn how to ask questions to draw people in. Would you be willing to give that a try now?

User: Sure, I can do that. But what if I mess up again?

Consultant: It’s completely okay to make mistakes, D. They are part of learning. Plus, when you try, you'll get feedback that can help you improve. Let’s focus on what feels challenging and remember that every small step counts. Ready to start?

User: Okay, I’ll try. I’ll pretend it’s a group discussion about our favorite movies. 

Consultant: Great choice! Imagine we are in that discussion. Go ahead and start—how would you introduce your idea?

User: Um, I guess I’d say something like, “Hey, I love action movies like ‘Avengers.’ What do you guys think?” 

Consultant: That’s a solid start! You’ve made it inviting for others to share their opinions. How do you feel delivering that line in a group?

User: It feels a bit nerve-wracking, but I think I can do it. 

Consultant: That’s good to hear! Feeling nervous is normal. How about we practice a few more times? We can adjust your approach based on how comfortable you feel each time. 

User: Alright! That sounds okay. 

Consultant: As we practice, let’s also discuss what you might do if someone interrupts or doesn’t respond right away. What would be your plan in that situation?

User: I think I would just wait and try to continue talking if they don’t stop me. 

Consultant: That’s a smart plan! Patience can be key. You could also try to directly engage someone if you feel you’re being ignored. For instance, you might ask, “What do you think?” to draw them in. Would that feel manageable for you?

User: Yeah, I could do that too. 

Consultant: Excellent, D! It’s all about finding strategies that work for you. With practice, you’ll gain confidence in your interactions. Do you feel more hopeful about trying these techniques?

User: I guess I feel a bit better about it. I just hope it works. 

Consultant: It’s completely natural to have uncertainties, and it’s great that you’re willing to give it a shot. Remember, every attempt is progress. After we finish here, you can reflect on our conversation. How do you plan to keep this motivation moving forward?

User: I’ll write down the lines to practice and remind myself to be patient, I think. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea, D! Keeping a reminder can help reinforce your commitment. Just remember, it may take several tries, but that's part of the journey. 

User: Thanks! It's nice to think it’s okay if it takes time. 

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s perfectly fine to take your time with this. Each step you take is a positive move forward. Before we wrap up, how do you feel about the progress we made today?

User: I feel a little more confident. I’m still nervous, but now I have something to work on! 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, D! Strengthening your confidence is a significant step. As you continue practicing, you might surprise yourself with how far you’ve come. We’ve laid a good foundation today. 

User: Yeah! I’m looking forward to seeing how it goes. 

Consultant: I’m excited for you, too! Keep challenging yourself, and remember that I'm here to support you. Let's check in on your progress next time we meet. You’ve got this!

User: Thank you! I feel better after talking today.

Consultant: You're welcome, D! It’s been a pleasure talking with you. Remember, each step is valuable. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care of yourself!
###################
Consultant: Hello, D! I'm really glad you're here today. I'd like to start by understanding how you've been feeling lately, especially with your new efforts to speak up in class. Can you share more about your experiences?

User: Hi. Well, I've been trying to participate more in class, but it hasn't been easy. I feel nervous when I speak up, and sometimes it feels like my classmates and even the teacher don’t understand me. It makes me wonder if I should just give up.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling quite anxious and uncertain about your efforts. It's understandable to feel this way when trying something new. Let's explore this together—what do you think has been the most challenging part of trying to speak up in class?

User: I guess I feel really judged when I talk. It’s like everyone is watching me, and if I say something wrong, they’ll think I’m stupid. It makes me want to hide.

Consultant: That’s a heavy feeling to carry, D. It’s tough when it seems like others are judging us. Can you recall a specific moment when you spoke up and felt that way? What thoughts were running through your mind?

User: Just last week, I answered a question about science. I thought I did okay, but then I heard someone whisper, and it made me feel really embarrassed. I started thinking maybe I shouldn’t even try.

Consultant: Experiencing whispers or any negative feedback can be really discouraging. What were those thoughts telling you? How did they make you feel about your abilities?

User: I thought, "I shouldn’t even have bothered," and "Maybe I’m just not smart enough." It made me feel really down, and I just wanted to quit.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really harsh. It’s common to have such negative self-talk, but it doesn’t reflect reality. Let’s examine that thinking a bit. How much evidence do you think supports those thoughts? Are there times when you felt you did well or learned something new?

User: Well, I remember I got a good score on my last science test. And I do enjoy learning about science. Sometimes it feels good to share what I know. 

Consultant: That’s a great observation, D! You have shown that you can succeed and enjoy science. If you were to look at the positive moments, how might that change the way you view your speaking up in class?

User: I guess if I focus on the good parts like the test, it might help. Maybe I shouldn’t let one bad experience make me give up.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on your successes, however small, can help build your confidence. Let’s set a small goal. What would be a positive step you can take next time you want to speak in class? 

User: Maybe I can take a deep breath and remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful strategy, D! Taking a deep breath can help calm your nerves. How about we also think of a small reward for yourself each time you try speaking up, no matter how it goes?

User: A reward? Like treating myself to something fun afterward?

Consultant: Yes! That can be a great way to reinforce your efforts. What kind of reward do you think would be motivating for you?

User: I like playing video games, so maybe I could play a bit longer after class if I speak up.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Associating your effort with something you enjoy can keep you motivated. As you work on this, how can you remind yourself of your successes in science?

User: I could keep a small journal and write down the things I learn and my accomplishments. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Keeping a journal will allow you to track your progress and reflect on your positive experiences. How do you feel about your ability to stick to this plan?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful now. It sounds like a good way to keep my focus on the positives.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, every small effort counts. Acknowledging your success can help you remain positive, even through tough times. What would you like to say to yourself when you feel those negative thoughts creeping in again?

User: I think I’d tell myself that I’m learning and it’s okay not to be perfect right away. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful affirmation to have, D! It emphasizes growth and learning rather than perfection. As we wrap up today, what do you believe is the biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think it’s that I shouldn’t focus too much on the negatives and instead celebrate my small wins in science and when I speak up.

Consultant: Yes, exactly! Celebrating those small wins is key to maintaining your motivation. Remember, I’m here to support you. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out. You're making great progress, and I’m proud of you!
###################
Consultant: Hi there, D! It's great to see you today. I remember last time we talked about your new interest in the science club. How are you feeling about that?

User: Hi! I'm actually feeling pretty good. I really enjoyed being part of the science club. It's nice to be around others who like science too. 

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Finding support from peers can make a big difference. What specific aspects of being in the science club do you enjoy the most?

User: I like doing experiments and figuring things out with my teammates. It makes me feel like I'm actually good at something for once.

Consultant: It’s fantastic to hear that you're finding your strengths in experiments and teamwork! How has this new interest affected how you view your abilities overall?

User: I think I’m starting to believe I can actually be good at science. Before, I always felt like I wasn't good at anything.

Consultant: That’s a significant change in how you see yourself, D. Believing in your abilities can really empower you. What small goals do you think you could set for yourself in science to keep that momentum going?

User: Maybe I could aim to do well on the next science project or help my team win a competition. That would be really cool!

Consultant: Setting those goals sounds exciting! Achieving them can definitely reinforce your confidence. How do you feel about managing your time to work towards these science goals alongside your other commitments?

User: I sometimes struggle to find time for everything. I get distracted easily, so it's hard to stick to a plan.

Consultant: That’s a common challenge. Would you be open to discussing some strategies that could help you manage your time better while also keeping your motivation high for science?

User: Sure! I’d like to learn how to balance everything without getting overwhelmed.

Consultant: Great! One effective approach is to create a daily schedule that breaks down your tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds helpful. I think if I plan my day, I won’t feel so lost.

Consultant: Exactly! Planning can help you gain a sense of control. When you have tasks laid out, it can be easier to see progress as you complete them. Would you like to try creating a sample schedule together?

User: Yes, let's do that! I want to start this week.

Consultant: Awesome! Let’s outline key activities you have, like school, time for science activities, and some leisure time to recharge. What does your typical day look like right now?

User: I go to school, come home, do homework, and then I feel tired and just play video games. I don’t really plan much.

Consultant: Thanks for sharing that. It sounds like after school, you might be looking for a way to relax, which is totally fine. How about we allocate specific time slots for homework, science projects, and fun activities like gaming? 

User: That sounds good! If I have a plan, maybe I won’t feel as bad about spending time on games.

Consultant: Yes! By scheduling your tasks, you can enjoy gaming guilt-free, knowing you’ve accomplished your goals. Would you like to set specific time slots for science study each week?

User: I think I could set aside about an hour after school on some days just for science.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Setting aside even just an hour can help you dive deeper into your interests. Will you keep track of your progress in a notebook to see how much you accomplish each week?

User: That sounds like a fun idea! I could check off what I finish, and then I’ll feel more accomplished.

Consultant: Exactly! Those check-offs can really provide a sense of achievement. How would it feel to document your progress and see how far you've come in a few weeks?

User: It would probably feel really satisfying. I hope I’d be proud of what I’ve done.

Consultant: I believe you will be! Recognizing your achievements is an important part of maintaining motivation and positive self-belief. Would you also consider sharing your successes with someone, like your grandpa or a friend?

User: I could tell my grandpa. I think he'd be proud of me if I show him my projects.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Sharing your achievements can strengthen your connection with him, too. How do you think he would respond to your progress in science?

User: He’d probably be happy, but he also expects a lot from me, so I hope I can meet those expectations.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel that pressure, but remember that your growth is what truly matters. Focus on your progress and the joy you find in science, rather than just meeting expectations. How does that sound to you?

User: That makes sense. I guess I should focus on doing my best rather than worrying too much about what he thinks.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s about your journey and growth. As you continue to discover your strengths and interests, you'll build more confidence. What’s one thing you feel excited to tackle this week in your science study?

User: I want to try building a model for our next project!

Consultant: That sounds exciting! Building models can really help deepen your understanding. Let’s make sure you stick to your plan and enjoy the process. Check back in with me next time to share how it went!

User: I will! This was really helpful. Thanks for the support!

Consultant: Anytime, D! You're showing such growth and motivation. I’m looking forward to hearing all about your experience in the next session. Take care and enjoy your science explorations!

User: Bye! I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao D! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, especially after participating in the group discussions. I was able to express myself more openly.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It sounds like you found those interactions supportive. Can you tell me more about what you liked about the group discussions?

User: I liked how everyone shared their thoughts. It made me feel like I could connect with others better, and I didn’t feel so alone.

Consultant: That sense of connection is really important. It seems like being part of the group helped you feel more engaged. What do you think contributed to your ability to open up?

User: I guess I wasn’t as afraid to speak up since everyone else was sharing too. It felt safe somehow.

Consultant: Feeling safe is key to opening up. It sounds like you’re beginning to trust these interactions. Have you noticed any changes in your feelings towards school or studying since then?

User: Yes! I'm starting to think if I can approach studying in a more relaxed way, instead of getting so angry or overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s a positive change. What would it look like for you to study without feeling overwhelmed?

User: Maybe if I could take short breaks and not push myself too hard? That way, I could focus better.

Consultant: Taking breaks can definitely help with focus. It’s great that you're considering how to manage your study time. What do you think would help you keep this approach consistent?

User: I guess having a plan would help. Like setting specific times for studying and breaks.

Consultant: A structured plan sounds like a good idea! How comfortable do you feel about creating a study schedule?

User: I think I could try that. It feels more manageable thinking about it this way.

Consultant: That’s an encouraging outlook. In addition to your study schedule, are there any skills you’ve learned in our sessions that you think can support you in maintaining this positive mindset?

User: I remember you talked about recognizing negative thoughts. I think that could help me not get frustrated when studying.

Consultant: Absolutely! Identifying those negative thoughts is crucial. How about we practice that? Can you think of a negative thought that comes to mind when you think about studying?

User: Sometimes I think, "I'll never understand anything," and that makes me not want to try.

Consultant: I see. That’s a tough thought to deal with. What evidence do you have that supports this feeling? Are there instances where you did understand something?

User: Well, there were times when I got good grades on tests, so I guess I do understand some things.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to remind yourself of those successes. What would you say to a friend who was feeling the same way about studying?

User: I would tell them that they can understand things if they keep trying and to focus on what they’ve learned.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful piece of advice! You can apply that same kindness to yourself. How do you feel about replacing that negative thought with a more encouraging one?

User: I think I could say something like, "I can learn at my own pace, and I've done it before."

Consultant: That’s an excellent alternative thought! By focusing on your achievements and allowing yourself to take breaks, you’re giving yourself the chance to succeed. 

User: I really like that perspective.

Consultant: I'm glad you do! As we move forward, what strategies can you implement to continue reinforcing this positive mindset in your daily life?

User: I could try journaling about my achievements and remind myself of them when I feel low.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy. Reflecting on your progress will help keep your spirits up. Are there any other areas you’d like to explore or discuss today?

User: I think I want to make sure I stay connected with friends, too. I feel better when I'm not alone.

Consultant: Staying connected is vital! How about we brainstorm some ways to maintain those friendships during busy school times?

User: We could set up study groups or just hang out more often. That’d be nice!

Consultant: Perfect! Strengthening those friendships can really help you feel supported. What’s your next step regarding your study plan and friendships?

User: I’ll start by writing out my study schedule and reaching out to friends to plan some hangouts.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Xiao D. I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes. As we conclude our session today, what would you say you’ve learned about managing your feelings and making progress?

User: I’ve learned that it’s okay to ask for help and that I can replace negative thoughts with positive reminders. I feel more hopeful now.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization, and I’m so proud of how far you’ve come. Remember, you can always reach out when you need support. Would you like to summarize any last thoughts before we finish?

User: Just that I feel motivated to keep trying. Thank you for helping me see things differently!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep nurturing that motivation. I believe in your ability to grow and succeed. Take care until we meet again!
