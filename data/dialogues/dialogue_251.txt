Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm glad to see you today. Before we begin, I want to hear about how you’ve been feeling recently. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really anxious, especially because there’s a girl I like at school. I keep thinking about asking her out, but my past experience of being rejected still haunts me. Plus, my disability makes me feel unworthy of love.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Chen. It sounds like you're in a tough spot, feeling both anxious about potential rejection and struggling with how your disability affects your self-worth. What would it mean for you to feel more confident in approaching her?

User: I guess it would mean feeling good about myself, believing that I deserve to be loved just like anyone else. It would feel freeing to just approach her without this constant fear.

Consultant: That’s a powerful aspiration, Chen. Let’s explore your feelings further. When you think about approaching this girl, what specific thoughts go through your mind that add to your anxiety?

User: I keep thinking, “What if she sees my disability and judges me?” or “What if she's just not interested because I’m not perfect?”

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very distressing. It’s understandable to have those worries. What feelings do these thoughts bring up for you?

User: They make me feel hopeless and insecure. Sometimes I just don’t want to try at all because I think it’s not worth it.

Consultant: I can see how easily those negative thoughts can make you feel defeated. Let’s delve into those thoughts a bit more. How accurate do you think those thoughts about her judging you are? Could there be alternative perspectives to consider?

User: I guess there’s really no proof that she would judge me that way. Maybe I’m just projecting my own insecurities onto her.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Chen! Recognizing that you might be projecting your own fears can help shift your perspective. What might happen if you reframed those thoughts to something more supportive?

User: Maybe I could think, “She may not care about my disability and might appreciate me for who I am.” 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a more positive way to view it. Now, let’s think about how you can take some small steps toward building up your confidence in this situation. What might be a manageable action you could take?

User: I suppose I could try talking to her in a casual setting, maybe in class or while studying. Just starting a conversation might help.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic approach! Starting a conversation in a relaxed environment can alleviate some pressure. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a little nervous but also excited about the possibility. It's a small step, but it feels like it could lead somewhere.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you feel some excitement! Remember, it’s normal to feel nervous, but taking that small step can be a big breakthrough. Do you have any specific strategies in mind on how you might initiate that conversation?

User: I could ask her about an assignment or something we both have in common to break the ice.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Shared topics can help ease the conversation. How about we discuss how you might handle any negative thoughts that pop up when you approach her?

User: Right. I guess I could remind myself that it’s just a conversation and not a life-or-death situation.

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping it light can help reduce pressure. Would you like to role-play that conversation a bit to practice?

User: Sure, that could help! 

Consultant: Great! I’ll be the girl, and you can start the conversation. Whenever you feel ready.

User: Okay… “Hey! I noticed we have the same assignment for class. What do you think about it?”

Consultant: “Oh, hey! Yeah, I think it’s really interesting but a bit challenging. How about you?” 

User: I feel like I would be nervous in that moment, but it’s good to think about how it could go.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous. The more you practice, the easier it will become. Remember, even if it feels challenging, each conversation is a learning experience. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel more prepared now. I still have some nerves, but I think I can do it.

Consultant: That’s an excellent mindset, Chen! It’s natural to feel a bit nervous, but you’re building the confidence to face it. Let’s also talk about how to handle any potential negative feedback you might encounter. How would you like to prepare for that?

User: I could remind myself that rejection is part of life and doesn’t reflect my worth. 

Consultant: Exactly! Rejection doesn’t define you. Each experience contributes to your growth. Let’s reflect on all the progress you’ve made today. What stands out to you?

User: I’ve recognized some of my negative thoughts and found ways to challenge them. Plus, I feel equipped to start that conversation.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Chen! You’re taking meaningful steps toward building your confidence. As we wrap up, how can you ensure you carry these strategies into the future?

User: I could write them down and remind myself whenever I start feeling anxious again.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Having a reminder can help reinforce your positive mindset. Remember, you’re capable of creating positive experiences. Today is a significant step forward. If you ever feel you need guidance, don’t hesitate to reach out again. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about the situation now. 

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that, Chen! Remember, you have the tools to navigate it. Take care, and I wish you all the best in your next steps!

Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been quite anxious, especially after that incident in the club. The comments about my disability really got to me. I find myself overthinking every interaction now.

Consultant: I can imagine how hurtful that must have felt. You’ve been thinking a lot about how others perceive you, and that has added to your anxiety, right? Let’s talk about what specifically troubles you in social situations lately.

User: Yes, it's like I’m constantly worried that people will judge me because of my foot. I want to make connections, but I feel like this cloud hangs over me.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to be accepted while also dealing with your fears of judgment. Have there been specific thoughts or worries that come to mind when you’re in those social settings?

User: I often think, "What if they look at me differently?" or "What if I can't fit in because of my situation?" It's exhausting to keep running these scenarios in my head.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly tiring. Those thoughts seem to create a barrier for you. Let’s explore them together. What emotions do you feel when these thoughts arise?

User: I feel anxious and sometimes even a little embarrassed. It just makes me want to withdraw from situations altogether.

Consultant: It's understandable to want to avoid discomfort. But withdrawing might prevent you from forming those connections you desire. What do you think would happen if you confronted those fears step by step?

User: I guess I would probably feel more empowered if I didn’t let it control me. But I'm not sure how to start.

Consultant: That’s a positive insight. You mentioned wanting to feel more empowered; one way to approach this is through gradual exposure to those social situations. Can we think of small steps you could take to face those feelings?

User: I could try attending more club meetings and maybe start conversations with new members. It sounds scary, but I want to try.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Starting small, like initiating a conversation with one new person, could help. What would be a comfortable way for you to start those conversations?

User: Maybe just introducing myself and asking them about their interests? I guess if I focus on them instead of me, it might help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Shifting the focus to the other person can lessen the pressure you feel. When you introduce yourself, how do you think you could present your disability in a way that feels comfortable for you?

User: Maybe I don't have to bring it up immediately. I can just talk about common interests first and see where it goes.

Consultant: That's a wise approach! By focusing on shared interests, you can build a connection without immediately addressing any sensitive topics. How would it feel to give this a try in the upcoming meeting?

User: It feels a bit nerve-wracking, but I like the idea of easing into it. It might work out better than I think.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Remember, it’s okay to feel anxious; the goal is to take those small steps despite the anxiety. How can you remind yourself of this mindset when you feel those familiar worries creep in?

User: I could write down some positive affirmations or reminders to encourage myself before the event. 

Consultant: Writing affirmations is an excellent strategy! You might also visualize the interaction going well. What would success look like to you in that meeting?

User: Success for me would be having a few good conversations and maybe even making some new friends. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful goals, Chen! When you think about success, it helps you focus on what you can control. Remember, you're also learning and growing, and that’s valuable regardless of the outcome.

User: Yes, that makes sense. I often forget that it’s about the process, not just the results.

Consultant: Exactly! Learning from the experience is what builds confidence over time. How do you think you would feel if you achieved your small goal of having a few conversations?

User: I would feel proud of myself. It would definitely boost my confidence.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! By acknowledging your achievements, no matter how small, you can cultivate that confidence. Based on our discussion, what do you think your first step will be when you go to the next meeting?

User: I think my first step will be to introduce myself to someone new and ask about their interests, then just see how the conversation flows.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! As we wrap up today, what are your key takeaways from our session?

User: I realized that I can handle social situations by focusing on others and taking small steps. Plus, having a reminder to encourage myself will help.

Consultant: Those are excellent insights! Before we end, how will you prepare yourself for the next meeting to ensure you feel more secure and ready to engage?

User: I’ll create a few positive prompts to read before the event and remind myself that it's a learning experience.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy, Chen! I’m proud of you for taking these steps towards your goals. Remember, I'm here if you need to talk again in the future. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. It was helpful talking today. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in your ability to face these challenges. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a mix of excitement and confusion. I recently managed to talk to a girl I like, and it felt great, but I'm still uncertain about where things are heading.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you had a positive experience talking to her! That must feel encouraging. Can you tell me more about what you’re uncertain about regarding your feelings towards her?

User: Well, I’m just not sure if she’s interested in me. I worry that I might be reading the signals wrong, you know? It’s all very confusing.

Consultant: That's completely understandable. Uncertainty can often cloud our judgment in these situations. Let’s explore what specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about her potential interest in you. What do you usually tell yourself?

User: I tend to think that maybe she’s just being polite or friendly. I doubt that she would actually like me as more than a friend.

Consultant: Those thoughts could understandably lead to some insecurity. It sounds like there's a sense of doubt about your value in her eyes. How does thinking this way make you feel when you interact with her?

User: It makes me anxious. I really overthink everything—like what to say or how she might react. Sometimes I even just want to avoid talking to her altogether to spare myself the stress.

Consultant: It sounds like that anxiety is really affecting your ability to interact with her freely. Let’s examine this thought pattern. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that she only sees you as a friend?

User: Well, she hasn't explicitly told me she likes me, and she talks to other guys too. It just feels safe to think that way.

Consultant: It’s natural to want to protect yourself from potential rejection. However, what if we considered other possibilities? Is there evidence that might suggest she enjoys your company and values your interactions?

User: I mean, she does smile a lot when we talk and seems engaged in our conversations. Maybe I’m just overthinking… 

Consultant: Those signs are important, Chen! It sounds like there might be more positive aspects to your interactions than you initially recognized. How do you feel about attempting to shift your focus from the worries to the positive signs?

User: I guess it could help to remind myself of the good moments instead of just dwelling on the negatives. 

Consultant: Absolutely, focusing on the positives can foster a healthier perspective. It could also help you feel more confident in continuing to develop this connection with her. What could be a small step you could take to practice this new mindset?

User: Maybe I could take a little risk and ask her to hang out more casually, like just as friends, to see how it goes.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Taking a small step can help you gauge her interest without overwhelming yourself. How can I support you in feeling more confident about this?

User: Just talking about it helps. I think I need to keep reminding myself that it’s okay to take risks in social situations.

Consultant: That's a helpful realization. It’s great to recognize that taking risks can lead to growth. Have you thought about what you’d like to do or say when you approach her next?

User: I haven’t really, but maybe I could just ask her to grab coffee or study together. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful approach! A casual coffee can create a comfortable environment for both of you. How do you feel about carrying that plan forward?

User: I’m feeling a bit more excited about it now. It just seems more manageable when I think about it this way.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Taking small, meaningful steps can definitely help lessen anxiety. As you prepare for this, think about how you want to maintain that positive outlook. What strategies could you employ if those anxious thoughts arise again?

User: I think I could remind myself of her positive gestures and our good conversations. And I could tell myself it’s okay to be vulnerable.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy, Chen! Reminding yourself of the positives and allowing vulnerability can really enhance your experiences. Before we conclude, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed today—what’s one key takeaway you have from this session?

User: I realized that my internal doubts might be clouding my views on her interest. Focusing on the positive signs and being open to risks can really change how I feel about the situation.

Consultant: Exactly! That awareness is significant. Remember, building relationships takes time and practice. You’ve made real progress in understanding your feelings today. Are there any last questions or thoughts you'd like to share before we wrap up?

User: No, I think I’m good for now! I feel more prepared to handle things moving forward. 

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear, Chen! I believe in your ability to navigate these feelings. If you ever need more support, I’m here for you. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!

User: Thank you! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm glad you're here today. How are you feeling about what we've discussed in our previous sessions?

User: Hi! I've been reflecting on the psychological education seminar I attended recently. It sparked some new thoughts about sexual knowledge and attitudes, but I'm still a bit confused about applying them in my daily life.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you found the seminar enlightening. You've gained some new insights, which is a positive step. Can you share more about what specifically confused you regarding applying this knowledge?

User: Well, I learned about healthy sexual attitudes, but I still feel awkward talking about it, especially with someone I like. I don't know how to approach the topic without feeling embarrassed.

Consultant: I understand that discussing these topics can feel intimidating. Building the confidence to express yourself openly is a journey. What would it look like for you to feel more comfortable discussing sexual topics?

User: I guess I would like to be more relaxed and able to share my feelings without feeling shy or worried about judgment.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful goal. Feeling relaxed and free to express yourself is essential. Can we explore what situations provoke that shyness for you? 

User: Sure. Whenever I think about talking to a girl I like, like my classmate, my mind goes blank. I just start overthinking everything.

Consultant: Overthinking can definitely contribute to those feelings of awkwardness. What kind of thoughts go through your mind whenever you think about approaching her?

User: I keep thinking that she'll reject me, just like it happened before. It makes me hesitate and not want to try at all.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel anxious about rejection, especially if you've experienced it in the past. Let's challenge that thought: what evidence do you have that she would reject you based solely on your feelings?

User: I don't really have concrete evidence. It's just a fear I have from my past experiences.

Consultant: It sounds like that fear is based more on past events rather than the present situation. If a friend were to come to you with a similar fear, what advice would you give them?

User: I would probably tell them that they shouldn't let past experiences hold them back. They should just be themselves and see what happens.

Consultant: That's a great perspective! It sounds like you recognize the importance of not letting past fears dictate your present actions. What might be a small step you could take to practice this advice yourself?

User: Maybe I could try starting a casual conversation with her about something we both enjoy, like our classes. 

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect starting point! A casual conversation can ease the pressure. Remember, it’s about connecting over shared interests. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited. I think it might be easier than jumping straight into deeper topics.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel a mix of nerves and excitement. The important part is that you’re willing to take that step. Let’s consider what you might do before that conversation to calm those nerves.

User: I could practice what I want to say or even write down some points to help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Practicing can be really helpful! It not only builds your confidence but also makes the conversation feel more natural. What feelings do you hope to experience after that conversation? 

User: I hope to feel proud of myself for trying, regardless of the outcome.

Consultant: That pride in taking action is a valuable outcome! Remember to celebrate that effort. Let's also think about how you can maintain this openness in other areas of your life. Any ideas on how to practice expressing yourself more?

User: I guess I could try talking more about my interests with friends. That feels safer.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your interests with friends is an excellent way to build your confidence. It creates a comfortable space for you to express yourself. How do you feel about incorporating that into your routine?

User: I think I'll give it a try. It seems less daunting to start small with people I trust.

Consultant: That's a fantastic approach! Starting with familiar people can make it feel less intimidating. As you practice, you'll likely find it easier to expand those conversations into new settings. 

User: Yeah, that sounds reasonable. I’m starting to feel more hopeful about this!

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Recognizing your ability to improve and express yourself is significant. Let's finish our session today by reviewing what you've gained from our conversation. What stands out to you?

User: I learned that I shouldn't let past fears control me and that taking small steps can help build my confidence. 

Consultant: Exactly! You have a lot of valuable insights there. Remember, every small step counts. How will you carry this motivation into your upcoming conversations?

User: I’ll focus on being more open and taking those small steps. I feel more equipped now!

Consultant: You’ve made great progress today! Remember, I'll be here to support you whenever you need to talk again in the future. How do you feel about where you are now?

User: I feel really good! I'm excited to put this into practice. Thank you!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Chen! I'm proud of the progress you've made. Until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm glad to see you again. It sounds like you had a positive experience in your group discussion. How are you feeling about it now?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel encouraged after sharing my feelings about my disability. It's nice to be accepted, but I'm still a bit worried about expressing my feelings to a girl I like.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling inspired by the acceptance you received! It’s completely natural to feel worried about expressing your feelings, especially towards someone you like. What specifically makes you feel uneasy about that?

User: I guess I'm scared of being rejected again. My last experience was really tough for me. I don't want to go through that pain again.

Consultant: That's understandable, Chen. Rejection can be really painful, especially when you’re opening yourself up to someone. Let's explore that feeling a bit more. When you think about expressing your feelings to her, what thoughts run through your mind?

User: I often think she won't like me because of my disability. I feel that it's a burden and that people won't accept me fully just because of it.

Consultant: It sounds like you have some very strong beliefs about your situation and how it may affect your relationships. It might help to challenge those thoughts a bit. Can you think of any reasons why someone might appreciate you beyond your disability?

User: Well, I’m a good listener, and I try to be supportive to my friends—that counts for something, right?

Consultant: Absolutely, those qualities are very valuable! It’s important to recognize the positive aspects you bring to friendships and relationships. How might you remind yourself of those strengths when you're feeling insecure?

User: Maybe I could write them down or tell myself that I’m a good person. But sometimes, it feels hard to believe that.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Writing down your strengths can serve as a good reminder. It’s completely normal to struggle with self-belief, but challenging those negative thoughts is key. What could you tell yourself in the moment to counter those feelings of doubt?

User: I could say something like, “I am worthy, and I have so much to offer.” 

Consultant: Those affirmations sound encouraging! It’s powerful to remind yourself of your worth. If you were to talk to a friend in your situation, what advice would you give them about facing fear of rejection?

User: I’d probably tell them to just be honest about their feelings and that it’s okay to be vulnerable. It might be scary, but being open is important.

Consultant: That's wonderful advice! You really understand the importance of vulnerability. How do you think you can apply that same perspective to your own situation?

User: I guess I should try to be honest and accept that it’s part of the process, even if it’s scary.

Consultant: Exactly. Embracing that honesty can open new doors for you. What small step could you take towards being open with her, even in a casual context?

User: Maybe I could start by complimenting her or asking her about her interests to build a connection.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Connecting over shared interests can create a natural flow of conversation. How do you feel about starting with that approach?

User: It makes me feel a bit better to have a plan. It seems less intimidating when I think about it like that.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Having a plan can help reduce anxiety. Remember, it's just about connecting and not putting too much pressure on yourself. How do you think you'll feel after taking that first step?

User: I think I would feel proud of myself for trying. It might even boost my confidence a little.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking that first step can foster a sense of accomplishment. As you prepare to approach her, what mindset would you like to carry with you?

User: I want to carry a mindset of being open and positive, telling myself that whatever happens, it’s part of learning.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset, Chen! Embracing the learning aspect can help you navigate the experience, regardless of the outcome. Moving forward, how do you plan to remind yourself of this openness?

User: I could keep reminding myself daily, maybe even in my journal. Writing things down seems to help me clarify my thoughts.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Journaling can be a powerful tool for self-reflection and maintaining that positive mindset. As we wrap up today, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I feel more confident about expressing myself and managing my fears. I also have a clearer idea of how to approach the girl I like.

Consultant: That’s wonderful progress, Chen! I'm proud of your development and confident that you will continue to build on this momentum. Remember, it’s all about taking small steps and being gentle with yourself. If you need to talk again, I'm here for you. 

User: Thank you, I really appreciate your support! I feel much better now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep nurturing your communication skills, and I look forward to our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Chen! I'm thrilled to see you for today's session. How have you been feeling lately regarding your studies and social interactions?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good overall. I've been actively participating in club activities and taking on significant roles in academic projects. It's been empowering and has made me feel more confident. However, I'm still a bit troubled about expressing my feelings to a girl I like.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling empowered and confident with your activities! It sounds like you’re making excellent progress. Let's explore a bit further about this situation with the girl. What specifically has been troubling you about expressing your feelings to her?

User: I just feel really anxious about the possibility of being rejected again. The last time I confessed my feelings, it didn’t go well, and I'm worried it might happen again.

Consultant: I understand that past experiences can cast a shadow on new opportunities. It's completely natural to feel anxious thinking about rejection. Think back to that situation—what thoughts crossed your mind when you decided to confess last time?

User: I thought that if I just told her how I felt, everything would be fine. But when she rejected me, I felt embarrassed and thought I should have just kept my feelings to myself.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience led you to some negative thoughts about expressing your feelings. Have you noticed if these thoughts come back when you think about approaching her again?

User: Yes, definitely. I start thinking that I might embarrass myself or that she might laugh at me. 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really tough, and they can create a cycle of anxiety. What if we examined those thoughts a bit more? How likely is it that she would react negatively? Is there any evidence to support or refute that fear?

User: I guess I don’t really know how she would react, but my brain just jumps to the worst-case scenario. I think it’s because I fear what I can’t predict.

Consultant: That makes sense. When we fear the unknown, our minds often fill in the blanks with negative outcomes. Let’s try imagining your approach to her. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about handling their feelings?

User: I’d tell them to be honest and that it’s okay to express their feelings regardless of the outcome. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! It highlights the value of authenticity and courage. Now, can we work on a positive reframe together? What would be a healthier or more supportive way to think about this situation?

User: Maybe I could think of it as an opportunity to share my feelings, regardless of the outcome. If it doesn’t work out, at least I’ll know, and I can move on.

Consultant: That sounds like a powerful way to view it! By approaching this with openness, you might lessen the burden of expectations. What strategies can we create to help you prepare for that conversation with her?

User: I think practicing what I want to say might help, and maybe even sharing my feelings with a close friend for feedback prior to approaching her.

Consultant: Those are excellent tactics! Practicing can really boost your confidence. Let’s set a plan for when and how you’ll do this. How about scheduling a time to practice this week?

User: That sounds good. I could practice tomorrow evening and then maybe talk to my friend afterward for input. 

Consultant: Perfect! That gives you a chance to refine your approach. After that, we can regroup and see how you felt about it. Remember, it's about the experience and growth, not just the outcome.

User: Right! I think approaching it like that takes some pressure off me. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It sounds like you’re moving towards a healthy mindset. Let’s also discuss ways to reinforce your self-confidence following your practice. What are some activities or affirmations that make you feel good about yourself?

User: I like to remind myself of my accomplishments in my studies and clubs. They make me feel proud and reinforce my self-worth.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Keeping a journal to note these accomplishments can be a great way to remind yourself of your strengths. How about planning to jot down a few things each week that you're proud of? 

User: I can definitely do that! It seems like a great idea to keep my spirits up and measure my growth over time.

Consultant: Absolutely! As you continue to recognize your achievements, it will help boost your confidence overall. Let’s recap what we’ve discussed today. You’re preparing to practice expressing your feelings, reinforcing your self-worth, and using positive self-talk to reduce anxiety. Does that resonate with you?

User: Yes, it really does. I feel like I have a clearer path forward now.

Consultant: I’m really proud of the progress you’re making. Remember to be kind to yourself during this process. You’re showing wonderful initiative and resilience. What do you feel would be your next step after our session today?

User: I think my next step is to practice what I want to say and keep reinforcing the positive thoughts we talked about. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Chen. You’re taking meaningful steps towards your goals. In our next session, we can discuss how your practice went and any feelings that arose. 

User: I look forward to it! Thank you for your support today. It really helped me to clarify my thoughts and feelings.

Consultant: My pleasure! I'm here to support you. Remember, you’re capable of handling this, and I’m excited to hear about your progress in our next session. Take care until then!
