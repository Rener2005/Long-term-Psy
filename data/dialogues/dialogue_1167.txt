Consultant: Hello, Xu! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious, especially after moving into the new dorm. My relationship with my roommates has not been great, and it's just made my obsessive thoughts worse. I feel helpless.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like the situation with your roommates is significantly impacting your mental state and causing you a lot of distress. Can you share more about the specific thoughts you're experiencing?

User: I keep worrying that I'm not being a good roommate or that they think I'm annoying. I replay conversations in my mind, thinking I might have upset them without realizing it.

Consultant: It sounds exhausting to be caught in that cycle of thinking. When those thoughts arise, what emotions do they trigger for you?

User: I feel anxious and sometimes even a bit depressed. I start doubting myself and my social skills. It makes me feel even more isolated.

Consultant: That isolation can be really tough. It's important to recognize that these feelings and thoughts can often distort our view of reality. Have you noticed any patterns in these obsessive thoughts when you’re around your roommates?

User: Yeah, I always feel like I need to say or do the right thing, or else I’m going to ruin our relationship. It’s like I freeze up or overthink everything.

Consultant: That definitely adds pressure to your interactions. You mentioned feeling like you might ruin the relationship. Let's challenge that thought a bit—what evidence do you have that supports or contradicts this idea?

User: I guess there isn't any real evidence that I'm ruining things. It just feels that way in my mind. 

Consultant: It's insightful that you've recognized this difference. It’s easy for our minds to exaggerate situations. If a friend were in your position, what advice would you give them about these feelings?

User: I would tell them to relax and that not everything has to be perfect. But I can’t seem to take that advice for myself.

Consultant: That's a common struggle. It's easier to offer wisdom to others than to apply it ourselves. What if we worked together to create a plan for communicating with your roommates? 

User: I think that could be helpful. I really want to improve our relationship but I don't know how to start that conversation.

Consultant: We can brainstorm some ways of initiating a conversation that feels comfortable for you. What would be a small step you could take that feels manageable?

User: Maybe I could invite them to hang out or ask them about their day. It’s not too intrusive, right?

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! Simple, open questions can help ease any tension. How do you feel about that approach?

User: I think it might work! I just hope they don't feel pressured or anything.

Consultant: That’s understandable. You’re being considerate of their feelings, which is a positive sign. Remember, it’s okay to be vulnerable and share how you’re feeling too. It may open up the lines of communication. 

User: You’re right. Maybe sharing a bit about my stress can help them understand my perspective.

Consultant: Exactly! Sharing your feelings could foster empathy and understanding. Would you be willing to practice how you might express that stress with them?

User: Sure! I could say something like, “I’ve been feeling a bit anxious lately about our living situation, and it would help me to talk about it.”

Consultant: That's a clear and honest statement. It opens the door for a dialogue. How do you think they might respond to that?

User: Hopefully positively. I really want them to understand I'm not trying to be difficult.

Consultant: That’s a good intention. Remember, communication is a two-way street. If you set the stage for open dialogue, it's likely they’ll respond in kind. 

User: I hope so. It just feels like a big step for me.

Consultant: It's definitely a step outside your comfort zone, but taking small steps can lead to significant changes. How about we set a goal for you to try this within the next week?

User: Yes, I think I'll aim to do it by the end of the week.

Consultant: Great! Once you've had that conversation, we can discuss how it went in our next session. Remember, no matter the outcome, you're taking control of your situation.

User: Thank you for reminding me of that. I’ll do my best.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xu. It takes courage to face these challenges. Keep practicing self-compassion through this process. How are you feeling about our conversation today? 

User: I feel a bit lighter, actually. Just talking through my thoughts helps. But I’m still worried about the outcome.

Consultant: It's normal to feel concerned about the unknown. Acknowledge those feelings, but try not to let them overwhelm you. You’re equipped with strategies to cope as things unfold.

User: That makes sense. I’ll try to keep that in mind. 

Consultant: I'm here to support you. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you'd like to address or any other thoughts on your mind?

User: No, I think we covered everything. I just hope I can be brave enough to actually talk to them.

Consultant: I believe you can. Remember, bravery is often found in the small actions we take, and this step is important for you. I'm proud of you for committing to this.

User: Thank you. I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xu! I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care of yourself in the meantime. 

User: I will! See you next time.

Consultant: See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xu! I'm glad to see you today. Last time we spoke, you mentioned feeling a bit down about your attempts to communicate with your dorm mates. How have things been since then?

User: Hi! I've tried to talk to them a few more times, but it didn’t really help. I just feel like I'm failing at communication, and it makes me question if I can manage social situations at all.

Consultant: It sounds really frustrating to feel that you're not getting through to them. Communication can be challenging, especially in a shared living environment. Can you share a specific instance where you felt the communication didn’t go well?

User: Well, there was one time when I tried to talk about our schedules to see when we could all clean up together. But they seemed uninterested, and it felt awkward. I ended up just apologizing and backing off.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel disheartened after that experience. You wanted to connect and cooperate, but it seemed to fall flat. How did that make you feel about your ability to communicate effectively?

User: It made me feel really low. I felt like I couldn’t even express a simple request without making it uncomfortable. It’s like my social skills have disappeared or something.

Consultant: That must have been a tough moment for you. It’s important to recognize that communication can be difficult, and it often doesn’t go as planned. Let’s explore those feelings. What thoughts crossed your mind after that interaction?

User: I kept thinking that maybe I'm not very good at expressing myself, and that everyone must think I’m weird or annoying for trying.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite weighty. It seems like you're being quite hard on yourself. Let’s examine those thoughts more closely. What evidence do you have to support the idea that others find you annoying or weird?

User: I guess I don’t have much proof. It’s just a feeling I get based on how they react. But maybe I’m just overthinking it.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re recognizing that tendency to overthink. It’s common to see things in a more negative light when we’re feeling down. How would you respond if a friend expressed similar concerns about their communication skills?

User: I would probably tell them it’s okay to struggle and that they just need to keep trying. 

Consultant: That’s a kind and supportive response! Now, let’s try to apply that kindness to yourself. How could you reframe thoughts like "I’m annoying" into something more constructive?

User: Maybe I could think, "It’s normal to struggle with communication, and I’m still learning." 

Consultant: Absolutely, that’s a much healthier way to frame it! Reassessing our thoughts can really change how we feel. Let’s shift gears a bit—what are some situations outside of your dorm where you feel more at ease communicating?

User: I feel more comfortable in class discussions or when chatting with friends outside of my dorm. It’s like the pressure is off.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It’s important to leverage those environments where you feel more confident. What do you do differently in those situations that contributes to your comfort?

User: I think I’m more relaxed. Maybe because it feels more casual, and I know the others are there to share ideas rather than just focus on chores.

Consultant: That’s an excellent observation! The context really matters in communication. Perhaps you can apply some of those relaxed feelings and approaches when talking with your dorm mates. What do you think?

User: It might actually help if I tried to think of our conversations as just casual chats rather than formal discussions about chores.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! By framing it that way, you might find that you can express yourself more freely. Are there any small, casual topics you could approach them with next?

User: I could start by just asking about their day or weekend plans. That seems less pressure-filled than bringing up chores immediately.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect starting point! Light and friendly conversations can help build rapport and make future discussions easier. Let’s also practice how you might start one of those conversations. How would you initiate it?

User: Maybe I could say something like, "Hey, how was your day? Anything fun happen?" 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful opener! It’s friendly and opens the door for them to share. Remember to be attentive and listen, too. How does that make you feel about your ability to engage with them?

User: It makes me feel a bit more confident. I realize that I don’t have to make it all about chores right away. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Confidence can grow with practice, so even small steps can make a significant impact. What concerns do you have moving forward with this new approach?

User: I guess I just worry that it still won’t go well. What if they don’t want to talk? 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, and it’s okay to feel that way. Sometimes, people may not engage as we hope, but it doesn’t reflect your worth. You can control your actions and responses. Remember, persistence is key! How do you think you might handle it if someone appears uninterested?

User: I think I can tell myself it’s fine and try again another time. 

Consultant: Yes! That’s a great mindset. If a conversation doesn’t go as planned, it doesn’t mean you’ve failed. You have plenty of opportunities to connect. Let’s recap what we’ve covered today—what are your main takeaways?

User: To approach conversations casually, focus on light topics first, and remind myself that it’s okay if not every chat goes perfectly. 

Consultant: Exactly! Those are excellent strategies to implement. As we prepare to conclude our session, how do you feel about your communication skills now compared to when we started?

User: I feel like I have some tools now to improve. I’m still anxious about my dorm mates, but I'm a bit more hopeful.

Consultant: That’s an encouraging shift! It’s a good sign that you’re feeling a bit more hopeful. Keep practicing these strategies, and I believe you’ll continue to grow more comfortable. If you find yourself stuck, remember it’s all part of the learning process. How do you feel about scheduling our next session to discuss your progress?

User: I’d really like that. I want to work through this and feel better about social interactions.

Consultant: Perfect! I look forward to our next chat and hearing more about your experiences. Remember, you’ve got this, and I'm here to support you. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xu! I'm glad you decided to come back for another session today. I remember we've been focusing on enhancing your communication strategies in different social environments. How are you feeling about that?

User: Hi! I think I've been doing okay. In class and during study groups, I feel more at ease when sharing my thoughts. But I’m still stressed about my relationships in the dorm.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re feeling more comfortable in class and study groups! That’s a significant achievement. Let’s explore that a bit more. Can you tell me about what specifically feels challenging in your dorm relationships?

User: Well, my roommate and I don’t seem to get along. There’s a lot of tension, and sometimes it feels like we’re just avoiding each other. It makes me anxious, and I don’t know how to approach her without feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a lot of discomfort there, and it’s understandable to feel anxious about it. Avoiding difficult conversations can lead to even more stress. Would you be open to discussing some strategies we can try to help you feel more confident in approaching her?

User: Yes, I really want to improve the situation but I’m not sure where to start. 

Consultant: Let's focus on some small steps. How about we role-play a potential conversation? We can practice what you might say and how to express your feelings without feeling so overwhelmed. What do you think?

User: That sounds helpful. I guess I just need to say something to break the ice. 

Consultant: Absolutely. Let's start with an opening line. You might say something like, "Hey, I've noticed we've been a bit distant lately, and I’d like to talk about it." How does that sound to you?

User: I think that could work. It’s direct but not confrontational. 

Consultant: Yes, it’s a great approach! Directness can help clear the air. How do you feel about following that up with how you both might benefit from a better understanding?

User: I could say something like, "I value our living situation, and I think communicating could help us both feel more comfortable." 

Consultant: That’s perfect! It shows that you care about the relationship and are open to resolving issues. How confident do you feel about trying this in real life?

User: I feel a bit more confident just thinking about it. But the anxiety might hit when I actually have to do it.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel anxious before a difficult conversation. One technique we can use is to practice some deep breathing before you approach her. This can help calm your nerves. Would you like to try it now?

User: Sure, I think that could help. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in... hold it for a moment... and then slowly exhale. How does that feel?

User: It feels a bit relaxing! I think I can do this. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. You’re already on the right path. After your conversation, it might be helpful to reflect on how it went. Would you be open to journaling your thoughts and feelings after the talk?

User: Yes, writing things down usually helps me process better. 

Consultant: Excellent idea! Journaling can offer you insights into your feelings and help track your progress. How do you feel about setting a small goal for the week, perhaps initiating that conversation with your roommate?

User: I think I can aim to have that conversation by the end of the week. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid goal! Afterward, we can discuss how it went and what you learned from the experience. Remember, each step you take builds your confidence. 

User: I already feel a little more hopeful thinking about it. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xu! Recognizing progress, no matter how small, is key to building confidence. As we wrap up today, what do you think you will take away from our session?

User: I think practicing the conversation and breathing techniques will help me a lot. And just feeling more prepared makes me less anxious. 

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s been a pleasure working with you on this. Keep in mind, you have the tools and strategies to improve your relationships, especially in the dorm. I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. See you next time!

Consultant: Take care, Xu! I believe in your ability to make these connections work. See you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. I'm looking forward to hearing about your recent experiences, especially in the group activities. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling quite good. Being part of the group has helped me realize that I can connect with others. I've started to enjoy our activities, but I'm still worried about my relationship with my roommates.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear you've felt a sense of belonging in the group! It's understandable to have concerns about your roommates, especially since you've mentioned that the relationship has been challenging. Can you share what specific worries you have regarding your interactions with them?

User: I worry that they might not like me or think I'm annoying when I try to be more involved. Sometimes I overthink what I say or how I act around them.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a bit of anxiety about their perceptions of you. Those automatic thoughts can be quite powerful. When you think about their potential reactions, how does that make you feel emotionally?

User: I feel anxious and sometimes even a little embarrassed. I start doubting myself and my ability to be a good roommate.

Consultant: I completely understand. It's tough when those self-doubts creep in. Can you tell me about a moment in the group activity that made you feel confident or accepted? 

User: There was a time during a game when I made everyone laugh. They seemed to enjoy my participation, and I felt really good in that moment.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic experience! It seems like you were able to connect and bring joy to the group. What do you think contributed to that positive interaction?

User: I guess I just felt free to be myself and not worry too much. It was fun, and everyone was really supportive.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It shows how being yourself can lead to positive connections. How do you think you can bring that same energy into your interactions with your roommates?

User: I think I could try to be more open and not overthink it. I need to trust that they will appreciate me for who I am.

Consultant: Absolutely! Trusting yourself is key. Have you thought about how you can initiate some interactions that might help build a better relationship with them?

User: Maybe I could invite them to join me for a movie night or something casual. It could make it easier for us to bond.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Casual settings often help ease the tension. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: It feels a bit scary, but also exciting. I think it could help me feel more connected to them.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel a mix of excitement and fear. What steps could you take to prepare yourself for this invitation, so it feels a bit more manageable?

User: I could plan the details first, like what movie to watch, and maybe even share some snacks. That way, I’ll feel more confident.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Having details worked out can certainly help ease anxiety. How would you feel if the invitation doesn't go as planned? 

User: I guess I might feel disappointed, but I could remind myself that it’s just one interaction. There will be more chances.

Consultant: Exactly. Remember, one experience does not define your ability to connect. You already have a positive experience from the group activities to draw upon. How do you think reflecting on that can help you in this situation?

User: It makes me realize that I can create fun moments and that others can enjoy my company. I just have to keep trying.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Embracing those past successes can help empower you. As you continue this journey, could you reflect on how you want to feel after interacting with your roommates?

User: I want to feel accepted and like I’m a part of the group, rather than just an outsider.

Consultant: That's a meaningful goal. Keeping that feeling in mind can guide your actions and interactions. As we wrap up today, which strategies do you think you can carry forward to maintain this newfound confidence?

User: I’ll remember to take things one step at a time, focus on being myself, and remind myself of those positive moments in the group.

Consultant: That’s a great takeaway! You've made significant progress today, and I believe you can build on that. If you ever feel uncertain, always come back to those experiences that have brought you joy. Remember, it's a journey, and you're on the right path.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I feel more hopeful about the future of my relationships.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've done wonderfully today, and I'm here whenever you need to talk again. Keep up the great work, and don't hesitate to use those skills as you navigate your interactions. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, welcome to today's session! I'm glad to see you again. How have things been since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite good, actually. I've been trying to stay proactive in my dorm relationships, and I even suggested some activities which had a positive response. But I still worry that my compulsive thoughts might come back.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've taken initiative and experienced positive interactions in your dorm! Let's talk more about those worries you mentioned. How do you feel your compulsive thoughts are affecting you right now?

User: Well, sometimes when I start thinking about how things could go wrong, I find myself stuck in these loops of doubt. It can feel overwhelming, especially with the added pressure of keeping up the positive changes.

Consultant: I see. So, while you're experiencing these positive changes, there’s this fear of slipping back into those compulsive thought patterns. Can you share a specific instance where you noticed these thoughts creeping in?

User: Sure, just the other day, I was thinking about our next dorm gathering. I started worrying if my suggestions would be well-received, and I couldn’t shake off the fear that it would be awkward.

Consultant: That hesitation sounds tough. When those thoughts come up, what emotions do you find yourself feeling? 

User: I feel anxious and a bit restless, like I just want to escape the situation. It's like I have to constantly validate my ideas to avoid judgment.

Consultant: That sounds very stressful. Let’s take a moment to really identify those automatic thoughts. You mentioned feeling like you need to validate your ideas. What thoughts are running through your mind at that moment?

User: I think things like, "What if everyone thinks my ideas are stupid?" or "What if they start ignoring me again?" 

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite harsh. Can we explore how realistic they are? How much evidence do you have to support the idea that people would react negatively to your suggestions?

User: I guess I don't have much evidence. Most of the time, they seem engaged, but it’s hard for me to shake that fear.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you’ve experienced challenges in the past. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them?

User: I would probably tell them not to worry and remind them that everyone has unique ideas. They shouldn’t let fear stop them from sharing.

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate response! Now, let’s try to apply that same advice to yourself. What would it look like for you to acknowledge your ideas without the pressure of needing validation?

User: Maybe I could focus on the enjoyment of simply sharing, rather than worrying about how it’s received. That might lessen the pressure!

Consultant: Exactly! Emphasizing the enjoyment of sharing can shift your focus. How can you remind yourself of this during your next gathering?

User: I could write down some affirmations or remind myself to focus on enjoying the moment rather than evaluating responses.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Writing down affirmations can help reinforce your self-trust. Could you think of a few affirmations now that might help you in those moments?

User: How about, "My ideas are valid and contribute to our shared experience," and, "I enjoy connecting with my friends regardless of their responses."

Consultant: I love those affirmations! They can be very empowering. Now, let’s talk about the moments you feel those compulsive thoughts creeping back in. How can we establish a plan to address them when they arise?

User: Perhaps I could take a moment to breathe deeply and remind myself to reflect on my progress so far. I might also practice grounding techniques.

Consultant: That sounds great! Grounding techniques can be a useful way to bring your focus back to the present. Can we explore a specific technique that resonates with you?

User: I think focusing on my surroundings might help. Noticing colors, sounds, or textures could pull me back from overthinking.

Consultant: That’s an excellent choice! Engaging your senses can indeed help center you. Now, as we summarize today’s breakthroughs, how do you feel about your progress and use of these techniques moving forward?

User: I feel pretty optimistic! I see that I can manage my compulsive thoughts better and that I've made progress in my relationships. It’s encouraging.

Consultant: I’m proud of your progress, too! We’ve identified useful strategies to reduce the impact of those thoughts. Looking forward, how can you maintain this positive attitude and continue this growth?

User: I suppose by reminding myself of these affirmations, engaging in activities, and practicing grounding techniques, I can keep this momentum going.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan. Remember to celebrate those small victories! As we conclude today’s session, what do you feel has been your biggest takeaway?

User: I realize that I have more control over my thoughts than I believed and that I can definitely foster positive changes in my life.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! You’ve developed so many valuable skills. If you ever feel the need for further support, no matter when, don’t hesitate to reach out. I believe you’re capable of managing your emotions and thoughts effectively.

User: Thank you, I really appreciate all your guidance! I feel more equipped to handle my feelings now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep up the great work, and take care of yourself. I look forward to hearing from you in the future!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xu! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've actually been doing quite well. The situation in my dorm has stabilized, and I'm participating in more class activities. Overall, I'm feeling more satisfied with my life.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It's great that you've made progress in your dorm relationships and are engaging more socially. Can you share some specific experiences that made you feel this way?

User: Sure! I recently joined a study group, and we had a lot of fun working together. It felt good to connect with my classmates. I also feel less anxious about my studies now.

Consultant: It sounds like being part of that study group has had a positive impact on you! Connecting with others can really help in managing stress. What about your thoughts and feelings towards your previous compulsive thinking? Have you noticed any changes?

User: Yes, I’ve noticed that I’m not ruminating as much as I used to. I still have moments of worry, but they’re not as overwhelming anymore. I think my focus on participating in activities has really helped.

Consultant: That's a significant improvement! It's good to see you finding a balance between your social life and managing your thoughts. How do you feel about the strategies you used to achieve this?

User: I think they’ve worked well for me. Engaging with others and trying to focus on positive experiences has made a difference. I remember you mentioned that maintaining these connections is important.

Consultant: Absolutely, social connections can be really beneficial. It seems like you've been proactive in creating a supportive environment for yourself. What could you do to maintain this positive momentum in the future?

User: I would like to keep participating in social activities and maintain my study group. Also, I think scheduling time for relaxation could help me manage my worries better.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent plans! Scheduling time for relaxation is particularly important. How do you typically relax, and are there any new activities you’d like to try?

User: I enjoy reading and watching movies to unwind. I might also try some mindfulness exercises since I've heard they can help with anxiety.

Consultant: Mindfulness can be a helpful tool for managing anxiety and staying grounded. Have you had any experience with mindfulness before, or would this be a new venture for you?

User: It's new for me, but I'm open to trying it. I think it could help me be more present and reduce some of the worry I feel.

Consultant: That’s a great attitude! Starting something new can be a bit daunting, but it can also be very rewarding. How do you plan to integrate mindfulness into your routine?

User: I think starting with just a few minutes a day, maybe in the morning, could work. I’ll just focus on my breathing and see how it feels.

Consultant: That sounds like a manageable approach. Starting small is often the best way to build a new habit. As you try this, pay attention to how it affects your mood and your thought patterns.

User: Yes, I’ll keep track of how it feels. I’ll also look for moments throughout the day when I can practice being mindful, not just in the mornings.

Consultant: That's a great strategy—finding those moments in your day can really enhance your awareness. As we wrap up our session today, let’s take a moment to reflect on your progress. What do you feel has been your biggest achievement during our time together?

User: I think my biggest achievement is learning to manage my compulsive thoughts and finding joy in connecting with others. It’s empowering to feel like I have control over my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a significant accomplishment, Xu! Recognizing that you have the tools to manage your thoughts and feelings is key to your ongoing success. As you move forward, remember that you can always revisit these strategies whenever you need support. What are your thoughts about continuing to apply what you've learned?

User: I feel confident about applying what I've learned. I know I can reach out or review our strategies if I need to.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset! I'll remind you that it’s completely normal to experience ups and downs, and seeking help is always an option. Lastly, take a moment to think about what you’d like to carry forward from our discussions into your future.

User: I want to carry the positivity and the strategies for maintaining connections with others, along with the mindfulness approach. It feels like I’ve built a stronger foundation for myself.

Consultant: You've built an excellent foundation! I’m so proud of how far you’ve come. As today is our last session, remember that you have the skills to continue on this path. If you ever feel you need guidance again, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you so much! I truly appreciate everything you've helped me with. I feel ready to take on the future.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xu! I have no doubt that you will continue to thrive. Take care of yourself, and remember that you have all the tools you need. Goodbye for now!

User: Goodbye!
