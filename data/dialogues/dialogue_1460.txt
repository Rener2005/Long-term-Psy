Consultant: Hi Xiaowen! I'm really glad you came to today's session. I understand that you have been going through some tough times lately. Can you share with me how you have been feeling recently?

User: Hi. I just feel so down. My last exam didn’t go well at all, and my teacher didn't hesitate to criticize me. It just makes me question my abilities even more. I feel like I disappoint everyone, especially my parents.

Consultant: It sounds like that criticism from your teacher really affected you and intensified feelings of disappointment. You are questioning your abilities and feeling a lot of pressure. Can you tell me what thoughts were crossing your mind right after the exam and the conversation with your teacher?

User: I kept thinking that I must be the worst student. I don’t know how I let myself fall behind, and I feel like I should be better. It's like I can never meet anyone's expectations.

Consultant: I hear that you’re being really hard on yourself and feeling like you’re falling short. That kind of negative self-talk—thinking you’re the worst—can be quite heavy. What specific emotions does that thought bring up for you?

User: I feel sad and hopeless. Sometimes I even think it would be better if I just didn't exist. It's just overwhelming.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's important to recognize how serious these feelings can be. Let's explore that thought a bit more. When you think, "it would be better if I just didn't exist," what evidence do you have that supports that thought? 

User: I guess... I just feel like I'm letting everyone down. It seems like no one really sees how hard I try.

Consultant: I understand how isolating that must feel, believing others don’t see your efforts. But can we challenge that thought a little? Has there been any time where someone acknowledged your hard work or saw you in a positive light?

User: Well, my mother sometimes tells me I do well in art, which is nice... but it feels like that's the only thing I'm good at.

Consultant: It's great that your mother recognizes your talent in art! Maybe we can use that as a stepping stone. What if we looked at your other strengths? What are some things you’re proud of, even if they seem small?

User: I guess I help my friends with their homework sometimes. They say I explain things well... but it still doesn’t feel significant.

Consultant: Helping your friends with homework is a significant strength! It shows you have knowledge and skills to share with others, which is valuable. How did that make you feel when they appreciated your help?

User: I felt good for a moment, but then I just go back to feeling like I'm not doing enough.

Consultant: It's understandable to revert back to those old feelings, but let’s work on recognizing those small moments of success as important parts of who you are. Can we try to create a new thought to replace the negative ones? For example, "I help others and have strengths, even if I struggle in some areas." How does that resonate with you?

User: I suppose that sounds okay, but it's hard to believe it all the time. 

Consultant: It is definitely a process, Xiaowen. Changing our thoughts isn't something that happens overnight. What if we start gradually—can you try to remind yourself of your strengths whenever negative thoughts arise? Perhaps set a reminder on your phone or write it down?

User: Yeah, I could write it down. Maybe that would help.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Writing down your strengths and positive feedback can serve as a reminder. What about social connections? Have you thought about talking to your friends or family about how you’re feeling?

User: I haven't really talked to anyone. I feel embarrassed. 

Consultant: Feeling embarrassed is a common response, but reaching out can really help alleviate some of that heaviness. Just as your mother recognizes your talents, friends may surprise you with their support. Is this something you would consider trying?

User: Maybe... if I find the right moment. 

Consultant: That’s totally understandable! It’s important to find the right timing. Maybe plan to mention it casually next time you’re together? Remember, openness can foster deeper connections. 

User: I think I could try that. 

Consultant: Fantastic. It's a step towards recognizing you're not alone in this. You have people around you who care, even if it doesn’t feel that way sometimes. Regarding your exam, what do you think you could do differently next time to manage your feelings about it?

User: I hardly think I can change my abilities, though...

Consultant: It's natural to feel that way, but remember, improvement often comes with practice and preparation. Let's break it down: what could be one small thing you could change in your study habits or approach to feel more prepared and less anxious?

User: Maybe I could set smaller goals for studying instead of trying to do it all at once... 

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Setting smaller, achievable goals can help make studying feel less overwhelming and give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each task. What small goal can you set for yourself starting today?

User: I think I’ll try to study for just 30 minutes today without distractions. 

Consultant: That’s a perfect start! Focusing on studying for a shorter time can help you build momentum without feeling overwhelmed. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: It makes me a little nervous, but also hopeful, I guess.

Consultant: Those feelings are completely valid! Nervousness can often accompany new beginnings, but hope is a powerful motivator. Let’s check in on this next time to see how that went for you. 

User: Okay, I’ll keep you updated on that!

Consultant: Great! As we approach the end of this session, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed. You are making progress, Xiaowen—recognizing your strengths, setting goals, and considering reaching out for support. What’s one thing you’ll take away from today?

User: I think I realized I have some good qualities, and that’s something I should remember more often.

Consultant: Absolutely, celebrating your qualities is essential! Also, being open about how you feel can make a difference. You’re on the right path to better understanding your emotions. For our next session, let’s reinforce our strategies and continue challenging those negative thoughts. 

User: That sounds good. Thanks for today. 

Consultant: You're very welcome. I'm proud of your willingness to work through these challenges. Remember, it's okay to feel what you're feeling, and you have the capacity to grow. I look forward to our next session together!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaowen! It's great to see you again. Before we dive in, I’d like to hear about how you're feeling since our last session. How have things been for you?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling a bit better in some ways, but I still struggle a lot with my confidence. Last week in class, I didn't finish an assignment and my classmates laughed at me. That really hurt and made me doubt myself again.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that, Xiaowen. It must have felt painful to be laughed at, especially when you're already feeling unsure about your abilities. Can you tell me more about what thoughts went through your mind after that happened?

User: I thought that maybe I’m just not good enough and that my classmates will always see me that way. It makes me want to hide and not participate in class ever again.

Consultant: That sounds very overwhelming. It’s common to have those kinds of thoughts, especially when feeling vulnerable. Can we explore how these thoughts affect your feelings and behaviors? What emotions do you experience when you think this way?

User: I feel anxious and sad; it’s hard to concentrate on anything else. I just want to avoid situations where I could be judged again.

Consultant: Avoiding situations can feel safe, but it might also keep you feeling stuck. Let's think about this: when you have those thoughts of not being good enough, can you identify how that influences your classroom experience? 

User: Well, I think it makes me less likely to raise my hand or join discussions. I just keep to myself to avoid embarrassment.

Consultant: That makes sense. It sounds like those negative thoughts are creating a cycle of withdrawal. How about we work together to challenge those thoughts? What do you think might happen if you tried to participate, even when you're feeling anxious?

User: I guess I could feel proud of myself for trying, but I worry that I’ll mess up and be laughed at again.

Consultant: That’s a valid fear. But let’s explore it: What evidence do you have that participating would lead to a negative outcome? Are there times when raising your hand has gone well or been welcomed by others?

User: Sometimes, my teachers and some classmates do support me, especially when I answer correctly. But my mind only focuses on the bad experiences.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. While the negative experiences are impactful, it seems you do have moments of success as well. Let’s try to reframe this: What would you say to a friend who was feeling the same way about their abilities?

User: I would tell them not to be so hard on themselves and to just give it a try, that no one is perfect.

Consultant: That’s very compassionate, and it's a great perspective! Now, could you consider applying that same kindness to yourself? What would it look like to give yourself permission to be imperfect in class?

User: I suppose it would mean that I could answer freely and not judge myself too harshly if I made a mistake.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about accepting that mistakes are part of learning. How about we create a small goal for next week? Could you try to participate in class just once, focusing on the process rather than the outcome?

User: That sounds possible! I could aim to raise my hand at least once, even if I feel nervous.

Consultant: That's a fantastic goal, Xiaowen! Remember to be gentle with yourself in that process. How do you feel about that plan?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited. I really want to improve my self-esteem.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! It’s normal to feel a mix of emotions. What can you do to remind yourself of this goal if you start to feel anxious next week?

User: Maybe I can write it down and remind myself that it’s okay to try my best, no matter the outcome.

Consultant: Writing it down sounds like a great strategy! Would you also consider telling someone you trust about your goal so they can support you through it?

User: Yes, I could talk to my mom. She’s really supportive and always encourages me.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Having support can make a big difference. As we wrap up today, I want you to reflect on the steps we’ve discussed. What’s one key takeaway you have from our session?

User: I think it's about challenging my negative thoughts and being kinder to myself. I need to practice participating even if I’m scared.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway! Remember, progress takes time and practice. I believe in your ability to work on this. Let’s check in again next week to see how it went. You’re doing great, Xiaowen!

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful now. I’ll try my best!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Wen! I'm really glad to see you today. Let's talk about what's been on your mind lately. How have you been feeling?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really low and anxious. After that school event where I didn't perform well, I've been avoiding my classmates and now I feel really lonely. 

Consultant: It sounds like that experience really impacted you. You mentioned feeling lonely after avoiding your classmates. Can you tell me more about what you felt during and after that event?

User: I felt embarrassed and thought everyone was judging me. I thought maybe I shouldn’t even try to join in anymore since I messed up.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way after a tough situation. Sometimes, our minds can be really critical of ourselves. What were some thoughts that went through your mind when you felt embarrassed?

User: I kept thinking that I was not good enough and that I should have done better. It’s frustrating because I always want to be perfect.

Consultant: Striving for perfection can be exhausting. It's important to remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes and it's part of learning. How do you think those thoughts of not being good enough affect your feelings and actions?

User: They make me want to hide away more. The more I think about it, the harder it is for me to talk to anyone.

Consultant: That’s a tough cycle to be in. When you think that way, it increases your desire to avoid situations. What if we could explore some ways to challenge those thoughts? 

User: I guess we could try. But I’m really not sure it will work. 

Consultant: That’s okay to feel unsure. Let’s take it one step at a time. Can you think of a situation where those negative thoughts came up recently, perhaps in school or at home?

User: Yes, like last week in class when I had to present. I felt like everyone was thinking I was terrible.

Consultant: Presenting can be really nerve-wracking. Let’s look at that moment—what evidence do you have that supports the idea that your classmates thought you were terrible?

User: I mean, I tripped over my words and it felt awkward. I just assumed they were laughing at me. 

Consultant: It’s natural to focus on the moments we feel we did poorly. But do you think there might be other explanations for how your classmates felt? They could have been supportive or understanding, right?

User: I hadn’t thought about that. Maybe they didn’t care as much as I thought?

Consultant: Absolutely, it's possible! Sometimes, we project our fears onto others. Let's challenge that thought about your classmates’ reactions. What would you tell a friend if they were feeling this way about their performance?

User: I would tell them that it's okay and that they did their best. They can always improve next time.

Consultant: That’s a kind and supportive perspective! How can you apply that same kindness toward yourself in future situations?

User: I suppose I should remind myself of that instead of being so harsh. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Let’s start practicing that self-compassion together. What might be a small step you could take in your next class to be more supportive of yourself?

User: Maybe I can tell myself it’s okay to make mistakes before presenting. 

Consultant: Yes! That sounds like a wonderful plan. Also, it could help to focus on what you enjoy about participating in classes. What do you enjoy most when you're in a classroom setting?

User: I actually like sharing my ideas. I just get scared of how people will react.

Consultant: That’s a great realization. So, we can work on reframing your focus on the joy of sharing, rather than the fear of negative reactions. How does that sound?

User: That makes sense. I just need to remember that feeling instead of the fear.

Consultant: Exactly! And we can practice that. So how about we set a goal for your next class, focusing on expressing your ideas more freely? 

User: Yeah, I’d like to try that. Maybe I can also practice with a few friends first.

Consultant: Practicing with friends is a wonderful way to build confidence! This will help you ease into more challenging situations later on. What can you do to prepare for that practice session?

User: I could write down what I want to say and practice it so I feel ready. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Preparing like that can help you feel more secure. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. 

User: I really like the idea of focusing on progress. It feels less overwhelming.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed. How do you feel about tackling those social situations now? 

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I think with some practice, I can start to manage my feelings better. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent step forward, Xiao Wen! Remember, it’s all about taking small actions and being kind to yourself. If you need support, I’m here to help anytime.

User: Thank you! I appreciate it. I’ll try to keep that in mind.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep up the good work, and I look forward to hearing how your practice goes next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've actually been thinking a lot about what we discussed last time. I feel like I’m trying to manage my emotions better, especially with the school pressure, but I still get overwhelmed at times. 

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're putting effort into managing your emotions. Can you share a specific situation where you felt overwhelmed recently?

User: Well, I had a big project due for school last week. I tried to stay calm, but as the deadline approached, I felt this wave of anxiety. I just couldn't focus. 

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It's understandable to feel anxious when facing deadlines. What thoughts went through your mind during that project, especially when the deadline was near?

User: I kept thinking that if I didn't do well, it would be a disaster. I also thought everyone else would do better than me, and I felt like such a failure. 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really tough. It sounds like you might have been experiencing some negative self-talk. How did those thoughts make you feel emotionally? 

User: I felt really anxious and even kind of helpless. It just made everything feel worse, like I was stuck. 

Consultant: I hear you. It's easy to get caught in that cycle of negative thinking, where one thought leads to another. Let's try to identify those thoughts more closely. When you think you're a failure, what evidence do you have to support or challenge that belief?

User: I guess I don't really have concrete evidence. I just feel like I always fall short of what's expected of me. 

Consultant: That's a common perception, especially for someone who strives for perfection. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you advise them regarding those self-critical thoughts?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on the effort rather than just the outcome, and to be kinder to themselves.

Consultant: That's a compassionate approach. Now, let's practice shifting that negative thought. Instead of "I'm a failure," how can we reframe it to reflect your efforts and reality in a more balanced way?

User: Maybe something like, "I'm doing my best, and it's okay to make mistakes." 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful reframe! Acknowledging your effort is key. How does that new thought make you feel compared to the original one?

User: It feels a bit lighter and less overwhelming. I think I can actually accept that I’m not perfect.

Consultant: That's a significant shift! Acceptance can relieve a lot of pressure. Now, let's incorporate some practical techniques. Have you ever tried breathing exercises or mindfulness techniques to help in those heightened moments? 

User: I read about mindfulness, but I haven't really practiced it yet. 

Consultant: Mindfulness can be very effective! Would you be open to trying a simple breathing exercise together? It can help ground you when you're feeling overwhelmed.

User: Yes, I’d like to give that a try! 

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable and take a deep breath in through your nose… hold it for a few seconds… and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Let's do this a few times together.

User: *takes deep breaths* Okay, I feel a bit calmer now. 

Consultant: Excellent! Remember, you can always return to your breath when anxiety rises. Can you think of a situation this week where you might try using this technique?

User: I have another project coming up... I could definitely use this breathing exercise before starting it to help calm my nerves.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! It’s about gradual practice. Over time, these techniques can become a part of your routine. How are you feeling about trying this strategy?

User: I feel hopeful about it. It seems manageable, like something I can actually do.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've made some wonderful insights today. Before we finish up, let’s recap what we’ve discussed and the strategies you want to implement moving forward.

User: We talked about recognizing my negative self-talk and how to reframe those thoughts. I also learned a breathing exercise to help calm myself when I feel anxious.

Consultant: Exactly! You've outlined effective strategies. As you practice these, remember to be gentle with yourself during this process. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss before we wrap up?

User: No, I think I’m good for now. Thank you for your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm proud of the progress you’re making. Remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time. If you ever feel the need to talk more, I'm here for you. 

User: Thanks! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: Of course! I'm looking forward to our next session and hearing about how these strategies worked for you. Take care!

User: You too! Bye!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaowen! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to open up a bit more, especially after participating in the school support group. It felt nice being around others.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re starting to feel the warmth of teamwork and support. What was it like for you to connect with others in the group?

User: It was surprisingly comforting. I usually keep to myself, but talking to people who understand similar feelings helped. I felt a bit more at ease.

Consultant: It makes a lot of sense that being surrounded by understanding peers would help you feel more comfortable. Can you share some specific moments from the group that stood out to you?

User: Well, there was this moment when someone shared a story about feeling anxious, and I could relate. It made me feel like I wasn’t alone in this.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant moment! It's powerful to realize that others share similar experiences. How did that make you feel about your own anxiety?

User: It felt validating, I guess. Like, maybe what I'm feeling is okay and I’m not the only one going through it.

Consultant: Absolutely, feeling validated can be really uplifting. Now, as you continue these interactions, what changes do you notice in your confidence when you share your thoughts?

User: I think I’m starting to feel a bit more confident. I used to worry a lot about what others would think, but now I'm starting to be okay with expressing myself.

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress, Xiaowen! It’s great to see you developing greater confidence. What are some ways you think you could further nurture this openness when talking to others?

User: Maybe I could try to share more of my thoughts and feelings, even when I'm scared. I guess practice could help me feel more comfortable.

Consultant: Practice is a great idea! The more you share, the easier it will become. Can you think of a small step you could take in your next group interaction to push your comfort zone?

User: I could try to share a little more about why I feel anxious, instead of just keeping it to myself. Maybe just one thing to start.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Sharing even a small piece of your experience can be really meaningful. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also a little excited. It feels like I’m moving forward.

Consultant: Feeling nervous is completely normal, but it’s great that you’re also feeling excitement. What do you think could help you manage that nervousness before you share?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that others are there to support me. I could also think about how good it felt to relate with someone in the group.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Keeping in mind the support of others can really ease your nerves. How about thinking of some positive affirmations you can remind yourself of before sharing?

User: That sounds helpful. I could tell myself that it's okay to feel nervous, but I have something valuable to share.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic affirmation! Acknowledging your feelings while recognizing your worth is very powerful. How do you feel about the progress you've made so far in this process?

User: I feel proud, actually. I’m starting to see that I can change how I approach these situations.

Consultant: You should be proud! Acknowledging your growth is a significant step. Let’s talk about how you can maintain this progress and continue to build trust in your interactions. What ideas do you have?

User: I think I should keep attending the group and try to engage more. Maybe I could also finish my homework on time so I can focus on the group without stress.

Consultant: Those are both great ideas! Engaging in the group and managing your time effectively can certainly help you feel more relaxed and present. How do you feel about these plans?

User: I feel hopeful! It seems manageable, which is encouraging.

Consultant: Hope is a wonderful emotion to hold onto! As you take these steps, how can you remind yourself of this hope and the progress you've made?

User: I could keep a journal to note what I achieve and how I feel after each group meeting. That way, I can reflect on my journey.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely idea! Journaling can really help reinforce your experiences and feelings. How do you envision feeling after reflecting on your journey in writing?

User: I think I’ll feel more grounded. It could remind me of my progress and push me to keep going.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Reflection can help keep you motivated and focused on your growth. As we wrap up our session today, is there anything in particular you want to take away from our discussion?

User: I want to remember that I have support and that I can keep improving if I keep trying. This session was really encouraging.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Remember, you have a supportive community and the ability to grow. Keep embracing those moments, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care, Xiaowen! 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaowen! I'm so glad to see you again. How are you feeling today, especially after your mother's recent praise?  

User: Hi! I'm feeling pretty good, actually. It's nice to hear my mom recognize my efforts in school. I feel a bit lighter, but sometimes the pressure is still there.  

Consultant: That sounds like a positive shift in your emotional state! It's great to hear that you're feeling lighter. Can you tell me more about the pressure you still experience?  

User: Well, although my mom is supportive, I still have high expectations for myself. Sometimes I feel like I need to be perfect, which makes me anxious.  

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're battling between enjoying the support and still feeling the weight of your self-expectations. What do you think that pressure to be perfect stems from?  

User: I think I just want to prove to myself and my family that I can do well, especially with my past struggles. It feels like there's a lot riding on my performance.  

Consultant: That makes sense. Wanting to prove yourself can certainly create pressure. Let's explore how you might deal with those expectations. What would happen if you allowed yourself to make mistakes?  

User: I guess I would feel relieved, but then I fear disappointing others... and myself.  

Consultant: Those fears are understandable. It's a tough balance. Can you share a time when you felt proud of yourself, even if things didn’t go perfectly?  

User: Recently, I finished a project that I thought would be really difficult, and although I made some mistakes, I still felt proud of the effort I put in.  

Consultant: That’s a wonderful achievement, and it’s great that you could recognize your effort! How did it feel to give yourself permission to acknowledge that pride despite the imperfections?  

User: It felt nice, but it was also hard to shake off the guilt from those mistakes.  

Consultant: It shows how powerful self-criticism can be, even when we achieve something significant. How could you remind yourself that it's okay to be imperfect while still enjoying your accomplishments?  

User: Maybe I could keep a journal to reflect on my successes, no matter how small, and remind myself that it's part of learning.  

Consultant: That sounds like a productive idea! Journaling can be a helpful tool to celebrate your progress. How do you feel about starting that practice this week?  

User: I think I can do that! It sounds like it might help.  

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it's about recognizing the journey as well as the destination. How else can we support your journey of self-acceptance?  

User: I think practicing how to communicate my feelings better would help. Sometimes I struggle to express what I am feeling, especially at home.  

Consultant: Communication can be challenging, but it’s great that you want to work on it! Would you like to role-play a scenario where you express your feelings to someone important to you?  

User: That might be helpful! I have a hard time talking to my mom about my worries.  

Consultant: Perfect, let's role-play. Imagine you’re talking to your mom. You could start by sharing a specific worry you have and how it makes you feel. Ready when you are!  

User: Okay. *takes a deep breath* "Mom, I’ve been feeling a bit anxious about my grades. I’m proud of what I’ve done, but I'm scared of letting you down."  

Consultant: That was a great start, Xiaowen! How does it feel to say that out loud?  

User: It feels vulnerable, but also kind of freeing. I think my mom would understand.  

Consultant: Absolutely! Vulnerability can often lead to deeper connections. If you did share your feelings, what kind of outcome do you imagine would happen?  

User: I hope she would be supportive and maybe share some of her experiences too.  

Consultant: That’s a lovely thought. Opening up can indeed pave the way for mutual support. Would you feel prepared to have that conversation with her?  

User: Yes, I think so! It's about time I let her in on how I'm really feeling.  

Consultant: That’s excellent progress, Xiaowen! Remember, it’s all part of nurturing your relationship with her. Before we wrap up today, what do you think your next steps will be?  

User: I will start journaling and practice talking to my mom about my feelings.  

Consultant: Those are great actionable steps! It's important to validate your experiences and feelings. As we conclude today, what key takeaway do you have from our session?  

User: I feel empowered to express myself and appreciate my own progress without being too hard on myself.  

Consultant: That’s a beautiful insight! Maintaining that self-compassion is vital. Remember, you can always return to these strategies whenever you need. You’re doing wonderfully, Xiaowen!  

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support.  

Consultant: You're very welcome! I believe you'll continue to make great strides. Take care, and I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next time!
