Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ming! I'm really happy to see you today. How are you feeling about your experience at school lately?

User: Hi! I'm feeling really good! I was able to stay quiet during class, and my teacher said I did a great job!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re feeling proud of yourself for your good behavior. Can you tell me more about how you managed to stay quiet this time?

User: Well, I just remembered that my teacher wants us to listen and not talk too much. I thought it would help me learn better.

Consultant: That’s a great thought, Xiao Ming! Remembering your teacher's instructions shows that you’re becoming more aware of the classroom rules. How did it feel to keep quiet while learning?

User: It felt nice. I could hear what the teacher was saying, and I think I understood the lesson better.

Consultant: That’s an excellent observation! Understanding the lesson is important. What do you think might happen if you continue to practice staying quiet in class?

User: I hope I can help my friends too. If I stay quiet, maybe they can hear better like I did!

Consultant: That’s such a caring thought, Xiao Ming! Supporting your friends by being quiet shows you’re a good friend. How does it feel to think about helping others in class?

User: It makes me happy! I want my friends to learn just like I did.

Consultant: I can hear that you really value your friends and their learning. Let’s think about how you can remind yourself to stay quiet more often. What can you do when you feel the urge to talk?

User: Maybe I can take deep breaths or just think about the lesson instead of what I want to say.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies, Xiao Ming! Taking deep breaths can help you calm down and focus. How do you think your classmates would react if they saw you using these techniques?

User: I think they might notice and want to do it too. I want to show them how it works!

Consultant: That’s a great idea! By showing them, you can lead by example. How does it feel to think about being a role model for your friends?

User: It feels really cool! I want to be a good example.

Consultant: I can see you’re excited about being a good example! Let’s also talk about what good behavior looks like outside of class. Are there times during play that you could practice staying calm and focused?

User: Yes! Sometimes during games, I get a little too excited and want to talk a lot, but I think I can try to focus more.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic insight! Focusing during games can help everyone have more fun. Can you think of a specific game where you can practice this?

User: Maybe during tag. I can listen for when it’s my turn and not shout too much.

Consultant: That’s a perfect choice! Listening carefully during tag will help the game run smoothly. How do you feel about trying that next time you play?

User: I feel good about it! I’m excited to try and see if it works.

Consultant: I’m excited for you too, Xiao Ming! Remember, practicing these skills will take time. What can you do to remind yourself to stay calm when playing?

User: I can ask my parents to help me remember. They can remind me before I start playing!

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Your parents can certainly help support you. What else can you do to reinforce your good behavior in school and during play?

User: Maybe I can tell my teacher and friends what I’m trying to do. They can help me too!

Consultant: Absolutely! Involving your teacher and friends can create a supportive environment. How do you feel about sharing your goals with them?

User: I think it will be nice! They can cheer me on and help me remember.

Consultant: That sounds very encouraging! Having support can really help you succeed. As we wrap up today, what do you think is the most important lesson you've learned about staying calm and focused?

User: I learned that staying quiet helps me listen better, and I can help my friends too!

Consultant: Precisely, Xiao Ming! You’ve shown great understanding today. As you continue to practice, remember to be patient with yourself. How are you feeling about your progress so far?

User: I feel really happy and excited to try everything we talked about!

Consultant: Hello, little Ming! I'm happy to see you today. How are you feeling about getting along with your classmates?

User: Hi! I feel pretty good, but I’m a bit worried. I want to be friends with everyone, but sometimes I don’t know what to say or how to invite them to play.

Consultant: It’s great that you want to make friends! Can you tell me more about a time when you felt like you wanted to join in but weren’t sure how?

User: At my friend’s birthday party, I saw some kids playing a game, and I wanted to ask if I could join, but I was too shy and just sat there.

Consultant: I see! It sounds like you were excited to play but didn't feel confident enough to ask. What do you think made you feel shy at that moment?

User: I think I was afraid they might say no or think I’m weird for wanting to join.

Consultant: That’s a very common feeling! It’s normal to worry about what others think. If you could imagine a positive way to ask to join, what would that look like?

User: Maybe I could say, “Can I play with you?” But I’m not sure if I could say it out loud.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Let’s practice that together. How would you tell me, “Can I play with you?” right now?

User: Okay… “Can I play with you?” I think I could try to say it.

Consultant: That sounded really good, Ming! Remember, practicing helps you feel more comfortable. How do you feel after saying it out loud?

User: I feel a little better, but still a bit nervous.

Consultant: It's okay to feel nervous! Everyone does sometimes. What could help you feel less nervous next time you want to ask?

User: Maybe if I take a deep breath before I ask, it might help.

Consultant: Taking a deep breath is a fantastic idea! It can calm you down. Is there another situation where you’d like to invite a friend to play or do something together?

User: Yes! There's a boy in my class, Tim, and I want to invite him to play with my toys after school.

Consultant: That sounds like a fun plan! How could you invite Tim to play with your toys? Let’s think of some words you can use.

User: I could say, “Do you want to come to my house and play with my toys?” 

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a clear and friendly invitation. How do you feel about saying that to Tim?

User: I feel good. I think I can do it!

Consultant: Awesome! What would be a good way to approach Tim when you see him next?

User: I could catch him during recess when we are both playing.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Remember to smile when you ask. After you invite him, what do you think will happen next?

User: I hope he says yes! I really want to play together.

Consultant: That’s a great expectation! If he says yes, what fun things do you want to do with him?

User: Maybe we can build a big tower with my blocks! 

Consultant: Building a tower sounds like a lot of fun! What if, instead, Tim says he can’t play today? How would you feel about that?

User: I think I would be a bit sad, but it’s okay. I could ask him again another day.

Consultant: That’s a mature way to think about it, Ming! Being okay with someone saying no shows you’re resilient. Remember, friendships take time. How about we summarize what you’ll do?

User: I’ll practice asking, “Can I play with you?” and I’ll invite Tim to play with my toys. If he says no, I’ll try again later. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! You’ve got some solid strategies to use. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel a bit more confident now. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad you feel better. Remember, every small step counts. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoming! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi! I’ve been a bit sad because I had a disagreement with one of my classmates. I wanted to play, but we didn’t understand each other, and it ended up in a fight.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like that situation made you feel upset. It’s good that you are here and ready to talk about it. Can you tell me more about what happened during that disagreement?

User: Well, I wanted to play with the toys, but my classmate said no. I felt angry and said something mean, and then we both didn’t want to play anymore.

Consultant: That sounds tough, Xiaoming. It's normal to feel angry when someone doesn't want to share. What do you think made it difficult for you two to understand each other?

User: I think we both wanted to play with the toys, but we didn't say it nicely. I just got frustrated and didn't know how to ask.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel frustrated. Understanding how to express your feelings can be really important in situations like these. How do you think you could have expressed your feelings differently in that moment?

User: Maybe I could have said, “I really want to play with the toys. Can we share them?” But I didn’t think of that when I was angry.

Consultant: That's a great thought, Xiaoming! Using “I” statements like that can help your friends understand how you feel without getting defensive. How do you feel about trying to use that approach next time?

User: I think I’d like to try it. I really want to be friends and play together again.

Consultant: That's a wonderful intention, and I'm proud of you for wanting to make it better with your friend. Let's practice together! How would you say it if your friend didn’t want to play?

User: Um... I would say, “I feel sad when you don’t want to play. Can we share?”

Consultant: Very good, Xiaoming! That sounds kind and clear. How do you think your friend would respond to that?

User: I hope they would understand and say yes. I just want to play without fighting.

Consultant: That's perfectly valid. Focusing on sharing can really help. If a disagreement happens again, what might you do first to calm down?

User: I can take a deep breath and count to three before saying anything mean.

Consultant: Great strategy! Taking a moment to breathe can help you think before reacting. How does that make you feel about handling future conflicts?

User: It makes me feel a bit more confident. I want to be better at talking to my friends.

Consultant: That’s an excellent mindset to have! Confidence will help you express your feelings better. How do you think your relationship with your friends would improve if you used these skills?

User: I think we would understand each other more and have more fun together.

Consultant: Absolutely! Building understanding can lead to more fun and laughter. Now, let’s think of a time when you successfully talked to a friend. Can you tell me about it?

User: There was a time when I wanted to play a game, and I asked nicely. We shared the toys and had a lot of fun together.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic example, Xiaoming! It shows that open communication can lead to positive experiences. How did you feel after that?

User: I felt very happy! It was nice to play together. I want to feel that way again.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Remembering those happy moments can motivate you to use your communication skills. What do you think you can do at home to practice expressing your feelings with your family?

User: I can tell my mom when I feel tired or when I want to play. I’ll try to explain nicely.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Practicing at home can make it easier when you’re with your friends. Do you feel ready to use these skills in your daily life?

User: Yes, I feel ready! I’m excited to try talking more openly.

Consultant: Fantastic! You're making great progress, Xiaoming. Before we wrap up today’s session, what’s one thing you want to remember from our conversation?

User: I want to remember to use “I” statements and take deep breaths to stay calm.

Consultant: Perfect! Those tools will serve you well. I'm proud of you for being open and ready to learn. Remember, it’s okay to ask for help whenever you feel unsure, either from me or your family. 

User: Thank you! I’ll keep practicing and come back if I need more help.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaoming! I'm here for you anytime you need support. Have a wonderful day, and keep practicing your new skills!
