Consultant: Hello, Li. I'm glad you're here today. I want to start by checking in on how you've been feeling lately. Can you share what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've just been feeling really down. Since my phone was taken away, my mom has been pretty harsh on me, and I don’t feel like I have any worth. Sometimes, I just want to escape everything.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Li. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when you’re facing such challenges at home. Can you tell me more about what emotions you’ve been feeling during this time?

User: I often feel sad and alone. I have moments where I think there’s no point to anything, and I just feel empty. It’s like I’m stuck in this darkness.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. Feeling stuck in darkness can be incredibly heavy. It's important to recognize that these feelings are valid. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come up in those moments when you feel empty?

User: I keep thinking that I’m not good enough and that nobody really cares about me. It feels like I’m just a burden to everyone.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite painful, and they can definitely intensify feelings of worthlessness. Let's explore these thoughts a bit further. When you think you're a burden, what evidence comes to mind that supports this belief?

User: I just think about how my mom gets frustrated with me a lot, like when she took my phone. It seems like I'm always upsetting her, so maybe I really am a burden.

Consultant: It's understandable that her frustration could lead you to feel that way. However, it might be helpful to challenge that thought. Can you think of moments when your mom has shown that she cares about you, even if it doesn’t always seem that way?

User: Sometimes she does show concern, like when I’m sick or when she helps me with school work. But it still feels overshadowed by her anger.

Consultant: That’s an important recognition, Li. While it’s true that her anger can overshadow the care she shows, it’s valuable to acknowledge both sides. It shows that you are capable of seeing a more complete picture. What might you tell a friend if they expressed feelings similar to yours about being a burden?

User: I would probably say they’re not a burden and that everyone has tough times. I’d want to reassure them that they are valued.

Consultant: That’s a kind perspective to have for a friend. Now, what if you turned that advice inward? What would it look like for you to recognize your own value and remind yourself that everyone has challenging moments?

User: I guess I could try to remind myself that I’m not perfect and that it’s okay to have struggles. Everyone faces difficulties in life.

Consultant: Exactly, Li! Everyone does have struggles, and those struggles don’t define your worth. Let’s focus on nurturing that self-compassion. Would you be open to starting an emotional journal where you can write down your feelings and reflect on your experiences?

User: I think that could help. Writing things down might be a good way to process my feelings.

Consultant: Great! Journaling can be a powerful tool. You could use it to identify your emotions and the thoughts accompanying them. It might help you gain insight into your feelings as well as to note any moments of self-worth. How do you feel about incorporating that into your week?

User: I feel like I’d like to try that. It seems like it could be a good way to get my feelings out.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear. Each time you write, perhaps focus on one feeling you experienced during the day and explore why you felt that way. This can build up your emotional awareness. Are there any moments recently that you’d like to reflect on?

User: I felt really upset when my mom yelled at me. I just wanted to hide.

Consultant: It sounds like that situation was really difficult. What thoughts were running through your mind during that moment?

User: I thought I was going to disappoint her forever and that I didn’t deserve to be happy.

Consultant: Those thoughts are incredibly harsh, especially in a moment of distress. How would you challenge that belief? What could you say to shift that perspective?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that one mistake doesn’t define my whole life, and I can always improve and learn.

Consultant: That’s an amazing realization, Li! Focusing on growth instead of permanence can open new doors. As we continue this journey together, let’s aim to reinforce these positive affirmations. How can you encourage yourself during moments of self-doubt?

User: I could actually say things like “I am learning” or “I’m not alone in this.” It might help to remind myself of that.

Consultant: Absolutely! Repeating affirmations can help reframe your thoughts. Let’s also think about practical steps to do when you’re feeling particularly low. What activities or hobbies do you enjoy that might help shift your mood?

User: I like drawing and listening to music. Those usually help me feel a little better.

Consultant: Those are great outlets for expression! Creating a plan to incorporate drawing or music into your daily routine when you’re feeling low can be beneficial. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I’ll try to draw when I’m feeling upset instead of just sitting with those feelings.

Consultant: Perfect, Li. Engaging in activities you enjoy can act as a positive distraction. I’m proud of you for deciding to take action. As we start wrapping up today, can you share one insight you gained from our conversation?

User: I think I learned that it’s okay to feel my emotions and that I need to remind myself of my worth, especially during tough times.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight! Remember, feelings are valid, and it’s wonderful to hear you recognize your worth. Before we conclude, let’s think about how you can use what we’ve talked about until our next session. What will you carry forward?

User: I’ll try journaling, work on my affirmations, and spend some time drawing. I think that will really help.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent steps, Li. I’m glad we could connect today. Remember, it's important to practice self-kindness as you navigate through these feelings. If you ever need support, I'm right here.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you again. As we start our session today, I’d like to check in on how you’ve been feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi! I'm trying to adjust to life without my phone. It's quite challenging, and I often feel lonely. Sometimes I doubt my value and wonder if I really have friends.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, Li. Adjusting to life without your phone can indeed be tough, especially when you're trying to build deeper friendships. It seems like you're experiencing some conflicting feelings—like wanting connection but also feeling lonely. Can you tell me more about those moments when you feel lonely?

User: Well, I often see my classmates chatting and having fun together, and I feel left out. Sometimes, I think maybe they don't really want to include me because I'm not interesting enough.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult, feeling left out can be very painful. It sounds like you sometimes believe that your value is tied to how others see you. What goes through your mind when you start to think that way about yourself?

User: I guess I think I have to be funny or super smart for them to like me. If I'm not, I feel like they'll just ignore me or think I'm boring.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Li. It sounds like you hold some pretty high expectations for yourself in social situations. Let's explore this a little—what evidence do you have that you need to be funny or smart to be valued by your friends?

User: I don't know… I just feel like everyone else is more interesting than me. I can be quiet sometimes, so maybe they just forget I'm there.

Consultant: That’s a common concern, but let’s challenge that thought. If a friend of yours was feeling that way, what would you tell them? How would you reassure them about their worth?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone is unique and that they have their own qualities that make them special. Maybe I should remember that for myself too.

Consultant: Exactly! It's important to recognize your unique traits as well. Can you think of some qualities you possess that contribute to your friendships? 

User: I’m a good listener, and I try to be supportive. I like helping people with their problems.

Consultant: Those are wonderful qualities, Li! Being a good listener and supportive friend is incredibly valuable. How could you use those strengths to engage more with your classmates and perhaps even start new conversations?

User: Maybe I could invite someone to study together or just ask them about their day more often? 

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Initiating small conversations can help you feel more connected. What kind of activities do you think you could suggest when talking with them?

User: I could suggest working on school projects together or even just hanging out at the park after school.

Consultant: Those are excellent suggestions! Getting involved in activities can foster a sense of belonging. How do you feel about making these small steps?

User: I feel a little nervous because I worry they might not want to spend time with me.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous when reaching out! Remember, taking small actions can often lead to positive outcomes. Could we set a small goal for your next interactions at school? Something simple you can aim for?

User: Maybe I could try talking to one classmate this week? Just to see how it goes?

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect goal! It’s manageable, and you can see how it feels. Remember to be kind to yourself, no matter the outcome. What would you like to remind yourself if that nervousness comes back while trying this?

User: I think I should tell myself that it’s okay not to be perfect and that just trying is enough.

Consultant: Absolutely, Li! Just making the effort is already a success, regardless of the reaction you get. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you've learned or realized during our conversation?

User: I’ve realized that I can use my strengths to connect with others and that I’m worth it no matter what. 

Consultant: That’s a significant breakthrough! You are indeed enough, just as you are. Our next steps can continue to build on this realization. If doubts arise, remember your qualities and the small goals we’ve set. I’m looking forward to hearing about how your efforts go in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I think this will help me feel less lonely. 

Consultant: You’re welcome, Li! Remember, every step you take counts. I’m here to support you, and I wish you the best in trying out those new interactions. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm really glad to see you today. It sounds like you’ve made some progress recently. How are you feeling about the emotional release you experienced during your self-expression?

User: Hi! I feel a bit lighter after sharing my story in the psychology class. It's nice to talk about it, but I still don't feel totally confident when I express myself.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you felt a sense of relief from sharing. Building confidence takes time, and it's perfectly okay to feel a bit uncertain. What specific moments do you find it hardest to express yourself?

User: Well, when I’m in class, I often hesitate to raise my hand. I worry that my thoughts won’t come out right or that others might judge me.

Consultant: That’s a common concern, but it’s completely understandable. Let’s explore this together. Can you tell me what thoughts go through your mind when you are about to speak up in class?

User: I usually think things like "What if I say something stupid?" or "Everyone will laugh at me." It makes me really anxious.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really challenging to deal with. If a friend were feeling this way, what would you say to encourage them?

User: I’d probably tell them that it doesn’t matter what others think and that it’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: That’s a very supportive perspective! Now, let’s try to apply that advice to yourself. What evidence do you have that supports your fears, and is there a possibility that people might actually appreciate hearing your thoughts?

User: I guess I don’t have much evidence. Most of the time, when I listen to my classmates, I think their ideas are interesting, even if they make mistakes.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! It seems like you’re being much kinder to your friends than to yourself. How can you start being that supportive friend to yourself when you're in those situations?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that mistakes are part of learning, and that it’s okay to be imperfect.

Consultant: Absolutely! Embracing imperfection is a big step towards building confidence. Would you feel comfortable practicing this mindset in small steps? Perhaps sharing a thought in your next class?

User: I think I could try that! Maybe I’ll write down a few points beforehand so I feel more prepared.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful strategy! Writing things down can help clarify your thoughts. How do you feel about the idea of joining a small group activity next week to further practice sharing in a supportive environment?

User: I’d like that! A group feels safer than just talking in front of the whole class.

Consultant: Perfect! Groups can often provide a nurturing space for sharing. As we move towards that, what support do you think you’ll need from me to help you through this?

User: I think just encouragement and maybe some tips on how to cope with feeling anxious before talking.

Consultant: Of course, I’m here for that! We can work on some relaxation techniques together or even some quick grounding exercises you can use if you start feeling anxious before speaking. How does that sound?

User: That sounds really helpful. I think having a strategy will make me feel better.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s practice a simple grounding technique that can help calm you before you speak up. Would you like to try it right now?

User: Sure, I’d love to try!

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath together ... Inhale slowly ... hold ... and exhale. Now, focus on where you are. What do you see, hear, or feel right now?

User: I see you, I hear the clock ticking, and I feel the chair beneath me. It’s calming to focus on these things.

Consultant: Excellent! This mindfulness can help center you when you feel anxious. How might you use this technique before speaking in class?

User: I can take a few breaths and focus on the present before raising my hand. I think that will help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing this will help reinforce your confidence. As we prepare for our next session, I’d love for you to try using this technique and share how it felt. 

User: I’ll definitely do that! I’m feeling more optimistic already. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s all about progress. We’re building that emotional connection and confidence step by step. We can wrap up today’s session, but I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time!

User: Thank you! You've been really supportive. I’m excited about practicing and coming back next week.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li! I appreciate your openness, and I’m here to support your journey. Take care, and I'll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm really glad to see you today. Last time, we talked about your relationship with your mother and the improvements you've been experiencing. How have things been since our last session?

User: Hi! Things have been a little better. My mom has been supportive about my schoolwork, and it feels nice to have her encouragement.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful to hear! It seems like the support from your mother is making a positive difference for you. Can you tell me more about how her encouragement makes you feel?

User: I feel more motivated to study and do my best. It's like I have someone believing in me, and that makes me want to improve.

Consultant: That's great to hear, Li! Having that belief can be really powerful. Now, what do you think about the communication between you and your mother? Do you feel it's getting easier?

User: Yes, I think so. We’ve been talking a bit more. Sometimes, we even discuss my day at school. It feels good to share those moments with her.

Consultant: Sharing those moments can really enhance your connection. Have there been any specific conversations that stood out to you recently?

User: We talked about my favorite subjects and what I want to do in the future. She was really interested and asked a lot of questions! 

Consultant: That’s fantastic! When someone shows interest in what we care about, it can strengthen our bond. How did you feel during and after that conversation?

User: I felt really happy while talking, and afterward, I felt like she understood me better. It was nice.

Consultant: It's amazing to feel understood. Now, let's think about how we can build on this progress. What specific skills do you think could help improve your communication with your mother even further?

User: Maybe I could try to express my feelings more clearly. Sometimes I struggle to find the words to say what I’m feeling.

Consultant: Expressing feelings clearly is a great goal. What are some feelings you think you’d like to share more with her?

User: I think I want to talk more about when I feel stressed or anxious, especially with school activities. 

Consultant: That's an important step! Being open about stress can help her understand what you’re going through. Would you like to practice how you could express those feelings to her?

User: Yes, I think that would help! 

Consultant: Let's try a role-playing exercise. Imagine I’m your mother, and you’re sharing how stressed you feel about school. What would you say to me first?

User: I guess I would start with, “Mom, I’ve been feeling really stressed about my homework lately.”

Consultant: That’s a strong opening! You’re sharing your feelings directly. How do you think your mother might respond to that?

User: I think she would want to help me and maybe suggest we study together.

Consultant: Exactly! Then you could share your feelings about wanting support. How about saying something like, “I would love it if we could study together sometimes?” 

User: That sounds good. It feels easier when I have a way to say it.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Practicing this kind of communication can lead to more trust and collaboration. Now, let’s talk about how you can put this into action at home. Would you be open to suggesting a “family game day” to help strengthen that bond even more?

User: That’s a fun idea! I think it would be great for us to spend quality time together.

Consultant: Wonderful! Activities like that can create lasting memories and improve your relationship. What games or activities do you think would be enjoyable for both of you?

User: Maybe board games or something we can do as a team, like cooking together!

Consultant: Those sound like fantastic options! Consider sharing the idea with your mother and see how she feels. Remember, this will also give you a chance to express joy and happiness together, reinforcing that connection.

User: I will definitely mention it to her, I think she’ll like it!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Let’s take a moment to review what we’ve discussed today. You’ve made progress in your communication with your mother, and you have a plan to express your feelings and suggest family activities. How do you feel about all of this?

User: I feel excited and hopeful! It feels good to have a plan in place.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Li! Now, let’s think about how you can maintain this positivity moving forward. What strategies can you use if things feel difficult in the future?

User: I guess I could remind myself of the progress I’ve made and talk things out. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping those past successes in mind can be very helpful. Remember that I’m always here if you need additional support. It’s been a pleasure working with you today!

User: Thank you! I appreciate everything you've helped me with.

Consultant: You’re most welcome! I'm proud of your progress. I look forward to seeing you next time, and I wish you all the best with your family activities!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good actually. Participating in team activities has been really rewarding, and I feel more positive about things.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like engaging with your peers has been fulfilling for you. Can you share more about how these experiences have affected your mood or confidence?

User: Sure! Being part of a team makes me feel included. I’ve noticed that I smile more often, and I feel like I can express myself better around others.

Consultant: That's really great! It sounds like these social interactions are enhancing your overall sense of belonging and self-expression. Have you set any new goals for yourself regarding these activities?

User: Yes, I want to join a few more clubs at school and maybe even try organizing some activities. I feel like I could do it!

Consultant: That's an excellent goal, Li! Organizing activities could really help you build your confidence further. What specific clubs or activities are you considering?

User: I'm thinking about joining the art club and maybe the science club. I love expressing myself through art, and science always interests me.

Consultant: Both sound like fantastic options! How do you feel about taking the first step to join these clubs? What emotions come up for you when thinking about this?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. I worry about fitting in or if I'll be good enough, but I really want to try.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel a mixture of excitement and nerves. Let’s explore those worries for a moment. What evidence do you have that you might not fit in or be good enough?

User: I guess I've seen some really talented people in those clubs, and sometimes I compare myself to them. 

Consultant: Comparison can indeed lead to self-doubt. But let’s consider an alternative perspective: what unique qualities do you bring to the table? How might those qualities contribute to the clubs you’re interested in?

User: I think I’m creative, and I have a lot of ideas to share. In my current team, I’ve taken the lead on a few projects, and I think that helped others too.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, Li! Your creativity and leadership can greatly enrich those clubs. What if you reframed your thinking around your worries? Instead of focusing on comparisons, how might you celebrate your own contributions?

User: I could remind myself that everyone has their own strengths and that I can learn from others too, rather than just feeling inferior.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on learning and personal growth helps to reduce that pressure. Let's also add some small actionable steps. How about setting a timeline to join these clubs? It could help with both excitement and nerves.

User: That sounds good. Maybe I can aim to join by the end of this month. 

Consultant: That's a great timeline! You’ll have time to prepare and feel ready. After joining, how about we set a goal for you to reflect on your experiences and share what you’ve learned in our next session?

User: Yes, I can definitely do that. I think it will be nice to look back and see how I felt about it.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflecting on these experiences can solidify your progress. As you engage in these activities, remember to pay attention to how you feel and what you achieve. 

User: I will. I want to remember these feelings and learn from them.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset! Additionally, consider keeping a journal where you can write about your day-to-day interactions and feelings. It can be a powerful tool for self-reflection.

User: I like that idea! I can track my progress and feelings about how things are going in the clubs.

Consultant: Perfect! Journaling can provide you with insights into your growth and serve as a positive reinforcement tool. How do you feel about using this journaling approach moving forward?

User: I feel motivated to start! It sounds like a good way to keep track of my feelings.

Consultant: That’s great to hear, Li! As you embark on this journey, remember that it’s okay to feel a range of emotions. Each experience contributes to your growth. 

User: I know, and I appreciate how supportive you’ve been. It's really helping me feel more confident.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! It's important to acknowledge your progress and the benefits of those supportive environments. Let's continue to build on this confidence together.

User: Yes, I look forward to it! 

Consultant: Before we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed. You’re planning to join new clubs, you’ll celebrate your contributions, and you’ll start journaling about your experiences. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I feel more organized with these plans.

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember, every step you take builds more confidence. I’m looking forward to hearing all about it when we meet next time. 

User: Thank you! I'm excited to see how it all goes.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Li! It’s been a pleasure talking with you today. Keep nurturing those positive experiences, and I'll see you soon!

User: Bye! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! It's great to see you again. I'm looking forward to our session today. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. I got an award at school for my performance, and my mom was really proud of me. It felt nice to be recognized.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like receiving that award was a significant moment for you. Can you tell me more about how that recognition impacted your feelings?

User: It made me feel more confident and like I'm doing something right. I realized that my efforts are paying off, which is quite encouraging. 

Consultant: Absolutely, it's fantastic that you’re building your confidence. Recognizing your achievements is an important part of maintaining emotional stability. How do you think you can keep this positive momentum going?

User: I think I need to remind myself of this award when I feel uncertain or anxious about things. Maybe I could write it down somewhere to see it every day.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Keeping a tangible reminder of your accomplishments can help reinforce positive feelings during challenging times. Have you considered any other techniques to support your self-care?

User: I sometimes read books or listen to music when I need to calm down. I think those help me relax, but I haven't been doing it as much lately.

Consultant: It sounds like engaging with music and reading can be soothing for you. Perhaps we could explore setting aside specific times during your week for these activities. How do you feel about that idea?

User: That could work! I’d like to make it a habit again. It just gets busy with school and everything.

Consultant: I understand that balancing school and personal time can be challenging. What might be a good starting point for incorporating these relaxing activities back into your routine?

User: Maybe I could start with just 15 minutes in the evening. That seems doable.

Consultant: That sounds like a reasonable approach! Starting small can make it more manageable. How does that align with your current schedule?

User: In the evenings, I usually have some homework, but I can finish it earlier to make time for that. 

Consultant: It's wonderful to see you taking charge of your time. Allocating that 15 minutes could serve as a rewarding way to close your day. Are there any other emotions or situations you want to discuss that might affect your confidence?

User: Sometimes I still get nervous before presentations, even though I've been doing well. I worry about forgetting what I'm going to say.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous before speaking in front of others. Can we explore what specifically triggers that anxiety for you?

User: I think it’s the fear of not being as good as I was last time, or what if I make a mistake?

Consultant: Those thoughts are quite common, and they can create pressure. What if we challenged those thoughts together? For instance, can you think of instances where you've successfully handled mistakes?

User: Well, once I forgot a part of my speech, but I just took a deep breath and continued. It went okay.

Consultant: Great example! It shows that you can recover and adapt in those situations. Let’s practice reframing your thought process—what would you tell a friend in that situation, compared to how you talk to yourself?

User: I would probably encourage him to just keep going and not worry too much. I guess I should do that for myself too.

Consultant: Exactly! Offering yourself the same kindness and understanding that you’d give to a friend is a powerful tool. This could help ease your anxiety next time you present. 

User: I really like that. I’m definitely going to try to be kinder to myself.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful commitment! We’ve talked about many strategies today. As we wrap up, do you feel ready to implement these self-care techniques and the new mindset for your upcoming presentations?

User: Yes, I feel more equipped after our conversation. I appreciate you helping me work through these things.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Li! Remember, it's all about progress. Let's review your achievements in our next session, and evaluate how the strategies are working for you. 

User: Sounds good! I look forward to it.

Consultant: Me too! Thank you for being here today. I'm confident that you’ll continue to grow and manage your emotions effectively. See you next time!

User: See you!
