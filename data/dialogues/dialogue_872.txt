Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious. The pressure of graduating is weighing on me, and I'm even more worried about how I will interact with others in the future.

Consultant: That sounds very challenging. It's understandable to feel anxiety during such a significant transition. Can you share more about what specifically makes you feel anxious about social interactions?

User: I feel like I don't fit in and that everyone else is better at socializing than I am. Whenever I think about meeting new people, especially girls, I just freeze up.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to perform socially. What thoughts run through your mind when you find yourself in those situations?

User: I often think that I'll embarrass myself or that they won't like me. It feels like I'm destined to fail every time.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really overwhelming. Let’s explore them a bit. How much evidence do you have to support those beliefs that you will embarrass yourself or be disliked?

User: I guess there's not much actual evidence. It's just how I feel. But it doesn’t feel like a choice, it feels real and convincing in the moment.

Consultant: I understand. Emotions can feel very powerful and real, even if they aren't backed by evidence. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them to think?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it's okay to not be perfect. I wouldn’t be so hard on them.

Consultant: That's a great perspective! It shows that you have a compassionate side when thinking about others. What if we could apply that same kindness to your own feelings? 

User: I guess it would help. I often forget to be kind to myself in those moments.

Consultant: Let's work on that together. When you're feeling anxious about social situations, can we try to challenge those negative thoughts with a more balanced viewpoint? 

User: That sounds like something I need, but I worry that it won't be easy.

Consultant: It may take some practice, but it is possible. How about we create a small plan for you to gradually face social situations? We can start with something manageable.

User: Okay, maybe just saying hi to someone in class would be a good start. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent first step! How do you feel about setting a goal to say hi to someone next week?

User: I feel nervous just thinking about it, but I know I need to try.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous, Wang. What if we prepared a simple plan for that interaction? You could even practice the greeting beforehand.

User: Practicing sounds helpful. Maybe if I think of it as just a friendly gesture, it wouldn’t feel so scary.

Consultant: Absolutely! And remember, you're not alone in this. Many people feel nervous in social settings. How about after you say hi, we could talk about how you felt afterward?

User: That would be good. Having a space to talk about it might help me process my feelings.

Consultant: Definitely! Reflecting on experiences can provide valuable insights. What else do you think might help you gain confidence in those situations?

User: Maybe I could also think about what I would like to talk about, like my hobbies or interests. 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Focusing on topics that excite you can help steer the conversation in a positive direction. 

User: Yes, I have some interests I am passionate about, but I usually clam up and don’t share.

Consultant: We can work on gradually sharing those passions. What would it feel like to talk about something you enjoy in a low-pressure situation?

User: It might actually feel good, like I would be sharing a piece of myself with others.

Consultant: Exactly! Sharing can create connections. As you practice, try to remind yourself of your interests and the value they bring to conversations.

User: I will try to keep that in mind. It helps to know I can talk about what I love.

Consultant: You’re making wonderful progress! Remember, self-compassion is key. It's okay to feel nervous but also allow yourself to celebrate small victories.

User: I think I understand that more now. I will try to be kinder to myself during these moments.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, Wang. You're doing really well. Let's set a time to talk about your experience with these interactions next session.

User: I look forward to it. I hope I can at least say hi to someone by then.

Consultant: I'm sure you can! Remember, take it step by step. I’m here for you, and we’ll keep working through this together.

User: Thanks for your support. I feel a bit more hopeful about it now. 

Consultant: You’re welcome, Wang. It’s great to see you feeling a bit more hopeful. Remember, progress takes time. If you ever feel overwhelmed, just reach out.

User: I appreciate that. I’ll do my best! 

Consultant: That’s all anyone can ask for. I believe in you. Let’s reconvene next time to discuss how it all went. 

User: Sounds good! See you next time! 

Consultant: See you, Wang! Take care until then.

Consultant: Hello, welcome to today's session, Wang. It's good to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last talk about your experiences at the academic event?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling quite anxious, actually. Even though I had the courage to attend, I was really tense throughout the whole thing. It just made me feel like I'm not good enough when it comes to socializing.

Consultant: I hear you, and it sounds like that experience was quite overwhelming. You hoped to engage more, but it seems it intensified your feelings of self-doubt. Can you tell me more about that tension and what thoughts were running through your mind during the event?

User: I kept thinking that I shouldn't be there, that everyone else is more confident and capable than I am. It felt like I was just waiting to embarrass myself.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy. It's understandable that they would contribute to your anxiety. When you think "I shouldn’t be there" or "I’ll embarrass myself," how does that make you feel in the moment?

User: It makes me feel empty and scared. I just want to get out of that situation as fast as I can.

Consultant: It's tough feeling that way. So, it seems your thoughts are leading to a sense of panic and an urge to escape. Have you noticed how these thoughts might be influencing your actions in social situations?

User: Yes, definitely. They make me avoid situations where I might have to talk to people. I've skipped some study group meetings and social events because of this anxiety.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s a common response to avoid discomfort. Let’s explore this a bit more. What do you believe might happen if you did attend those study groups or social events despite your fears?

User: I suppose I worry that I'll just freeze up or say something stupid, which will confirm that I’m not good at socializing.

Consultant: That’s a powerful concern, and it seems like it's reinforcing your belief that you’re not socially competent. But what if we looked at this from a different perspective? What evidence do you have that you would definitely freeze or say something wrong?

User: I guess I don't really have hard evidence. It's just how I feel based on my previous experiences.

Consultant: So, those feelings are based on past experiences, but they might not be the full picture. If you could think of a time when you interacted well with someone, even if it was just a brief encounter, what did that look like?

User: There were a couple of times when I could have a short chat with classmates, and it felt okay, but I often forget those moments when I'm feeling anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like those positive interactions might have been overshadowed by your anxiety. What if we practiced recalling those moments whenever you feel anxiety creeping in? This could help balance out your thoughts.

User: That could help, I think. I just find it hard to remember those times in the moment.

Consultant: I understand. Let’s try to create a strategy together. What if you created a small journal of those positive interactions? Writing them down could serve as a reminder of your capabilities.

User: That sounds like a good idea. It might help to have something tangible to look back on.

Consultant: Great! We can also combine this with some gradual exposure. Perhaps you could set a small goal for yourself, like attending one low-pressure study group this week. How does that sound?

User: I'm a bit nervous about that, but I’d like to try.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous! Let’s take it step by step. What’s one specific action you could take to prepare for that study group to help ease some of that nervousness?

User: Maybe I could prepare some questions to bring up during the group. That way, I won’t feel so lost.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Preparing in advance can certainly give you a sense of control. I believe you can do this. How do you think you might feel after attending the study group, even if it’s challenging?

User: I think I might feel a sense of achievement, even if it’s tough. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Every small step is progress. Let’s set an intention for you. If you do face anxiety during these interactions, how can you remind yourself that you are making a positive effort?

User: I can remind myself that it's okay to feel nervous and that I'm practicing. It doesn't have to be perfect.

Consultant: Exactly! It's about progress, not perfection. Let’s wrap up for today by summarizing what you plan to do before our next session. What key actions will you take?

User: I’ll keep a journal of positive social moments and prepare for the study group with questions. I’ll also remind myself that it's all part of practice.

Consultant: That sounds perfect, Wang! I’m really proud of you for taking these steps. Remember to be kind to yourself during this process. If you need support on the way, I'm here for you. 

User: Thank you. I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing how it goes next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! Welcome to today’s session. How are you feeling? I’d like to hear more about what’s been on your mind lately.

User: Hi! I've been really anxious about my studies and my interactions with classmates. I feel overwhelmed and it's hard to focus on my work. I fear that if I don't manage my relationships better, it will impact my academic performance.

Consultant: I understand, that combination of academic pressure and social interaction can be quite stressful. Could you tell me more about what specific situations have made you feel this way regarding your classmates?

User: Well, when I try to join study groups, I often feel out of place. I worry that I’ll say something wrong or that they’ll judge me. It’s just really stressful.

Consultant: It sounds like you feel a lot of pressure during those interactions. Can you share what thoughts go through your mind in those moments? What do you think might happen if you said something incorrect?

User: I keep thinking they will laugh at me or think I'm not smart enough. This makes me feel embarrassed and I tend to withdraw.

Consultant: That’s a tough position to be in, feeling embarrassed can really hinder your ability to connect with others. What kind of feelings does this lead to when you're faced with those situations?

User: I often feel quite anxious and sometimes even frustrated with myself for not being more confident. I feel like I’m stuck in a cycle of worrying.

Consultant: I can imagine that frustration. It seems like your thoughts about potential judgment from classmates are causing a significant amount of anxiety. What evidence do you see that supports these thoughts? Are there times when things go better than you expect?

User: Sometimes, my classmates have been friendly, but my mind seems to focus on the worst-case scenarios. It’s always the negativity that sticks with me.

Consultant: It’s common for our minds to latch onto the negatives. If a friend of yours were in a similar situation with such thoughts, what would you advise them to focus on?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on the positive interactions they've had and not to assume the worst from others.

Consultant: That’s a valuable perspective! Let’s try to apply that to you. Could we take a moment to list some positive experiences you've had with your classmates? How did they react to you?

User: There have been a few times when we laughed together during study sessions. They seemed to appreciate my contributions. But, I often forget those moments when I’m feeling anxious.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you’ve had positive experiences! Let’s try to challenge those negative beliefs. How might you remind yourself of those positive moments when anxiety arises in the future?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal to jot down nice interactions. That way, I can look back at it whenever I doubt myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Keeping a journal can help solidify those positive experiences. Now, let's think about some practical steps you can take to tackle those feelings of anxiety in social situations. What might be a small step you could take towards engaging with your classmates more comfortably?

User: I think I could start by initiating small conversations with one or two people before study sessions, maybe just about the weather or classes. That feels less intimidating.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic starting point! Initiating brief conversations can help build confidence. How do you think you will feel after taking that step?

User: I hope I’ll feel a bit more at ease, knowing I engaged positively rather than just avoiding them.

Consultant: Exactly! Each small step can help reduce anxiety over time. Let's also consider some strategies you can use when anxiety strikes. What do you think would help calm you in those moments?

User: I could try some deep breathing exercises to center myself before I engage in conversation. That might help ease the tension.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be very effective! Let’s practice that technique together. Remembering to take a few slow, deep breaths can make a big difference. How do you feel about your progress today?

User: I feel a little hopeful. It’s good to have a plan and some strategies to try.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, change takes time, but you’re on the right path. As we wrap up today, I encourage you to practice these ideas and reflect on your interactions. How do you plan to implement them in the coming week?

User: I’ll start by journaling my positive experiences and trying to chat with classmates a few times. I’ll also remember to breathe if I start to feel anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! We’ll continue to build on your experiences next time we meet. Keep in mind that it’s okay to feel anxious sometimes, but you’re taking proactive steps to manage it. If you find yourself struggling, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance. I’m looking forward to trying these things out.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Wang! I believe in your ability to navigate these challenges. I’ll see you next time, and take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! It's nice to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hello. I've been struggling a lot, especially with this group project. I feel really overwhelmed and disappointed about the misunderstandings that happened when trying to work with my classmates.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling really frustrated about the communication issues within your team. Can you describe what specific misunderstandings occurred that made you feel this way?

User: Well, we were supposed to divide our work, but I thought I was clear about my role. Instead, my classmates seemed to have different ideas. I felt like I let everyone down, and now I doubt my ability to collaborate.

Consultant: I hear you. It’s tough when expectations aren’t aligned. I want to help you build your communication skills within the group. What do you think would help you feel more confident in expressing your role and ideas next time?

User: Maybe if I could clearly outline my thoughts before discussions? Like writing them down or practicing what I want to say.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Preparing what you want to communicate can definitely help. Let's explore how you can structure your points effectively. How do you feel about trying out some techniques to express yourself more clearly?

User: I think that could work. I just hesitate a lot when I’m in the moment. I want to say things, but I feel stuck.

Consultant: That’s completely normal, especially in a team setting. Let’s focus on identifying the thoughts that come up when you feel stuck. How do you feel in those moments when you want to speak up, but hold back?

User: I guess I feel anxious, like I'm going to be judged. I keep thinking that what I say won't make sense or that they won’t take me seriously.

Consultant: Those thoughts of judgment can be heavy. Let's challenge them. What evidence do you have that your contributions wouldn't be valued? 

User: I don’t know…maybe because I'm not as outspoken as others?

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, but being outspoken isn't the only way to contribute. What if some team members are actually waiting for your input? Can we reframe that thought?

User: I hadn’t thought of it that way. Maybe they actually want to hear what I have to say.

Consultant: Exactly! The goal is to recognize that your perspective is valuable. We could also role-play a team discussion exercise. How does that sound to you?

User: Role-playing could be helpful. I could try saying things in a 'safe' space first.

Consultant: Great idea! Let’s simulate a discussion where you have to express your ideas. What topic should we discuss that feels relevant to your group project?

User: We could talk about the research methods section, which I’m comfortable with.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s imagine we're in the meeting, and you need to share your thoughts. Go ahead and start explaining your ideas as you would in the group.

User: Alright. I’d say something like, "I think we should use a mixed-method approach because it could offer more comprehensive data..."

Consultant: Excellent start! That was clear and informative. How did it feel to articulate your thoughts?

User: A bit nerve-wracking, but I think I did better than I expected.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! With practice, you'll find it easier. What would you like to focus on next in our upcoming sessions to continue building your confidence?

User: I’d like to work on managing my anxiety and building more confidence when talking in a group.

Consultant: That’s a solid goal. We can incorporate relaxation techniques to ease anxiety and help reinforce your confidence in those settings. How does that sound for your next steps?

User: That sounds really good. I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: I am too! It’s great to see your motivation. Let’s continue developing these skills, and I'll support you as you navigate those group dynamics. Remember, it's a process, and you're doing really well.

User: Thank you! It feels good to have a plan and someone to talk to about this.

Consultant: You’re welcome! Remember, I'm here to help you along the way. I believe in your ability to grow and find comfort in social interactions. If you need clarification or support, just let me know.

User: I will! I really appreciate your guidance.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing so openly today, Wang. Let’s keep building on this progress. I look forward to our next session, where we can continue to strengthen your skills.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing a bit better, actually. I participated in a group study last week, and even though I was nervous, I felt some support from my classmates. It was a little overwhelming but mostly positive.

Consultant: That sounds like a meaningful step forward! It’s great to hear that you felt supported during your group study. How does that experience influence your feelings about social situations right now?

User: I think it makes me feel a bit more hopeful. I realized that I can actually engage with others, even if it feels challenging at first. I want to keep building on that.

Consultant: That's a fantastic insight! Acknowledging that you can engage with others is essential for building confidence. What specific moments from the group study stood out to you as positive experiences?

User: Well, there were times when I shared my thoughts about the material, and my classmates seemed to appreciate my input. It felt nice to be heard.

Consultant: Being heard and appreciated is such an important aspect of social interaction! How did those moments make you feel about your abilities in social situations?

User: It made me feel more confident. I realized that I do have ideas worth sharing, and that encourages me to speak up more often.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Let’s explore that further. When you think about speaking up in future social situations, what thoughts come to mind? 

User: Sometimes I still fear that I might say something silly or that others won't be interested in what I have to say.

Consultant: Those thoughts are quite common, and it's positive that you’re aware of them. Can we challenge that fear a bit? What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts those worries?

User: Well, during the group study, my classmates responded positively, which contradicts my worries. I guess sometimes my mind exaggerates the fear.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s great that you recognized that. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them to focus on instead of those worries?

User: I would tell them to focus on the fact that they have something valuable to contribute and that everyone makes mistakes sometimes.

Consultant: That’s excellent advice! Now, let’s think about what small steps you can take to continue engaging socially. Is there a specific activity or event coming up that you could participate in to practice this?

User: There’s a study group scheduled for next week. I could prepare a topic to discuss, which might help me feel more confident.

Consultant: Preparing a topic sounds like a wonderful plan! Focusing on something you’re knowledgeable about can really help ease your nerves. How could you make the experience even more enjoyable or rewarding for yourself?

User: I could promise myself to acknowledge my contributions, regardless of how others react. Just focusing on my participation feels encouraging.

Consultant: That’s a powerful commitment to yourself! Celebrating your contributions is key. How do you plan to acknowledge your efforts after the study session?

User: Maybe I could write down what I said and how I felt during and after the group. That way, I can reflect on the positive moments.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant idea! Reflection will help reinforce your confidence. How do you feel about the progress you've made so far in building your social confidence?

User: Honestly, I feel proud. It’s not easy for me, but I can see that I’m starting to change my mindset a bit.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Acknowledging your progress is vital. What challenges do you think you might face as you continue on this journey, and how can we work together to address them?

User: I worry that some days I might feel really anxious again and hesitate to join in. I guess I need to prepare for those moments too.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re thinking ahead. What strategies can you use on those anxious days to remind yourself of your strengths and previous successes?

User: I could have a few affirmations ready to tell myself or remind myself of positive experiences like the study group. 

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Preparing affirmations and recalling positive experiences can be very useful. Let’s make it a goal to identify a few affirmations that resonate with you. What thoughts would you like to include?

User: I’d like to say, “I contribute valuable ideas” and “it’s okay to be nervous.” These feel encouraging to me.

Consultant: Those are powerful affirmations! Remember to practice them regularly, especially before social interactions. As we wrap up this session, what is one key takeaway you want to hold onto as you continue to work on your social confidence?

User: I think it’s that I have value in social interactions and that it’s normal to feel anxious sometimes. I can still engage and grow.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic takeaway! You’re absolutely right; feeling nervous is part of the process. I believe you’re well on your way to maintaining your confidence. If you experience challenges, remember that you’ve developed useful strategies. You’re always welcome back whenever you need support. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance. I’m looking forward to applying what we've discussed today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m excited for your continued progress. Have a great week ahead, and I hope to hear about your experiences next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you again! How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi, I've been feeling quite good, actually! I recently gave a group presentation, and it went really well. My classmates and my professor praised me, which boosted my confidence quite a bit.

Consultant: That sounds fantastic! It's great to hear that you received positive feedback. How did you feel during the presentation, and what thoughts were going through your mind?

User: I felt nervous at first, but as I started speaking, I became more relaxed. I tried not to think too much about what could go wrong, and it really helped.

Consultant: It's impressive that you were able to manage those nerves. It seems like you were able to shift your focus from potential mistakes to the positive experience of speaking. How has this experience influenced your view of yourself in social situations?

User: I think it's made me realize that I can handle social situations better than I thought. I’m feeling more comfortable engaging with people, and I'm not as afraid of being judged anymore.

Consultant: That's an important realization! Building on this progress, how do you feel about your future social interactions? Are there specific areas where you'd like to improve even further?

User: I want to be more proactive in social settings. Sometimes I still hesitate to join conversations or introduce myself to new people, even though I know I can do it now.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel hesitant sometimes. Let’s explore some strategies that might help you feel more comfortable initiating conversations. What do you think could help you take that step?

User: Maybe having a few conversation starters ready would help. Also, practicing with friends could boost my confidence.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Having conversation starters can be very beneficial. Additionally, practicing with friends is a safe way to build your skills. How do you feel about setting a specific goal for yourself in this area?

User: I could aim to start a conversation with at least one new person during my next social event. That feels doable!

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful goal! Starting small can make a big difference. How do you plan to prepare for this goal? 

User: I could think of a few topics I might want to discuss or some interesting questions to ask. I also need to remind myself that it’s okay if the conversation doesn’t go perfectly.

Consultant: That's a healthy mindset to have! Remember, it’s more about connecting than achieving perfection. Would you like to discuss any potential challenges you might face while trying to achieve this goal?

User: I think my biggest challenge might be overthinking what to say. I get worried about saying something stupid.

Consultant: Overthinking can definitely hinder our interactions. One technique you might find helpful is to focus on the other person during a conversation. Try to listen and respond to what they say rather than putting too much pressure on yourself. How does that sound to you?

User: That makes sense! If I focus on listening, I might feel less pressure to come up with perfect responses.

Consultant: Exactly! Engaging in the moment can help alleviate some of that pressure. As you move forward, remember to celebrate small victories, even if they seem minor. How do you plan to keep track of your progress?

User: I could keep a journal to note down my experiences and feelings after social events. It would help me see how much I’ve improved.

Consultant: A journal is a fantastic idea! Reflecting on your experiences will give you valuable insights and reinforce the positive strides you're making. Is there anything else you want to discuss today?

User: I think we've covered a lot! I'm really feeling optimistic about the next steps.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It seems like you’re in a great place. Before we wrap up, let's summarize some of the key takeaways from our session today and how you've progressed since we started working together.

User: Sure! I’ve become more comfortable in social situations, and I have a plan to initiate conversations more frequently. I’ll prepare conversation starters and focus on listening to others.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! You’ve made significant progress, and I’m proud of you for recognizing your growth. As we conclude our sessions, remember that setbacks are a natural part of growth, and you have the skills to manage them. How do you feel moving forward?

User: I feel confident and ready to take on social challenges! I appreciate all the support you've provided.

Consultant: You've done amazing work, and it’s been a pleasure to support you. Trust in your abilities, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need guidance in the future. Best of luck on your journey ahead!
