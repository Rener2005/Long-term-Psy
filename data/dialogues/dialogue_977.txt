Consultant: Hello, Xiaohong! I’m glad you’re here for our session today. How have you been feeling lately with your studies and upcoming exams?

User: Hi. Lately, I've been really stressed about my studies. With the mid-terms approaching, I start feeling anxious about three days before the exam, and then I can’t focus at all on my study materials.

Consultant: It sounds like the anticipation of the exam is genuinely affecting your preparation. Can you share more about what goes through your mind during those anxious moments?

User: Well, I keep thinking about how I didn’t perform well in the last two monthly tests, and I’m worried I might fail again. My heart races, and I can’t concentrate on what I'm studying.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It's understandable that past experiences can create a lot of pressure. How does it make you feel when you think about those past performances?

User: It makes me feel really down on myself. I keep blaming myself for not studying hard enough, and it feels like I’m letting my mom down because she has such high expectations.

Consultant: It's tough to carry that kind of pressure. You want to meet your own expectations as well as those of your mother. What would it look like for you to find a way to manage this anxiety so you can study more effectively?

User: I just want to feel calmer and be able to get through my study plan without panic setting in. Right now, it just feels overwhelming.

Consultant: Absolutely. We can work together to build a sense of calm. Let’s explore some of those thoughts you have. What thoughts come to mind just before you start to feel that anxiety?

User: I often tell myself, "What if I fail again?" or "I’ll disappoint my mom." Those thoughts just keep looping in my head, making things worse.

Consultant: Those thoughts can feel very powerful. When you say, "What if I fail again?" what emotions or physical sensations do you experience?

User: I feel a tight knot in my stomach and my heart races. I also feel really frustrated and hopeless.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Xiaohong. It’s important to recognize how those thoughts impact your feelings and physical state. Let's try to challenge one of those thoughts: Is there any evidence that supports that you will fail again, or could there be other explanations for past results?

User: Well, I guess there were other factors that affected my performance, like feeling unwell during the tests. But it’s hard to remember that when I’m so stressed.

Consultant: It is common for stressful moments to cloud our judgment. If you were advising a friend in your position, what would you tell them about their worries?

User: I’d probably tell them to focus on what they can do now, rather than worrying about the outcome. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight! You seem to recognize the importance of focusing on the present. Perhaps we can practice some techniques together that help shift your attention away from those worries.

User: I’d like that. I need some tools to manage my anxiety better.

Consultant: One simple method is mindfulness. It involves paying attention to the present moment without judgment. Would you be comfortable trying a short mindfulness exercise here?

User: Sure, I think that might help.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment to close our eyes, take a deep breath in through the nose, and then slowly release it through the mouth. As you breathe, focus on the sensation of your breath entering and leaving your body. If thoughts arise, gently acknowledge them and return to your breath. How’s that feeling for you?

User: It feels calming. I didn’t realize how much tension I was holding.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Practicing mindfulness regularly can help you manage your anxiety more effectively. How might you incorporate this technique into your study routine leading up to exams?

User: I could try doing this before I start studying to help my mind clear.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! It’s all about finding what strategies work best for you. Let’s also think about your study schedule. How are you currently distributing your time for studying?

User: I usually just cram everything in before the exams, which adds to my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s understandable. How might spreading out your study time over the month, perhaps with short breaks and mindfulness exercises, impact your feelings going into the exams?

User: It might actually help me feel more prepared and less frantic if I don’t leave everything until the last minute.

Consultant: Exactly! Creating a balanced study schedule could really alleviate the pressure. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what strategies we've discussed that you can practice to feel more confident and lessen anxiety.

User: We talked about using mindfulness before studying and spreading out my study sessions instead of cramming. 

Consultant: Yes! And remember, it’s important to be kind to yourself in this process. You’ve already identified some effective strategies today. How are you feeling about implementing these ideas?

User: I feel hopeful. I really want to try these techniques and see how they work for me.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful outlook, Xiaohong! You’ve taken important steps today. If you find yourself needing more support, don’t hesitate to reach out. You’re capable of handling this, and I'm here to help.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Hong! I'm glad to see you again today. Last time, we talked about your anxiety related to exam preparation. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I still feel pretty anxious, especially since the mock exams are approaching. I worry I won't have enough time to study everything, and I keep blaming myself for not being able to manage it better.

Consultant: It sounds like the pressure is still quite significant for you, and that you're feeling overwhelmed by the expectations. Let’s explore this a bit more. What emotions do you experience when you think about your study schedule right now?

User: I feel really anxious and sometimes I just freeze. It’s like I want to study, but my mind feels cluttered, making it hard to focus on anything.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way when the pressure builds up. It may help to identify the thoughts that are contributing to this anxiety. What specific thoughts do you have when you find it hard to focus?

User: I often think, “What if I forget everything during the exam?” or “I should be studying harder instead of just sitting here.” 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very intense and judgmental. When you think those thoughts, how do they affect your feelings of anxiety?

User: They make me feel worse, which only adds to the anxiety. I get frustrated with myself and then feel even less motivated to study.

Consultant: I hear you. It seems like these thoughts are creating a cycle of anxiety and frustration. Let’s try to challenge those thoughts. Can you consider any evidence that might contradict them? 

User: Well, I did manage to do well on some previous tests, but I just focus on the fear of failing this time.

Consultant: That's a good point! Reflecting on your past successes can help counter those negative thoughts. If you were to advise a friend experiencing similar concerns about their exams, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them to take breaks, trust their preparation, and not to be so hard on themselves.

Consultant: That’s solid advice! It might be helpful to apply that same perspective to yourself. Let's discuss how we can create a study plan that allows for breaks and time to reassess your goals. What do you think would be a realistic approach for managing your study time?

User: I guess I could break down my subjects into smaller topics and set specific times to study each one. That way, I won’t feel so overwhelmed.

Consultant: Absolutely! Breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks can reduce feelings of anxiety. How about we create a specific schedule together? Could you share with me how many subjects you need to prepare for and how much time you have available each day?

User: There are five subjects, and I have about three weeks until the exams. If I study a bit every day, I think I can cover them all.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Let’s figure out a way to structure your daily study sessions. Do you have a preferred time of day when you feel most focused?

User: I think I concentrate best in the morning, but I often get distracted in the afternoon.

Consultant: Great! We can focus your study sessions in the morning when your concentration is at its peak. Perhaps you could set aside a couple of hours each morning for your most challenging subjects. How does that sound?

User: That makes sense! And I could use the afternoons for review or lighter subjects.

Consultant: Perfect! Balancing your schedule like that can help maintain your motivation. Now, what strategies can you apply if you start feeling anxious during a study session?

User: Maybe I could take deep breaths or take a short break to walk around.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Taking breaks and practicing mindfulness can help you reset your mind. It's also important to acknowledge your progress during your study periods. How might you do that?

User: I could set small goals for each session and reward myself when I complete them.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea, Xiao Hong! Rewards can motivate you, plus reflect on your achievements can remind you of what you’ve accomplished, reducing anxiety. Let’s set some concrete goals together for your next session. What would you like to achieve?

User: I want to finish studying one entire subject tomorrow.

Consultant: That’s a clear and achievable goal! Focusing on one subject at a time will also reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed. What can you do to prepare for this study session in the evening?

User: I could gather all my materials and make a list of what I need to cover.

Consultant: Excellent! Preparing in advance can help you feel more organized and ready. How does it feel thinking about these strategies for your study routine?

User: It feels a bit relieving. I feel like I have a plan now, and that eases my mind a little.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s normal to have ups and downs in your study journey. If you ever feel overwhelmed, it’s OK to reach out for support. Before we wrap up, let’s recap your goals for this week.

User: I want to stick to my schedule and complete the study for one subject each day, while also caring for my mental health by taking breaks.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! I believe you can manage this. You have demonstrated your dedication and ability to bounce back. If you start to feel anxious, remember to apply those strategies we discussed today. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate this session. It’s helped me feel more confident about my plans.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Hong. I’m proud of you for taking these steps. Remember, it’s a journey, and you're in control of it. I'm here for you if you need anything in the future. Good luck with your studies!

User: Thank you! I'll do my best, and I’ll definitely reach out if I need help again.

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Hong! I'm glad to see you today. Before we start, could you share how you've been feeling lately, especially with the exams approaching?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really anxious, especially at night when I can't sleep thinking about my grades. It's frustrating because I know I need rest for my exams, but the worry just keeps me awake.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiao Hong. It’s completely understandable to feel anxious with such important exams coming up. Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you about your grades?

User: I worry that if I don’t do well, my parents will be disappointed. My mom has such high expectations for me, and I feel like I need to meet them. It's just a lot of pressure.

Consultant: It seems like you feel a strong sense of responsibility to meet your mother’s expectations. That pressure can be overwhelming. What do you think would happen if things didn’t go as planned?

User: I think my mom would be really upset, and I might let myself down too. It feels like the end of the world if I don’t get the grades I want.

Consultant: I hear you—there’s a lot at stake in your mind, and it feels very serious. Let’s explore this fear a little. Do you think it’s possible that there could be other outcomes besides the worst-case scenario?

User: Maybe, but it’s hard to see that. I’m just focused on the fear of failing. I want to do well because I've worked so hard, but I can't stop worrying.

Consultant: I completely understand. Focusing on your hard work is important. It might help to look at your thoughts about failure. What evidence do you have that failing would lead to the worst outcomes you imagine?

User: Well, I’ve never failed before, but I guess I’m just really scared of disappointing my parents and myself.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It’s natural to fear disappointing others. If you had a friend in your position, what would you tell them about handling that fear?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on doing their best and not to worry too much about the outcome. But when it's me, I find it hard to take my own advice.

Consultant: That’s insightful! It sounds like you’re aware of healthier thoughts but find it challenging to apply them to yourself. Let’s try something together. Can you think of one small step you can take to focus more on your effort rather than the result?

User: Maybe I could create a study schedule to stay organized and focused. That might help me feel more in control.

Consultant: That’s a great idea, Xiao Hong! A study schedule can definitely give you a sense of control. How about we also incorporate some relaxation techniques to help with your sleep before exams? Would you be open to trying some breathing exercises with me?

User: Sure, I think that might help. I’ve read about breathing exercises but have never really tried them.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s start with a simple breathing technique. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold your breath for a count of four, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Ready to try it with me?

User: Okay, let’s do it.

Consultant: Great! Inhale… 2, 3, 4… hold… 2, 3, 4… now exhale… 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. How did that feel?

User: It actually felt a bit calming! I didn’t think I could feel that way just from breathing.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It shows how powerful breathing can be in managing anxiety. We can use this technique whenever you start to feel overwhelmed. Would you like to practice it again or focus on something else?

User: I’d like to practice it again! It felt nice. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s do another round together. Inhale deeply… 2, 3, 4… hold… 2, 3, 4… and exhale slowly… 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. You’re doing great! 

User: I feel more relaxed now. I definitely want to incorporate this into my routine.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It’s a great way to manage anxiety. As we continue our sessions, we can also work on those thoughts about expectations. It’s important to remind yourself that doing your best is what truly matters, not just the outcomes.

User: I really need to remember that. I feel like I need to let go of some of the pressure.

Consultant: Yes, letting go of that pressure can help you perform better. It sounds like you’re starting to open up to ideas about managing your thoughts and emotions. Is there anything specific you would like to focus on next time?

User: Maybe I want to learn more about how to shift my thinking when I feel anxious. I think that would help a lot.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can delve deeper into cognitive restructuring to help challenge those anxious thoughts. Remember, the process is just as important as the outcome, and I’m here to support you every step of the way.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate all this support. I’m feeling a bit better already.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Hong! I’m proud of the progress you’re making. Remember, practicing these skills will take time, but with consistency, you’ll likely see improvements. I look forward to our next session together!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Little Red! I'm really glad to see you today. It sounds like you've been exploring mindfulness practices recently. Can you share how that has been for you?

User: Hi! Yes, I've started practicing mindfulness, and I think it's helped a little. I feel more relaxed during some moments, but my anxiety still creeps in, especially when I think about exams.

Consultant: It's great that you've noticed some relaxation from mindfulness! It's completely normal for anxiety to still be present, especially with exams approaching. Can you tell me more about the moments when your anxiety feels overwhelming?

User: Well, sometimes I just get this tight feeling in my chest, and my mind races with thoughts about failing. I really want to do well, but then I get afraid of disappointing my parents, especially my mom.

Consultant: That sounds tough, feeling that pressure from wanting to succeed and the fear of disappointing your parents. When you start to feel that tightness in your chest, what specific thoughts usually come to your mind?

User: I often think, "What if I don't get into a good university?" or "I'm not smart enough." Those thoughts just make me feel worse.

Consultant: I see. Those thoughts seem to weigh heavily on you. Let's try to identify how these thoughts connect with your feelings. When you think, "I'm not smart enough," how does that affect your emotions and actions?

User: It makes me feel really hopeless. I end up procrastinating because I feel overwhelmed by everything. It's like I can't even begin studying.

Consultant: That makes sense. Procrastination can often be a way of coping with overwhelming feelings. What would it look like for you to replace that thought of "I'm not smart enough" with something more supportive?

User: Maybe something like, "I am doing my best, and that’s enough." But it feels so difficult to keep reminding myself of that.

Consultant: That's a valuable alternative thought! It can be hard to shift our thinking, especially under pressure. How about we practice a short mindfulness exercise together, focusing on grounding yourself and reinforcing that positive belief?

User: Sure, I’d be willing to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment to close our eyes and take deep breaths—inhale slowly through your nose and exhale through your mouth. Imagine with each breath that you’re releasing tension and welcoming calmness. 

User: Okay, I’m doing that now. It feels nice. 

Consultant: As you breathe, bring that alternative thought to mind, “I am doing my best, and that’s enough." Let that thought fill your mind as you continue to breathe deeply. 

User: I feel a bit lighter doing this. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Practicing this can help you whenever anxiety arises. How do you think you can incorporate this kind of mindfulness exercise into your daily routine, especially during exam preparation?

User: Maybe I can do this for a few minutes before studying. It could help me start on the right foot.

Consultant: Absolutely! Just a few minutes of mindfulness can set a positive tone for your studying. Let’s also talk about other strategies you can use if anxiety pops up while studying. What do you think you might need in those moments?

User: I think it would help to have some quick breathing techniques ready, or reminders to take breaks.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Taking short breaks and using breathing techniques can be quite effective. Would you like to create a simple plan together for your study sessions, including these strategies?

User: Yes, I’d like that!

Consultant: Let's outline that. For each study session, you could start with a 5-minute mindfulness exercise, then study for a set period, followed by a 1-2 minute break for deep breathing. How does that sound?

User: That sounds doable. I can try that out!

Consultant: Perfect! Remember, it's about being gentle with yourself and working at your own pace. If you find your thoughts getting negative during studying, you can always return to that breathing technique or remind yourself of that supportive thought. 

User: I really like that idea. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, what's the biggest takeaway you're getting from our conversation?

User: I feel like having these mindfulness strategies and positive thoughts can really help me manage my anxiety more effectively moving forward.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway! You’ve been proactive in seeking tools to support your journey. Remember, it's also important to lean on your friends and family for support when you need it. 

User: I think I could talk to my friends more about how I’m feeling. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Connecting with friends can make a significant difference. Just knowing you’re not alone can be comforting. 

User: Thank you so much for our session today. I feel more hopeful! 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. Remember, you’re always welcome to come back if you need further support. 

User: I will! Thanks again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaohong! Welcome to today’s session. I’m glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit anxious about my upcoming exams. But I've also realized that talking to my friends has helped me a lot.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It sounds like you’re starting to recognize the importance of social support. Can you tell me more about how your friends have helped you during this anxious time?

User: Well, I’ve been sharing my worries with them, and they seem to understand what I’m going through. It feels comforting to know I’m not alone.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you’ve found comfort in sharing your worries with friends. It’s a big step to reach out for support. How has this sharing changed your feelings about your anxiety?

User: I feel a bit lighter after talking to them. It’s like I can let some of the weight off my shoulders, but I still find it hard to concentrate sometimes.

Consultant: Let’s explore that further. You mentioned feeling lighter. What other feelings come up when you talk to your friends? Are there specific thoughts that still create tension for you?

User: I think I still worry about not performing well in exams. Sometimes, I have thoughts like "What if I don’t get the grades I want?" 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite challenging. Can you pinpoint how that specific worry makes you feel in the moment? 

User: It makes me feel anxious and a bit hopeless. I begin to doubt my abilities, which isn’t a great feeling.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially with the pressure you’re under. Let’s try to identify if there are any cognitive distortions—like extreme thinking—in that worry. For instance, do you think it’s possible that there are other outcomes besides not doing well?

User: I guess there might be, but I usually focus on the worst-case scenario.

Consultant: That’s a common pattern. It can be helpful to challenge those extremes. If a friend were in your situation, what would you tell them about the possibility of doing well?

User: I’d probably tell them that they’ve worked hard and that it’s okay to have a little anxiety, but it doesn’t mean they’ll fail.

Consultant: Exactly! You already have positive insights. How might you apply that advice to yourself? 

User: I think I need to remind myself that I’ve prepared and that worrying doesn’t change the outcome.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! We can work on developing a few affirmations you can use to counteract those negative thoughts. How does that sound?

User: That sounds really helpful.

Consultant: Fantastic! Let’s create some together. For example, “I am prepared and capable,” or “I can handle whatever comes my way.” What do you think?

User: I like those! Maybe I can add, “My worth is not defined by my grades.”

Consultant: That’s a powerful addition. Using affirmations can significantly help in reshaping your mindset. Are there any activities you can try to keep reminding yourself of these affirmations as you study?

User: Maybe I could write them down and put them on my study desk. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Visual reminders can reinforce those positive thoughts. Moving forward, let’s also consider how to structure your study time to ease some of that pressure. Would you be open to exploring some study techniques together?

User: Yes, I would love that!

Consultant: Great! Let’s discuss setting smaller, achievable goals for your study sessions. For instance, rather than thinking about studying for several hours straight, we could break it down into manageable chunks. How does that sound?

User: That sounds more doable. I could focus for half an hour and then take a short break.

Consultant: Exactly! Breaks can help recharge your mind and reduce anxiety. How do you feel about implementing this approach in the coming days?

User: I think it would really help. I'm hopeful that this can keep me calm and focused.

Consultant: Wonderful! As you practice these techniques, I’d love to hear how it goes next time. Remember, every little step counts. Is there anything else you’d like to talk about today?

User: I feel good about our discussion. I think I just need to keep reminding myself that it’s okay to ask for help when I need it.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Xiaohong. You’ve made great progress in recognizing the value of support and honing coping strategies. As we wrap up, let’s recap what we’ve learned today and the steps you'll take moving forward.

User: Sure! I’ll use affirmations, structure my study time, and continue reaching out to my friends.

Consultant: That sounds like a brilliant plan! Remember, emotional stability and confidence will grow as you practice these strategies. If you encounter any roadblocks, I’ll be here to help. Thank you for sharing today. 

User: Thank you! I feel much more optimistic now. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaohong! I'm really glad to see you back for this session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting, especially with your exams coming up?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty good, actually. I’ve been practicing mindfulness, and I think it’s really helping me stay calm and focused. I even did well on my recent monthly exam!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like the mindfulness practice is making a positive impact on your overall wellbeing and performance. Can you tell me more about what aspects of your mindfulness practice you found helpful?

User: Sure! I’ve been focusing on my breathing and trying to clear my mind when I start to feel anxious. It helps me feel more centered, and I noticed that I'm completing my study sessions more effectively.

Consultant: That’s excellent progress! Being able to manage your anxiety through mindfulness techniques can be really empowering. Have there been moments recently when you felt anxious again, or has it mostly been smooth sailing?

User: There were a few moments before the exam when I felt a bit overwhelmed, but I used my breathing techniques and managed to stay calm. It was a relief not to spiral into anxiety like I used to.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve developed some great tools to handle anxiety when it arises. Acknowledging those feelings without letting them control you is a significant improvement. What do you think has contributed most to this change in your approach?

User: I believe the mindfulness practice has been key, but it also helps that I feel more confident in my abilities. I've seen progress in my studies which makes me believe I can do well.

Consultant: Confidence is indeed a crucial aspect of managing exam-related stress. It's great that you're recognizing your achievements! Moving forward, I’d love to explore how you can maintain this positive state and ensure you’re prepared for future exams. What support do you think might be helpful for you now?

User: I think continuing my mindfulness practice is important, but I also want to develop better time management skills for my study schedule. Sometimes I feel I’m not using my study time efficiently.

Consultant: That sounds like a smart approach. Let’s focus on finding ways to balance your mindfulness techniques with effective time management strategies. How do you currently organize your study time, and what challenges do you face?

User: Right now, I usually just study until I feel too tired or distracted. I don't have a set schedule, which sometimes makes me feel scattered.

Consultant: It’s common to feel scattered without a clear plan. We can work on creating a structured study schedule that incorporates breaks and mindfulness practices. How do you think this could help improve your study efficiency?

User: I think having a schedule would help me stay on track and not get overwhelmed. It would also remind me to take mindful breaks during studying.

Consultant: Absolutely! A well-structured schedule can provide you with a sense of control and accomplishment. Let’s draft a basic schedule together. How many hours do you think you want to allocate for studying each day?

User: I think around four hours would be good, but I’d like to include some shorter sessions and breaks to stay fresh.

Consultant: That sounds like a sustainable plan! How about we break it into two two-hour sessions with a mindful break in between? This way, you can stay focused and avoid burnout. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds perfect! I can do the first two hours in the morning and the second two hours in the late afternoon. 

Consultant: Great! You could even set a timer for your study sessions and mindful breaks to make it easier to stick to the schedule. Will you need any help setting reminders or anything else for this plan?

User: I’m okay with just writing it down for now. I feel confident I can stick to it, especially since I’ve been enjoying the mindfulness breaks.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! I’m proud of how proactive you are about your mental wellbeing and studies. As we wrap up, let’s summarize the progress you’ve made and reinforce your confidence. What do you feel has been your greatest achievement so far?

User: I think overcoming my anxiety during the recent exam and seeing improvements in my focus has been my biggest achievement. 

Consultant: That’s a significant milestone, Xiaohong! You’ve done an amazing job adapting and implementing new techniques. Going forward, remember that it’s okay to rely on these tools when you face challenges and to keep reinforcing your positive mindset. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I feel more equipped to handle future exams now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here for you whenever you feel you might need additional support. Remember to practice self-care as you progress. Best of luck with your upcoming studies and exams!

User: Thanks again! I’ll definitely keep practicing what I’ve learned. 

Consultant: It was a pleasure seeing you today, Xiaohong. Take care and keep up the great work!
