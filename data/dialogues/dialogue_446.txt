Consultant: Hello Zhang Wei! Welcome to today's session. I appreciate you being here. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better in some ways, but I still struggle with anxiety. I often find myself questioning my abilities and feel quite lost about my future after the breakup.

Consultant: It sounds like you're still navigating some challenging emotions. I want to help you explore those feelings. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts come to mind when you feel anxious about your abilities?

User: Well, I often think that I'm not good enough or that others are doing better than me. It makes me want to avoid situations where I might need to prove myself, like group projects or socializing.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It seems like these thoughts create a cycle of anxiety that makes you want to withdraw. Can you recall a recent situation where these thoughts were particularly strong?

User: Yes, last week during a group presentation, I felt paralyzed by fear. I was convinced that I would embarrass myself in front of my classmates, so I struggled to speak at all.

Consultant: That must have been really challenging for you. It seems like fear of embarrassment was very strong in that moment. What specific thoughts crossed your mind right before you felt that fear?

User: I kept thinking that everyone would judge me if I messed up and that I’d look foolish. It really made me freeze up.

Consultant: I understand. Those thoughts of being judged can be really intimidating. Let’s take a moment to challenge those beliefs. How realistic do you think those fears are? What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts those thoughts?

User: I guess when I think about it, most of the time, my classmates are supportive. I have seen others take risks and mess up without anyone making fun of them. Yet, I still can’t help but feel like I’d be the exception.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! It seems like there’s a disconnect between what you see in others and how you view yourself. If a friend were in that situation, what advice would you give them?

User: I would tell them it’s okay to make mistakes and that everyone has made them. I guess I need to remember that I can give myself the same grace.

Consultant: Absolutely! You deserve that kindness too. Let’s explore how you might start applying that perspective to yourself. What small steps can you take in your daily life to practice being more forgiving towards yourself?

User: Maybe I could try to engage more in group activities, even if it's uncomfortable. And remind myself that it's okay to not be perfect every time.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Engaging in group activities can help gradually build your confidence. How would you feel about setting a small goal to join a group activity this week?

User: I think I could try joining a club meeting or a group study session. I’m nervous, but it might help.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea, Zhang Wei! It’s completely normal to feel nervous, but remember that it’s part of the process of challenging yourself. What thoughts do you think might come up for you in those situations, and how could you counter them?

User: I might think that I won't fit in or that I’ll embarrass myself. But I could remind myself that everyone is there to learn and that I might actually connect with someone.

Consultant: Exactly! Those counter-thoughts can help you shift your focus from fear to connection. As we wrap up today, what have you learned about your anxiety and how you might address it moving forward?

User: I’ve learned that my fears are often exaggerated and not always based on reality. I can choose to challenge those thoughts and take small steps to build my confidence.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight, Zhang Wei! Remember that progress takes time, and you’re already on the right path. Next time, we can discuss how those small steps went and continue to work on building your confidence. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel relieved that I was able to talk about my fears. I realize I have some tools to deal with them now, which makes me hopeful.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Always remember that you're not alone in this journey. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! I'm glad to see you again today. I remember from our last session that you've been striving to understand your anxiety better. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I've been thinking a lot about our last conversation. I feel like I’ve gained some insight into my anxiety, but I still struggle with how to be more confident, especially around others.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've gained some insight! Building confidence can be challenging, especially in social situations. Can you share a specific instance recently where you felt your anxiety was heightened?

User: Well, I went to a small gathering with some classmates, and I felt really anxious. I kept worrying about what others thought of me, and it made it hard for me to enjoy myself.

Consultant: I can imagine how tough that must have been for you. It sounds like you were very aware of your thoughts and feelings at that moment. What thoughts were going through your mind during that gathering?

User: I kept thinking that I would say something stupid or that no one would want to talk to me. It just made me feel more isolated.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts were quite negative and likely contributed to your feelings of isolation. Let's explore them a bit more. Do you notice any patterns in these thoughts? For instance, are they always about social situations, or do they appear in other areas of your life too?

User: They mostly come up in social situations. Whenever I have to interact with others, I feel this pressure to act a certain way, and it really holds me back.

Consultant: That's a valuable insight, Zhang Wei. Recognizing these patterns is the first step in addressing them. How do you feel these thoughts affect your behavior in social interactions?

User: When I feel that way, I often just try to avoid conversations or stick to the edges of the group. I know it’s not helping, but it feels easier at the moment.

Consultant: Avoidance can provide temporary relief, but it may also lead to feeling more anxious in the long run. Can we try to challenge some of those negative thoughts? For example, what evidence do you have that saying something "stupid" would lead to a negative outcome?

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence. It’s just that fear of being judged pops into my head, but it’s not like anyone has actually said anything mean to me.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! It seems like your thoughts are based more on fear than on facts. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I think I would encourage them to just be themselves and not worry too much about others’ opinions.

Consultant: That's a kind and supportive perspective. Now, let’s consider applying that advice to yourself. What if you approached social situations with the mindset of simply being yourself and engaging without the pressure of perfection?

User: That sounds like a good idea, but it’s hard to put into practice. I still worry about what others think.

Consultant: It's completely understandable. Changing our thought patterns takes time and practice. What if we start with small, achievable goals? For instance, could you set a goal to initiate a short conversation with one person at the next gathering?

User: I could try that! Even just saying hello to someone would be a start.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! It's small but meaningful. Engaging in these low-pressure interactions can help build your confidence over time. How does that make you feel about your upcoming social gatherings?

User: It makes it feel a bit less daunting, to be honest. I like the idea of focusing on just one person.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. As you practice these smaller steps, you may begin to feel more comfortable in social settings. How would you like to track your experiences in the next week as you implement this goal?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal of how the conversations go, noting what I felt before and after. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Journaling can help you reflect on your progress and emotions, which is a great way to build self-awareness. How do you feel about taking this step?

User: I feel motivated! It's nice to have a plan rather than just worrying about it.

Consultant: Motivation is key, and it's great that you're feeling positive about this! As we come to the end of our session, let’s summarize what you’ve learned today and your plan for the next week. How would you sum up your key takeaways?

User: I’ve learned that my negative thoughts aren’t based on facts, and I can start with small steps to build my confidence in social situations.

Consultant: Exactly! You've made great progress in recognizing those thoughts and are ready to take steps toward greater social comfort. If you encounter challenges, remember to be kind to yourself. Would you like to share how you plan to sustain this motivation moving forward?

User: I think reminding myself of these small goals and journaling about my experiences will help. Also, I’ll think about the advice I’d give a friend.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Before we conclude, remember that you can always reach out if you need support. You've made significant strides, and I believe in your ability to manage these feelings. Thank you for sharing today, Zhang Wei!

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help and guidance. I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! I'm glad to see you again for this session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting, especially regarding your social interactions?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better about understanding my anxiety, but I still get really nervous in social situations. Just last week at a campus event, I felt super uncomfortable even though I tried to join in.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're gaining insights into your anxiety. Social situations can be challenging. Can you share more about what specifically made you feel uncomfortable at the event?

User: I think it’s the fear of being judged or saying something silly. I find it hard to keep conversations going, and that makes me anxious.

Consultant: That’s a common concern, and it makes sense why you’d feel anxious. When you’re in those moments and feeling judged, what thoughts come to your mind?

User: I often think, “What if they don’t like me?” or “What if I embarrass myself?” It just spirals from there.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite overwhelming. Let’s explore these thoughts a bit more. Do you think there’s any evidence to support those thoughts? Have you ever had a situation where people reacted negatively to you?

User: To be honest, I can’t really think of a time when that happened. Most of the time, people seem friendly enough.

Consultant: That's an important realization! So, it sounds like there might be a disconnect between your thoughts and the actual experiences you've had. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about managing those thoughts?

User: I guess I’d tell them to just relax and not think too much about what others think.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s easier to say that than to feel it ourselves, right? How about we work together on some strategies to help you feel more relaxed during social interactions? 

User: I’d really appreciate that. I want to feel more confident!

Consultant: Great! One effective way is through gradually exposing yourself to social settings. Let’s set some achievable goals. How about starting with a smaller gathering where you can interact with a few people, rather than larger events?

User: That sounds doable. Maybe I could try attending a study group this week.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Studying together can create a more relaxed atmosphere. How do you feel about initiating a conversation during that group?

User: It makes me a bit nervous to think about it, but I know I need to try. I guess I could prepare a few topics to discuss.

Consultant: Preparation is a great strategy. What kind of topics do you think would work well for you in that group?

User: Maybe I could ask about the assignments or share my thoughts on the material. It feels safer to talk about schoolwork.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Discussing shared interests can ease the pressure. Could we also think about a positive affirmation you could tell yourself before or during the group? 

User: How about “I’m just here to learn and connect”? 

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation! It helps to remind you of the purpose of the gathering. When you start feeling anxious, repeating this to yourself can help shift your focus. 

User: I’ll definitely try that! 

Consultant: Excellent. After the study group, let’s plan for you to share how it went next time we meet. Reflecting on your experience can be very beneficial.

User: Okay! I’m feeling a bit hopeful now. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s completely normal to feel nervous, but with each step you take, you’ll build more confidence. 

User: Thanks! I really want to overcome this anxiety.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you’re committed to this process. You’re taking important steps toward feeling more comfortable. Is there anything else on your mind today that you’d like to discuss?

User: No, I think we covered it all for now. 

Consultant: Alright, Zhang Wei. Remember to keep practicing your affirmation, and be kind to yourself. You've made great progress today! 

User: Thank you so much! I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences. Take care, and see you soon!

Consultant: Hello Zhang Wei! It's great to see you again. I’m excited to continue our conversations about your progress. How have you been feeling about your social activities and studies since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling much more confident about participating in social activities. I actually enjoyed the last study group we had, which is a huge step for me. But I still feel a bit anxious about my exams coming up.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear that you enjoyed the study group! It's a big achievement to feel more comfortable in social settings. Regarding the anxiety about your exams, can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel anxious?

User: I guess I'm worried about not performing well, especially since I want to prove to myself that I can manage my studies efficiently. Sometimes, I think about the worst outcomes, and that just makes me feel more pressure.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure to perform, which is understandable, especially when you care so much about your studies. When you think about those worst outcomes, what kind of thoughts cross your mind? How do they make you feel?

User: I often think, "What if I fail?" or "What if everyone else does better than me?" That really intensifies my anxiety and makes it hard to concentrate on studying.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be overwhelming. Let's take a moment to explore them. What kind of evidence do you have that supports the idea that you might fail or that others will do better? 

User: I guess there’s no solid evidence. I know I’ve done well in the past, but the fear just sneaks in, and I start doubting myself.

Consultant: It’s normal to have fear, but it’s interesting how your mind can jump to those conclusions. If a friend were in your position, what advice would you give them about their fears? 

User: I would probably tell them to focus on what they can control and remind them of past successes. I guess I should do the same for myself.

Consultant: That’s a very wise perspective! It seems that you already have the tools to challenge those negative thoughts. Now, let's think about some small steps you can take to manage your anxiety while preparing for exams. What activities or study techniques have you found helpful in the past?

User: I usually find it helpful to break my study sessions into shorter segments with breaks in between. It makes it less daunting. 

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Breaking down your study sessions can keep them manageable and reduce feelings of overwhelm. How about we create a plan together for your upcoming study sessions that incorporates these shorter segments? 

User: That sounds good! I think that would help me feel less anxious and more focused.

Consultant: Great! Let’s outline a schedule. How many days do you have until your exams, and how many subjects do you need to cover? 

User: I have about two weeks, and I need to cover three main subjects.

Consultant: Perfect! We can set up a plan to focus on one subject each day, with short breaks, and perhaps a review session on the weekends. Would that work for you?

User: That definitely sounds feasible. I think having a clear plan will keep me on track.

Consultant: Excellent! Remember to celebrate your achievements, no matter how small. After each study session, it could help to jot down what you accomplished as a way to reflect positively on your progress. How does that sound?

User: I love that idea! It will be nice to see what I’ve accomplished instead of just focusing on what’s left to do.

Consultant: I'm glad you resonate with that. It’ll serve to reinforce positive thinking and build more confidence. As you prepare, it might also be good to practice some relaxation techniques before studying or during your breaks. Have you tried any in the past?

User: Not really. I’ve heard of breathing exercises, but I haven't used them myself.

Consultant: Breathing exercises can be a great way to help reduce anxiety. Would you like to try a simple one together now?

User: Sure, I’d like that!

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s take a deep breath in through the nose, hold it for a moment, and then exhale slowly through the mouth. Ready? Inhale… hold… and exhale. How did that feel?

User: That actually felt calming. I think I’ll try to do that when I start feeling stressed.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Incorporating these techniques regularly will contribute to your overall mindset. As we wrap up today, let's reflect on your confidence in handling these situations. What actions will you take to continue building that confidence moving forward?

User: I think I’ll commit to following the study plan we discussed, practice my breathing, and remember to acknowledge my achievements regularly.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! You've made excellent progress today, Zhang Wei. How would you sum up your feelings after our session?

User: I feel much more in control and optimistic about my studies now. Thank you for your support!

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember, you can always reach out if you need additional support. I'm proud of the steps you’re taking. Looking forward to our next session together!

User: Me too! Thank you again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! I'm glad to see you again today. Last time we talked about your progress in social interactions and your recent experiences as a volunteer. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel more confident in social situations now. I've been enjoying my volunteer work and making connections with new people. However, I still sometimes wonder if I can keep this up.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like you're feeling more positive about your interactions. What specifically do you think contributes to your confidence in these social settings?

User: I think being involved in volunteer activities helps. I get to interact with others who share similar interests, and that makes me feel more comfortable. But sometimes I still doubt myself and worry about how I come across to others.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those moments of self-doubt, even when you're experiencing success. Let’s explore this further. When you start to doubt yourself, what kinds of thoughts go through your mind?

User: I often think that maybe I'm not interesting enough or that people are just being polite when talking to me. It feels frustrating because I really want to connect with others more genuinely.

Consultant: I understand how that could be frustrating. It sounds like you're dealing with some negative thoughts about your self-worth in social interactions. Have you noticed how those thoughts affect your feelings during conversations?

User: Yes, when I think that way, I feel more anxious. Sometimes I even hesitate to contribute to discussions because I fear my input won't be valuable.

Consultant: Noticing those connections between your thoughts and feelings is a great step. Let's try to challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that your contributions aren't valuable?

User: Well, I guess I've received positive feedback from some people, but I tend to disregard that. I focus more on the few instances where I felt out of place or not interesting.

Consultant: It sounds like you're highlighting negative experiences over the positive feedback you've received. Let's work on reframing that. If a friend shared similar doubts, what would you tell them about their value in conversations?

User: I would probably tell them that their perspective is unique and that everyone has something to contribute. I think I'd encourage them to share their thoughts more openly.

Consultant: That's a wonderful perspective! Now, how might that advice apply to yourself? Could you try to remind yourself of your value in conversations next time?

User: I can definitely try that. I guess I need to be kinder to myself and trust that I have something worthwhile to share.

Consultant: Exactly! Being kind to yourself is key. Besides reflecting on your contributions, what other strategies can you think of to maintain your confidence during social interactions?

User: Maybe I could prepare some topics beforehand for conversations, or remind myself of positive past interactions before going into new ones.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Preparing topics can help you feel more equipped, and reflecting on positive experiences can boost your confidence. Let’s focus on one of these strategies to implement before your next social gathering. Which would you prefer?

User: I think preparing topics would be more helpful. That way, I feel like I have a safety net if the conversation lulls.

Consultant: Great choice! How about we brainstorm some topics now that you might feel comfortable discussing with others?

User: Sure! I could talk about recent events, such as interesting volunteer experiences or classes I'm taking. I think people would generally find that engaging.

Consultant: Those sound like engaging topics! Remember, the goal is to connect with others, and sharing personal experiences often invites others to share as well. How do you feel about this plan moving forward?

User: I feel more optimistic and excited about having those conversations! It feels good to have a strategy to work with.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! As we reflect on how far you've come, what do you feel has been your biggest achievement in our sessions, and how might you continue to build on that?

User: I think recognizing my self-worth and the importance of my contributions has been significant. I want to continue boosting my confidence and maybe take on more leadership roles in my volunteer projects.

Consultant: Those are fantastic growth goals! You're not just recognizing your worth but also wanting to expand it. How will you keep that momentum going in the future?

User: I plan to remind myself of my strengths and seek out more opportunities to engage with people. I also want to keep working on my social skills.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Zhang Wei! Before we wrap up today, let’s summarize your achievements and the strategies we've discussed. How do you feel about everything we've covered?

User: I feel accomplished and more self-assured. It's reassuring to have these strategies in place, and I'm excited about my future interactions.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've made remarkable progress, and it's been a pleasure to support you on this journey. Remember, you can always reach out if you need guidance in the future. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. I'll be sure to reach out if I need help again.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and good luck with your upcoming social engagements. I'm confident you'll do great!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! It's great to see you again. I'm really looking forward to our conversation today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling much better, actually. Winning the competition really boosted my confidence, and I’ve noticed that I'm more motivated to tackle my studies now.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that! Celebrating your achievements is so important for self-esteem. Let's take a moment to reflect on what you've accomplished. How do you feel these changes have impacted your daily life?

User: I feel like I’m more productive and focused. I used to procrastinate a lot, but now I find it easier to sit down and study. However, sometimes I still worry about maintaining this level of motivation.

Consultant: It’s natural to have those worries, especially when you’ve made substantial progress. Let’s explore that concern a bit more. What specific thoughts come to mind when you think about maintaining your motivation?

User: I often think, what if I can’t keep this up? What if I go back to feeling anxious and unmotivated like before?

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite overwhelming. It’s easy to fall into that pattern of negative thinking. Have you noticed how those thoughts affect your emotions when they arise?

User: Yes, they definitely make me feel uneasy and sometimes a bit frustrated. I don’t want to go back to feeling anxious, especially after experiencing this improvement.

Consultant: Absolutely, it makes sense that you want to protect your progress. Let’s try to challenge those thoughts—do you have any evidence that suggests you will go back to feeling anxious and unmotivated?

User: Not really. I guess I’ve been doing well lately, and I have support from friends and teachers. But I still worry a lot about it.

Consultant: It’s great you can see the support around you! Maybe we can aim to develop strategies that reinforce your current progress. How would you feel about creating a plan to celebrate small achievements moving forward?

User: That sounds like a good idea! I enjoy celebrating my wins, no matter how small they are. It helps remind me of my progress.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! Focusing on and acknowledging small wins can really help maintain your motivation. What are some small achievements you could look forward to this week?

User: I want to finish a certain number of chapters in my textbook this week. I also have an assignment due, so completing that would be a good milestone.

Consultant: Those sound like very attainable goals, Zhang Wei! How about we outline a simple plan to help you achieve those? Breaking it down into smaller tasks can make it feel less daunting.

User: That makes sense. I could set aside a few hours each day to work on those assignments and chapters. Maybe I can also reward myself with a small treat after I complete them.

Consultant: That's an excellent approach! Rewards can serve as great motivators. What kind of treat do you have in mind?

User: Maybe a nice coffee or a movie night with friends. It would make the effort feel worthwhile!

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful rewards! Let’s also think about how you’ll deal with any anxiety that might come up while working on your tasks. What techniques have been helpful for you in the past?

User: I found that deep breathing techniques helped me calm down. Also, taking short breaks during study sessions keeps me from getting overwhelmed.

Consultant: Perfect! Incorporating those techniques into your plan is a strong strategy. You can use them whenever you start to feel anxious. How does that feel for you?

User: It feels reassuring to have a plan. I think having these techniques ready will help when I do feel anxious.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s okay to have ups and downs. How do you feel about the strategies we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel more prepared and optimistic about the future. I appreciate having a plan and ways to manage my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It seems like you’re ready to maintain your progress and keep growing. As we wrap up our session, what would you say is your biggest takeaway today?

User: My biggest takeaway is that I can celebrate my achievements, no matter how small, and use my coping strategies whenever I feel anxious.

Consultant: Absolutely, Zhang Wei! Those are powerful lessons to carry forward. If you feel those fears creeping in again, just remember how far you’ve come. This has been a productive session. I believe in your ability to keep growing!

User: Thank you so much! I’ll definitely keep that in mind. I appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Remember, you can always return if you need support in the future. Take care, and I wish you all the best with your studies and goals!
