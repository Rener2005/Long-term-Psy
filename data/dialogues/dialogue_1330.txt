Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! I'm glad you could join me today. Let’s start by discussing how you’ve been feeling recently. Can you share what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious because of what happened in my last English class. The teacher asked me a question, and I felt really embarrassed. Now, I can't handle being in that kind of classroom environment anymore. 

Consultant: It sounds like that experience in class was quite overwhelming for you. Can you tell me more about how that situation made you feel in the moment and afterward?

User: During the class, I felt like everyone was staring at me, and my heart was racing. Afterward, I just felt so small and embarrassed. I keep thinking that I’m not as good as the other students.

Consultant: I hear you—that must have been a tough moment. It's understandable to feel that way, especially if you compare yourself to others. What do you think those thoughts about not being good enough stem from?

User: I guess I’ve always been shy and not very confident. It just feels worse in class because I worry about what others think of me.

Consultant: Your shyness and worries about judgment can contribute to those feelings of self-doubt. Let’s explore this a bit more: when you think about yourself in those situations, what specific thoughts pop into your mind?

User: I often think things like, "I’ll mess up" or "They’ll laugh at me." It makes me feel really anxious and makes me want to avoid speaking up in class.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound pretty harsh. They can definitely enhance your anxiety. What emotion do you experience when you have these thoughts—beyond just anxiety?

User: I also feel really sad and frustrated with myself, like I should be better at this.

Consultant: That sadness and frustration can make it even harder to speak in class. Let’s challenge some of these negative beliefs together. Can you think of any evidence that contradicts the idea that you’ll mess up or that others will laugh at you?

User: Well, I did answer a question correctly last month, and nobody laughed then. But it feels different every time I think about speaking again.

Consultant: That’s a great observation! Remembering a time when you succeeded can help. What would you say to a friend who felt the same way as you do now?

User: I’d probably tell them to relax and focus on what they know instead of worrying about others.

Consultant: That’s kind advice! It reflects the perspective we can adopt. What if we tried to apply that same advice to you? How might it change your experience in class?

User: I guess it would help if I could focus more on my own thoughts and less on everyone else. But it’s hard to do that when I’m in the moment.

Consultant: It is challenging, but we can work on strategies together. Have you tried any techniques to help calm yourself before or during class?

User: Not really. I usually just sit there feeling anxious until something happens.

Consultant: How about we explore some calming techniques you could use, even practicing deep breathing or self-encouragement phrases before class? Would you be open to trying that?

User: Yes, I can try deep breathing. I've heard it's helpful. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic choice! Breathing exercises can help ground you. Let’s also think about gradual exposure—could you set small goals for participating in class? 

User: Maybe I could start by raising my hand just once per class, even if it’s just to agree with someone.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! A small step can build your confidence over time. Let’s set a goal for the next session. Would you be comfortable trying that in your next class and reflecting on how it goes? 

User: Yes, I think that would be manageable. I’ll do my best to raise my hand.

Consultant: Great! When we meet again, we can talk about how that went and any feelings that came up. It’s important to acknowledge your progress. 

User: I will definitely keep that in mind. 

Consultant: As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect a bit. What have you learned about your anxiety and how you can handle it better?

User: I’ve realized that my thoughts are really negative and don’t help. I can try to challenge them and remember the times I’ve done well. I also learned that I can use breathing exercises.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight, and I’m glad you’re open to trying new strategies! Remember, it’s okay to feel anxious, but you have the tools to manage it. 

User: Thank you. I feel a bit more hopeful about facing my classes now.

Consultant: I'm really proud of you for taking these steps. Remember, these skills will take time to develop, and it’s perfectly fine to have ups and downs. 

User: I appreciate your support. I’ll work on everything we discussed.

Consultant: Of course, Xiaozhang! I’m here for you, and I believe in your ability to navigate these challenges. Looking forward to hearing about your progress next time! 

User: Thank you very much! See you next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for today’s session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. I'm still struggling a lot with my anxiety about attending classes. I thought I could handle it, but I still feel terrified when I think about going back.

Consultant: It sounds really challenging for you. You’ve been putting in effort, but the fear of class is still holding you back. Can you share more about what specifically makes you feel anxious about the classroom environment?

User: I just feel like everyone is watching me, judging me. What if I make a mistake? It’s like I can’t breathe when I think about raising my hand or asking a question.

Consultant: That sounds really overwhelming, feeling like all eyes are on you. It's understandable that such thoughts would increase your anxiety. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come to mind when you're in those situations?

User: Yes, I often think, “I’ll embarrass myself,” or “I won’t understand anything.” Those thoughts just spiral out of control and make everything worse.

Consultant: Those kinds of thoughts can be very powerful. Let’s explore them a bit. How do those thoughts affect your feelings and actions when you’re considering going to class?

User: They make me feel hopeless and really anxious, so I usually end up just skipping class. I keep thinking I should go, but the fear is just too strong.

Consultant: Skipping class sounds like a way to cope with the intense fear you’re feeling. How has this pattern affected your academic progress and your feelings of self-worth?

User: I feel guilty afterward for missing class, but I can’t bear the thought of going. It’s just a cycle that I can’t seem to break.

Consultant: It’s a tough cycle to be in, feeling trapped between your fear and the regret of not attending. Let’s try to identify any positive or alternative thoughts that could help lessen that fear. What would you say to a friend who felt this way about attending class?

User: I guess I would tell them that it’s okay to be nervous and that everyone makes mistakes. But I don’t seem to believe that advice myself.

Consultant: That’s an important insight! Recognizing that your own judgments might be harsher than what you would tell a friend can help. What if we practiced a different way of thinking when those anxious thoughts arise? For example, reminding yourself that it’s okay to feel nervous and that mistakes are part of learning.

User: I think that might help, but it still feels hard to believe when I'm actually in class.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way initially. Change takes time. As part of the process, we can try gradual exposure to that environment to help ease into it. What small steps could we take to help you feel more comfortable with attending class?

User: Maybe I could start by just visiting the classroom without going to class, just to see it again.

Consultant: That sounds like a great first step! Just going to the classroom can help desensitize you to the environment. Would you feel comfortable setting a goal to do that this week?

User: Yes, I think I could do that. Just standing outside might help a little.

Consultant: Perfect! While you’re there, it might also be helpful to practice some breathing exercises to manage your anxiety. How do you feel about preparing some strategies for when those anxious feelings come up?

User: That sounds good! I can definitely try some breathing techniques.

Consultant: Great! Let’s plan to incorporate that as you gradually expose yourself to the classroom. Afterward, we can reflect on your experience and how you felt. Remember, this is a process, and every small step counts. 

User: I really appreciate that, it feels more manageable when I break it down like that.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As you reflect on your experiences, recognizing any progress, no matter how small, can help reinforce positive feelings towards attending class. How have you felt about our discussions so far?

User: I feel like I have more clarity on my feelings. It's a bit validating to talk about these things.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Validation is an important step in understanding your emotions. As we continue, let’s think about how we can build on this clarity. What strategies do you think could be useful in reflecting on your classroom experience?

User: I could keep a journal after I visit the classroom. Writing down how I felt and what I observed might help me see things more clearly.

Consultant: Journaling is an excellent idea! It can help you track your thoughts and emotions over time. Would you like to set a specific time for this journaling practice after your visit?

User: I could do it right after I get home from the classroom visit.

Consultant: That gives you an opportunity to capture your feelings while they're still fresh. Let’s also plan to revisit our strategies during our next meeting and discuss any insights you've gained. 

User: I’m looking forward to that! I hope I notice some progress.

Consultant: You’re already making progress by recognizing your feelings and planning actionable steps. Remember, it’s all about taking things one step at a time. Before we wrap up today, is there anything else on your mind that you want to address?

User: Just that I feel more hopeful now than I did before. Thank you for that!

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! Feeling hopeful is a great place to be. As we conclude today, remember you have tools to cope with your anxiety, and I'm here to support you. If any challenges arise before our next meeting, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: I will. Thank you so much for your help today!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your classroom visit during our next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! It's great to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hello! I've been trying to push myself to attend classes. I managed to go a few times, but I still feel very anxious when I’m there. It’s frustrating.

Consultant: I can understand that pushing yourself to attend class is a big step. It sounds like the anxiety is still quite strong for you. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel anxious when you're in class?

User: I feel like everyone is watching me. I worry about making mistakes or not being able to answer questions. It's embarrassing.

Consultant: It sounds like you feel very self-conscious, which is completely normal in a classroom setting. Let's explore those feelings a bit more. What thoughts go through your mind when you’re afraid of being judged by your classmates?

User: I think that if I say something wrong, everyone will laugh at me. It makes me feel really small and scared.

Consultant: That’s a tough thought to carry with you. It's important to challenge that belief. Is there any evidence that supports the idea that your classmates would laugh at you if you made a mistake? 

User: I don't know... It’s just something I feel. I guess I haven’t really seen anyone laugh at someone else, but I still think it.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when anxiety is involved. Since you haven't actually witnessed anyone laughing, perhaps we can think of some alternative perspectives. If a friend was in your shoes, how would you encourage them to view the situation?

User: I would tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay. I guess I’m harder on myself than I am on others.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization, Xiaozhang. Being aware of the difference in how we treat ourselves versus how we treat others can be the first step in changing our thought patterns. What would it look like for you to be as kind to yourself as you would be to a friend in class?

User: I think I would try to remind myself that making mistakes is part of learning. Maybe I could focus on what I did right instead of what I did wrong.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Focusing on positives can help shift your mindset. Let’s try to incorporate that idea into your classroom experience. When you leave class, could you start keeping a small journal of things you felt went well? 

User: That sounds like a good idea! I think I could write down at least one positive thing from each class.

Consultant: Perfect! This practice could help reinforce those positive feelings and experiences. Let's build on this. How about trying to challenge yourself with a simple self-report in class? For instance, raise your hand once to share something during a lesson. How does that sound?

User: That’s a bit scary, but I think I can try. It might help me feel more involved.

Consultant: Yes, trying something small can make a big difference. Remember, each step you take counts. We can also explore how to calm your nerves before doing this. What might help you feel more relaxed heading into class?

User: I could try deep breathing exercises before class. I’ve heard that helps.

Consultant: Absolutely! Deep breathing is a great tool. We can practice some techniques together now if you'd like. This can prepare you for feeling calmer during class.

User: Yes, I’d like that. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in together... hold it for a moment... and breathe out slowly. Repeat this a few times, focusing on the sensation of your breath. How are you feeling?

User: A bit more relaxed, actually. It helps to focus on my breathing.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Incorporating that technique before class could really help calm your anxiety. As we wrap up today, what have you found most beneficial from our discussion?

User: I think identifying my negative thoughts and working on replacing them with positive ones feels useful. And trying to write about good things each day seems encouraging.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! By focusing on the positives, you’re creating a safe space for yourself. Let’s set a goal for the next session to see how your experience goes with your self-report and journaling.

User: Okay! I will definitely try those.

Consultant: I believe in you, Xiaozhang. Remember that this is a process, and each small step is significant. I'm excited to hear about your experiences next time. If you have any struggles, it's okay to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to our next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! It's great to see you today. I remember how we discussed your improvements in interacting with classmates and feeling a bit more comfortable outside of class. How have you been feeling about your classroom interactions lately?

User: Hi! I've been doing a bit better in group study sessions, but when I enter larger classes, I still feel anxious. It's like a knot in my stomach that makes it hard to focus.

Consultant: I understand. That knot of anxiety can be really uncomfortable, especially in larger settings. Let's explore that feeling a bit more. Can you tell me what thoughts come to your mind during those larger classes that might contribute to your anxiety?

User: Well, I often think that everyone is watching me, and if I say something wrong, they will judge me. It makes me really hesitant to participate.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It seems like you're feeling a lot of pressure to perform perfectly. Can you share how that thought of being judged makes you feel in the moment?

User: It makes me feel really small and embarrassed. I just want to disappear sometimes instead of speaking up.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable, Xiaozhang. Feeling that way can be quite isolating. Let’s talk about ways to challenge that thought of being judged. What evidence is there for and against this idea that everyone is watching and critiquing you?

User: I guess not everyone is actually focused on me. They have their own concerns, right? 

Consultant: Exactly! It's natural for people to be wrapped up in their own thoughts. What might it feel like to remind yourself of this the next time you’re in a larger class?

User: I think it could help to remember that. Maybe I won't feel so pressured to perform.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive shift! How about we think about some small steps you can take to gradually boost your confidence in those larger class settings? 

User: Like what kind of steps?

Consultant: For starters, how about setting a goal to ask a question or share a thought at least once in your next large class? You could tell yourself, "Even if I fumble, it’s okay to express my thoughts." How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds manageable. I think if I focus on just speaking once, it might not feel so overwhelming.

Consultant: That's a great approach! Taking it one step at a time can really help reduce that feeling of being overwhelmed. How do you think you'd feel after achieving that goal in class?

User: I might feel proud that I did it, even if it was just once.

Consultant: Absolutely! That sense of accomplishment can build momentum. What are some ways we could prepare for that moment so it feels less daunting?

User: Maybe practicing what I want to say beforehand could help? Just to feel more confident.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Preparing some thoughts in advance can definitely ease anxiety. Would you like to practice a specific question or comment together right now?

User: Sure! That might make me feel more ready.

Consultant: Great! Let’s say the topic of discussion is something you’re familiar with. What’s something you could contribute?

User: I could mention some information from an article I read relevant to the topic.

Consultant: Perfect! How about we frame that as your contribution? You might start with, "I read an article about this topic recently, and it mentioned..." Then, pause to gauge the reaction.

User: I like that! It gives me a structure to follow.

Consultant: I'm glad you found it helpful! How do you think you would feel after giving that contribution in class?

User: I think it would boost my confidence a bit, knowing I prepared for it.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful outlook! Preparing can help shift your focus from anxiety to anticipation. Let’s plan to check in on how that goes after your next class. How does that sound?

User: Sounds great! I feel more optimistic about it now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiaozhang. Remember, it’s all about those small wins. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what you feel you’ve gained from this session.

User: I feel like I have some concrete steps to take now, and it’s nice to know I’m not alone in this.

Consultant: You’re definitely not alone! Plus, with each small step, you’re building your confidence. What strategies will you take with you into your next class?

User: I’ll remember to focus on that anxiety and remind myself people are focused on their own thoughts. And I will prepare something to say.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I can’t wait to hear how it goes in our next session. Until then, remember to give yourself credit for trying.

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaozhang! I’m proud of the progress you’re making. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hi Xiaozhang! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially after your successful participation in the small discussion?

User: Hi! I felt quite happy after that session. Participating in the small discussion boosted my confidence a bit, but I still get so anxious when I think about speaking in front of the whole class. 

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that you felt happier! It sounds like your experience in the small group was positive. Can you tell me a bit more about how your confidence changes when you think about speaking in the larger class?

User: Well, in the small group, I felt more comfortable because it was a safe space. But when I think of the big class, my heart races, and I can't seem to gather my thoughts. I worry about being judged or making a mistake in front of everyone.

Consultant: I completely understand. It’s common to feel more at ease in smaller settings but anxious in larger ones. Let’s explore that feeling a bit more. What specific thoughts run through your mind when you predict speaking in front of the class?

User: I keep thinking, “What if I mess up?” or “What if nobody cares what I say?” These thoughts just make me panicky.

Consultant: Those are challenging thoughts you’re experiencing. It sounds like they contribute significantly to your anxiety. Let’s try to identify the emotions tied to those thoughts. How do these thoughts make you feel physically and emotionally?

User: Physically, I get really tense, and emotionally, I feel embarrassed and frustrated. It's like I want to disappear when I think about speaking up.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. Feeling that way can be quite overwhelming. Now, let’s work on challenging those negative thoughts. How much evidence do you think supports the idea that you would mess up if you spoke in class?

User: I guess I can’t really think of any solid evidence. I’ve never actually messed up when I’ve tried speaking before…it’s just my mind jumping to the worst-case scenarios.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! It seems like your mind may be exaggerating the potential outcomes. If a friend were in your position, what advice would you give them to overcome those fears?

User: I would probably tell them to just breathe and focus on what they want to say, not on what others might think. It seems easier when I think of it that way.

Consultant: That’s wonderful advice! Now, how might you apply that same perspective to yourself? What if you focused on the message you want to share instead of worrying about the response from others?

User: I think that would help a lot. If I focus on sharing my thoughts, maybe I won’t get so overwhelmed. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Shifting your focus can make a significant difference. Let’s also think about small steps you could take to ease into participating in the larger class. What small actions might you consider to help build your confidence gradually?

User: Maybe I could practice speaking out loud at home or raise my hand for simple questions first before tackling something bigger.

Consultant: Those are excellent steps! Practicing at home can certainly help, and starting with simple questions can make it easier to build your confidence in class. How does that plan sound to you?

User: It sounds manageable! I really like the idea of starting small. 

Consultant: Great! As you work on this, it’s essential to keep track of your feelings and remind yourself of your successes, even the small ones. How can you remind yourself of the positive experiences when you feel anxious?

User: I might keep a journal where I can write about my experiences and how I felt during discussions, even the small successes.

Consultant: A journal is a fantastic idea! It can serve as a reminder of your progress and help combat those negative thoughts. As we move forward, what key takeaways do you feel are most beneficial for you from our discussion today?

User: I think the biggest takeaways are that I need to challenge my negative thoughts, focus on sharing my ideas, and celebrate the small wins in my journey. 

Consultant: That’s exactly right! By actively recognizing and altering those negative thoughts, you're taking steps toward greater confidence. How are you feeling about the next class after this conversation?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful and excited about trying out my plan. I definitely feel more empowered to face my anxiety now.

Consultant: That's amazing to hear! As we wrap up, let’s talk about how you can maintain your progress. What strategies can you use to prevent falling back into old thought patterns during challenging situations?

User: I could set up reminders in my journal and practice those small steps. Plus, I can reach out to friends who support me, to keep me motivated.

Consultant: Those sound like strong strategies! It’s essential to have support and reminders as you navigate these challenges. 

User: Thank you so much for your help today! I feel really grateful for the guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaozhang! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Remember, you have the ability to continue growing and improving. Don't hesitate to return if you need further support. Take care, and keep believing in yourself!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I feel like I’ve made some progress. My fear of classes has lessened a lot, and I've been able to participate more in discussions. But I still feel a bit nervous sometimes.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear that you've made progress! It’s completely normal to still feel some nerves. Can you share a recent experience where you felt anxious in class? 

User: Sure, there was a group presentation last week. I was nervous at first, but I actually managed to present part of it. Afterward, I was relieved and proud but also a bit anxious about how I did.

Consultant: It sounds like you handled the presentation courageously, which is a big step! How did you cope with that anxiety before and during the presentation? 

User: I tried to take deep breaths and remind myself that it would be okay. I think thinking positively helped a lot.

Consultant: That's a great technique—positive thinking can indeed make a difference. Let’s reflect on what you’ve learned during our time together. What do you think has been the most effective strategy for you in overcoming classroom anxiety? 

User: I think the breathing exercises and visualizing success were really helpful. They made me feel more in control.

Consultant: It’s good to recognize what works for you! Now that you’ve experienced success, how do you imagine applying these techniques in the future? 

User: I want to keep using the breathing exercises before classes and remind myself of the positive experiences I’ve had so far. I think I can also try to speak up more in smaller groups to build my confidence.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals, Xiaozhang! Gradually increasing your participation in smaller groups will help reinforce your confidence. How about we set a few specific goals for your next steps? 

User: Sure! Maybe I can aim to contribute at least once in each group discussion I have next week. 

Consultant: That sounds like a manageable goal! Let’s also think about tracking your progress. How do you feel about keeping a journal where you can note down your experiences in class and reflect on how you feel afterwards? 

User: I think that could be really helpful. Writing down my feelings might make me more aware of my progress.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflection can be very insightful. As you continue this journey, remember to celebrate your small victories. What might you do to celebrate when you achieve your goal of participating in group discussions? 

User: Maybe I could treat myself to something nice, like a coffee after class or a small gift to myself!

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Treating yourself reinforces positive behavior. As we near the conclusion of our sessions together, how do you feel about the progress you've made overall? 

User: It feels really good. I’ve noticed a clear change in how I approach my classes, and I’m feeling more confident.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’ve shown great courage and determination throughout our sessions. As we wrap up today, let's summarize your strengths and the strategies you've learned. 

User: I feel stronger in managing my anxiety, and I’ve developed tools like breathing exercises and positive affirmations.

Consultant: Precisely! Remember these tools as you move forward. For future challenges, what have you learned about how to manage your feelings? 

User: If I encounter anxiety, I can rely on my coping strategies and also reflect on my successes to keep my confidence up.

Consultant: Exactly. And as you continue to monitor your progress, it’s important to recognize both your achievements and any areas that need improvement. You have the tools now to maintain your growth. 

User: Thank you! This has been really helpful. I feel much better prepared to face my challenges.

Consultant: I'm so proud of you, Xiaozhang. You've made significant strides, and I believe you’ll continue to thrive. Remember, if you ever need support, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate everything you’ve done. 

Consultant: It’s been a pleasure working with you. Take care and keep believing in yourself! Good luck with everything! 

User: Thanks! I will keep practicing what I learned! Goodbye!
