Consultant: Hi Daniel! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit anxious sometimes, but I've been doing better at school. My behavior has improved, and my mom and I are getting along well.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive change! It's good to hear about the improvements in your school behavior and your relationship with your mom. Can you tell me more about the times when you feel anxious lately?

User: Well, sometimes when I'm in class, I worry that I won't understand the lessons. I feel like everyone is watching me, and it makes me nervous.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like being in class can create some worries for you. What kind of thoughts go through your mind when you feel like everyone is watching you?

User: I think they might laugh at me if I get something wrong, or that I'll be the only one who doesn’t understand.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Daniel. Those thoughts can certainly increase your anxiety. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell him about those worries?

User: I guess I would say it's okay to make mistakes and that everyone struggles sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective! It shows you understand that everyone has challenges. Let's explore how we can use that understanding to help you feel more confident in class. What would it look like for you to feel less anxious and engage more during the lessons?

User: I think if I felt more prepared and believed I could answer questions without worrying, it would help a lot.

Consultant: Preparation can definitely boost your confidence. We can create a strategy to help you feel more prepared. How do you currently get ready for your classes?

User: I usually do my homework and try to pay attention, but sometimes I forget what I've learned when I'm in class.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel that way sometimes. Would it help if we discuss some ways to reinforce your learning so that you feel more secure when you’re in class?

User: Yes, that would be great. I think it would help to have some reminders or techniques I can use.

Consultant: Perfect! We can work on some simple techniques, like summarizing what you learned at home before class or writing down key points to remember during the lesson. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds useful! I think it could help me feel more confident.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Additionally, let’s address those thoughts about being watched. We can practice some calming techniques together. Would you like to try that?

User: Yes, I'd like to try! I want to see if it helps.

Consultant: Great! One technique we can practice is deep breathing. When you feel anxious, taking deep breaths can help you calm down. Let's try it together now—take a deep breath in… and out… That’s it! How does that feel?

User: It feels a little relaxing. I think I could do that more often.

Consultant: Excellent! With practice, deep breathing can really help. Let’s also talk about how you can challenge those negative thoughts when they come up. Can you think of a situation where you had those worries, and how you might respond differently next time?

User: Maybe when I raise my hand to answer a question, I could tell myself that it’s okay if I don’t get it right the first time.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful reframe! Reminding yourself that it’s okay to make mistakes can be very empowering. It promotes a growth mindset. Are there any new activities or social situations coming up that you’re feeling nervous about?

User: There’s a group project next week that I’m a bit worried about. I’m not sure how to work with others.

Consultant: Group projects can sometimes feel daunting. How about we brainstorm some ways for you to communicate effectively with your group? What ideas do you have about how to contribute?

User: I think I could suggest roles for everyone and maybe help organize the work.

Consultant: That’s a great idea, Daniel! Taking on a leadership role can help you feel more in control. How do you think you’d feel about talking to your group about your ideas?

User: I think it might be okay if I prepare what I want to say beforehand. 

Consultant: Preparing is a strong strategy! Practicing what you want to say can help reduce anxiety. How about we set a goal for you to prepare for this project over the next few days and share how it goes in our next session?

User: That sounds like a good plan! I hope it goes well.

Consultant: I'm confident you can do it! Just remember to use your breathing techniques if you feel anxious. Before we finish today, let’s recap what we’ve discussed. What are the key steps you’ll take moving forward?

User: I'll practice deep breathing, prepare for class by summarizing what I learn, and get ready for the group project by planning out my contributions.

Consultant: Those are fantastic steps! You’re making great progress toward increasing your confidence. Remember, it’s okay to feel a little nervous, and you have the skills to manage that anxiety. I look forward to hearing how your efforts go next time!

User: Thanks! I feel more hopeful now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Daniel! Keep up the positive work, and I’ll see you next time. Remember, you’re capable of facing these challenges!

Consultant: Hello Daniel! I'm really glad to see you today. It sounds like you've been doing some great things! Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling recently?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good overall. I participated in some extracurricular activities at school, and my teachers praised me for my efforts. But I still feel a bit anxious when interacting with new people.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear about your achievements! It's completely normal to feel a bit anxious in new social situations. What do you think contributes to that anxiety when you meet new people?

User: I guess I'm afraid of saying something wrong or that they won't like me. Sometimes, I just freeze and don't know what to say.

Consultant: It makes sense that you'd have those worries. Many people feel that way in new interactions. Can you share a specific moment where you felt this way recently? What thoughts were going through your mind at that time?

User: Well, I remember during a group project, I felt really nervous. I thought everyone would think I was stupid if I made a mistake, and that made me not want to speak up.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Daniel. It sounds like you were really holding yourself back because of those thoughts. What do you think about that belief—that others would think negatively of you if you made a mistake? Is it possible that they might be more understanding?

User: Maybe. I guess I don't really know how they would react. I just focus on the worst-case scenario.

Consultant: That’s a common tendency, to think of the worst-case scenario. Can we try looking at your thoughts differently? What evidence do you have that supports that they would think negatively of you?

User: I don't really have any evidence, it’s just how I feel. I think I just expect the worst.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel that way, but it’s also important to challenge those thoughts. If a friend felt the same way, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably say they shouldn’t worry too much and that everyone makes mistakes.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you have a compassionate approach when it comes to others. Now, let's see if we can apply that same understanding to yourself. What if you allowed yourself to make mistakes? How do you think that could change your experiences in social situations?

User: Well, I suppose I'd feel a bit more relaxed. If I could see it as part of learning, it might not feel so scary.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Embracing mistakes as part of the learning process can really help reduce pressure. Let’s practice a bit—imagine you’re in a social situation and make a small mistake. What would you say to yourself to stay calm and positive?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to mess up, and maybe even laugh about it.

Consultant: Fantastic! That’s a healthy way to cope. How about we role-play a scenario where you meet someone new? This could be a helpful way to practice handling those feelings.

User: Sure, I’d like to try that. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s pretend we’re meeting for the first time at school. I’ll be the new student. Remember, no pressure—just practice. 

User: Okay. Hi there!

Consultant: Hi! I'm new here. What do you like about this school?

User: I like the extracurricular activities we have. I recently joined the soccer team.

Consultant: That sounds exciting! I’d love to hear more about it. How long have you been playing?

User: Um, just a few weeks. I’m still learning though.

Consultant: That’s perfectly fine! Everyone has to start somewhere. How are you finding it so far?

User: It’s fun, but I still get nervous when playing in front of others.

Consultant: Nervousness is understandable. How do you think you could remind yourself of that kindness towards yourself in those moments, just like you did during our role-play?

User: I could take a deep breath and remind myself it's okay to be nervous sometimes.

Consultant: Absolutely! Deep breaths can help calm those nerves. After this practice, how do you feel about your social skills?

User: I feel a bit more confident. It feels good to know that I can try to be kinder to myself.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! Remember, practice is key. Any upcoming events or situations where you'd like to apply these skills? 

User: There’s a school event next week. I could try some of these tips there.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! How will you remind yourself to be kind to yourself during that event?

User: I’ll make a plan to take deep breaths if I start feeling anxious, and remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Daniel. As we wrap up today, let’s recap what you’ve learned. What do you see as your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I think it’s that being kind to myself can help a lot. I can try to see mistakes as learning moments.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve made some excellent progress. Remember that you can always come back if you need more support. You’ve got this! 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Daniel! I’m proud of what you’ve accomplished, and I look forward to hearing how the event goes. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Daniel! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since the speech contest at school?

User: Hi! I feel proud that I completed the speech, but I still get really nervous thinking about being in front of others again.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you felt proud after your presentation. That’s a significant achievement! Let's talk about that nervous feeling. What do you think makes you feel nervous when you're in front of others?

User: I guess I worry that I might mess up or that people will judge me.

Consultant: Those thoughts are completely normal. Many people feel that way. It sounds like you’re concerned about being evaluated. What kind of thoughts go through your mind when you're about to speak or perform in front of a group?

User: I often think things like "What if I forget what I'm supposed to say?" or "What if they don't like what I say?"

Consultant: Those thoughts seem to create a lot of pressure. When those thoughts occur, how do you feel in your body? 

User: My heart races, and I feel like I can't breathe properly. Sometimes my hands get all sweaty too.

Consultant: That sounds really uncomfortable. Those physical sensations can certainly add to your anxiety. Let’s explore some techniques that could help manage those feelings when they arise. Have you ever tried deep breathing exercises?

User: No, I haven’t. What is that?

Consultant: Deep breathing is a simple technique where you focus on taking slow, deep breaths. It can help calm your body and mind. Would you like to try a short breathing exercise together?

User: Sure, I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start. Take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four... (pauses) Now hold that breath for a count of four... (pauses) and now breathe out slowly through your mouth for a count of six. How does that feel?

User: It feels a little better. I think I can breathe more easily now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Practicing deep breathing can make a big difference, especially before speaking. How do you think you might use this technique in the future when you start to feel nervous?

User: Maybe I can take a few deep breaths before I speak, just to calm myself down.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! It’s important to find moments to pause and breathe. Is there any other situation where you feel similar tension that we can discuss?

User: Sometimes I feel anxious when I have to join in group activities or games at school.

Consultant: That’s quite common as well. It’s understandable to feel nervous joining in. What thoughts go through your mind when faced with group activities?

User: I think about how I might not fit in or feel left out.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a fear of not being accepted. Let’s examine those thoughts. What evidence do you have that you won’t fit in?

User: I don’t really know... I guess I just assume it because it has happened before.

Consultant: That makes sense. Past experiences can influence how we feel. So, in those past situations where you felt left out, is it possible that there were moments where you felt included or welcomed too?

User: Sometimes, yes. There were times when my friends invited me to join.

Consultant: It’s important to remember those positive experiences. Everyone has moments when they feel out of place, but it doesn't define the whole situation. Would you be open to reminding yourself of those invitations in the future?

User: Yeah, I think that would help me feel better.

Consultant: Fantastic! Each time you remember a positive experience, it might help lessen the intensity of the anxious thoughts. How do you feel about trying to participate more in group activities moving forward, focusing on those positive experiences?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful thinking about it.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Daniel. Cultivating hope is a vital part of building confidence. As you continue to practice these techniques, how would you describe your overall willingness to participate in activities now compared to before today?

User: I think I’m more willing to try being part of things, even if I still feel nervous.

Consultant: That’s a huge step forward! Acknowledging your feelings while still being willing to step out of your comfort zone is so important. Let’s make a plan together for how you can start to approach these situations. What’s one small step you can take this week?

User: Maybe I can try to join a new club or a group activity where I can meet different kids.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Joining a club can be a fantastic way to meet new friends and practice those skills. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel excited but a bit scared too.

Consultant: Feeling excited and scared at the same time is completely normal! Just remember, it's okay to feel that way. You can use the deep breathing technique whenever you feel those nerves. I'm proud of you for taking this step. Do you think you’re ready for our next session together?

User: Yes, I think I’d like to come back and share how it goes!

Consultant: I look forward to hearing about it! Remember, each small step counts. You’ve made great progress today, and I'm confident in your abilities. Until next time, take care!

User: Thank you! I will!

Consultant: Hi Daniel! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since the summer camp? 

User: Hi! I think I've been doing better. I made some new friends, and it felt nice to be part of a group. But sometimes, I still find it a bit hard to join in conversations.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like you enjoyed making new friends, which is a positive step. Can you tell me more about what it's like for you when you feel hesitant to join conversations?

User: Well, sometimes I worry that I might say something silly or that they won't want to talk to me. So, I just stay quiet instead.

Consultant: I understand. It can be tough to put ourselves out there, especially when we fear how others might respond. What do you think would happen if you did speak up in those moments?

User: I guess I’d feel a bit scared but maybe also relieved if they responded positively. I want to be more confident in talking to people.

Consultant: It's normal to feel scared, but it’s wonderful that you want to be more confident. Let's think about a specific situation—can you recall a moment at the camp where you felt like joining the conversation, but didn’t?

User: Yes, there was a time when a group was talking about a game I really like, but I didn't say anything. I just listened.

Consultant: That sounds like a missed opportunity to share something you enjoy. What do you think could help you feel more comfortable in similar situations next time?

User: Maybe I could practice what to say before? Or just remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: Those are great ideas! Practicing what you want to say can build your confidence. And yes, reminding yourself that everyone makes mistakes helps ease the pressure. How about we set a small goal for the next time you’re in a group setting?

User: Sure! Maybe I can try to say at least one thing about the game next time.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Just one comment can be a big step. How do you feel about setting that goal?

User: I feel good! It sounds manageable. I just hope it works out.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel a little unsure, but remember, every little step counts. If you don't achieve it perfectly, that's okay—just keep trying! What can you do to remind yourself of this goal when you're with others?

User: Maybe I can write it down and keep it with me, or think about it before I join in.

Consultant: Writing it down is a fantastic strategy! It can help you stay focused on your goal and boost your confidence. What do you think your next steps will be after today's session to prepare for your goal?

User: I think I’ll write it down as soon as I get home, and maybe even practice saying it out loud a few times.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Practicing out loud can really help. Do you feel more excited now about participating in conversations?

User: Yes, I do! I feel like I have a plan.

Consultant: That's excellent to hear! Having a plan can make a significant difference. As we wrap up, let's discuss how you felt about our conversation today and what you think your takeaway should be.

User: I feel like I understand myself better now, and I have some good ideas for moving forward.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s important to recognize your progress and strengths. We’ll keep building on these strategies. Before our next session, keep reflecting on your experiences, and remember to be patient with yourself.

User: Thank you! I’ll do my best.

Consultant: You're welcome, Daniel! I believe you can do this. Remember, reaching out and participating is a journey. If you ever feel stuck, just know that you can always come back and talk about it. Looking forward to our next session.

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to it too!

Consultant: Hello, Daniel! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good. Winning that award for my project really boosted my confidence. I’m excited about it!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like that experience has made a positive impact on your self-esteem. What specific things do you think contributed to that boost in confidence?

User: Well, I guess it made me realize that I can do things well when I just focus and put in the effort. It felt great to be recognized for it!

Consultant: Recognition can be incredibly motivating. It's great that you see the connection between your effort and positive outcomes. Are there other areas in your life where you'd like to build on that confidence?

User: Yeah, I want to do better in class too. Sometimes I still feel nervous talking to my classmates or teachers.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel nervous in those situations. Let’s explore how you can apply the confidence you gained from your project to your classroom interactions. What do you think would help you feel more comfortable speaking up in class?

User: Maybe I could practice speaking more at home or find opportunities to answer questions in a smaller group first.

Consultant: Practicing at home is a great idea! It can help you prepare and feel less anxious. What kind of environment would you feel most comfortable practicing in?

User: I think practicing with my mom would be nice. She usually helps me feel calm.

Consultant: Having a supportive person like your mom can make a big difference. How about setting a small goal for this week related to speaking up in class and practicing with her?

User: That sounds good! I could aim to speak at least once in class this week and practice at home beforehand.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, Daniel. Speaking once in class is a great start. How would you feel if you achieved that goal?

User: I’d feel really proud of myself! I guess it would show that I’m improving.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s important to acknowledge those achievements, no matter how small. Let's also think about how you can maintain this positive momentum. What are some daily habits you could incorporate to keep building your self-confidence?

User: I could remind myself of what I did well in the project and maybe write down what I want to achieve each day.

Consultant: Writing down your successes and goals can be a powerful reminder of your capabilities. How about setting a specific time each day to reflect on your progress?

User: I could do that! Maybe in the evening, when I’m winding down.

Consultant: Perfect! This time can help you review your achievements and plan for the next day. What else could you include in this routine to reinforce your confidence?

User: I could also practice visualization. Like imagining myself speaking confidently in class.

Consultant: Visualization is a great technique! It can help prepare your mind for success. How would you feel doing that each evening?

User: I think it would help me relax and feel more ready.

Consultant: Exactly! Relaxation and preparation are key. It’s also important to notice any negative thoughts that may arise about speaking up. If those thoughts appear, how might you challenge them?

User: I’d remind myself of my successes and that everyone makes mistakes. It’s okay if I don’t get everything perfect.

Consultant: That’s a healthy way to approach it, Daniel! Remembering that everyone has ups and downs can ease that pressure. As we wrap up today, what do you feel has been your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I feel like I have a clearer plan to boost my confidence. Practicing, writing down goals, and visualizing will really help me.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you have actionable steps to take moving forward. As we prepare for our next session, how can you continue to build on what you've learned today?

User: I’ll keep practicing my speaking and reflect on my progress. I’ll also let my mom know about my goals so she can help me.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a solid plan! I'm proud of you, Daniel, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Remember, these changes take time, and each step counts. See you soon!

User: Thank you! I’m feeling optimistic about it all. See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello Daniel! It's great to see you again. I’m really looking forward to our session today. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi! I feel really good. The class event was a big success, and I was happy with how it turned out. But sometimes, I still worry about how people see me.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear about the class event! It's a big achievement showing your organizational skills. It’s completely normal to have some worries about how others perceive you. Can you tell me a bit more about those worries?

User: Well, I just sometimes think that maybe I’m not as good as they think. Like, what if they think I'm just pretending to be a leader?

Consultant: It sounds like you're questioning your abilities and how others view you. Let's explore this further. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you have these feelings?

User: I think things like, "Maybe they’ll see I’m not really capable," or "What if they realize I’m just lucky?"

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite critical of yourself. It's important to recognize how such thinking can impact your confidence. How do these thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: They make me feel anxious and a bit sad. It’s like I doubt myself a lot more than I should.

Consultant: I can see how painful that can be, especially after a successful event. Remember, you’ve proven your skills and leadership. Let’s challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports those negative beliefs?

User: Well, I guess there isn’t any real evidence. People did seem happy with my work. Maybe I just can’t shake the feeling of doubt.

Consultant: It’s understandable. Our minds can sometimes cling to negativity, even when evidence suggests otherwise. If a friend said similar things about themselves, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably say that they did a great job and should believe in themselves.

Consultant: Exactly! You would encourage them to recognize their achievements. Let’s apply that thinking to you. What strengths do you have that contributed to the event’s success?

User: I think I organized everything pretty well, and I worked with my classmates to make it happen.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic insight! You successfully coordinated and collaborated with others, which are significant strengths. How can you remind yourself of these strengths when those doubts arise?

User: Maybe I could write down my accomplishments and look at them when I feel unsure.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Keeping a list of your achievements can help provide you with a reality check. Let's also discuss some new activities you might do to boost your confidence even more. What activities do you enjoy that could highlight your leadership skills?

User: I love playing team sports and helping my classmates with projects.

Consultant: Those are excellent options! Engaging in team sports could further develop your leadership and teamwork abilities while giving you a venue to shine. Would you be open to seeking more opportunities to take on leadership roles in those activities?

User: Yeah, I think that would be helpful. I’d like to try being a captain or something like that.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Experiencing those roles can reinforce your confidence. As we wrap up today, let’s review your progress. What would you say is the biggest takeaway from today’s session?

User: I think I learned that my doubts aren’t based on reality and that I have strengths I can rely on.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve made significant progress in recognizing your skills and challenging negative thoughts. Remember to lean on those strategies we discussed when you feel doubts creeping in. You’ve done very well, Daniel! 

User: Thank you! I feel like I have more tools now to handle my feelings.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember, it’s all about practice and patience. I'm proud of the steps you've taken. If you ever feel like you need support, don't hesitate to reach out again. You've got this!

User: I will! Thanks for everything. I feel a lot more confident now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! I believe in you, Daniel. Take care, and remember to celebrate your successes along the way. Goodbye for now!
