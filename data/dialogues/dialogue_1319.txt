Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you could join today's session. Before we dive in, I'd like to hear about how you've been feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really anxious since that incident in class where I couldn't answer a question. It’s been tough knowing that some classmates laughed at me. Now, I just feel embarrassed and insecure, especially in social situations.

Consultant: I can understand how distressing that experience must have been for you. It sounds like it has affected your confidence significantly. Can you tell me more about how this situation has impacted your daily life or interactions with others?

User: I find myself avoiding conversations with classmates because I fear judgment. It’s like I’m in my own head, constantly worrying about what they think of me. I often replay that moment in my mind.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel this way after such an experience. It seems you're stuck in a cycle of negative thoughts about yourself and your abilities. Let's explore those thoughts further. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about that moment in class?

User: I keep thinking that I'm not smart enough or that I always mess things up. It makes me feel worthless, and I dread the idea of speaking up in class again.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing some very harsh self-judgments. I wonder, is there any evidence that supports these thoughts about not being smart enough? Or could there be another perspective?

User: I guess I did well in other classes before. But this one incident just overshadows everything. It feels like everyone saw me fail, and that’s all they remember.

Consultant: That’s understandable, but it’s important to recognize that a single event doesn’t define your entire ability. If a friend were in your shoes, how would you encourage them to think about this situation?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it doesn't mean they aren’t smart. They should try again and not let one moment drag them down.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a compassionate perspective. So, let's practice treating yourself with that same kindness. What could be a more balanced thought for you to replace the idea of not being smart enough?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that I’m capable, and that mistakes are just a part of learning. I could focus on what I can improve instead of just the failure.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Focusing on growth and learning can be very powerful. Let’s work on incorporating that mindset. Is there a specific situation you’d like to face next, where you can apply this new approach?

User: I have a presentation coming up in class. I’m really nervous about it, but I want to try and be less anxious this time.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s break that down. How about we set a small goal for this presentation? Perhaps practicing in front of a mirror or with a friend could help you feel more comfortable. What do you think?

User: Practicing in front of someone sounds good. It might help reduce my fear of judgment if I get used to it.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! It can also provide you with some positive feedback to bolster your confidence. How do you feel about setting a practice session for this week?

User: I think I can manage that. I’ll ask a friend if they can help me practice. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember to be kind to yourself during this process. It’s a learning experience, and everyone has been in a position where they felt nervous. How do you feel about your upcoming presentation now?

User: I still feel a bit nervous, but I’m more hopeful. I think if I put myself out there and practice, I might surprise myself.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic attitude! Let’s also brainstorm some techniques to help you stay calm before and during the presentation. Would you like to explore some relaxation strategies?

User: Yes, that would be really helpful. I always get so tense before I speak.

Consultant: One technique is deep breathing. Before your presentation, take a few moments to breathe in deeply through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then slowly exhale. Would you be willing to practice this breathing exercise before your presentation?

User: I can definitely try that. I think it could help ease my tension a bit.

Consultant: Great! Another strategy is positive visualization. Imagine yourself giving the presentation successfully—how you would feel and the reactions from your classmates. Can you visualize that for yourself?

User: I can try to picture it. Focusing on that might help shift my thoughts from fear to maybe a little excitement.

Consultant: Exactly! Visualization can transform anxiety into anticipation. As we begin to wrap up, let’s review what you’ll take with you from our session today. What are your key takeaways about building confidence for your presentation?

User: I need to be kinder to myself, recognize that mistakes are part of learning, and practice my presentation with a friend. I’ll also use deep breathing and visualization to stay calm.

Consultant: Those are wonderful insights! You’ve made great progress today. As we conclude, remember that every small step counts. How do you feel about our session and the strategies we’ve discussed?

User: I feel more positive now. I’m grateful we talked about these strategies. I think I can face my presentation with a better mindset.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a journey, and I’m here to support you. If you ever need more assistance, feel free to reach out. You’ve made wonderful progress, and I believe in your ability to manage these feelings. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today. I'll keep you posted on how my presentation goes!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing how it goes. Take care, and remember to be gentle with yourself as you prepare.

Consultant: Hello Li! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, especially after that successful response in class. It gives me a little more confidence, but I still feel nervous and self-conscious when others react to what I say.

Consultant: That's great to hear about the successful experience in class! It sounds like a significant step forward. Can you tell me more about those feelings of nervousness? What specifically worries you when others react?

User: I guess I worry that if they laugh or look at me a certain way, it means they think I'm not smart or that I'm saying something foolish. It makes me feel really anxious.

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like you might be interpreting their reactions in a way that makes you feel more self-conscious. What do you think might be an alternative interpretation of their laughter or reactions?

User: Maybe they are just enjoying what I said and not judging me? But it’s hard to think that way when I’m in the moment.

Consultant: That's a valid point. It's common to jump to negative conclusions about how others perceive us. What if we worked on recognizing those interpretations as just one possibility rather than the only truth? 

User: I suppose that makes sense. I can try to remind myself that they might just be having a good time instead of thinking negatively about me.

Consultant: Exactly! Challenging those negative thoughts can be very helpful. The next time you find yourself in a similar situation, what would be a positive thought you could replace your initial worry with?

User: I could think, "They are interested in what I'm saying," instead of worrying about their reactions. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! By focusing on the positive intent behind others' reactions, you may find it easier to express yourself. How do you feel about trying this approach the next time you participate in class?

User: I feel a bit hopeful. It sounds easier than just trying not to feel anxious at all. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful attitude! It's more about managing your thoughts and feelings rather than eliminating them completely. How about we brainstorm some specific scenarios in class where you can practice this new thinking pattern?

User: Sure! I can think of contributing during discussions or answering more questions when I feel comfortable.

Consultant: Great! Let’s focus on a specific discussion or class activity coming up soon. What do you think you could do differently in terms of your mindset during that activity?

User: I could remind myself that everyone is learning together, and it's okay to make mistakes. 

Consultant: Absolutely! By embracing the learning process, you shift the pressure off yourself. What other thoughts might help you maintain this perspective?

User: I could tell myself that everyone has their own struggles and no one is perfect, so my mistakes won’t overshadow my efforts.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization! Recognizing that everyone is human can lessen your fears. Let's also consider how you might respond to laughter or positive reactions from classmates during your next contribution. 

User: I think I’ll try to just smile and continue speaking, instead of letting the laughter throw me off.

Consultant: That's an excellent plan! Returning the positive energy and not getting bogged down by fear can really help. What about practicing this response? How do you intend to feel if you successfully maintain it?

User: I would feel much more relaxed and perhaps proud of myself for handling it better than before.

Consultant: That’s a great outcome to focus on! As we approach your next class participation, what steps can you take to prepare yourself mentally?

User: I could visualize myself speaking confidently and receiving positive feedback, rather than imagining a negative response.

Consultant: Visualization can be a very effective tool! It helps to create a positive expectation. Are you comfortable with that approach?

User: Yes, it makes me feel more optimistic about the possibility of success!

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember, it’s about reinforcing those positive feelings and thoughts over time. Is there anything else that you think could help you in this process?

User: Maybe keeping a journal of my experiences and how I felt during those times? That way, I can reflect on my growth.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Journaling can help you track your progress and provide insights into your thoughts. It also allows you to celebrate your successes, no matter how small. How do you feel about starting that?

User: I think I’ll definitely try it out. It might help me see things more clearly.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up our session today, what do you feel you've learned that will help you moving forward?

User: I’ve learned that I can challenge my negative thoughts and practice positive responses. I feel more equipped to handle future situations now.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight! You're developing a crucial skill set for managing anxiety in social situations. Remember, it’s a journey, and progress is what matters. I'll be here to support you along the way. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your guidance.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li! I'm here whenever you need support. Keep practicing those skills, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you again. It sounds like you've made some positive strides in expressing yourself lately during that campus event. How are you feeling about it now?

User: Hi! Yes, I was really nervous during the planning, but I managed to share my ideas. It felt good, but I still have this lingering anxiety about speaking in front of people.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you were able to express your ideas. Feeling a bit anxious afterward is completely normal. Can you tell me more about what specific situations make you feel anxious when speaking in public?

User: I think it’s mainly when I feel everyone is watching and judging me. I worry that I might say something wrong or that they won’t take me seriously.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It’s understandable to be concerned about others' perceptions. How have these thoughts impacted your confidence in social situations?

User: Well, they make me hesitate to join conversations sometimes. I often second-guess what I want to say.

Consultant: I can see how that would affect your willingness to engage. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. What goes through your mind just before you choose not to speak up?

User: I think things like "What if they think I'm stupid?" or "What if I embarrass myself?"

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really daunting. Can we try to identify how those beliefs might not fully reflect reality? What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts those beliefs?

User: Well, after the event, I received some positive feedback from my friends, which felt nice. But I still tend to focus more on the anxiety than the compliments.

Consultant: It’s great that you received positive feedback! It sounds like your friends value what you say. How can we work together to help shift your focus from that anxiety to acknowledging your positive experiences?

User: I guess I could remind myself of the positive feedback more often, but it’s hard when I’m in the moment.

Consultant: That's a good start! Maybe we can practice some strategies to help you remember those positive moments when you're feeling anxious. How does that sound to you?

User: Yes, that sounds good! What kind of strategies do you suggest?

Consultant: One approach might be to create a "success log" where you jot down positive interactions or compliments right when they happen. This way, you can refer back to it when you're feeling anxious. Would you be willing to try that?

User: I think I could do that. It might help me remember the good moments when I'm feeling down.

Consultant: Fantastic! Along with that, we can also practice some relaxation techniques to help you manage anxiety in real-time. How do you feel about trying some breathing exercises here today?

User: That sounds helpful! I often feel like I need to calm myself down before speaking.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment to practice. Breathe in deeply through your nose for four counts, hold for four counts, and exhale slowly through your mouth for six counts. Ready? 

User: Okay, I’ll try it.

Consultant: Let’s do it together. Inhale… 1, 2, 3, 4. Hold… 1, 2, 3, 4. And exhale… 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt nice. I already feel a bit calmer.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Incorporating these breathing exercises before speaking might help counteract your anxiety. Let’s also think about a small social situation where you could practice speaking up. What might be a comfortable environment for you to start?

User: Maybe I could practice with my classmates during group discussions. I feel comfortable with them.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! You could plan to share at least one idea in the next discussion. How do you think you might feel about that?

User: I think if I prepare what I want to say beforehand, it might help ease my anxiety.

Consultant: Preparing a bit can definitely boost your confidence. Why don’t we set a goal for the next discussion? Can you think of something specific you could aim to share?

User: I think I could suggest a new approach for our project. I’ve been thinking about it a lot.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Setting that as your goal will help you focus on contributing. When you think about sharing that idea, what emotions do you expect to feel?

User: I might feel nervous initially, but I think I’d also feel proud if I go through with it.

Consultant: That’s a positive outlook! Remember, even if you feel a bit nervous, it’s perfectly okay. Just acknowledge those feelings. After you share, reflect on how it went and add that experience to your success log.  

User: I’ll definitely do that. Thank you for the encouragement!

Consultant: You’re welcome, Li! It’s really encouraging to see your progress. We can build on these strategies in our future sessions. Remember, social interactions take practice, and you’re doing great. 

User: I’m actually looking forward to speaking up now. Thank you for your help!

Consultant: That’s an amazing shift in perspective! I’m proud of you for taking these steps. Keep embracing those interactions, and we’ll continue to build on this together. 

User: I will! I feel more excited about joining conversations now.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’re taking with you. You have your success log, breathing techniques, and a specific goal for your next group discussion. Do you feel ready to take these next steps? 

User: Yes, I do! I'm feeling much better about all of this.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! You've made some significant strides. Remember, it's a journey, and every step counts. If you find yourself feeling anxious again, don’t hesitate to reach out. You've got this!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care!

User: I will! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hi Li! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing better, actually. I had a group project with my classmates recently, and it went really well. I felt more comfortable interacting with them.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like you had a positive experience connecting with your classmates. What did you enjoy most about that interaction?

User: I enjoyed the collaboration and seeing how we could share ideas freely. It felt good to work as a team rather than being stressed out about my own work.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience helped you realize the benefits of teamwork and collaboration. How do you think this might influence your confidence in other social situations?

User: I think it makes me feel like I can engage more with others. I might be able to approach classmates or friends without feeling overwhelming anxiety.

Consultant: That's a wonderful insight! It seems you're becoming more open to social interactions. Are there specific situations where you hope to practice this newfound confidence?

User: I want to talk more in class discussions and maybe participate in some social events. I’m just worried about how I will come across to others.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way. What do you think makes you anxious about how you come across to others?

User: I guess I'm afraid of being judged or making a mistake when I speak up.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Let's explore that fear. What kind of judgments do you worry others might have?

User: I worry they'll think I’m not smart enough or that I might embarrass myself.

Consultant: Those fears can be quite heavy to carry. How do you think you could challenge those thoughts when they arise in a social setting?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone makes mistakes, and it's okay to not be perfect.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! It’s helpful to remember that everyone has their own insecurities. Would you be open to trying out positive self-talk during social situations?

User: Yes, I think that could work. I could also write down some of the positive things I've experienced lately to remind myself.

Consultant: Writing down those positive experiences is a great idea! It will help you remind yourself of your achievements and strengths. Are there any specific situations you could try this approach in?

User: I could start by sharing my ideas in class next week. That seems like a good first step.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan, Li! How are you feeling about trying that out?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited about the possibility of sharing and being heard.

Consultant: It's normal to feel a mix of emotions. To help you manage that nervousness, let’s think about some calming strategies you could use before speaking up.

User: Maybe I can take deep breaths and focus on what I want to say before I raise my hand.

Consultant: Deep breathing is an excellent technique to calm those nerves. Would it help to visualize a positive outcome before you start speaking?

User: Yes, visualizing a positive response might help. I can picture my classmates being engaged and interested.

Consultant: That’s a powerful visualization! Let’s also set a goal for how you want to feel during and after that interaction. What would a successful outcome look like for you?

User: I’d like to feel proud of myself for speaking up, regardless of how the class reacts. 

Consultant: That's a healthy goal! Focusing on your effort and growth rather than external validation can be very freeing. As we wrap up, how do you feel about the journey ahead?

User: I feel more motivated to put myself out there. I think I can handle it better than before.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’ve made significant progress, and I believe you’ll do great. Remember, each small step counts. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’m looking forward to sharing my progress!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li! Take care, and I'll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hi there, it's great to see you again! I'm looking forward to our session today. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I’ve actually been feeling pretty good. I've been participating more in campus activities and enjoying social interactions with my classmates. The anxiety I used to have is much less noticeable now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made significant progress. Could you share more about any specific social situations where you felt confident and satisfied with your performance?

User: Sure! Just last week, I participated in a group project. I was able to share my ideas without feeling overly anxious, and my classmates responded positively. It felt really good to connect with them.

Consultant: It sounds like that was a really affirming experience for you. Let’s think about how you can carry that confidence into other social situations. What types of scenarios would you like to tackle next?

User: I want to feel just as comfortable in larger gatherings, like parties or club meetings. I think it would be fun to socialize more in those environments without feeling nervous.

Consultant: That’s a great goal! Larger gatherings can sometimes feel overwhelming. How about we explore some strategies to help you feel at ease in those settings? 

User: Yes, I'd like that. I think having some strategies would make me feel more prepared.

Consultant: For sure! One approach we can use is role-playing. We can simulate a party scenario and practice different ways to initiate conversations. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds interesting and might really help! Should I think of a specific party setting to practice?

Consultant: Yes, that’s a good idea. Try to envision a particular event you might attend. What kind of topics would you feel comfortable discussing with new people?

User: I usually talk about movies and video games. Those are the things I enjoy and feel confident discussing.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s role-play a scene where you meet someone new at a party, and you can share your thoughts on a movie. I’ll play the role of the other person. Ready?

User: Yes, I'm ready. 

Consultant: Hi there! I just watched a new action movie last night. Have you seen it? What did you think of it?

User: Um, yes! I saw that too. I thought the action scenes were really well done, but I wasn’t a big fan of the plot. What about you?

Consultant: I appreciate that perspective! I enjoyed the action as well. It's interesting how different elements can resonate with us. How does it feel to engage in this conversation?

User: It feels good! I think I’m actually enjoying this practice.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! You’re doing really well. Remember, keeping it light and sharing your thoughts can help break the ice. How would you feel about trying another scenario, maybe a bit more challenging?

User: Okay, I think that could be a good next step. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine a setting where you meet someone who seems a bit intimidating. How about sharing your opinions on a popular video game you love? Ready to give it a go?

User: All right, here we go!

Consultant: Hi! I noticed you’re playing that new game. I’m a huge fan too! What’s your favorite part about it?

User: I really love the graphics and the gameplay mechanics. It’s so engaging! What do you think?

Consultant: I agree! I think the storyline is also captivating. Your enthusiasm shines through. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt much easier to talk than I expected. I’m surprised I didn't feel anxious at all.

Consultant: That's a significant breakthrough! Practicing these conversations can really enhance your confidence. How do you feel about carrying this confidence into real situations now?

User: I’m feeling much more confident. I’m excited about using these skills at an actual event.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Let’s discuss ways to maintain this momentum. What steps can you take before your next gathering to feel even more prepared?

User: I think I can make a list of topics I’m comfortable with and visualize the scenarios where I can use them.

Consultant: That’s a smart strategy! Visualizing success can really set a positive tone. As we wrap up today, what are your key takeaways from our session?

User: I feel like I have a clearer understanding of how to interact in social situations, and I’m excited to apply what I've practiced.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’ve made remarkable progress, and I believe you will continue to grow in your social confidence. Remember to stay connected with the positive experiences you’ve had. If you encounter challenges in the future, you can always revisit these strategies. Thank you for sharing today. You've done wonderfully!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate this session and all your help.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm really glad to see you again for this session. Before we dive in, how have you been feeling since our last discussion?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good. The last time we spoke was helpful, and I even felt more confident during a recent class reunion where I engaged actively in the discussion. 

Consultant: That sounds fantastic! It's great to hear about your positive experience at the reunion. Can you share how your confidence changes during that event affected your feelings about social interactions?

User: Well, I felt like I was really connecting with others, and it made me realize that I can hold a conversation and be part of the group. It was a nice change from my usual reserved self.

Consultant: That's a significant realization! It sounds like you’re starting to see your social skills in a new light. What aspects of that experience do you think contributed most to your increased confidence?

User: I think being able to speak up and share my thoughts made a big difference. I received positive feedback, and that really boosted my self-esteem.

Consultant: It's amazing how positive interactions can reinforce our self-worth. Given this progress, how do you envision applying this newfound confidence to future social situations?

User: I hope that I can keep participating more actively in discussions. Maybe I'll even try initiating conversations with people I don’t know very well.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! Initiating conversations can be daunting, but it's a great way to further develop your skills. What challenges do you think you might face while trying to initiate conversations?

User: I guess I might feel nervous or unsure if the other person wants to talk. I worry about saying the wrong thing.

Consultant: Those feelings are quite common! It's normal to have some apprehension about how others will respond. How might we address that worry to make it easier for you to initiate conversations?

User: Maybe we could come up with some strategies or questions I can use to start a conversation?

Consultant: Absolutely! Let's brainstorm some open-ended questions that are easy to ask and that encourage others to share their thoughts. What interests you in conversations?

User: I enjoy talking about technology and movies. I could ask people what they think about a recent tech development or a film.

Consultant: Great choices! Those topics are relatable and can spark engaging discussions. For instance, you could ask, “Have you seen any interesting new tech that caught your eye?” or “What’s a movie you’ve enjoyed recently?” How do you feel about using these questions?

User: I feel more equipped! They seem casual and engaging, which makes it less intimidating.

Consultant: Exactly! The more relaxed the approach, the more natural the conversation can flow. Now, let’s think about ways to practice these skills in a safe environment. What are some opportunities you have to practice these conversation starters?

User: I could try them out in my classes or with classmates before or after lectures. I already know some of them from my past interactions.

Consultant: That's a great strategy. It will allow you to practice without too much pressure. How do you think you will feel after trying out these strategies in class?

User: I imagine it will be a little nerve-wracking, but also rewarding if it goes well. I hope to feel more comfortable each time.

Consultant: That mindset is crucial. Remember, it's a process, and with each interaction, you'll likely feel more at ease. As we wrap up today, let's summarize what you’ve gained and how you'll continue this journey of confidence. 

User: Sure! I’ve learned to initiate conversations better, plan to practice in classes, and I have some open-ended questions to use. This feels really encouraging!

Consultant: I'm delighted to hear that, Li! You've made wonderful strides. As you continue to build on these skills, what strategies will you use to ensure you maintain your confidence during social interactions?

User: I’ll remind myself of the positive feedback I received and focus on the enjoyment of conversing, rather than the fear of saying something wrong.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. And finally, keep in mind that setbacks are normal, too. If you feel overwhelmed, just reflect on your progress. You’ve got this! 

User: Thank you! I feel more prepared now, and I appreciate your support throughout this process.

Consultant: It’s been a pleasure working with you, Li. Remember, you can always reach out if you need guidance in the future. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress!

User: Thank you! I will definitely keep in touch.
