Consultant: Hello! It's good to see you again today. I understand that you've been going through a tough time. Can you share with me how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really lost and devastated since the breakup and not getting into the graduate program. I keep crying every day, and I even thought about giving up. It's like I'm stuck in this dark place.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of pain and uncertainty right now. Let's take a moment to explore what you've been experiencing. What specific thoughts or feelings come to mind when you think about your breakup and the exam results?

User: I just keep thinking that I'm not good enough. My boyfriend said it was because of my issues, and now I feel like I've failed at everything. I don't see a way out of this.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts of self-doubt are really heavy for you. Can you tell me more about how these thoughts make you feel on an emotional level? 

User: They make me feel so empty and worthless. Every time I think about it, I just feel like crying. I wish I could just erase everything and start over.

Consultant: That feeling of wanting to escape the pain is understandable, especially when it feels like everything is overwhelming. Let's try to identify some specific thoughts you have when you're feeling this way. For example, when you think about not getting into the graduate program, what thoughts come up for you?

User: I keep thinking, "I’ll never succeed." Or "I’ll always be alone." It’s like a loop in my head that keeps reminding me of my failures.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really distressing and it’s understandable they would impact your feelings. What do you think might be an alternative way to look at your situation? Is there any evidence against those negative thoughts?

User: Maybe I could think that just because I didn’t get into that program doesn’t mean I won’t succeed somewhere else. But it’s hard to believe that right now.

Consultant: It is definitely challenging to shift those thoughts, especially when emotions are running high. If a friend came to you with similar feelings, how would you encourage them to think differently about their situation? 

User: I would probably tell them that one setback doesn’t define their worth. They should focus on other opportunities.

Consultant: That's a very compassionate perspective to have. It sounds like you have the capacity to be supportive to yourself, just as you would for a friend. Let’s brainstorm some actions you might take to counter those negative thoughts. What could you do this week that would help you feel more connected or engaged in life?

User: I guess I could reach out to some friends and try to get together. I've been isolating myself so much lately.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Connecting with friends can be really helpful. It can also provide you with support and a different perspective. What activities do you think you could do together that might lift your spirits?

User: Maybe we could go for coffee or watch a movie. Anything to just get out of the house and feel some normalcy.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Taking those small steps to engage with others can really help improve your mood. Remember, it’s okay to feel sad—it’s a part of the healing process. How do you feel about setting up a plan to meet a friend this week?

User: I think I can do that. It makes me feel a bit better just thinking about it. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, reaching out for support is a sign of strength. Let’s check in on that next time. Now, as we continue to process these feelings, it might be helpful to also discuss ways to manage the emotional ups and downs you're experiencing. How are you currently coping with your emotions?

User: I just cry a lot. Sometimes I write in a journal, but I often feel too overwhelmed to do even that.

Consultant: It’s understandable that expressing your feelings can be difficult when you’re feeling overwhelmed. Writing can be a very therapeutic outlet, but it’s important to honor where you are emotionally. Would you be receptive to trying some mindfulness techniques that could help with managing those intense feelings? 

User: I think I could try that. I’ve heard it can help.

Consultant: Absolutely, mindfulness can be a great way to ground yourself and find some calm amidst emotional chaos. We could start with simple breathing exercises together. Would you like to try that now?

User: Yes, that sounds good.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s take a moment and focus on your breathing. Inhale deeply through your nose… hold it for a few seconds… and then exhale gently through your mouth. Let’s do this a few times together and focus on releasing any tension with each exhale.

User: That feels nice. I'm feeling a little lighter already.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Breathing exercises can be a simple yet effective way to bring some relaxation into your day. As we wrap up for today, what would you say is one key takeaway you’d like to hold onto from our conversation?

User: I think focusing on reaching out to friends and trying to change my thoughts would be important. 

Consultant: That sounds like a valuable takeaway. Remember, you’re not alone in this, and it's okay to reach out for help. In our next session, we can delve more into your feelings and explore how those actions are serving you. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you next time.

User: Thank you. I really appreciate your support.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been having some ups and downs. I tried to get involved in more social activities, which has helped a bit, but I still have moments of self-doubt and feel uncertain about the future.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’ve started participating in social activities. Those experiences can be really beneficial. Can you tell me about one of those activities and how it made you feel?

User: I attended a club meeting last week, and it was nice to be around people again. We shared some laughs, but afterward, I still felt this lingering sadness about my recent exam results and everything else.

Consultant: It sounds like being with others brought you some joy, but the sadness lingered afterward. It's understandable to feel that way. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come up when you feel this sadness?

User: Yes, I keep thinking that I'm not good enough, especially after not getting into the graduate program I wanted. It makes me doubt my worth.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy. It’s important to challenge those negative beliefs. When you think "I’m not good enough," what emotions do you feel in your body?

User: I feel this tightness in my chest and sometimes tears well up in my eyes. It’s like a wave of despair washes over me.

Consultant: That sounds very overwhelming. Let’s explore the thoughts behind that feeling. Can you recall a specific moment when you felt this way recently? What thoughts went through your mind at that time?

User: After the exam results came out, I thought, "I’ve failed myself," and then my boyfriend broke up with me. It felt like everything just collapsed.

Consultant: I’m really sorry to hear that you’re going through all this. It’s okay to feel upset about it. Let’s work on reframing those thoughts. What evidence do you have that contradicts the idea that you’ve failed yourself?

User: I guess I did get a job offer, but it just feels overshadowed by these failures.

Consultant: That’s an important achievement! It shows that you have value and skills, even if it feels overshadowed right now. Can we try to focus on what that job offer means for you and how it can be a stepping stone moving forward?

User: Yes, I suppose that job can bring me some stability. But I’m still worried about not getting into graduate school.

Consultant: It’s okay to have concerns about the future, but remember, this is one path among many. If a friend were in your situation, what would you tell them about their worth despite setbacks?

User: I’d probably tell them that their value isn’t defined by one failure and that they still have many other opportunities.

Consultant: Exactly! Those words apply to you as well. It's about looking at the big picture and the possibilities ahead. Let’s brainstorm some fun activities you could do to keep building your confidence and stay engaged socially.

User: That sounds good. I think I could join a new club or perhaps do some volunteer work to feel more involved.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Engaging in new environments can help you feel connected and appreciated. How about setting a goal to try one new activity this week? 

User: I can definitely try to join that volunteer opportunity I came across. 

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! And remember, while you’re doing that, practice some mindfulness techniques to help you manage those difficult emotions when they arise. Would you like to learn a simple mindfulness exercise to try?

User: Yes, I would love to! I think it could help me stay grounded.

Consultant: A helpful exercise is to take a few minutes each day to focus on your breathing. Sit comfortably, close your eyes if it feels right, and take a deep breath in through your nose, then out through your mouth. As you breathe, try to focus only on the sensation of your breath—let other thoughts drift away. How does that sound?

User: It sounds calming! I’ll give it a shot and see how it goes.

Consultant: Great! Let’s plan to check in next time about how the volunteering goes and how the mindfulness exercise works for you. It’s all about moving at your own pace.

User: I appreciate that. It feels nice to have a little plan.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, it’s important to be patient with yourself as you work through these feelings. You’re doing a lot by taking these steps. 

User: Thank you! It really helps to have someone to talk to about all this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here to support you. Keep reminding yourself of your strengths and the positive paths ahead. 

User: I will. I’m feeling a bit more hopeful already.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Let’s keep building on that hope in our next session. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything before then.

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to our next session. 

Consultant: Me too! Take care and see you soon!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoh, I'm glad to see you today. It's great that you've had some supportive conversations with your parents recently. How are you feeling since then?

User: Hi! I feel a bit better, but there's still this nagging doubt about my self-worth. It's tough to shake off the feeling that I’m not good enough.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It’s understandable to have those feelings, especially after the recent challenges you've faced. Can you tell me more about the doubts you're experiencing? 

User: Well, after not making it to the interview stage for my desired graduate school, I started questioning my abilities. It feels like everything I worked for has just crumbled.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult, Xiaoh. When you think about your experiences and achievements, what are some positive things that you have accomplished, despite the setbacks?

User: I guess I have done well academically. I've won some awards and was involved in various clubs. But they seem less important now.

Consultant: Those achievements are significant, and it’s important to recognize them, even when you’re facing challenges. Let’s explore how we can integrate those successes into your current perspective. How would acknowledging these achievements change how you feel about yourself?

User: I suppose if I focus on them, it might help me feel a bit more confident. But it’s hard to believe in myself right now.

Consultant: I understand. Building belief in yourself takes time, especially after experiencing setbacks. How about we set some smaller, achievable goals that can help you regain that confidence?

User: That sounds like a good idea. I want to work on something that makes me feel accomplished again.

Consultant: Great! Let’s think about what short-term goals you could set. Perhaps something related to your study or skills you’d like to develop further? 

User: I’ve been considering taking a course to improve my skills in a specific area. Maybe that could be a good goal?

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking a course can be a fantastic way to develop new skills and boost your confidence. What specific skills are you thinking about focusing on? 

User: I was thinking of learning more about data analysis. It’s relevant to my field and could enhance my employability.

Consultant: That’s a very practical choice, Xiaoh. Let’s set a goal for you to research courses in data analysis this week. When would you like to complete that?

User: I can try to have a list by the end of the week. That feels doable.

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a great goal. How do you feel about taking this step to focus on your development?

User: I feel a bit excited. It’s nice to think about something positive, instead of dwelling on what went wrong.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Excitement is a positive emotion to build on. Once you compile that list, we can discuss how to move forward and perhaps even set another goal related to this.

User: Yes, I’d like that. It would be great to have a plan.

Consultant: Creating a plan is a productive way to approach your feelings and future. Have you thought about how you can reward yourself for completing this task?

User: I could treat myself to a nice dinner or something special. It’s a nice motivator!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Treating yourself can reinforce your progress and keep you motivated. Let’s remember to celebrate these small victories together. 

User: Sure, I’ll keep that in mind. It does feel good to have a small win to look forward to.

Consultant: Exactly! Small wins lead to bigger changes. As you complete these tasks, how can you document your progress to reflect on your achievements?

User: I could keep a journal of my goals and the steps I take towards them. That might help.

Consultant: A journal is an excellent tool! It can help you track your progress and remind you of your achievements. How does that feel as a plan?

User: It feels helpful. I think writing things down will make a difference.

Consultant: Wonderful! Writing can be a very cathartic and motivating process. As you start this journey, are there any potential barriers you foresee in accomplishing your goals?

User: I’m a bit worried about distracting myself or losing motivation if things get tough again.

Consultant: It's normal to have those worries. Let’s brainstorm some strategies to manage distractions and maintain motivation if challenges arise. What do you think could help you stay on track?

User: Setting specific times to study and maybe using apps to limit my phone use could work.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Setting a schedule can provide structure, and limiting distractions can significantly increase your focus. How would you feel about sharing your schedule with someone for accountability?

User: I could talk to a friend about it. They would probably support me and keep me accountable.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Sharing your goals can help solidify your commitment to them. Let’s incorporate that into your action plan. 

User: I will definitely do that. Thanks for helping me break it down!

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xiaoh! I’m so impressed by your willingness to adapt and set new goals. Let’s check in on your progress next time we meet. Remember, it’s about taking those small steps towards rebuilding your confidence. 

User: I really appreciate this. I feel more hopeful than before!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Hopefulness is a powerful emotion. I look forward to seeing your progress and catching up on your experiences next time. 

User: Thank you! I’ll do my best.

Consultant: You’re already making strides, Xiaoh. Keep reminding yourself of your strengths, and I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Hello Xiaohé! I'm glad you're here for today’s session. You recently signed up for a workplace skills enhancement workshop, and it seems like you’re feeling excited about trying something new. Let’s talk more about this. How have you been feeling since you decided to participate in the workshop?

User: Hi! Yes, I am feeling a bit more stable emotionally lately. The thought of learning new skills excites me, and I think it might really help me rethink my career direction after graduation.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It sounds like this workshop has sparked some positive feelings and new perspectives for you. Can you share a bit about the skills you're hoping to develop in this workshop? How do you see them impacting your future?

User: I want to learn more about project management and communication skills. I believe these abilities are essential for practically any job out there. Hopefully, gaining these skills will make me more adaptable and open up more job opportunities.

Consultant: Those are valuable skills indeed! Project management and communication can significantly enhance your employability. What do you think it means for you to become more adaptable in your career?

User: I think being adaptable means I’ll be able to handle change better and stay open to various job opportunities, instead of feeling stuck or overwhelmed. I really want to avoid the feelings of hopelessness I had when I didn’t get into my desired school.

Consultant: It sounds like adapting to changes is very important for you. That makes perfect sense, especially considering the challenges you’ve faced recently. How do you feel about the prospect of facing new challenges in this workshop?

User: I’m a bit nervous but mostly excited. I know pushing through the nervousness can lead to personal growth. I just want to keep moving forward instead of getting stuck in my past disappointments.

Consultant: That’s such a positive mindset, Xiaohé! Recognizing the need to move forward despite the nervousness is a significant step. Since you mentioned wanting to push through these feelings, what strategies do you think could help you manage any anxiety during the workshop?

User: I was thinking about reminding myself of the reasons I’m doing this. Also, maybe practicing some breathing exercises to calm down before I go into the sessions.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Reminding yourself of your goals can keep you motivated. Breathing exercises can also help calm your mind and body. Are there specific instances from your past where you've successfully navigated anxiety in new situations?

User: Yes, I felt anxious when I started my university life, but I found that getting involved in club activities helped a lot. I made friends and built a support network quickly, which eased my fears.

Consultant: It’s inspiring to hear how involvement in clubs supported you during a significant transition. Building connections can be a great support system! How might you apply that same approach to this new workshop environment?

User: I could try to connect with other participants, maybe form study groups or just chat with them during breaks to ease my nerves. That helped me before, so why not?

Consultant: That sounds like a practical plan! Engaging with others can make the experience more enjoyable and supportive. As you prepare for the workshop, have you also considered how this new skill set aligns with your career goals?

User: Definitely! I believe mastering project management could help me in various fields, especially in roles that involve teamwork and collaboration, which interests me.

Consultant: It’s fantastic that you’re already envisioning how these skills can fit into your career! As you explore this, what potential jobs or fields excite you that you think might benefit from what you learn?

User: I find project management roles appealing. I think working in tech or even in a non-profit organization could be fulfilling, especially where I can help coordinate and manage teams.

Consultant: Those are great fields, and project management skills can be incredibly beneficial in both. Seeking roles that resonate with your interests and values is important for long-term satisfaction. How are you feeling about your ability to explore these options as you move forward?

User: I feel more optimistic now. I think with these new skills, I might have a better chance of finding a role that fits me well, which is reassuring.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Feeling optimistic about your future is crucial. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize your goals: you want to focus on developing project management and communication skills, actively engage with workshop participants, and keep an open mind about potential career paths. How do you feel about these goals?

User: I feel great about them! Having clearer goals really helps me stay focused and motivated.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. Embracing these new experiences will enrich your journey. If you begin to feel overwhelmed, just remind yourself of the progress you’ve already made. I'm here for you whenever you need to talk again.

User: Thank you so much! This session has really helped me feel more confident. I'm looking forward to the workshop now more than ever!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaohé! I’m thrilled to hear you feel more confident. Keep that positive momentum going, and remember to celebrate your efforts along the way. Wishing you the best in your workshop and future endeavors!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoh, it's great to see you today! How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling more confident recently. I'm getting excited about graduating and starting my career. But I still have moments where I get anxious thinking about the future.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more confident and excited about the future! Can you share more about what specifically triggers your anxiety when you think about starting your career?

User: Well, sometimes I worry that I'm not going to find a job that fits my expectations or that I'll fail at whatever I end up doing. It just feels overwhelming.

Consultant: I can understand why that feels overwhelming for you. Transitioning into the workforce is a significant change. What do you think a successful outcome would look like for you in this new chapter of your life?

User: I hope to find a job that I enjoy, where I can see myself growing and learning. I also want to feel capable and confident in my skills.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive goal to have. Let’s break it down a bit. What skills or strengths do you feel you bring with you into the job market?

User: I believe I'm a good communicator and I have experience from my internship. I also have a strong academic background, so I think I can adapt quickly.

Consultant: Those are excellent strengths to have! Communication and adaptability will definitely serve you well. As you prepare for job applications, how do you typically manage any stress or anxiety that comes up?

User: I try to keep myself organized and write lists. Sometimes though, I still get anxious and overthink things, which just makes it worse.

Consultant: It's great that you're using organization as a tool. Overthinking can be tough. Have you noticed any particular situations where overthinking tends to happen the most?

User: Yes, especially when I look at job postings. I start comparing myself to others and question if I’m really qualified.

Consultant: It’s common to compare ourselves to others, especially in competitive situations. If a friend was in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably tell them that they have unique qualities that make them suitable for different roles, and not to compare themselves too harshly.

Consultant: That’s a kind and supportive mindset. Let’s explore how you can apply that same perspective to yourself. What evidence can you find to support your qualifications and uniqueness?

User: I guess I have my internship experience and good grades. I also received positive feedback from my professors about my projects.

Consultant: Those are fantastic points! It sounds like you have concrete evidence of your capabilities. When those self-doubts creep in, how can you remind yourself of these achievements?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal of my accomplishments and read them when I start to doubt myself.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Keeping a journal can help reinforce your self-worth and remind you of your journey. What other strategies can we think of to help you manage anxiety during this transition?

User: I could try practicing mindfulness or maybe even scheduling short breaks when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Mindfulness is an excellent strategy to help ground you, and scheduling breaks can prevent burnout. How do you feel about incorporating those techniques into your routine?

User: I think it could really help. I tend to forget to take breaks when I'm stressed.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Let’s set some small, achievable goals around taking breaks and practicing mindfulness. For example, could you start with five minutes of mindfulness each day?

User: Yes, I think starting with five minutes sounds manageable.

Consultant: Great! As you work on this, remember to celebrate those small victories, however minor they may seem. How do you feel about your ability to implement these changes in your daily life?

User: I feel hopeful! I believe I can make these small adjustments to help reduce my stress.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we’re moving forward, let’s touch upon your career goals once more. What steps could you take in the next week that would help you feel more prepared for job applications?

User: I can update my resume and maybe reach out to a few connections to ask for advice.

Consultant: Those are proactive steps! Networking can be incredibly valuable, and having an updated resume will boost your confidence. How does this plan make you feel about starting your job search?

User: It makes me feel excited and less anxious, knowing that I have action steps to take.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s perfectly normal to feel a mix of excitement and anxiety during this time. Just keep focusing on the steps you can take. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?

User: No, I think we’ve covered a lot. I feel more prepared to face the job search now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Xiaoh. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on your progress. What have you learned about yourself during our sessions that will help you moving forward?

User: I’ve learned that I have skills and experiences that I shouldn't underestimate, and that it’s okay to feel anxious as long as I have ways to cope.

Consultant: That's an excellent insight! Recognizing your worth and having coping strategies is key. I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support throughout this process.

Consultant: You’re very welcome. Remember, I’m here if you ever want to talk more. Good luck with your next steps, and I look forward to hearing how things go in our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoshu! It's great to have you here today. I understand you're at a significant transition point in your life. How are you feeling about the upcoming graduation ceremony and the new phase of life ahead?

User: Hi! I'm actually feeling quite excited about graduation. It's a chance to celebrate with my classmates after four years of hard work. But I also feel a little anxious about what comes next. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of excitement and anxiety as you approach this milestone. Could you share more about what specifically makes you feel anxious about the future?

User: I guess I'm worried about finding a job and figuring out what I really want to do. It feels overwhelming sometimes, especially after the setbacks I faced with the graduate school exam.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Transitioning from university to the workforce can indeed be daunting, particularly after experiencing disappointments like the exam results. How do you think those experiences have influenced your feelings about your future?

User: Well, after not making it to the interviews, I've felt less sure of myself. I thought that my academic achievements would lead me somewhere, but now I feel stuck.

Consultant: It seems like the challenges you've faced have impacted your self-confidence. When you think about your achievements in university, what are some specific accomplishments that stand out to you and might help you regain your confidence?

User: I received several academic awards and led a few successful projects in my clubs. I also have a strong academic record. 

Consultant: Those are significant accomplishments, Xiaoshu! It’s important to recognize your strengths. How can we use these achievements to help you feel more confident about your job search and future plans?

User: I suppose I could focus on those experiences when applying for jobs. Maybe they’ll remind me that I do have valuable skills and experiences.

Consultant: Absolutely! Highlighting your strengths and experiences can boost your confidence. As you prepare for job applications, why don't we discuss the types of jobs or sectors you’re interested in? 

User: I'm interested in social work or community development. I really enjoyed working on projects that engaged with the community during my studies.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Community development is a meaningful field. Have you thought about any specific organizations or roles you might want to pursue in that area?

User: Not really, I feel lost about where to start. There are so many options out there, and I’m not sure which one suits me best.

Consultant: It makes sense to feel overwhelmed by the options. Let's break it down. What aspects of community development do you find most appealing? Are there certain skills or experiences you want to utilize in your future job?

User: I love helping people and making a difference in their lives. I also enjoy organizing events and working with teams. 

Consultant: Those skills are incredibly valuable in community development. Based on what you’ve shared, you might consider roles that involve event coordination or project management within organizations that focus on social impact. Does that resonate with you?

User: Yes, it does! That sounds like a great direction. 

Consultant: Excellent! Now that we have identified a potential path, let’s set some actionable steps for you to take. What do you think could be your first step toward exploring these opportunities?

User: Maybe I could start by researching organizations in that field and reaching out for informational interviews. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Informational interviews can provide valuable insights and help you network. How do you feel about initiating those conversations? 

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I know it's important to make connections. 

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel nervous! We can work on strategies to help you approach those conversations with confidence. Would you like to role-play an introduction or possible questions you might ask during an informational interview?

User: Yes, I think that would help a lot. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you’re reaching out to someone at an organization you admire. How would you introduce yourself?

User: Hi, my name is Xiaoshu. I recently graduated from university and I’m interested in community development. 

Consultant: That's a strong start! You’re clearly stating who you are and your interests. What do you think might come next? 

User: I could mention my background, like the projects I worked on and my curiosity about their work.

Consultant: Exactly! Sharing your background and expressing genuine curiosity will help establish rapport. Practicing this can build your confidence. How do you feel about targeting a few organizations to reach out to this week? 

User: I feel more motivated now! I will look up organizations and prepare my introduction. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Xiaoshu! It’s important to take these steps at your own pace. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ve accomplished in our session. What are your key takeaways and next steps?

User: I’m going to focus on my strengths and achievements, explore community development roles, and reach out for informational interviews. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! You should feel proud of that. Remember, you have overcome challenges, and taking these steps shows your commitment to your future. If you encounter any barriers or need further support, don’t hesitate to come back and share. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and feel much better about what’s next. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaoshu! I'm glad I could assist you today. Enjoy celebrating your graduation, and I wish you the best on your journey ahead. Take care!
