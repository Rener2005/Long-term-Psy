Consultant: Hello, Xiao Zhang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty down. I keep thinking about my last exam results and it makes me really frustrated. I don't want to go back to school.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's normal to feel overwhelmed after a disappointing result. Can you share more about what thoughts go through your mind when you think about school?

User: I just feel like I won’t do well again, and everyone will see me as a failure. I don't like being there at all.

Consultant: It sounds like you are feeling a lot of pressure and fear about what others might think. That can be really tough. Do you notice any specific moments when these thoughts get stronger? 

User: Yes, it’s mainly when I see my classmates studying or during class discussions. I feel like I can't keep up and that makes me want to just play games instead.

Consultant: Avoiding those feelings by playing games is something many people do, but it seems like it isn’t helping you achieve what you really want. What do you think would help you feel better about returning to school?

User: I guess if I could just do better in my studies, I might feel okay. But I don't know how to start.

Consultant: It’s good that you want to improve! Perhaps we could break it down into smaller steps. What would be one small goal that you feel is achievable related to your school work?

User: Maybe I could try to study for like, just an hour a day and see how it goes?

Consultant: That sounds like a manageable plan! Committing to an hour a day could build your confidence. How do you feel about that idea? 

User: I think I could do that. But I’m still scared that I won’t be able to concentrate or that it won’t help.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel scared, especially when trying something new. Let’s challenge that thought a bit. Can you think of any evidence that suggests you might be able to concentrate? 

User: Well, I guess I did study a little before my last exam. Maybe if I find a quiet place, I can focus better.

Consultant: That's a great realization! It sounds like you’ve had some success before when you created a good environment. If you take that approach again, what do you think will be different this time?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that I am capable of doing better instead of expecting to fail all the time.

Consultant: Absolutely! Replacing those negative thoughts with more positive ones can really make a difference. How about we work together on developing some of those encouraging reminders for you?

User: That sounds good. I could write down some positive phrases to look at when I'm feeling down.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Writing them down will give you something tangible to refer back to. What’s one phrase you think could help you feel more confident?

User: How about “I can improve and learn from my mistakes”? 

Consultant: That’s a strong and affirming phrase! By telling yourself that, you can start building a more positive mindset. Do you think you can commit to practicing that daily?

User: Yeah, I think I can try that!

Consultant: Great! Practice makes progress. Let’s also talk about some activities outside of school that you can engage in to help balance your feelings. Are there any hobbies or activities you enjoy?

User: I used to like playing basketball but haven’t done it in a while.

Consultant: Basketball could definitely be a wonderful outlet for stress and a way to boost your mood. Would you consider reintroducing it into your routine?

User: I think so. It sounds fun to do with my friends. 

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Engaging with friends while doing something active can really help improve your spirits. How often do you think you could play?

User: Maybe once or twice a week?

Consultant: That sounds like a reasonable start, and it gives you something to look forward to! As we continue on this path, it’s important to remind yourself that progress takes time. 

User: I understand. I’ll be patient with myself.

Consultant: Excellent attitude, Xiao Zhang! To wrap up today, let's quickly review what we’ve discussed. You have plans to study an hour a day, practice a positive phrase, and start playing basketball again with friends. 

User: Yes, that sounds right.

Consultant: So proud of you! If you ever find yourself feeling anxious or hesitant about these changes, remember it’s okay to reach out. You’ve made great strides today. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit better already.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that. You’re doing an amazing job confronting these challenges. Remember, it’s about taking one step at a time. I look forward to seeing you in our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I think I feel a bit better. I cut down on my gaming, but I still feel really anxious about going back to school. 

Consultant: That's a positive step—reducing gaming can often help with anxiety. Let's talk about that anxiety regarding school. What specifically makes you nervous about returning?

User: I just keep thinking about how everyone will react to me. I'm worried they'll say things about my absence or that I won’t be able to catch up with my studies.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure around what others might think and the academic expectations. Can you share what thoughts come up for you when you think about those reactions?

User: I think they'll judge me, like maybe they think I’m lazy or not trying hard enough. It makes me feel really embarrassed.

Consultant: I understand that you're feeling embarrassed about these thoughts. It's common to worry about others’ judgments. At that moment, what emotions do you feel?

User: I feel anxious and a bit ashamed. Sometimes I even just want to avoid it and stay home longer.

Consultant: It’s natural to have those feelings, especially when faced with pressure. How do you think avoiding school might influence your worries in the long run?

User: Probably will make it worse since I won't have to confront it, but the thought of going back just scares me so much.

Consultant: It seems like you're aware that avoidance may not be the best solution. Let’s think about some small steps that could help you face this fear. How about we try imagining what a first day back at school might look like and how you could handle it?

User: I guess I could picture walking in, talking to a friend, and just sitting through a class. 

Consultant: That's a great start! Can you think of one small action you could take today that would move you closer to that picture? Maybe contacting a friend from school?

User: I could message a friend… maybe to see how they're doing or if they want to meet up later. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Connecting with a friend can help reduce your feelings of isolation. What do you think you might say in your message?

User: I might just ask them how classes are and say I've missed them, maybe suggest hanging out.

Consultant: That’s perfect! It shows you’re making an effort to reconnect. How do you feel about sending that message?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think I can do it. It’s nice to think about hanging out with them again.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous! Remember, reaching out could help ease some of that anxiety. What might be a time frame for sending the message?

User: I think I’ll send it later today after I finish my homework.

Consultant: That’s a reasonable plan! Once you do that, we can reflect together in our next session about how it went. How are you feeling about that step?

User: I feel hopeful. It feels good to have a plan, but I’m still anxious about school in general.

Consultant: It’s great to hear you’re feeling hopeful! We'll continue to work on your school-related anxiety. Let’s also talk about how you can communicate with your family about your feelings. How comfortable do you feel discussing your anxiety with them?

User: I haven’t really talked to them about it. They just think I’m okay, but I don’t want them to worry.

Consultant: It’s understandable to want to protect them, but sharing your feelings could strengthen your support system. How might you start that conversation?

User: I could tell them that I’ve been feeling anxious about school and that it’s hard for me to talk about it, but I want their support.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful approach! Being open about your feelings can help them understand what you're going through. Is there a time when you could bring this up with them?

User: Maybe during dinner? That feels like a good time when we’re all relaxed.

Consultant: Dinner sounds like a great opportunity to connect in a comfortable environment. How do you think they might react to hearing what you have to say?

User: I think they would want to help me, especially my mom. She’s always been supportive about my studies.

Consultant: That’s encouraging! Having support from your mom can make a big difference. How would it feel to know that they understand and want to help you?

User: I think that would make me feel less alone and more supported. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Support can make a huge difference during challenging times. As we wrap up today, what key things have you taken away from our conversation?

User: I feel like I have some action steps—messaging my friend and talking to my family. It feels like I have a way to start facing my fears.

Consultant: That’s an important takeaway! Remember, facing these fears gradually can help reduce your anxiety. Next time, we can discuss how these interactions went and explore more strategies to continue your progress.

User: Thank you! I feel lighter and more motivated to take these steps.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiaozhang! You're making valuable progress. I’m here to support you, and I'm looking forward to our next session. 

User: Me too! Thanks!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! I'm really happy to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a little better, actually. I've participated in some family activities, and it feels nice. But I'm still worried about going back to school and the pressure there.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’ve been able to enjoy family activities! It sounds like family support has been helpful. Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you about returning to school?

User: I guess I'm just anxious about seeing my classmates again. What if they ask me why I was gone for so long? I don’t know how to answer that.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It's completely normal to feel anxious about social interactions, especially after some time away. What do you think might be a comfortable way to explain your absence to your classmates?

User: Maybe I could just say I was busy with family stuff. But what if they don’t believe me or think I’m making excuses?

Consultant: I understand that you're worried about their perception. Let’s think about this together—do you believe there’s a chance your classmates would be understanding? How might they react?

User: I think some of them might understand, but I feel like others could be judgmental. I just don't want to feel embarrassed.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a mix of beliefs about how your classmates would respond. What if we challenge this thought a bit—do you think it’s possible that they could have similar experiences or struggles?

User: Yeah, it’s true. I think everyone has their own issues. But still, the anxiety creeps in sometimes, making me think they’ll judge me.

Consultant: That’s completely normal! Anxiety often makes us think the worst of situations. How about we try to reframe that thought? Instead of assuming they will judge you, what if you thought about how they might be supportive or curious?

User: I guess that could work. Maybe they would just want to catch up and not worry about my absence.

Consultant: Exactly! And it could become a chance for you to connect with them. How does that thinking make you feel about the idea of going back?

User: I feel a little more hopeful, I suppose. It seems like maybe I could handle it after all.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Let’s build on that hope. What activities do you think you could participate in when you return to school that might help you feel more involved?

User: Maybe I could join some clubs or teams to meet new people. I always wanted to be part of the art club.

Consultant: Joining the art club could be a fantastic way to express yourself and meet people with similar interests! It sounds like a supportive environment. How about setting a small goal for yourself related to that?

User: I could try to attend the first meeting when school starts. That feels manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan, Xiaozhang! Attending that first meeting can help ease you back into school. What feelings do you anticipate having during that first meeting?

User: I think I might feel a little nervous, but also excited to see what it’s like. 

Consultant: That mix of emotions is completely normal! It’s important to acknowledge both nerves and excitement. What can you tell yourself to manage that nervousness when the time comes?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that it’s okay to be nervous and that everyone else is probably a bit nervous too.

Consultant: That’s a very supportive thought! Acknowledging your feelings and recognizing that others share similar experiences can really help you feel less isolated. How do you feel about discussing this with your family before you go back to school?

User: I think talking to my parents about it could help. They might have some good advice.

Consultant: Talking to your parents sounds like a great idea. They can offer support and insights. What other positive steps can you take to prepare for your return?

User: I could practice some conversation starters to get ready for when I see my classmates.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach! Practicing conversation starters can boost your confidence. Would you like to brainstorm some together?

User: Sure! What about asking them about their summer or if they are joining any clubs?

Consultant: Those are excellent starters! They can make the conversation flow naturally. How do you feel about practicing these starters a bit?

User: That could really help. I’m feeling more like I can do this now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. As we prepare for your school return, I want to emphasize how far you've come. How do you feel about the progress you’ve made?

User: I think I've made good progress. I feel less scared about everything.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Recognizing your progress is crucial. As we wrap up today, could you share one strategy you plan to implement to maintain your confidence moving forward?

User: I’ll remind myself that it's okay to feel nervous and that connecting with others can be a positive experience.

Consultant: That's a beautiful mindset to have, Xiaozhang! Embracing those feelings can lead to meaningful connections. Today was a great session! Remember, you’re not alone in this. Whenever you feel uncertain, just reach out. We’ll continue working together on this journey!

User: Thank you! I'm really looking forward to going back to school now.

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Zhang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling better actually. I started joining some group activities at school, and it’s been really fun. 

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear that you're engaging more with your peers. Can you tell me more about these group activities and how they make you feel?

User: We have a new art club, and I joined in. I like drawing and painting. When I'm there, I feel relaxed and creative. It’s nice to be with friends.

Consultant: Joining the art club sounds like a fantastic way to express yourself and connect with friends. How does this experience affect your confidence in school?

User: I feel like I can talk to people more easily now. Before, I used to feel nervous in class or when talking to others, but now I’m not as afraid.

Consultant: That's an impressive improvement, Xiao Zhang! It sounds like being part of the art club has helped you gain confidence. What specific moments made you realize that your fear was decreasing?

User: There was this time when we had to present our artwork to the class. I was really nervous, but I did it anyway. It felt good to share what I created.

Consultant: Presenting your artwork is a significant step! It shows your courage to express yourself. How did you feel before and after the presentation?

User: Before it was scary, but afterward, I felt proud of myself. Everyone clapped, which made me happy!

Consultant: That's fantastic! Recognition from your classmates can be very motivating. How can we build on this positive experience to help you feel more confident in other school activities or subjects?

User: Maybe I could set small goals for myself, like speaking up more in class discussions or asking questions when I don't understand something.

Consultant: Setting small goals is a great strategy! It allows you to gradually build your confidence. What specific goals would you like to start with for this week?

User: I think I can try to raise my hand at least once in math class and maybe join a discussion group during lunch.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! Raising your hand in class and participating in discussions will surely help you become more comfortable speaking up. How do you feel about trying to achieve those goals?

User: I feel excited but a little nervous too. What if I forget what I want to say?

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about speaking up. If that happens, take a deep breath and remind yourself that it's okay to take a moment to think. What do you think would help you manage that nervousness?

User: Maybe I can practice what I want to say beforehand or write it down on a small paper.

Consultant: Practicing or writing your thoughts can definitely help calm your nerves. Would you like to create a small checklist to prepare for your goals this week?

User: Yes! That would help me feel more organized.

Consultant: Great! Let's outline your checklist: 1) Prepare a question for math class. 2) Raise your hand at least once. 3) Join a discussion group at lunch. Does that sound manageable?

User: Yes, it sounds doable! 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As you work on these goals, remember that it's all about progress, not perfection. Each small step counts. How confident do you feel about starting this week?

User: I feel a bit more confident now, especially since I have a plan.

Consultant: Having a plan is empowering! I believe in your ability to take these steps. Let's also think about how you'll reward yourself for achieving these goals. What might that look like?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to some ice cream or spend extra time drawing.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful rewards! Treating yourself will make reaching your goals even more enjoyable. As we wrap up today, what insights have you gained from our session?

User: I’ve learned that I can set small goals to help me feel more confident and that I should celebrate my progress, no matter how small.

Consultant: Exactly! Celebrating your progress is crucial in reinforcing your achievements. Keep focusing on those small steps, and remember, I’m here to support you. How do you feel about our next session?

User: I’m looking forward to it! I want to share how the week goes.

Consultant: I'm looking forward to hearing all about it too. Remember, you're making great strides. See you next time, Xiao Zhang!

User: Thank you! Bye!
###################
Consultant: Hi there! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, but I still have some moments when I doubt myself during group activities at school. It's like I want to join in, but I hesitate.

Consultant: It's great to hear you're feeling a bit better! It's completely normal to have those doubts, especially when you're trying to join group activities. Can you tell me more about what happens when you start to feel hesitant?

User: Well, sometimes when I'm in a group discussion, I worry that my ideas might not be good enough, and that makes me not want to speak up.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're concerned about how your ideas will be received. This is quite common. Let's explore this a bit deeper—what are some thoughts or beliefs that come to your mind when you hesitate to share your ideas?

User: I often think that if I say something, people might laugh at me or think I'm silly. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling like others might judge you. Those thoughts can be quite powerful. If we examine that belief, how likely do you think it is that someone would actually laugh at your ideas? 

User: I guess it’s not very likely, but I still feel scared. 

Consultant: Fear can definitely hold you back, even when the reality isn't as scary as we perceive. Let's try to challenge that belief—if a friend of yours felt the same way, what would you tell them? 

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has different ideas, and it’s okay if not everyone agrees. 

Consultant: Exactly! You seem to understand that it’s all part of learning together. Let’s work on reminding yourself of those thoughts. How do you think you could confidently express your ideas next time during a group discussion?

User: Maybe I could practice saying my thoughts out loud beforehand or write them down to help me remember.

Consultant: That's a wonderful strategy! Practicing can make a big difference in boosting your confidence. When you prepare, it can feel less daunting to share. Have you thought about when you'll have a chance to try this out?

User: In my next group project, I think I’ll try to share my ideas. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Preparing in advance will help. Let's set a small goal for you—could you write down one idea this week that you want to share with your group?

User: Yes, I can do that! 

Consultant: Fantastic! You’re taking a positive step forward. As you work on this, keep track of how you feel after sharing your idea. Reflecting on it can help you see your progress. 

User: Okay, I’ll remember to do that. 

Consultant: Perfect! And remember, it's totally normal to feel a bit anxious at first. Each time you share, you're building your confidence. Is there anything else that’s been on your mind lately?

User: Sometimes I feel a bit left out during lunch because I can’t find a place to sit. 

Consultant: That can be tough, feeling left out. Can you tell me more about what happens during lunchtime?

User: I usually look for a group to join, but I get nervous that they won’t want me there. 

Consultant: I understand. It’s challenging to approach new groups. If we look at this situation, what are some possible outcomes if you do approach a group?

User: They might invite me to sit with them, or they might ignore me.

Consultant: That’s true; those are two possibilities. But there’s also a chance they’d be happy to have you join! What would it be like to consider that positive outcome as a possibility instead?

User: I guess that would be nice. 

Consultant: Yes, focusing on the positive outcome can help shift your mindset. Would it help if you practiced starting small conversations with one or two classmates next time you're at lunch?

User: Yeah, that could help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: Great! It sounds like you have some strategies in mind to tackle both the group discussions and lunchtime challenges. How are you feeling about these plans so far? 

User: I feel a little more hopeful. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. As you practice these strategies, notice how your emotional responses change over time. We’ll review your experiences next session. 

User: I’m looking forward to it! 

Consultant: Me too! Before we wrap up, let’s talk about how you want to celebrate your small successes over the next week. What would feel meaningful to you?

User: Maybe I can reward myself with some extra screen time for every time I share my ideas or make a new friend at lunch.

Consultant: That sounds like a fun and motivating reward! Celebrating your achievements, no matter how small, is so important. 

User: I like that idea. 

Consultant: Excellent! Remember, growth is all about progress. I’m really proud of you for being willing to try these new strategies. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m here to help you, and I’m excited to see how you progress. Let’s keep building on this confidence and celebrate everything you achieve. 

User: I can’t wait for next time! 

Consultant: Me too! Take care until our next session, and don’t hesitate to jot down any thoughts or feelings you have throughout the week. 

User: I will. Bye for now! 

Consultant: Bye! Looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Zhang! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel really good. I’ve been enjoying my classes and even made some new friends. My dad has been supportive too, which helps a lot.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made some great progress both academically and socially. What specific changes have you noticed in yourself during this time?

User: I’ve become more confident in speaking up during class and joining group activities. It feels nice not to be so shy anymore.

Consultant: That's a fantastic achievement! Building confidence in social settings is significant. Have there been any challenges or moments where you felt your confidence waver?

User: Sometimes I still get nervous during presentations. I worry that I'll mess up or forget what I want to say.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous during presentations. Could you share what thoughts go through your mind when you start to feel that way?

User: I think things like, “What if I embarrass myself?” or “What if they don’t like what I say?” It makes me want to avoid it.

Consultant: Those thoughts can certainly be overwhelming! Let’s break them down. How true do you feel those thoughts are? What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts them?

User: I guess I don’t have much evidence. Most of the time, my classmates seem interested, and they clapped after my last presentation.

Consultant: That’s a great observation! It seems like there’s more positive evidence than negative. If a friend were feeling the same way, how might you encourage them?

User: I’d probably tell them to focus on the good things that might happen instead of the bad ones. 

Consultant: Exactly! You already have the tools to support others, and you can use that same logic for yourself. What if we tried to reframe those anxious thoughts into something more positive?

User: Like thinking, “I can do this,” instead of “What if I fail”? 

Consultant: Yes, that’s a great start! Replacing negative thoughts with supportive and affirmative statements can make a big difference. Do you feel comfortable trying that during your next presentation?

User: I would like to try that! It sounds helpful.

Consultant: Fantastic! We can also think about some techniques to help you manage anxiety just before you present. What strategies have you found helpful in the past when facing challenges?

User: Sometimes I take deep breaths or think of a funny moment to lighten my mood.

Consultant: Breathing techniques and humor are excellent tools! Let’s make a plan for your next presentation that includes both deep breathing and a positive thought. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I like having a plan.

Consultant: Wonderful! This can also be a good opportunity to set some goals for the upcoming weeks. What would you like to achieve besides feeling more comfortable with presentations?

User: I want to get better at math because it’s been tough for me.

Consultant: That’s a solid goal. We can look at ways to improve your math skills, perhaps by joining a study group or asking your teacher for extra help when needed. How does that sound?

User: Yes, that would really help!

Consultant: Great! On top of that, maintaining your positive relationships at school is important. How do you think your friendships have helped your confidence?

User: My friends are really encouraging. They cheer me on when I participate in activities. It makes me feel like I belong.

Consultant: Having supportive friends can be a tremendous boost. How can you strengthen those friendships while working on your personal goals?

User: I can try to invite them to study together or do some fun activities after school.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! By sharing both study time and fun experiences, you’ll not only improve your skills but also deepen those friendships. As we look ahead, what kind of encouragement do you feel you need from home and school?

User: I think my dad and teachers could help by checking in on my progress and encouraging me when I’m trying hard.

Consultant: Communication with your dad and teachers about your goals can indeed provide extra support. Would you feel comfortable discussing this with them?

User: Yes, I think I can. I’ll share my goals with them.

Consultant: Awesome! It sounds like you have a solid plan for continuing your progress. As we wrap up, let’s reflect on everything we’ve discussed today. What do you feel has been your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I realized that I can change how I think about my fears, and I have support from friends and family to help me.

Consultant: That's a powerful insight! Remember, you have the tools and support to navigate these challenges. I’m proud of your progress, Xiao Zhang. If you need any help down the line, you can always come back. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I feel more positive about everything now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to hear that. Keep up the great work, and I look forward to hearing about your continued success next time. Take care!
