Consultant: Hello, Xiaoxing! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really lonely and just... I don't know, like I'm not good enough. I keep thinking about how I really wanted to join my classmates' conversations at school, but they just ignored me. It makes me feel even more isolated.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds really tough to feel ignored by your classmates, especially when you want to connect with them. Can you tell me more about what thoughts were going through your mind when that happened?

User: I just kept thinking that maybe I'm not interesting or fun enough for them to want to talk to me. It really made me question if there's something wrong with me.

Consultant: That sounds really painful. It's understandable to feel down when we perceive being left out. How do you think those thoughts affected your emotions at that moment?

User: I felt really sad and embarrassed. I wanted to cry but had to keep a straight face. It just seems like everyone else gets along so well, and I'm just... there.

Consultant: It sounds like you felt a mix of sadness and embarrassment, which is totally valid. Let's explore these thoughts a bit deeper. When you think you're not interesting or fun enough, how do you usually feel about yourself overall?

User: I start feeling really insecure like I don’t fit in anywhere. It’s exhausting to keep feeling this way.

Consultant: I can imagine how difficult that must be for you. Feeling insecure can be very draining. What do you think could help you cope with those feelings in moments like this?

User: I guess I wish I could just stop overthinking and let myself be. But it’s hard to change how I think.

Consultant: It really is hard to change our thought patterns, especially if they're deeply ingrained. Let's try to challenge some of those thoughts. What evidence do you have that proves you're not interesting or fun?

User: I just look at how they interact and it feels like I'm always on the outside. It’s like they don’t want me there.

Consultant: It’s tough to feel that way. However, sometimes our perceptions can lead us to conclusions that might not be fully accurate. Have you ever had moments when people engaged with you positively?

User: There have been times when my friends chatted with me. But those moments feel rare compared to the times I feel ignored.

Consultant: It's great that you've had those positive interactions! While those moments may feel rare, they still count and matter. What do you think might happen if you allowed yourself to reach out more often despite the fear of rejection?

User: Maybe I'd get more chances to connect, but I'm afraid of being shut down again. 

Consultant: That fear is completely understandable. It’s a natural part of putting ourselves out there. What if we tried a small experiment where you initiate a conversation with someone you feel comfortable with? How does that sound to you?

User: I could try that. Maybe starting with someone I'm closer to could make it easier. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Starting with someone you're comfortable with is a good step. How do you feel about trying this out before our next session?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also hopeful. I think I’ll give it a shot.

Consultant: That's a wonderful mindset to have! Nervousness is normal in new situations. We can also explore how you feel about it afterward. Let's also think about ways to document your emotions throughout this experience. Would you be open to keeping a journal about your thoughts and feelings?

User: Yes, writing things down might help me see patterns.

Consultant: Absolutely! Journaling can provide clarity and help you process your emotions. Let's make this a part of our strategy. Are there any specific feelings you want to focus on documenting?

User: I’d like to note when I feel left out and how that connects to my thoughts about myself.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Recognizing those connections is an important step. As we wrap up today, what’s one thing you hope to take away from this session?

User: I want to feel more aware of my feelings and not beat myself up for them. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful intention. Remember, it’s okay to experience these feelings without judgment. You’re doing an amazing job just by being here and expressing yourself. Before we end, is there anything else on your mind?

User: No, I think we covered a lot. Thank you for listening.

Consultant: You're welcome, Xiaoxing. I'm proud of you for sharing today. Remember, you can manage these feelings, and reaching out is a great step. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hi, welcome to our session today! How are you feeling as we start? What's been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really down and anxious. Recently, I participated in a school project, but no one invited me to join their team, and it made me feel really left out and sad. I keep thinking that I did something wrong.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like that experience really impacted you. Can you tell me more about what thoughts were going through your mind after that happened?

User: I just kept thinking that if they didn’t want me on their team, it must be because I’m not good enough or they don’t like me. I felt so alone.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem really heavy and can definitely contribute to feelings of loneliness and sadness. It’s natural to feel hurt in situations like this. But let’s explore those thoughts a bit—do you think they are based on evidence, or could there be other explanations for why they didn’t invite you?

User: I guess there could be other reasons, but I can’t help but feel it’s because I’m not social enough. My classmates seem closer to each other than to me.

Consultant: It’s understandable that you might feel that way. It sounds like you’re being really hard on yourself. If a friend were feeling like this, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s not their fault and that sometimes things just happen. 

Consultant: Exactly! You would encourage them to see the situation with more compassion. What if we tried to apply that same kindness to your own situation? Could you consider that there might be reasons that aren’t about you at all?

User: That makes sense. Maybe some people just have their own groups and it doesn’t mean they don’t like me. But it’s still hard to not take it personally.

Consultant: It can be really challenging to separate our self-worth from how others treat us. Let’s think about a time when you felt connected with your classmates. What was different in that situation?

User: There was this time during a group project where everyone listened to my ideas, and it felt great. I wish it could always be like that.

Consultant: It sounds like you have valuable contributions to make, and when they are recognized, you feel more connected. Let’s work together to build up your confidence for future interactions. How do you think you might start engaging with your classmates differently next time?

User: Maybe I could reach out more and try to join conversations instead of waiting for an invitation.

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive step! Setting small goals for social interactions can also help. For instance, would you feel comfortable trying to start a conversation with someone in your class this week?

User: I could try that, but I’m still worried about what to say.

Consultant: That’s a common concern! We can brainstorm some topics together that might help ease those worries. What do you think your classmates might enjoy talking about?

User: They often talk about movies or shows. I like some of those too, so maybe I can bring that up.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Finding common ground is a wonderful way to connect. How would you feel about practicing a short conversation with me right now using that topic?

User: Okay, I think I can do that. What should I say?

Consultant: You might start with a simple question like, “Have you seen any good movies lately?” Would you like to give that a try?

User: Sure! “Have you seen any good movies lately?” 

Consultant: That’s perfect! See how natural it sounds. Remember, it’s just a conversation, and focusing on the other person can help take the pressure off yourself.

User: I think I understand now. If I focus more on the conversation rather than just myself, it might help ease my anxiety.

Consultant: Exactly! And it’s okay to feel anxious; it’s a normal part of trying something new. You’re building a new skill. As you practice, it’ll get easier. What are some feelings you expect to experience when you engage with your classmates more actively?

User: I hope it feels less scary and maybe even fun once I get used to it.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset! Thinking about it as an opportunity to enjoy yourself can really change how you approach these situations. What’s one small step you think you can take before our next session?

User: I’ll try to talk to at least one person this week. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! We can discuss how it went during our next meeting. What else can we explore today that might be troubling you regarding your thoughts or feelings?

User: Well, I often feel quite anxious about my family too. My dad drinks a bit, and it makes me tense. I worry that it’s my fault because I don’t communicate well with him.

Consultant: That sounds tough and it's completely understandable to feel anxious in that kind of environment. It’s important to remember that family dynamics can be complicated. Let's talk about your feelings—what specifically makes you feel like it’s your fault?

User: I feel like if I could have talked to him better, maybe he wouldn’t drink as much. 

Consultant: I hear you, and it’s natural to want to take responsibility in situations where we care about others. But it’s also crucial to recognize that you’re not solely responsible for someone else’s choices. What might be a healthier way for you to communicate your feelings to him?

User: I could try telling him how I feel when he drinks and how it affects me. 

Consultant: That’s a brave step! Sharing your feelings can be very powerful and can help him understand your perspective better. What’s stopping you from having that conversation right now?

User: I guess I’m worried he might get angry or not understand.

Consultant: Those concerns are valid. It’s important to feel safe. What if you approached the conversation gently, focusing on how you feel rather than blaming anyone? 

User: That would probably make things easier. 

Consultant: Yes, sharing “I” statements often makes a big difference in communication. Practicing that may help you feel less anxious approaching him. How about we try a role-play where you express your feelings?

User: Okay, I’d like to practice that.

Consultant: Great! You could start with something like, “I feel anxious when I see you drinking because I love you and want us to be close.” Would you like to give that a try?

User: Sure. “I feel anxious when I see you drinking because I love you and want us to be close.”

Consultant: That was wonderful! Expressing your feelings honestly is so important. How do you feel about that approach now?

User: I feel a bit better, like I actually have a way to say how I feel.

Consultant: That’s excellent progress! You’re recognizing your emotions and taking steps to express them. Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous about these conversations; it means you care.  

User: Thank you. I appreciate your help with all this.

Consultant: I'm glad to assist you. We’ve made great strides today in building your confidence and exploring ways to communicate better. I believe that with practice, you'll feel more comfortable. Let’s recap what you’ll focus on before our next session. 

User: I’ll talk to someone at school and also try to express my feelings to my dad.

Consultant: Exactly! I’m looking forward to hearing how those conversations go. Thank you for sharing so openly today. Remember, it's all about growth, one step at a time. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful now.

Consultant: That’s exactly what we aim for. You're doing great, and I'm here to support you. Looking forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoxing! I’m glad you’re here today. How have you been feeling lately, especially with everything going on at home? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious. My parents and I had a big argument about money, and I keep thinking it's all my fault. I can't shake off this feeling of dread.

Consultant: It sounds really tough to be in that situation. You feel anxious and believe you might be to blame for the conflict with your parents. Can you tell me more about what happened during the argument?

User: Well, they were arguing about how much to spend on things for me, and I feel guilty because I think they work hard for it. I just can't stop worrying that I'm causing them stress.

Consultant: It seems like you’re feeling overwhelmed by guilt, even though it's not solely your responsibility. Let’s try to unpack those feelings a bit. When you think about the argument, what thoughts come to mind?

User: I keep thinking that I should be more understanding. Maybe if I didn't ask for things, they wouldn't fight. Sometimes I feel like I'm a burden to them.

Consultant: I can see how those thoughts can really weigh you down. It’s important to recognize that seeking support and having needs doesn’t make you a burden. Have you felt this way before in other situations?

User: Yes, especially when I get frustrated or upset. I just feel like I’m always causing problems, you know? Like I’m not good enough.

Consultant: It sounds like you might be viewing situations in a very negative light. When you have those thoughts of not being good enough, how does that affect how you feel and behave?

User: It makes me really sad and makes me want to isolate myself. I end up spending more time alone instead of talking to anyone.

Consultant: I understand that feeling. Isolation can sometimes feel safer, but it may also prolong your sadness. What if we explored some ways for you to express your feelings to your parents more openly?

User: I guess I could try, but I’m scared they won’t understand. What if they just get mad at me again?

Consultant: It’s natural to feel apprehensive about communication, especially after a conflict. One strategy we can try is role-playing a conversation with them. How do you think your parents would react if you expressed your feelings about both the argument and your needs?

User: They might be surprised. I usually just keep things to myself, but I hope they could see my side.

Consultant: Let’s practice that! Imagine you have the chance to tell your mother how you’re feeling. What would you say to her?

User: I would say that I don’t want to cause problems and that I feel bad when we argue about money. I just want us to be okay.

Consultant: That’s a great start! You’re expressing your feelings without directly blaming anyone. Now, how do you think your mother would respond to that?

User: I think she might listen, but I don’t know if she would understand everything I feel.

Consultant: It’s okay to have that uncertainty. Sometimes it helps to share specific examples of how you feel. Would you like to try saying a bit more about a specific instance that illustrates your feelings?

User: I could tell her about when I wanted something and felt guilty because I know they are trying to save money. I feel bad asking for things.

Consultant: That’s excellent! Sharing specific moments can really help them understand your perspective better. After practicing this, how do you feel about talking to your mom?

User: I feel a little more prepared, but still nervous. What if she reacts badly?

Consultant: It’s completely valid to feel nervous. Remember, you’re sharing your feelings to create understanding. You might also want to consider how you would respond if she didn’t react as you hoped. What could you tell yourself in that moment?

User: I suppose I could remind myself that it’s okay to feel how I feel and that it’s not completely on me if she doesn't understand right away.

Consultant: That’s a powerful thought! It’s important to be kind to yourself, even when others might not respond as expected. As we move forward, let’s keep focusing on building up your confidence in this communication. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good. I think I really want to work on this.

Consultant: Perfect! We’ve made great progress today in understanding your feelings and expressing them. How are you feeling about our conversation so far?

User: I feel lightened a bit just talking about it. It’s nice to have someone listen and help me think things through.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Xiaoxing. We’ll continue to build on this foundation in our next session, and I believe you will find ways to communicate that feel genuine and true to you. 

User: Thanks! I’m looking forward to it. I hope I can make things better.

Consultant: You’re already taking steps toward improvement, and I believe in your ability to make progress. Remember, communication is a skill that can be developed over time. We’ll work on it together. 

User: Thank you! I feel hopeful about it. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep practicing those expressions, and we’ll check in with your progress soon. Remember, I’m here if you ever need to talk.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoxing! I'm glad you're here today. Before we start, I want to understand how you've been feeling lately. Could you share a little about why you wanted to come in for a session today?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really misunderstood by my mom. Recently, she called me too sensitive, and it hurt because I already feel so alone and sad. I wish she could support me more instead of making me feel worse.

Consultant: It sounds like you've been feeling quite isolated and you really need some emotional support from your mom. Let’s explore that a bit more—what do you wish your mom would understand about what you’re going through?

User: I just want her to see how overwhelmed I feel. I'd like her to realize that I’m trying my best. But instead, I feel like she thinks I’m just being dramatic.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. You’re feeling overwhelmed and want her to acknowledge your efforts rather than dismiss them. What do you think causes her to respond in that way?

User: I guess she’s really tired from work, and when she gets stressed, she tends to snap. But it still feels unfair to me, you know?

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. You're dealing with your struggles, and when her stress impacts you, it becomes even harder. Have you had a chance to talk to her about how her comments affect you?

User: No, I haven’t. I’m afraid if I tell her, she’ll just say I’m overreacting again. It just makes me feel worse.

Consultant: That fear of being dismissed can be really overwhelming. It can feel like a lose-lose situation. What if we discuss some ways you could communicate your feelings to her without feeling like you’re going to be shot down?

User: That would be great, but I’m not sure if I can express myself without getting upset.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel nervous about expressing your feelings. One way to approach this could be to use "I" statements, which can help to communicate your feelings without sounding accusatory. For example, instead of saying “You always say I’m too sensitive,” you could say, “I feel hurt when I hear that because I’m trying really hard.” How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds a bit easier. I can try saying how I feel instead of pointing fingers. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on your own feelings can often encourage more understanding and connection. Would you like to practice expressing that kind of sentiment together?

User: Sure! I actually want to try telling her that I feel sad when I hear her call me sensitive.

Consultant: That’s a good start! So, let’s think about how you might begin that conversation. You could say, “Mom, I wanted to talk to you about something. Sometimes, when you call me sensitive, it makes me feel sad because I’m struggling a lot at school.” How does that resonate with you?

User: I think that sounds alright. It says how I feel without blaming her.

Consultant: Exactly! It helps to express yourself without putting her on the defensive. Now, let’s discuss how you might prepare for the conversation. What do you think could help you feel more confident about talking to her?

User: Maybe I could write down what I want to say. That way I won’t forget or get too emotional.

Consultant: Writing it down is a fantastic idea! It can help you stay focused on what you want to communicate. Additionally, practicing in front of a mirror or with me can also build your confidence. Would you find that helpful?

User: Yes, that would really help me feel ready. 

Consultant: Great! It’s all about finding what makes you comfortable. Let’s think about a possible scenario—imagine how she might respond. What are some positive or neutral reactions she could have?

User: I hope she might listen and actually consider what I’m saying. That would be nice.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful hope! And it’s certainly possible. If she listens and understands, it would be a positive outcome. If she doesn’t respond the way you hope, what will you do next?

User: I guess I’d have to remind myself that it’s not just me. She has her own issues too.

Consultant: That’s very insightful! Recognizing her struggles can help you manage your expectations and emotions. It might be beneficial to remind yourself that communication can take time. How do you feel about setting a goal for this week?

User: I think I can work on writing down my feelings and possibly talking to her by the end of the week.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! By taking those steps, you’re working towards improving your communication with her. Just remember, it’s okay to feel anxious about it, but every step counts. 

User: I feel a bit more confident about this now. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Before we finish, let’s quickly recap what we’ve discussed. By focusing on your feelings, practicing your words, and preparing for possible responses, you’re setting yourself up for a more productive conversation with your mom. 

User: Yes, I feel like I have a strategy now. 

Consultant: Perfect! And remember, whatever happens, you are taking positive steps forward. If you practice this communication strategy, it can open doors for better understanding. I’m here to support you whenever you need. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate it. 

Consultant: You're welcome! I believe in you. Next session, we can discuss how the conversation went and any feelings that came up. Take care, Xiaoxing!

User: Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Xing! I'm happy to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit anxious, especially about trying to talk more with my classmates. I’ve started to approach them, but I still worry that I might say something silly or not fit in. 

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way. Stepping out of your comfort zone can be really challenging. Can you share a specific situation where you tried to talk to a classmate recently?

User: Well, last week, I tried to join a group discussion in class. I wanted to give my opinion, but when I spoke, I felt really self-conscious. It didn’t go as smoothly as I hoped.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like it was a nerve-wracking experience for you. What thoughts were going through your mind when you felt self-conscious during the discussion?

User: I kept thinking that everyone was judging me and that they would laugh at what I said. I felt really small and just wanted to disappear.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It's common to have those kinds of thoughts when we feel vulnerable. What emotions did you experience during that moment?

User: I felt embarrassed and a bit sad afterward. I thought about how I could have said things differently and it just made me feel worse.

Consultant: I can see how that would be very discouraging. Let’s take a moment to consider those thoughts—do you think they are entirely true? What evidence do you have that supports or challenges those beliefs?

User: Well, I guess there's no real evidence that anyone was laughing. They might have just been focused on the topic. But in that moment, it felt very real.

Consultant: That's great insight, Xiao Xing. Sometimes our emotions can distort our perception of situations. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their experience? 

User: I would probably tell them it’s okay to make mistakes and that everyone feels awkward sometimes. It’s just a part of learning.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re showing compassion towards a friend, which is wonderful. Now, how about we apply that same understanding to yourself? What would happen if you treated yourself with the same kindness? 

User: I guess I could remind myself it’s normal to be nervous and that I’m still learning to communicate better.

Consultant: That's a good start! Let's practice some techniques to help you navigate those stressful situations. How about we role-play a social scenario together right now?

User: That sounds good! I think practicing could help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you are approaching a classmate during a break. What would you say to start a conversation?

User: I might say "Hi, how are you?" but I worry they might not respond well.

Consultant: It’s a simple and friendly opener! Remember, even if their response isn’t what you expect, it doesn’t reflect on you. Let’s try it out together; I’ll be your classmate. 

User: Okay! *nervously smiles* Hi, how are you?

Consultant: Hi, Xiao Xing! I'm good, thanks! How about you? 

User: I’m okay! Just a bit stressed about schoolwork. 

Consultant: That’s relatable. School can be really demanding. What subjects are you finding most challenging right now?

User: I’m struggling with math. It just doesn’t make sense sometimes!

Consultant: You’re doing well! You’re expressing yourself clearly. After these kinds of exchanges, how do you think you would feel? 

User: I think I would feel a little more confident, knowing I can talk about my struggles.

Consultant: Exactly! Confidence builds with practice. We can keep working on these social interactions together. What do you think would be a good next step for you after today?

User: Maybe I can try to approach a classmate again and use what we practiced here. I’ll remind myself it’s okay to feel awkward.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! You’ve shown a lot of courage in stepping forward today. How do you feel about your progress since our last session?

User: I feel a bit better! I think I’m slowly gaining some confidence and it feels nice to practice.

Consultant: You're doing an amazing job, Xiao Xing! As we continue with our sessions, we’ll build on this progress. Is there anything specific you’d like to focus on next time?

User: Perhaps I could work on handling rejection or unresponsive classmates. That’s something I worry about a lot.

Consultant: That's a valuable topic to explore. We’ll make it our focus next time. For now, let's recap everything you learned today and celebrate your achievements. 

User: Okay! I feel proud of myself for practicing and for being more open about my feelings.

Consultant: You should be proud! Recognizing your progress is important. Just remember, developing social skills takes time and practice. You’re on the right path!

User: Thank you for your support! I feel more motivated to continue.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiao Xing! Remember, keep practicing those skills and be kind to yourself in the process. I look forward to our next session! 

User: I can't wait! See you next time! 

Consultant: Take care and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hi, Little Star! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a little better, actually. I went to a family gathering recently, and it felt nice to be included. I think I’m starting to connect more with my family.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like that gathering provided you with a sense of support and acceptance. Can you share what you thought made that experience positive for you?

User: I think just being around my family and having conversations without feeling judged helped a lot. It felt different this time, and I noticed I was more open.

Consultant: It’s great that you felt able to be more open. Building those connections is important. How do you think this positive experience could help you in your daily life, especially at school or with friends?

User: I feel like if I can stay connected with my family, I might feel less anxious about being around other people. It could help me be more social at school, too.

Consultant: Connecting with your family can definitely create a foundation of support. As you think about your school experiences, what specific situations do you find challenging when it comes to socializing or feeling anxious?

User: Sometimes, I worry a lot about how others perceive me. I get nervous when I have to speak up in class or when I want to join in on a group conversation. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s natural to feel anxious about how others view us. Have you noticed any automatic thoughts that come to your mind in those situations, like specific worries or fears?

User: Yes, I often think things like “What if I sound silly?” or “What if they don’t like what I say?” Those thoughts make me hesitate to join in.

Consultant: Those thoughts can certainly be overwhelming. Let’s explore them a bit. What evidence do you have that supports those worries? Is there another way to look at those situations?

User: I guess, when I think about it, most of the time my friends and teachers are supportive. But in the moment, I forget that and just feel scared.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way under pressure. It can be helpful to remind yourself of those supportive experiences when those anxious thoughts arise. How could you challenge those fears in future situations?

User: Maybe I could try reminding myself that I do have friends who care about me, and it’s okay to make mistakes. I think I should just focus on sharing my thoughts instead of worrying so much.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Focusing on sharing rather than on potential judgment could free you from some of that anxiety. What would it take for you to practice this new way of thinking in school?

User: I could start by voicing my thoughts in smaller groups first or even with friends before I speak up in class. That might help me build confidence.

Consultant: Starting with smaller groups is a smart move! It allows you to share your thoughts without feeling too pressured. How do you feel about setting a goal for yourself to practice this strategy over the next week?

User: That sounds good! I can aim to speak up more in study groups or during lessons when I feel comfortable. 

Consultant: Excellent! It’s really empowering to take steps toward your goals. Let’s think about how to track your progress. What might help you reflect on how you're doing after trying this for a week?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal to write down my experiences after each class or group activity.

Consultant: Keeping a journal sounds like a valuable tool! It can help you process your feelings and note any positive changes. Would you like to discuss how to address any challenges you might face as you work toward this goal?

User: I think it’s important to acknowledge that I might still feel anxious. I just hope I can still manage it and not let it stop me.

Consultant: Acknowledging that is key! It’s okay to feel anxious, but with practice, those feelings can become easier to handle. Remember, take small steps, and celebrate each success you have, no matter how minor it may seem.

User: I will keep that in mind. I’ll try not to be too hard on myself if I have some setbacks.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Learn and grow from each experience. Let’s check in on your progress next time. What do you think about our focus today? 

User: I think it was really helpful. It feels good to have a plan. I’m looking forward to trying it out!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear you’re feeling positive about it. Remember, you have the support you need. Before we wrap up, is there anything you’d like to add or any questions you have?

User: No, I just appreciate this session. Thanks for helping me feel more hopeful!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Little Star! It’s been a pleasure to see your progress. I'm looking forward to hearing how your experiences go in our next session. Take care, and remember, you’re making great strides!
