Consultant: Hello, Mr. Zhang! I’m glad you’re here today. Let's start by discussing what’s been on your mind lately. How have you been feeling recently?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious again. I started experiencing severe heart palpitations and chest tightness, just like before. It's been happening more often, and I'm worried about what's causing it.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you’re feeling quite overwhelmed by these symptoms. Can you tell me more about what thoughts go through your mind when these palpitations occur?

User: When it happens, I can't help but think that there must be something seriously wrong with me. My mind races with the possibilities of misdiagnosis or that the doctors might have missed something important.

Consultant: It’s understandable that you’d feel that way, especially given your past experiences. Those thoughts can be really distressing. How does thinking that way affect your emotions during these episodes?

User: It just makes me even more anxious. I feel trapped in a cycle of panic, and it’s like I'm constantly on alert, waiting for the next episode. It’s exhausting.

Consultant: That sounds very tiring indeed. I want to explore how those thoughts connect to how you feel. Can you recall specific thoughts that come to mind when these episodes happen?

User: I often think things like "What if this time it's serious?" or "I can't handle this again." Those thoughts drive my anxiety through the roof.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very intense. It seems quite challenging to manage that level of anxiety. Let's consider them together. Do you think there might be any evidence to support these fearful thoughts?

User: Not really. I’ve been checked several times, and the doctors assure me there’s nothing serious. But it’s hard to ignore those fears when I feel this way.

Consultant: It must be frustrating to hear reassurance but still feel that anxiety. What if we looked at alternative perspectives? If a friend were experiencing similar thoughts, what might you suggest to them?

User: I would probably tell them to trust the doctors and that worrying doesn’t help. I wish I could believe that for myself.

Consultant: It makes sense. You recognize the logic there, but it’s challenging to apply it to yourself. Let’s try a small experiment. The next time you feel these symptoms, what if you tried talking back to those anxious thoughts? For example, tell yourself, "I have been cleared by doctors before."

User: That sounds helpful, but I'm afraid it won't work. I usually just give in to panic.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Change takes time, and it’s okay to be skeptical. Maybe try it once and see how it feels. What’s one thing you could say to yourself that might provide some comfort?

User: Maybe I could say, “I’ve been through this before, and I’m okay.” But I worry it won’t be enough to calm me down.

Consultant: That’s a good start! Remember, the goal isn’t to eliminate anxiety completely but to manage it better. How do you feel about practicing that affirmation the next time? 

User: I’ll try. It sounds simple, but I think I can remember to do it when I'm overwhelmed.

Consultant: Great! Alongside that, let’s think about activities that help you relax. Have you engaged in anything enjoyable or calming recently?

User: Not really. When I feel anxious, everything just feels too much, and I avoid doing things I usually like.

Consultant: That’s common when anxiety takes over. Let’s brainstorm a few small activities that might be manageable for you. Even a short walk or listening to music could be starting points. What do you think?

User: I used to enjoy going for walks. I can try doing that again, even if it’s just around the neighborhood.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step! It’s all about small victories. Regularly doing something you enjoy can help reduce that anxiety over time. 

User: I like the idea! I’ll aim to walk more this week. 

Consultant: Fantastic! During that time, also remind yourself that your feelings are valid, but they don’t define reality. It’s important to be gentle with yourself through this process. 

User: I’ll keep that in mind. It feels good to have something actionable to focus on. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflection and taking action will help you feel more in control. How do you feel about what we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel a bit relieved actually. Talking about it and having some strategies makes it less overwhelming.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up, let's reflect on what we’ve achieved today. You’re starting to build a new understanding of your anxiety, and you have some strategies to work with. 

User: Yes, that sounds true. I just need to keep reminding myself that I can face this. 

Consultant: Exactly! Remember, it’s a journey, not a sprint. You’re making strides, and I believe you can manage this. If those feelings of panic return or become overwhelming, don’t hesitate to reach out for support.

User: Thank you. I appreciate that. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Mr. Zhang. I'm looking forward to our next session and hearing about your progress. Take care until then!

User: Thank you! I'll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Lao Zhang! I'm really glad you could come to this session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hello. I've been thinking a lot about work and my ability to perform. Since the panic attacks have become more frequent, I'm starting to doubt my skills. It really makes me anxious.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like these panic attacks are making you feel uncertain about your capabilities, which is understandably distressing. Can you share more about how this anxiety affects your daily work?

User: Whenever I have tasks to complete, I feel this tightness in my chest and a rush of fear. It's like my mind is pulling me into that state of panic even before I start.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It's quite common for anxiety to manifest physically in situations like this. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come to your mind when you start feeling this way?

User: Yes, I often think things like "I can't handle this" or "What if I mess up?" It's almost like my brain is stuck on these negative thoughts.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite powerful in reinforcing your anxiety. Let's explore them a bit further. What do you feel when you think things like "I can't handle this"?

User: It just makes me feel weaker, like I'm not fit for the job. That leads to even more anxiety about failing.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts create a cycle of anxiety and self-doubt. What if we tried to challenge those thoughts? What evidence do you have that supports those negative beliefs about your abilities?

User: Well, I guess I’ve completed many tasks successfully in the past, but those moments feel overshadowed by my current fears.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to acknowledge your past successes. If a friend were in your situation, how might you advise them regarding those negative thoughts?

User: I would probably tell them that they’ve done well before and that they shouldn’t let anxiety take over. They should be kinder to themselves.

Consultant: That's a great perspective. It seems like you can see how negative thoughts can distort your self-view. How might you apply that same kindness to yourself when dealing with anxiety over work?

User: Maybe I could remind myself of my strengths and past achievements when I start feeling anxious.

Consultant: Absolutely, that self-affirmation could be a useful strategy. What’s one small step you can take to start incorporating this self-kindness into your day-to-day work routine?

User: I could write down some of my past achievements and keep the list on my desk to remind myself when I start feeling anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Having a physical reminder can be very helpful. Let’s talk about your social interactions—how do you feel those panic attacks might affect you in social situations?

User: I worry that social situations might trigger another attack, and that makes me anxious even before going out.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially with your experiences. What if we looked into ways you could prepare yourself for social events to reduce that anxiety?

User: I suppose I could practice some breathing exercises before going out. It might help calm my mind.

Consultant: Breathing exercises can be very effective. We can practice some techniques that you can use. How does the idea of preparing and practicing make you feel about attending social gatherings?

User: It feels a bit more manageable. If I have strategies to calm myself, it gives me some hope.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! Encouraging yourself to shift your focus can be empowering. Are there any specific social events coming up that you’re particularly anxious about?

User: Yes, there is a team gathering in a few days. I'm already feeling nervous about it.

Consultant: Let's focus on that. What is the worst-case scenario that you fear might happen during the gathering?

User: I fear I might have a panic attack and draw attention to myself. It feels humiliating.

Consultant: That’s a difficult thought to carry. But what’s the likelihood of that happening based on your past experiences? Have you had similar fears that didn’t come true before?

User: Yes, there were times I thought I would panic but ended up just being able to participate normally. 

Consultant: That’s valuable insight, Lao Zhang. Reminding yourself of those previous experiences could help. What alternative thought might help you when that fear starts creeping in?

User: I could think, "I’ve handled gatherings before, and even if I feel anxious, it doesn’t mean I can’t enjoy myself."

Consultant: That’s an excellent coping thought! As we start to wrap up our session today, how do you feel about using these strategies in the upcoming days?

User: I feel more equipped and optimistic. I guess acknowledging my strengths helps shift my mindset.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, facing anxiety is a process, and it’s great to see you taking these steps. For our next session, we can review how these strategies worked for you and adjust them if needed. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I look forward to discussing my progress.

Consultant: I’m glad! Remember, it’s a journey and every bit of progress counts. If you find yourself struggling, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m here to help. Take care, Lao Zhang!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Lao Zhang! I'm glad you're here today. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing some anxiety in social situations recently. Can you share a bit about what you've been feeling?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been really anxious around social gatherings. At the last family gathering, I felt that familiar heart racing and tightness in my chest. It’s making me hesitant to attend such events.

Consultant: I can understand how overwhelming that must feel, especially given your past experiences with panic attacks. What do you think causes that anxiety when you're in a social setting?

User: I worry that the panic may strike again. It feels like I can't control it, and I never know when it might happen, which makes me feel trapped.

Consultant: That’s a very valid concern. It's like you're anticipating the fear before even arriving at the event. What would it mean for you if you could manage that anxiety and feel more at ease in those situations?

User: If I could manage it, I think I would enjoy spending time with my family more. I hate missing out because I'm afraid of something that might not even happen.

Consultant: Enjoying family time is definitely important. Let's work on strategies to gradually expose you to those social situations in a way that feels manageable. Have you thought about starting with smaller gatherings?

User: Yes, I think that could help. Perhaps I could invite just a couple of close relatives over instead of a big family gathering.

Consultant: That sounds like a great step! Starting small can help build your confidence. When you think about this smaller gathering, what specific feelings arise for you?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also hopeful that I can handle it better than with larger groups.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous. Let’s focus on that hope. What do you think you could do to prepare for this small gathering and ensure you feel more in control?

User: Maybe I could practice some relaxation techniques before they arrive. Deep breathing or something like that could help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Deep breathing can be very effective. Would you like to learn more about how to use those techniques before the gathering?

User: Yes, please. I’d like to be ready so I don’t feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Great! You can try this: take a deep breath in for a count of four, hold it for four, and then exhale slowly for a count of six. Doing this several times can calm your nervous system.

User: That sounds doable. I’ll definitely try that.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. Also, when you're with your relatives, consider setting small goals for interaction. What might those goals look like?

User: Maybe I could try to start a conversation and stay engaged for a short period, like five minutes?

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect goal! It’s about making progress at your own pace. How do you feel about trying that?

User: I feel more encouraged about it. I think I can manage that.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Lao Zhang. Remember, it’s okay to take things step by step. After trying this out, we can discuss how it went and adjust if needed. What do you think?

User: Yes, I’d like that. It feels good to have a plan in place.

Consultant: Exactly! Having a plan can provide a sense of control. What concerns do you still have regarding this social interaction?

User: I guess I'm still worried that my symptoms will just return suddenly.

Consultant: That’s a natural worry given your experience. How about we create a small coping statement that you can remind yourself of if that happens? This might help reduce your fear.

User: That sounds helpful. What should it say?

Consultant: You could say, “I’ve handled these feelings before, and I can do it again. I’m safe, and I can take this one moment at a time.” How does that sound to you?

User: I like that! It feels reassuring.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Putting these affirmations into practice can help shift your mindset. As we move forward, how do you think you can incorporate this coping statement in your daily life?

User: I will try to repeat it to myself while I'm preparing for the gathering. I think it will help calm me down.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Consistent practice can really make a difference. Let’s also talk about how you could reward yourself after the gathering, regardless of how it goes.

User: Maybe I could treat myself to a nice meal afterward. That might motivate me to go.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely idea! Positive reinforcement can really help build confidence. What other rewards can you think of for after successful interactions?

User: I could watch my favorite movie or go for a walk in the park. Those things make me feel good.

Consultant: Those are wonderful rewards! They can help solidify the positive feelings you experience when you face your anxiety. Before we wrap up, how do you feel about the strategies we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel more hopeful. I have some actionable steps to take. It's nice to have a plan.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Feeling hopeful is such an important shift. We can keep working on this together. How about we plan to review your experiences in our next session?

User: Yes, I look forward to it. Thank you for your help today!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Lao Zhang! I’m excited for you to try these strategies. Remember, take it one step at a time. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Lao Zhang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to apply some of the pressure management techniques I learned, but I still find myself feeling anxious at times. The fear of panic attacks lingers in my mind, especially when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: It sounds like you're making progress in applying those techniques but still grappling with anxiety and the fear of panic attacks. Can you tell me more about what specific situations trigger those feelings for you?

User: Sure, there are times when small things at work or home seem to pile up. When that happens, I feel this tightness in my chest and worry that another panic attack might hit me.

Consultant: I understand. It seems that when you experience these situations, your physical sensations trigger thoughts of a potential panic attack. How do those thoughts make you feel in those moments?

User: They make me feel trapped and helpless. It's as if I'm always waiting for the next attack, which only adds to my stress.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling trapped in that cycle. Let’s explore the automatic thoughts that come to mind during those moments. Can you recall a specific thought you had during a recent instance of anxiety?

User: I remember thinking, "What if this turns into a panic attack, and I can't handle it?" That thought just spirals out of control.

Consultant: That thought sounds quite overwhelming. It’s understandable that you’d feel anxious with such a belief. Let's examine the evidence for that thought. How likely do you think it is that you’ll actually lose control during those situations?

User: I guess it’s not very likely. I’ve been through it before, and while it felt horrible, I always came out of it okay.

Consultant: That’s a valuable realization, Lao Zhang. It’s important to remind yourself that although it feels very real, you have coped with these feelings before. Let’s try to reframe that thought. Instead of "What if this turns into a panic attack?", what could be a more balanced or rational thought?

User: Maybe something like, "Even if I feel anxious, I can use my techniques to manage it"? 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a much more empowering thought. It affirms your skills and reinforces your ability to handle anxiety. How does this new thought make you feel in comparison to the previous one?

User: I feel a bit more in control just thinking about it. It’s a relief to realize I have tools I can use.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Feeling in control can make a significant difference. Now, let’s think about practical ways you can use those techniques. Are there specific breathing or mindfulness exercises you’ve found helpful in the past?

User: I remember we talked about deep breathing. I haven't practiced it as much as I should, but I know it can help.

Consultant: Deep breathing can indeed be a powerful tool. How about we set a small goal for you? You could practice deep breathing for just a few minutes each day. How does that sound?

User: That sounds manageable. I can definitely set aside a few minutes for that.

Consultant: Wonderful! Also, in stressful moments, you might find it helpful to remind yourself of this new thought you developed. Let’s reinforce that by planning a few situations where you can use this approach. What do you think?

User: Yes! I see how practicing it regularly could help. Maybe I can use it during busy days at work or when there’s tension at home.

Consultant: Those are excellent opportunities to practice. It’s about integrating these techniques into your daily life. Additionally, I want to ask if you’ve had moments where you felt supported by others during these challenging times?

User: I haven’t really shared much with others. I’ve always felt it was something I had to handle on my own, but maybe I should reach out.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Lao Zhang. Sharing your experiences can be very therapeutic and could help you feel less isolated. Who do you think you could talk to about this?

User: I suppose my wife would be a good person to open up to. She’s often been there for me, even if I haven’t expressed what I’m going through.

Consultant: That sounds like a great choice! Opening up to her can strengthen your support network. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I’m a bit nervous, but I feel it could help. I know she cares for me.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous, but it’s a positive step towards building that support system. How about setting a time to chat with her this week?

User: I can try to find a moment this weekend when we can sit down and talk. 

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan! Remember, this is a journey, and it’s okay to take it step by step. Before we finish today’s session, let’s review what we’ve discussed. What are your key takeaways?

User: I need to practice deep breathing daily and be mindful of my thoughts. I also want to share my feelings with my wife to get her support.

Consultant: Yes, those are excellent takeaways! You are strengthening your ability to manage anxiety and enhancing your support network. Keep reminding yourself of the progress you’re making. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about managing my anxiety now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Lao Zhang. I believe in your ability to implement these strategies. Remember, it’s all about small steps. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: I will! Thanks for your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your progress during our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Lao Zhang! I'm glad to see you again. How are you feeling today, and what would you like to discuss in our session?

User: Hello! I'm feeling a bit better since our last meeting. Sharing my experiences in the group has helped, but I still feel some lingering anxiety, especially when I think about how to manage my panic attacks.

Consultant: It's great to hear that sharing has been helpful for you. Let's explore your feelings a bit more—what specifically brings you anxiety when managing your panic attacks?

User: I worry about having a panic attack in public or when I’m alone. The thought of it makes me anxious, and sometimes I feel like I'm being judged, even though I know that's probably not the case.

Consultant: That sounds challenging. It’s common to feel anxious about potential situations where we might feel vulnerable. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that come to your mind when you start feeling anxious in those situations?

User: I often think, "What if I can't control it?" or "What if people see me panicking?" Those thoughts just make everything worse.

Consultant: I understand. Those thoughts can create a cycle of fear and anxiety. Let's try to identify how these thoughts affect your feelings. When you think, "What if I can't control it?", what emotions do you notice in that moment?

User: I feel a rush of fear and sometimes even shame. It’s like I’m suddenly overwhelmed by what’s going on around me.

Consultant: Those feelings of fear and shame can be quite intense. It seems that your thoughts are closely connected to your emotions. Would you say there's a pattern in how you react when you experience these feelings?

User: Definitely. I tend to isolate myself or avoid situations where I think I might panic. It feels safer that way, but I know it's not helping me in the long run.

Consultant: It makes sense to want to feel safe, but avoidance can sometimes reinforce those fears. Let’s look at some ways to challenge those thoughts. When you think about not being in control, what evidence do you have that supports this thought? And are there any alternative ways to view the situation?

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence that I’d lose control. It’s more of a fear in my head. Maybe if I view it differently, like reminding myself that I’ve managed these feelings before, it might help.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive way to reframe your thinking. Recognizing your past experiences can empower you. Can you think of a time when you felt anxious but were able to cope with it effectively?

User: Yes, during the group sharing last time, I felt nervous at first but managed to speak about my experiences. The support I received helped me feel more at ease.

Consultant: That’s a great example of your resilience, Lao Zhang! It shows that you can face anxiety and still engage with others. How can you remind yourself of this experience when you feel those anxious thoughts creeping in again?

User: Maybe I can write it down or even practice what I might say to myself in those moments. Like, "I have shared my experiences successfully before, and I can handle this."

Consultant: That sounds like a helpful strategy! Writing these affirmations down can create a tangible reminder of your strength. Let’s also think about how you can gradually expose yourself to situations that make you feel anxious. What might be a small step you could take in this direction?

User: I could try going to a small gathering with friends, even if I feel a bit anxious. Just being around people might help me practice managing those feelings.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Gradually facing those situations can help reduce fear over time. Remember to give yourself credit for each step you take, no matter how small. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It sounds manageable, especially if I remind myself of my past successes.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Lao Zhang! Building on your past successes can really help strengthen your confidence. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed. You’ve recognized the importance of challenging negative thoughts, sharing your experiences, and gradually facing anxiety-provoking situations. 

User: Yes, and I think writing down my experiences and affirmations is a good way to cope.

Consultant: Exactly! Now, as you think about the future, what strategies can you use to maintain these skills and continue your progress?

User: I can keep attending group sessions, practice my affirmations, and take small steps to face my fears. I feel more equipped now.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset, Lao Zhang! You’ve worked hard to reach this point. Remember, it’s a journey, and you have the tools to manage your feelings moving forward. If you ever find yourself in need of support, I’m here for you.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance. I look forward to applying what I've learned.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Keep nurturing that support network, and I believe you’ll continue to grow. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Lao Zhang! It’s great to see you today. I'm looking forward to continuing our work together. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a lot better, to be honest. The panic attacks have become less frequent, and I feel like I've gained a better understanding of my emotions.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made significant progress. Can you share more about what you think contributed to this improvement?

User: Well, I've been trying to apply the techniques we discussed, like deep breathing and challenging negative thoughts. The support from my family has also been really helpful.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re utilizing the techniques and have family support. Reflecting on our previous sessions, what specific strategies do you feel worked best for you in managing those panic attacks?

User: I think identifying the thoughts that trigger my anxiety and challenging them has been the most beneficial. It helps me regain control when I start feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s an important skill you've developed! How do you feel when you successfully challenge those thoughts? 

User: I feel empowered and more relaxed. It’s nice to know that I have some control over my feelings, rather than letting them take over.

Consultant: Empowerment is a key part of managing anxiety. As we move forward, let’s think about how you can continue to build on this progress. Are there any particular situations or triggers you find challenging right now?

User: Sometimes I still feel anxious in crowded places, like at family gatherings. I worry that a panic attack could happen, and that makes me nervous.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way in those situations. Have you tried any specific strategies in those settings to manage your anxiety?

User: Not really. I usually just try to leave those situations if I start feeling panicky. I guess I avoid the challenge.

Consultant: Avoidance can be tempting, but facing those situations gradually can help reduce your anxiety over time. Would you be open to discussing some small steps to approach those gatherings more comfortably?

User: Yes, I think that could be helpful. I want to feel more at ease during those times.

Consultant: Great! We can create a plan to gradually expose you to those situations. For example, you might start by attending a smaller gathering instead of a larger event. How does that sound?

User: That sounds reasonable. Starting small is definitely more manageable for me.

Consultant: Absolutely! And during these gatherings, you could practice deep breathing or using positive self-talk to manage your feelings. Would you like to set a specific goal for the next time a social event occurs?

User: Yes, I’d like to try attending my niece's birthday party next week and work on staying calm.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Remember to focus on how you can enjoy the moment rather than worrying about the possibility of a panic attack. How do you plan to prepare for the party?

User: I’ll remind myself of the techniques we discussed and maybe even practice deep breathing beforehand.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan, Lao Zhang. Visualization can also be a powerful tool—imagining yourself calmly interacting at the party can help reduce anxiety. Would you like to explore this visualization technique together?

User: Sure! I haven’t tried that before, but it sounds interesting.

Consultant: Let’s do a brief visualization exercise then. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and picture yourself at the party. Imagine engaging with your family, feeling relaxed and confident. What do you see yourself doing?

User: I see myself laughing and talking with my family. I feel more at ease, and I realize I can enjoy myself without panicking.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! By visualizing this positive experience, you are effectively preparing your mind. How do you feel about incorporating this exercise regularly leading up to the event?

User: I think I will. It could really help ease my worries.

Consultant: Fantastic! Regular practice can strengthen your ability to face these situations. As we conclude today’s session, let’s summarize the key takeaways. You have strategies for understanding your triggers, a plan for your niece’s party, and visualization techniques to support you.

User: Yes, I feel like I have a toolkit now to handle my anxiety better.

Consultant: I’m really pleased to hear that. Remember, it’s about taking one step at a time. If you encounter challenges, we can address them together in future sessions. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I feel more optimistic about handling things now.

Consultant: I believe in your ability to manage this, Lao Zhang. This has been a productive session, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences at the party. Take care, and see you next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help. See you soon!
