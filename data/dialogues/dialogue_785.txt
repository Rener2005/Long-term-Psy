Consultant: Hello, Xiaotian! I'm glad to see you again. Before we start today, how have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really anxious, especially after those recent exams. My parents are arguing a lot about my grades, and it just adds to my stress. 

Consultant: I can see how stressful that must be for you, especially with the pressure from your parents about your grades. It sounds overwhelming. Can you tell me more about what you’ve been experiencing?

User: I keep thinking about how disappointed they are in me. It makes me feel really low about myself. And then I end up hurting myself to cope with that feeling of worthlessness.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed with everything happening around you. Let’s take a moment to explore these thoughts. What exactly goes through your mind when you think about disappointing them?

User: I just feel like I’m not good enough. No matter how hard I try, I just can’t get the grades they want. It feels like they’re blaming me for everything.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiaotian. It seems like you’re carrying a heavy burden of expectations. Can you share what emotions come up for you when you think about those expectations?

User: I feel anxious and really sad. Sometimes I just want to give up because nothing seems to work out for me.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way under such pressure. Let’s try to dig a bit deeper—what do you think might be driving these feelings of anxiety and sadness for you specifically?

User: Sometimes I think it's because I see how hard my parents work. I feel like I should be doing better to make them proud, but I just can't handle it.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a lot of pressure to meet their expectations. You might feel that you're responsible for their happiness based on your performance. Let's think about that. When you don't meet their expectations, what thoughts cross your mind?

User: I often think they’d be disappointed, or even worse, they’d wish they didn’t have me. It’s like I’m a burden to them.

Consultant: That’s a heavy thought to carry, Xiaotian. But let's challenge that a bit. Do you think there’s any evidence supporting the idea that your parents would wish they didn’t have you?

User: Well, no, they’ve never said that. They do care about me, I guess… but it’s hard to remember that when I’m feeling down.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. It’s quite common to get caught up in negative thoughts, especially during tough times. What do you think you could tell yourself the next time you have those feelings of being a burden? 

User: I could remind myself that they work hard because they love me, and they wouldn’t be angry with me for not doing well all the time. 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a great alternative thought. By recognizing that your parents care for you despite your grades, you can start to shift your perspective. Have you thought about any healthier ways to manage your emotions when you feel overwhelmed?

User: Sometimes I draw or write, but it doesn't always help. I still think about self-harming when things get too much.

Consultant: It’s great that you have some outlets like drawing and writing. They are healthy ways to express yourself. Let’s explore that urge to self-harm a bit. What are some triggers or situations that lead you to consider self-harming?

User: It usually happens right after I get my grades or when my parents argue about school. I feel so lost in those moments.

Consultant: Understanding your triggers is a key step in managing those urges. How about we work on some coping strategies for when you start feeling that way? Perhaps deep breathing or taking a walk might help?

User: I’ve never really tried breathing exercises. I usually feel too tense to think about anything else.

Consultant: That makes sense, but I think you’ll find it helpful. It’s about taking those moments to pause and breathe deeply. Want to try a simple breathing exercise together right now?

User: Sure, I could try that. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s breathe in deeply through your nose for four counts, hold for four counts, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for four counts. Ready? 

User: Yes, let’s do it.

(They take a moment to practice the breathing exercise together.)

Consultant: How did that feel for you?

User: Actually, I do feel a bit calmer. It helps to just focus on breathing for a moment.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Breathing exercises can be an excellent tool for calming anxiety. Can we also think about some activities or things you enjoy that could help distract you when you feel overwhelmed?

User: I like playing video games, but I often feel guilty about spending time on them instead of studying.

Consultant: It's perfectly fine to enjoy video games! Balancing work and play is important for your well-being. How about setting specific times for gaming as a reward for completing your study sessions?

User: That sounds fair. I could use it as a break after studying.

Consultant: Absolutely! That balance can help reframe how you approach your study time while also providing something to look forward to. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on one thing you’d like to take away from this session.

User: I think I want to remember that my worth isn’t just based on my grades, and maybe to try those breathing exercises when I feel anxious.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway, Xiaotian. Remember, it’s a journey, and recognizing these patterns is a significant step forward. I'm here to support you, and we can keep building on these strategies together. 

User: Thank you. I really appreciate it.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Thinking about what we’ve discussed today, I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaotian! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, things have been pretty rough. I got criticized by my teacher, and I’m really worried that my parents will fight again because of my grades. It feels like I'm constantly under pressure.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and anxious about your performance at school. That's completely understandable. Can you tell me more about how you felt when the teacher criticized you?

User: I felt really embarrassed and upset. I kept thinking that maybe I’m just not good enough, and it made me want to avoid going to class. 

Consultant: I can see why you'd feel that way. It's tough to receive criticism, especially when it hits so close to home. You mentioned wanting to avoid class—what thoughts went through your head when you thought about going back?

User: I thought about how the other kids would judge me. It feels like everyone expects me to do well, and if I don't, it just makes everything worse at home too.

Consultant: That’s a lot to carry, Xiaotian. It’s natural to worry about how others view you, especially with added family stress. Let’s try to unpack those feelings. When you think about not being good enough, what specific thoughts come to mind?

User: I keep thinking that if I don’t get good grades, my parents will end up arguing again, just like before. I can't handle that pressure.

Consultant: It’s really challenging to feel like your performance is tied to your parents’ relationship. How does that connection make you feel inside?

User: It makes me feel helpless. I wish I could just do better so everyone would stop worrying. Sometimes I think of hurting myself just to escape those feelings.

Consultant: I hear you, and I’m really sorry to know you’re feeling that way. You’ve shown immense strength in sharing this. Let’s discuss some healthier ways to cope. Have you tried any strategies recently to avoid resorting to self-harm?

User: I’ve tried to distract myself by playing video games, but it doesn’t really help. I just end up feeling worse afterwards.

Consultant: Distractions can be helpful temporarily, but it sounds like they don't address the underlying feelings of anxiety. Let’s explore some other coping strategies that might help you feel more in control. Would you be open to discussing relaxation techniques or mindfulness exercises?

User: I guess I could try that. I’ve heard of mindfulness but don’t really know much about it.

Consultant: Mindfulness is about being present in the moment and noticing your thoughts and feelings without judgment. It can help create space between your feelings and your actions. Would you like to do a brief exercise together to see how it feels?

User: Sure, I’d be willing to try something like that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment to focus on your breath. Take a deep breath in through your nose, feeling your chest rise. Now, exhale slowly through your mouth. What do you notice about how your body feels?

User: It feels kind of relaxing, I guess. My head isn’t racing as much.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Deep breathing can be a great way to create calm. Let’s practice this a few times whenever you feel overwhelmed. As for your school situation, how do you think you could use this technique when you’re feeling pressured about grades?

User: Maybe I can take a moment to breathe before answering questions in class or before a test. It might help me not to feel so stressed.

Consultant: Absolutely! Breathing can help you regain your focus and calmness in those situations. Remember, it's okay to feel nervous, and it's how you respond that can make a difference. Do you think this is something you can start incorporating into your routine?

User: Yeah, I think I could do that. It doesn’t seem too hard.

Consultant: I'm glad you feel that way. Remember, it's all about taking small steps. You showed a lot of insight today, especially considering how difficult things have been at home and school. Looking forward, how do you feel about your next steps in managing these feelings?

User: I think if I can keep practicing the breathing, and maybe talk to a friend when I feel off, it could help. I just need to not bottle everything inside.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan, Xiaotian! Talking to friends can provide you with support and help you feel less isolated. How do you think you can approach your friends when you need to talk?

User: I guess I could just ask if they want to hang out and then bring it up naturally when we’re talking.

Consultant: That sounds like a great approach! Being open with your friends when you feel comfortable can strengthen your connection with them. It’s okay to share when things are tough. 

User: I’ll definitely try that. It feels a bit easier to think about now.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! You’ve made some important strides today. Before we wrap up, let’s quickly recap what you’ve learned. What do you think your biggest takeaway from today’s session is?

User: I think it's the breathing and being more open with my feelings. Keeping everything inside only makes it worse.

Consultant: Absolutely! And remember, it's a process. You’re learning and growing, and that’s really commendable. If you find it tough in the future, we can explore more strategies together. 

User: Thank you for the support. I feel a bit better.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of you for sharing today, Xiaotian. Remember, you can always come back if you want to discuss more. Take care and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaotian! I'm glad to see you today. Before we start, I want to check in with you. How have things been since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty low, actually. I had an argument with a classmate, and it's been bothering me a lot. I keep worrying that I'm going to be isolated from my friends.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that. It sounds like that argument has affected your emotions quite a bit. Can you tell me more about the situation and how it made you feel?

User: Well, we had a disagreement about a project, and I got really frustrated. I felt like he didn't respect my ideas. After that, I started to think that maybe the others will start to avoid me too, and that worries me.

Consultant: It sounds really tough to feel that way, especially when you’re concerned about being isolated. That can be a heavy burden to carry. What kind of thoughts were running through your mind after the argument?

User: I kept thinking that maybe my classmates think I’m not good enough or that I shouldn’t be part of the group. I even remembered how my parents sometimes argue and wonder if that means I’m not a good friend either.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. It seems like there’s a connection between what happened with your friend and what you’ve experienced at home. What feelings arise when you think about these thoughts?

User: I feel anxious most of the time. I don’t want to be alone, but I also feel unsure about reaching out to my classmates now. It’s like I'm stuck in my head.

Consultant: It makes sense that you’d feel anxious when you’re facing challenges in both your friendships and at home. Let’s explore those thoughts further. Do you think these beliefs about your classmates are based on evidence, or could there be other interpretations?

User: I guess I don’t really know for sure what they think. Maybe I'm just assuming the worst. But it feels so real when I'm anxious.

Consultant: It's normal to feel that way. Let’s try to challenge that thought together. If you were to talk to a friend in your situation, what do you think their perspective might be?

User: I think a friend would probably tell me that it's normal to have arguments and that they wouldn't judge me. They might even say it doesn't change our friendship.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a very supportive perspective. Let's try to apply that to your feelings. What if you approached your classmates and expressed how you felt? What do you think might happen?

User: I suppose they might be understanding and it could help clear the air. But part of me is still scared they won't care.

Consultant: It's natural to feel scared, but reaching out could lead to a positive outcome. Moreover, even if things don’t go perfectly, it’s an opportunity for growth. Would you be open to practicing how you might initiate a conversation with them?

User: Yeah, I could try that. I just need to figure out what to say that won’t sound awkward.

Consultant: That's a great start! Let's brainstorm some ideas together. How about starting with something simple, like, “Hey, can we talk about what happened? I didn’t mean for it to get heated”? How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds okay. I think I could say that. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Practicing phrases like this can help ease your anxiety. Let's also consider how to prepare for their responses. What supportive things could you remind yourself if things don’t go as planned?

User: I could tell myself that it's just one conversation and that it doesn’t define our friendship. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent way to think about it! Keeping a positive mindset is key. As we work on these skills, remember that trying and learning from each interaction is a part of the process. 

User: I appreciate that. It's nice to feel that I can try without it being the end of the world.

Consultant: Absolutely! You have the strength to navigate these situations. Let’s shift gears for a moment. How are you feeling about the expectations from your parents regarding school? 

User: I feel a lot of pressure from them, especially since they always talk about good grades. Sometimes I worry I won’t meet their expectations.

Consultant: It sounds like that stress adds another layer on top of everything. Could we discuss how those expectations affect your feelings and thoughts about school?

User: Sure. It makes me anxious about my performance, even on small assignments. I could be doing fine, but then I overthink it and feel like I’m failing.

Consultant: That’s a common reaction. Overthinking in response to pressure can make things more difficult than they need to be. What if we tried to identify some practical strategies to tackle this pressure?

User: That would be helpful! I want to find a way to cope better.

Consultant: One approach could be setting smaller, achievable goals rather than focusing only on the end grades. This could help you manage your anxiety. Does that resonate with you?

User: Yes, it sounds more manageable. Feeling like I can celebrate smaller victories might ease the pressure.

Consultant: Great insight, Xiaotian! Celebrate those small wins. It’s all part of your progress. Let’s think together about how you can break down your tasks into smaller steps. 

User: I could write down my assignments and then tackle them one by one instead of looking at everything at once. 

Consultant: Exactly! That approach can make it feel less overwhelming. How do you feel now about tackling your schoolwork with that plan?

User: I feel a bit more optimistic. It seems less daunting now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! As we wrap up today, what do you think is the most valuable takeaway from our session? 

User: I think it’s that I don't have to be perfect, and it’s okay to ask for help from my friends. Also, managing my schoolwork in smaller bites might help a lot.

Consultant: You’ve made some tremendous connections today! You have the tools to approach social situations with confidence and handle your workload better. Remember, I’m here to support you whenever needed. 

User: Thank you! That feels reassuring. I’ll try these suggestions.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaotian! I believe you’ll do great. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaotian! I'm glad you're here for today's session. I want to hear about how you've been feeling lately, especially with all the pressures from school and your parents. 

User: Hi! Well, I've been really stressed out because of my studies. I feel like my parents expect so much from me, and it’s hard to cope with that pressure. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by both your academic responsibilities and your parents' expectations. Can you share a bit more about what specifically has been stressing you out? 

User: I have a lot of assignments piling up, and I’m worried that if I don’t do well, my parents will be disappointed. Sometimes I just freeze and can’t start working on anything.

Consultant: I hear you. So the fear of disappointing your parents is making it hard for you to get started on your assignments. What does it feel like when you think about not meeting their expectations? 

User: I start feeling anxious, like there's this knot in my stomach. I keep thinking that maybe I'm not good enough or that I’ll fail.

Consultant: That anxiety can be really tough to deal with. It's understandable to feel that way, but it's important to recognize those thoughts. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come to you when you start feeling this way? 

User: I often think, "What if I fail? What if my parents get upset?" Those thoughts just spiral, and I can't think straight.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very intense and can add to your feelings of anxiety. Let’s explore them. You mentioned thinking "What if I fail?"—can you think of any evidence that supports or contradicts that belief? 

User: I guess I have passed tests before, so I can do it. But when I'm stressed, I just forget about those times.

Consultant: That's a great point! It seems that when you’re feeling pressured, it’s easy to forget your past successes. How would you feel if you started to remember those times when you did well? 

User: I think it would make me feel a bit relieved and maybe more motivated. But it's hard to remind myself of that when I'm freaking out.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to find it hard to remember positive experiences during stressful times. What if we worked on a few strategies to help you recall those moments when you're feeling anxious? 

User: That could help, I think. 

Consultant: Fantastic! One technique we can try is to keep a journal of your accomplishments, no matter how small. This way, when you're feeling overwhelmed, you can look back and remind yourself that you have succeeded before. How does that sound to you? 

User: That sounds useful. I never thought of doing that. I can try that out.

Consultant: Excellent! Additionally, we can also practice breaking your assignments into smaller, manageable tasks. How does the idea of dividing your work sound to you? 

User: It sounds better, but I sometimes don't know where to start. 

Consultant: That’s understandable. We can create a plan together. Let’s take your biggest assignment and break it down into steps. What’s the largest task you're facing right now? 

User: I have a big project for science that’s due next week.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start with that. What would be the first step you could take to begin working on your science project? 

User: I guess I could start by researching my topic. 

Consultant: Perfect! Researching is a great first step. How about we set a time for you to do that? When do you think you can dedicate some time to get started?

User: I could work on it tomorrow after school.

Consultant: That sounds good! Let’s write it down as a commitment. And remember, it’s okay to take breaks. Have you planned any breaks during your study time? 

User: No, I usually just try to get everything done in one go. 

Consultant: Taking breaks can help recharge your mind and prevent burnout. Let’s set aside some time for short breaks after working on a task. How about a 5-10 minute break after 30 minutes of focused work? 

User: That sounds manageable. I’ll try that. 

Consultant: Great attitude! As you set these new habits, remember to be kind to yourself. If things don’t go perfectly, that’s okay. We’re making progress. 

User: Thanks! I think I can work on these strategies. 

Consultant: I believe in you, Xiaotian. Let’s check in about your progress during our next session. Before we end today’s meeting, how are you feeling about these steps we discussed? 

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I think I can actually manage my work now. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s all about small steps. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. You’ve got this! 

User: Thank you! I feel relieved just talking about it. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiaotian. It’s always important to express how you feel. Until next time, take care of yourself!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaotian! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello. I've been feeling pretty down lately. I didn't participate in a class activity because I was too anxious. Now I just feel even worse about myself.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like that experience has affected your self-esteem. Can you tell me a bit more about what you felt during the activity?

User: I felt really nervous. I kept thinking that I would embarrass myself if I spoke up, so I just stayed quiet.

Consultant: That sounds tough. It seems like those thoughts made it hard for you to engage with others. What kind of thoughts were running through your mind at that moment?

User: I kept thinking that no one would want to hear what I had to say, and that I would just mess it up.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. A lot of people experience similar thoughts. How did those thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: They made me feel really anxious and ashamed. I felt like I didn’t belong.

Consultant: Feeling ashamed and anxious can be really painful. Let’s explore those thoughts together. Do you think they are based on reality, or could there be another way to look at it?

User: I guess I just assumed the worst. Sometimes I think my classmates wouldn’t care, which makes me not want to try.

Consultant: It’s interesting that you see it that way. If you were to look at it from a different perspective, what might your classmates think if you joined in?

User: Maybe they wouldn’t judge me? They might even appreciate my input.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s possible they would welcome your thoughts. Let’s challenge that automatic negative thought a bit more. What evidence do you have that your classmates would react negatively?

User: I guess I don’t really have any solid proof. It's just how I feel sometimes.

Consultant: And feelings can sometimes lead us to believe things that might not be true. It can be helpful to question those feelings. What could you tell yourself next time you find yourself thinking those negative thoughts?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to share my ideas, and that my classmates might really like what I have to say.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic reframe! Let’s practice that. Imagine you are in that class activity again. If you start to feel anxious, how would you use this new perspective to help yourself?

User: I could take a deep breath and say to myself that it’s okay to speak up and that my ideas are valid.

Consultant: Great! Breathing and positive affirmations can really help you manage anxiety. Have you tried any activities that made you feel more confident lately?

User: Not really. I just feel stuck and don’t know what to do.

Consultant: Let’s think of something small you could do to build confidence, perhaps outside of the classroom. What’s something you enjoy that you could do more often?

User: I like playing video games with my friends. It feels easier to connect when we’re gaming.

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! Building connections in a relaxed environment can boost your confidence. Could you try to take that same feeling of connection into other areas, like your classroom?

User: I’ll try to remember that. It might help me participate more if I think of my classmates as friends.

Consultant: Exactly! Friends share and support each other. As we wrap up today, can you share one thing you feel more positive about after our conversation?

User: I feel like I can work on my self-talk and maybe participate more next time. It feels a bit more manageable.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization, Xiaotian! Changing self-talk takes practice, but you’re already on the right path. Let’s keep building on this momentum in our next sessions. If you find yourself needing support, remember you can always reach out. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate it. I’ll try to keep this in mind. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Keep focusing on those small steps. I'll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaotian! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How are you feeling about your recent progress in school?

User: Hi! I feel pretty good actually. I did better on a recent quiz, and my teacher praised me. It's a nice change since I was struggling before.

Consultant: That's fantastic news! It sounds like that praise gave you a boost in confidence. How did it feel for you to receive such positive feedback after your efforts?

User: It felt really rewarding. I was so nervous before the quiz, but knowing that I improved made me feel proud of myself.

Consultant: I can see how that sense of achievement is uplifting for you. It's important to acknowledge these positive changes. What do you think contributed to your improvement?

User: I think I started studying a bit differently, like creating a schedule for myself. I also tried to focus more during class, listening better and taking notes.

Consultant: Excellent strategies! It seems that being organized and attentive has really paid off. How do you feel about continuing these habits moving forward?

User: I want to keep it up, but sometimes I worry that I might slip back into my old habits, especially with everything going on at home.

Consultant: It's completely natural to have those concerns, especially with the dynamics at home. Can you share a bit more about what's been on your mind regarding your family situation?

User: Well, my parents often argue, and even though they try to act fine in front of us, I can feel the tension. It makes me anxious sometimes, especially when I hear them fighting on WeChat.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiaotian. It’s understandable that the stress from home could make you uneasy, especially now that you're trying to focus on school. How do you usually cope when you feel anxious about your family?

User: I tend to just keep my head down and focus on my studies. But there are times when I just feel overwhelmed and can’t concentrate at all.

Consultant: It's great that you try to focus on your studies, but it sounds like you might benefit from some additional coping strategies to manage those overwhelming feelings. Would you like to explore some ways you could handle that anxiety better?

User: Yes, I would! I want to find ways to feel more relaxed and not let everything at home affect my schoolwork.

Consultant: That’s a great goal! One effective technique is identifying any automatic thoughts you might have during those stressful moments. Can you recall any particular thoughts that run through your mind when you’re feeling anxious at home?

User: I often think things like, "What if they get worse?" or "I can’t handle this." It's like a cycle of worrying.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy. Let's challenge them a bit. What evidence do you have that their situation will worsen, or that you cannot handle it?

User: I guess there isn't really any solid proof that things will get worse. It's just my mind going into overdrive.

Consultant: Exactly! Sometimes our minds can exaggerate situations. If you were to encourage a friend who felt the same way, what might you tell them?

User: I would probably say that it’s okay to feel worried but to focus on what they can do for themselves, like studying well and taking breaks.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective! It seems you have the insight to separate your worries from reality. How can you apply this self-encouragement to your own situation right now?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that I’m doing well in school and that I have control over my own actions, even if I can’t change what happens at home.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization, Xiaotian. Focusing on what you can control will really help you maintain your progress. What specific actions can you take to keep that positive mindset going?

User: I think I can set small goals for my studies each week and try not to let family issues interfere. I can also talk to my friends when I feel stressed.

Consultant: Those sound like effective steps! Setting small and achievable goals can really help you stay focused and motivated. How about we also think of some enjoyable activities outside of studying to help balance out your stress? 

User: I love playing basketball, but I haven’t done that much lately. Maybe I should make time for that.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Engaging in physical activity like basketball can boost your mood. How about setting a goal to play a few times a week?

User: Yes, I can do that! Just an hour or so after school to unwind sounds perfect.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Taking that time for yourself is essential. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on your progress. How do you feel about the changes you’ve discussed?

User: I feel encouraged! I have a clearer plan to keep improving and a way to deal with my worries.

Consultant: I'm really proud of the progress you're making. Remember, it's all about consistency and self-compassion. If you ever feel overwhelmed again, just remember those strategies we talked about. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate our conversation today. I feel more equipped to handle everything.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaotian. Believe in yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need support in the future. Good luck, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
