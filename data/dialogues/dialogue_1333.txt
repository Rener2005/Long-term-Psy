Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you’re here for this session. It sounds like you've been through a lot recently. Can we start by discussing how you've been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty low, to be honest. Since I found out about my husband's affair, I can't stop thinking about it. I feel so betrayed and angry, and it's like my whole world has crumbled.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly difficult and painful. It’s completely understandable to feel this way after such a shocking revelation. Can you tell me more about how this situation has affected your daily life?

User: Well, I find it hard to concentrate on anything. I don't feel motivated to do my job or even take care of myself. It’s like I’m stuck in this gloomy place where nothing seems to matter anymore.

Consultant: It makes sense that you would feel stuck and unmotivated right now, especially given the emotional weight of the situation. Have you had any moments where you felt a bit better, even briefly?

User: Occasionally, but they are fleeting. When I’m with friends or engaged in a conversation, I manage to distract myself, but the sadness always comes back.

Consultant: It’s great that you have moments of distraction with friends. Social connections can be helpful. However, it seems like those feelings of sadness are really persistent. What do you think triggers those feelings the most?

User: Just thinking about my husband's betrayal triggers a wave of sadness and anger. I feel so ashamed sometimes, like I should have seen this coming or done something to prevent it.

Consultant: It’s common to grapple with feelings of shame and self-blame, especially in situations like this. Can we explore those thoughts together? What specific thoughts do you have when you feel that way?

User: I keep thinking, "Was I not enough for him?" or "I must have done something wrong." It makes me feel even worse.

Consultant: Those are incredibly tough thoughts to deal with, and they can be misleading. Let’s examine them. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts these thoughts about not being enough?

User: I don’t know... I just feel inadequate. I’ve always been a good wife. It just makes me doubt everything about myself.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way in this situation. However, the fact that you've been a good partner doesn't diminish your value or worth as a person. If a friend were in your position, what would you say to them about their thoughts?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s not their fault and that they deserve respect regardless of any mistakes made in the relationship.

Consultant: Exactly! You deserve that same kindness and understanding towards yourself. It sounds like you're being very hard on yourself. What if we worked on practicing that same compassion for yourself?

User: I guess that could help, but it's hard to shake off these feelings.

Consultant: It is hard, but it’s possible with small steps. How would you feel about setting aside a few moments each day to acknowledge your feelings without judgment, allowing yourself to just be?

User: That sounds like a good idea. I can try to sit with my emotions instead of pushing them away. 

Consultant: That’s a great start! Acknowledging your feelings is an important step in the healing process. Would you be open to journaling your thoughts and feelings during that time?

User: I could give journaling a shot. It might help me process everything better.

Consultant: Wonderful! Journaling can be a powerful tool for understanding and processing emotions. As you start this practice, pay attention to any recurring thoughts that come up. It might reveal patterns we can discuss further.

User: I’ll definitely do that. I think I need to understand what I’m really feeling.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! As we continue to explore your feelings and thoughts, let's also think about ways to slowly rebuild trust in yourself and in your relationship. How does that sound to you?

User: Sounds good, but I'm still finding it hard to trust him again.

Consultant: That’s very understandable given the circumstances. Trust is built over time. What would you need to feel more secure in your relationship moving forward?

User: I think I need transparency from him and reassurance that he’s committed to making it right.

Consultant: Those needs are perfectly valid. Discussing these needs with him could be an important step towards rebuilding trust. How do you feel about initiating that conversation?

User: I’m nervous about it, but I know I probably should talk to him about it. 

Consultant: It makes sense to feel nervous. This is a big step. Remember, it’s about expressing your feelings and needs. Would you like to role-play how that conversation might go?

User: That could be helpful! I think I need some guidance on how to approach this.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s practice it together. You could start with, “I’ve been feeling very hurt and confused since I found out about your affair, and I need to talk about how we can move forward.” How does that feel to you?

User: I think that’s a good start! It sounds honest.

Consultant: Great! From there, you can share your feelings and what you need moving forward. Remember, it’s okay to be vulnerable. You’re expressing your needs and feelings for your well-being. 

User: I’ll keep that in mind. Thank you for guiding me.

Consultant: You’re doing really well. It's important to prioritize your feelings and needs. As we conclude today, let's summarize what we've talked about and the steps you plan to take.

User: I’ll focus on journaling my thoughts, and I will try to have that conversation with my husband about transparency.

Consultant: Those are excellent steps! Remember, it’s okay to take things one day at a time. I believe you have the strength to navigate through this. If you need support, I’m always here for you.

User: Thank you so much. I appreciate your help and understanding.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. I know you've had some challenges recently regarding trust in your marriage. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been trying to process everything about my husband's unfaithfulness. It's been tough, and I feel really conflicted. I want to trust him again, but it’s hard.

Consultant: It makes sense that you're feeling conflicted. It's a challenging situation that would cause a lot of emotional turmoil. Can you share what specific thoughts or feelings come to mind when you think about your trust in him?

User: I keep thinking about how he could do this to me after all these years. It makes me question my self-worth and whether I should continue in this marriage.

Consultant: Those thoughts are understandable and quite common in situations like this. It sounds like you might be experiencing feelings of low self-worth and uncertainty about your relationship. How do these thoughts typically affect your emotions or behaviors throughout your day?

User: Well, I often feel sad and anxious. I avoid talking about the situation with him because I fear it might lead to more arguments. I just don’t know how to approach it.

Consultant: I see. Avoidance can seem like a safe choice, but it often leads to more anxiety and unclear feelings. Let’s explore your automatic thoughts further. When you think about confronting him, what specific thoughts come to your mind?

User: I worry that he will deny everything or that I will start crying and won’t be able to express myself properly. Part of me thinks it’s better just to keep the peace.

Consultant: It seems like there are a couple of things at play here. Fear of conflict and fear of vulnerability might be causing you to hesitate. Let’s examine those fears. How likely do you think it is that your husband would deny your concerns, or that you would break down during the conversation?

User: I think there’s a good chance he might deny it. But then again, we’ve always communicated openly before. It’s just hard to believe that now.

Consultant: It sounds like there's a conflict between your past experiences and your current worries. Let’s question the belief that he would deny it. What evidence do you have from previous discussions that suggests he's not willing to engage honestly with you?

User: Well, in previous arguments, he was often defensive, but he has also shown remorse about what happened. I guess there’s a part of me that still believes he cares and wants to work things out.

Consultant: That's a valuable realization. It suggests that there is potential for open communication. Let's replace the thought "he will deny everything" with a more balanced perspective. What might that new thought look like?

User: Maybe I could think, "He has been remorseful in the past, and it’s worth having a conversation to clarify things."

Consultant: That’s a significant shift! By altering that belief, you’re allowing space for a constructive conversation. How do you feel about that new thought? 

User: It feels a little more hopeful, honestly. But I still worry about how to start the conversation without it getting emotional.

Consultant: Starting a conversation can be daunting, especially when emotions are involved. Perhaps we can develop some strategies to approach this calmly. What if you wrote down your thoughts or feelings beforehand to communicate them more clearly?

User: That could work! Writing might help organize my thoughts so I won’t forget what I want to say in the heat of the moment.

Consultant: Great idea! Writing can be a powerful tool. Besides writing, are there any specific phrases or questions you think could help open the conversation in a non-confrontational way?

User: I think maybe starting with something like, “I need to talk about how I’ve been feeling lately.” It sounds gentle but direct.

Consultant: That's an excellent approach! It's clear and expresses your needs without sounding accusatory. How confident do you feel about using that as your opening line?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but it does seem manageable. I want to express myself and give him a chance to respond.

Consultant: That’s a positive attitude! It’s great that you want to initiate this dialogue. Remember, expressing your feelings is important. As we conclude our session today, let’s summarize what you’ve learned and your next steps.

User: Okay! I’ve learned that questioning my negative thoughts helps me feel more hopeful. Writing my feelings down could make the conversation easier, and I can start with a gentle opener.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve made great progress in shifting your mindset towards a more constructive approach. When do you plan to have this conversation with your husband?

User: I think I’ll aim to do it by the end of the week. Hopefully, I will feel ready by then.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Remember, it's perfectly okay to feel anxious. You’re taking constructive steps, and I believe you can handle this. Let’s touch base next time to see how the conversation went.

User: Thank you! I feel more prepared, and I appreciate your support. I’ll definitely keep track of how it goes.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m here for you, and I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress. You've got this!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. I understand that you’ve been working on reassessing your relationship with your husband. Can you share with me what feelings or thoughts you are currently experiencing?

User: Hi. I'm really eager to rekindle our relationship and make it harmonious again. However, I find myself feeling anxious and uncertain about how to navigate our relationship. It's like I'm stuck in my thoughts about what might go wrong.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a mix of desire for connection and fear about potential outcomes. Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you regarding your relationship?

User: I worry that we might not see eye to eye on some issues, and I’m concerned that my attempts to talk about our feelings might push him away instead of bringing us closer.

Consultant: I understand that fear of pushing him away can be very daunting. Have you noticed any specific situations where this concern feels particularly strong for you?

User: Yes, during dinners or when we're watching a movie together. Sometimes I just want to bring up something personal, but I hesitate because I'm afraid of his reaction.

Consultant: That hesitation is quite common, especially when the stakes feel high. What thoughts run through your mind during those moments before you decide not to speak up?

User: I often think, "What if he gets defensive?" or "What if this turns into an argument?" Those thoughts make me feel like it's better to stay quiet.

Consultant: Those automatic thoughts you're experiencing are influencing your emotions and behavior. Let's take a moment to challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that bringing up personal topics would lead to negativity?

User: Well, there have been some instances in the past where he responded defensively, but there were also times when he was open to discussing things. It's just hard to focus on the positive moments.

Consultant: It's great that you can recognize both sides. If a friend were in your position, how might you encourage them to approach the conversation with their partner?

User: I would probably tell them to be honest and express their feelings clearly and calmly. But applying that advice to myself feels much harder.

Consultant: It’s understandable to find it challenging, given the personal context. What if we practiced some ways of expressing your thoughts that feel safer for you? Would you be comfortable trying that out?

User: Yes, I would like to try! Maybe role-playing could help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Let’s imagine a situation where you want to express something vulnerable. How would you start that conversation?

User: I guess I would say something like, "I've been feeling a bit off lately, and I really want to talk to you about it." 

Consultant: That’s a good start! It’s honest and opens the door for dialogue. How do you think he might respond to that?

User: I think he might be surprised at first, but I hope he'd want to listen. I just need to find the courage to say it.

Consultant: Finding that courage can be tough, especially when emotions are involved. Let’s explore a few coping strategies you could use to manage your anxiety before having these conversations. How does that sound?

User: Yes, I think that would help! I want to feel more at ease when I approach this.

Consultant: One technique could be practicing deep breathing exercises before you have the discussion. This can help calm your mind and allow you to speak more clearly. Have you tried anything like that before?

User: No, I haven’t. I usually just feel overwhelmed and don't know how to manage it.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way. Another technique might be to write down your thoughts and feelings before the conversation, which can help organize your mind. Would you be open to trying that?

User: Yes, writing things down usually helps me process my emotions better.

Consultant: Wonderful! This can also serve as a script to refer to during the conversation. The more prepared you feel, the less anxious you might become. What do you think about this plan?

User: I think it sounds good! I'm feeling a bit more hopeful about addressing my feelings.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. With each step, you'll build your confidence in expressing yourself. Is there anything else on your mind today regarding this process?

User: No, I think we covered a lot. I feel more equipped to approach my husband now. Thank you!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of the efforts you're making. As you practice these techniques, remember to be gentle with yourself along the way. How about we plan to touch base in our next session to discuss how it went?

User: That sounds perfect! I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: Great! I look forward to hearing about your progress and how you felt afterward. Have a wonderful week, and take care of yourself!

User: Thank you! I will.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for today's session. It seems you've been working on understanding your emotions more deeply. How are you feeling about that today?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel like I’m starting to see my emotions in a new light. I want to learn how to manage them better, especially during stressful times.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive development! Let's dive a little deeper—what kind of stressful situations are you facing right now?

User: Well, it's mostly related to work and juggling responsibilities at home. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed and unsure about how to handle everything.

Consultant: I can understand how that could be overwhelming. It sounds like you're feeling a challenging mix of stress from both your professional and personal life. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come to mind when you feel this way?

User: Yes, I often think that I'm not doing enough or that I might fail to meet expectations. It makes me anxious and paralyzes me a little.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite heavy. Let’s explore that. When you think, “I'm not doing enough,” what feelings does that bring up for you?

User: It makes me feel inadequate and frustrated. I start doubting my abilities as a teacher and a parent.

Consultant: Those feelings are important to acknowledge. It seems like you're being quite hard on yourself. Do you think there’s a possibility that some of those thoughts might not reflect reality?

User: I suppose they might be a bit extreme. I have had successful days, but I just don’t always see them clearly in the moment.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight. What would happen if you reframed that thought to something more balanced, such as “I do my best, and it’s okay not to be perfect”? How would that make you feel in comparison?

User: I think it would relieve some pressure. It sounds more realistic and forgiving.

Consultant: Exactly! Allowing yourself some grace can be empowering. Is this something you’d be willing to practice in your daily life?

User: Yes, I would definitely like to try that. It seems more manageable.

Consultant: Great! Now, let’s discuss some practical strategies to help you build this new perspective. Have you ever tried any relaxation techniques to help with the stress?

User: Not really. I think I’ve always just pushed through the stress instead of addressing it directly.

Consultant: That’s quite common. Sometimes, we feel we need to power through without taking a moment to breathe. Would you be open to learning a simple relaxation technique that you can use when things get overwhelming?

User: That would be helpful! I’d love to learn something new.

Consultant: One effective technique is deep breathing. It involves taking slow, deep breaths to help calm your mind and body. Would you like to try it here together?

User: Sure, I’m willing to try.

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s take a moment. First, find a comfortable position. Now, take a deep breath in through your nose, counting to four…1, 2, 3, 4. Hold that breath for a moment…now exhale slowly through your mouth, counting to six…1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. How did that feel?

User: It felt nice to slow down a bit. I didn’t realize how tense I was until I did that.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! This technique can be incredibly useful in moments of stress. How do you think you could incorporate this into your daily routine?

User: Maybe I could set aside a few minutes each morning or during my break at school. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Creating a routine can help reinforce these habits. As you continue practicing this, you may notice improvements in your emotional responses. How do you feel about that?

User: I'm excited! I really want to feel more in control of my emotions.

Consultant: That's a wonderful intention! Remember, it takes practice, but you’re already on the right path. Would you like to set a specific goal for the week regarding your relaxation practice?

User: Yes, I think I'll aim to practice deep breathing every day for at least a few minutes.

Consultant: That sounds realistic and achievable! How about we check in on your progress during our next session? This will allow you to reflect on what worked and any challenges you encountered.

User: That’s a good idea. I’d like to keep track of how it goes.

Consultant: Perfect! Remember to be kind to yourself through this process. Emotions can be complex, but each small step is significant. Do you have any other thoughts or feelings you’d like to discuss today?

User: I think we’ve covered a lot! I feel less anxious about trying these new techniques now.

Consultant: I’m happy to hear that! It’s all about progress, not perfection. Just as a reminder, our next session will be a chance to reflect on your experiences and to continue developing your skills. 

User: Thank you! I look forward to that.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember, it's okay to reach out if you need support before our next session. You're doing great work, and I'm here to help. Have a wonderful week ahead!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling pretty good. I’ve started to incorporate some relaxation techniques into my daily routine, especially the body scan technique we discussed last time.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear that you're applying the body scan technique. How has that experience been for you?

User: It’s been quite soothing. I used it last weekend and felt my stress just melt away. I think I’m starting to appreciate these moments of calm.

Consultant: That's really encouraging to hear! It seems like you’re becoming more open to experiencing relaxation and its benefits. Have you noticed any changes in your emotions or interactions with others since you started these techniques?

User: Yes, I think I’m definitely more relaxed and present when talking to my colleagues and friends. I used to feel overwhelmed in group settings, but now I feel like I can engage more comfortably.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift! Engaging more comfortably in social situations is a great improvement. Can you recall any specific interactions where you felt this way?

User: There was a teacher meeting where I usually feel anxious. But this time, I focused on my breathing before speaking, and I actually contributed more to the discussion.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! By using your breathing as a tool, it helped you participate actively. It’s great to see how the relaxation techniques can positively impact your confidence and engagement. Do you think you could use this approach in other situations as well?

User: Absolutely! I hope to apply it in my classroom too. Sometimes I get nervous when speaking in front of my students. 

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Bringing these techniques into your classroom environment can create a more relaxed atmosphere for both you and your students. What would you like to focus on this week to support that goal?

User: I want to practice more with my body scan technique before classes and see how it affects my mood while teaching.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid approach! We can also explore how to handle any anxiety that might still arise in those teaching moments. How do you typically feel leading up to your classes?

User: I usually feel a mix of excitement and a bit of anxiety. The anticipation can be quite overwhelming sometimes.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel both excitement and anxiety. It’s important to channel that energy positively. When you feel overwhelmed, could you remind yourself of the relaxation techniques we've discussed? 

User: Yes, I think I should remind myself to focus on my breathing before stepping into the classroom. That kind of grounding should help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Grounding yourself with breathing techniques can create a stable foundation for your teaching. Are there any specific thoughts that come up for you right before you enter the classroom that contribute to that anxiety?

User: Sometimes I worry about how the students will respond to my lesson or if I’ll answer their questions correctly.

Consultant: Those thoughts are quite common, but they can create pressure. What if we could challenge those thoughts a bit? What evidence do you have that suggests your students wouldn’t respond well or that you wouldn’t answer their questions correctly?

User: I don’t have any real evidence; it’s just a fear I have. Most of the time, they seem engaged and interested.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re doing well, and their engagement is a reflection of your teaching abilities. How might you remind yourself of this when those anxious thoughts arise again?

User: I could keep a note in my planner that lists positive feedback I’ve received from students. That might help me focus on the good experiences instead of the fears.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! A tangible reminder of your successes can be very reassuring. As you continue practicing relaxation and challenging those anxious thoughts, do you notice a difference in how you feel as you prepare for your classes?

User: Yes, I think I’m starting to feel less overwhelmed just thinking about it. The relaxation techniques seem to help calm my mind.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful observation! It shows that you’re effectively integrating these techniques into your routine. Let’s continue to work on reinforcing these strategies during our sessions. How do you feel about the progress you’re making?

User: I feel positive about it! I can see the improvements and I’m much more open to using these techniques.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Your openness is key to this journey. As we move forward, we’ll build on these techniques to ensure you can maintain this progress. Have you set any personal goals for how you’d like to feel when entering your classroom next week?

User: I’d like to feel calm and confident, enjoying the teaching process instead of feeling anxious.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! We can formulate a small plan to help you achieve that calm and confidence. Would you be willing to establish some form of a routine or practice leading up to your classes to reinforce that?

User: Yes, I think having a clear routine to follow will help me. Maybe a few minutes of the body scan right before class, that could work!

Consultant: Perfect! Incorporating the body scan right before class can help center you. Let’s also think about what to do if anxiety does arise during your lessons. What could you try in that moment?

User: I could take a deep breath and quickly remind myself of the positive feedback I’ve received. That ought to help me reset my mindset.

Consultant: Excellent plan! Being aware of your successes and taking a moment to breathe can significantly aid in managing anxiety in those moments. It’s about creating strategies that feel right for you. What will you take away from our conversation today?

User: I feel like I have a plan to tackle anxiety better and enjoy teaching more. I’m excited to see how this change will go!

Consultant: I’m excited for you too! Remember, it’s a journey, and you’re making great strides. We’ll check in about your progress next time. Keep practicing those techniques, and I’ll see you soon!

User: Thank you! I look forward to our next session.

Consultant: Hello there! I'm so glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite good, actually. My emotional state has improved significantly, and I feel more comfortable discussing things with my husband. It's been quite a relief.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're experiencing some positive changes in your emotional management. Can you tell me more about what specific improvements you've noticed in your discussions with your husband?

User: Sure! We used to have some difficulties when discussing certain topics, but now I can express my thoughts and feelings more openly. I think we are connecting better than before.

Consultant: That’s great progress! Open communication is key in any relationship. What do you think has helped you to feel more comfortable expressing yourself?

User: I believe I've worked on being more aware of my emotions and recognizing when I'm holding back. It's easier to talk about my feelings now that I’ve understood them better.

User: Yes, he seems more receptive and engaged. I think our conversations have become more meaningful, and he appreciates me sharing my feelings.

Consultant: That's a positive shift! How do you feel about the progress you're making in both your personal life and at work?

User: I feel very satisfied. At work, I've also been more assertive in meetings, which has boosted my confidence. My students seem to respond well to my teaching as well.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really thriving both at home and at work! What do you think has contributed to these improvements in your professional life?

User: I've become more confident in sharing my ideas and setting boundaries with colleagues, which has made my work environment much more pleasant.

Consultant: Confidence can be a powerful tool! As you look ahead, what are some goals you might want to focus on to maintain this positive trajectory?

User: I want to continue improving my communication skills, both with my husband and at work. Also, I’d like to find new ways to relax and manage stress when it arises.

Consultant: Those are great goals. Building on what you’ve achieved will help you maintain your progress. Are there specific activities or practices you think might help you relax more effectively?

User: I’ve been thinking about trying mindfulness exercises or maybe even yoga. I’ve heard they can help with stress management.

Consultant: Mindfulness and yoga can be very beneficial for stress relief. Would you like to incorporate those into your routine?

User: Yes, I think I will start looking for classes or maybe follow some online tutorials. I want to create a consistent practice.

Consultant: That's a fantastic approach! Establishing a routine can enhance your resilience against stress. Have you faced any challenges lately that you want to discuss?

User: Not really, things have been going pretty smoothly. I guess I’m just worried about maintaining this positive state.

Consultant: It's completely natural to have concerns about sustaining progress. What strategies do you think might help you stay on track?

User: I think keeping a journal could be helpful, reflecting on my progress and any challenges I face. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful strategy! Journaling can provide insight and reinforce your achievements. Is there anything else you feel you might need support with moving forward?

User: I think just continuing to check in periodically would be beneficial. I want to ensure I don’t fall back into old habits.

Consultant: Regular check-ins can help reinforce your progress. I recommend setting specific times to reflect on your emotions and experiences, which will help you stay aware. 

User: That sounds good! I feel more committed to this approach now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we wrap up, let’s take a moment to summarize what you’ve accomplished and what your next steps will be.

User: I feel I've made significant strides in my communication, and I'm looking forward to exploring mindfulness and yoga as stress management tools.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve recognized important goals and strategies for maintaining your emotional health. Remember, you’ve built a strong foundation to continue your progress.

User: Thank you! I feel much more equipped to handle things now.

Consultant: It's been a pleasure to witness your journey. Remember, if you ever need support in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm confident you can manage your emotions independently moving forward.

User: Thank you so much for your help throughout this process! I really appreciate it.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm so proud of what you’ve achieved. Take care and best of luck on your journey ahead!
