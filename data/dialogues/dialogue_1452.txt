Consultant: Hello Xiaomi, I’m glad you’re here today. I’d like to start by checking in on how you’ve been feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I’ve been really anxious. I just can’t seem to concentrate on my studies, and it feels like I’m always worried about failing.

Consultant: I hear you. Your anxiety around studying and fear of failure can be overwhelming. Can you tell me more about when you started to feel this way? 

User: It all started when my mom wanted me to go back home for school a few months ago. We had a big argument, and since then, things have just felt heavy. My grades have been slipping too.

Consultant: It sounds like that argument with your mom was really impactful for you. It’s understandable that this change and tension at home could affect your mood and school performance. How are you handling those feelings of tension in your home life now?

User: I try to avoid talking to them because I don’t want to fight again. So, I just keep everything to myself, but it’s tiring.

Consultant: It's tough to hold in those feelings, especially when communication seems challenging. Can you tell me what thoughts go through your mind when you feel anxious about school or speaking with your family?

User: I start thinking things like, "What if I fail? What if they get disappointed in me?" It spirals, and then I just freeze up.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy and stressful. It's common for our brains to jump to the worst-case scenarios. Have you noticed how those thoughts make you feel physically and emotionally?

User: Yeah, I get really shaky and feel like I can’t breathe properly. Sometimes, I just want to give up on everything.

Consultant: That sounds alarming, Xiaomi. It’s important to acknowledge those physical responses to anxiety. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit more. What evidence do you have for believing you would fail or that your parents would be disappointed?

User: I guess I don’t have real proof. I just feel like I’m always letting them down, especially when my grades drop.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way if you're under pressure, but remember, our feelings can often distort reality. If a friend were in your situation, how would you encourage them to view their grades and their parents' expectations?

User: I’d probably tell them that grades aren’t everything and that their worth isn’t determined by them. 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a kinder perspective. Can we try to apply that same understanding to your situation? How might you reframe how you view your exams and your relationship with your parents?

User: Maybe I could think of it as a chance to learn rather than a test to prove myself. That sounds better.

Consultant: That's a great start! Shifting your focus from pressure to opportunities can help alleviate some anxiety. What’s one small step you could take to begin practicing this new way of thinking?

User: I could set smaller goals for my studies instead of stressing about the finals as a whole.

Consultant: That sounds like an effective strategy! Setting smaller, manageable goals can help you feel more in control. What's one small goal you could set for today or this week regarding your studies?

User: I think I could aim to study for just 30 minutes a day, focusing on one subject at a time.

Consultant: That’s a realistic and achievable goal! Let’s also think about how you can express your feelings to your family. What is one thing you could say to your mom or dad to share how you’re feeling without escalating into an argument?

User: I could say that I feel stressed about school and that I’m trying my best, and see how they respond. 

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach! Opening up about your feelings can help alleviate some of the tension at home. As we wrap up today, I want you to remember the reframing exercise we've discussed. How do you feel about the steps we’ve talked about?

User: I feel a bit lighter, actually. If I can remember to focus on the positives, it might help.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Reflecting on the positives can be a powerful tool. Before we end, let’s think about how you can maintain this progress. What strategies can you use moving forward to ensure you keep this perspective?

User: I can keep a journal to write down my thoughts and have reminders about what I learned to think more positively.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Journaling can be a great outlet to process your thoughts and feelings. Remember, it’s okay to reach out for support whenever you feel overwhelmed. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help today. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaomi! Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to practice those new strategies. I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaomi! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling more anxious lately. I feel really tense, especially when I think about answering questions in class. Sometimes, I just want to avoid raising my hand altogether.

Consultant: I understand that you're feeling increased anxiety, particularly about participating in class. It sounds like you're experiencing a fear of making mistakes in front of others. Can you tell me more about what specifically triggers those feelings?

User: Well, after I answered a question wrong last week, I felt embarrassed. Since then, I've been doubting myself more and avoiding situations where I might have to speak up.

Consultant: That sounds very challenging. It's common to feel embarrassed after making a mistake, but it seems like this experience has led to more self-doubt and avoidance for you. What thoughts go through your mind when you think about participating in class?

User: I usually think that everyone will judge me if I get the answer wrong again. It feels like all eyes are on me and that I’ll make a fool of myself.

Consultant: That creates a lot of pressure. It sounds like you're worried about others' opinions and the potential for embarrassment. Let’s take a closer look at those thoughts. Can you identify any specific beliefs that contribute to your fear of judgment in these situations?

User: I guess I believe that it's really important for me to always be right, otherwise people will see me as not smart.

Consultant: That's a significant belief. The idea that you must always be right can lead to feelings of anxiety and pressure. What would happen if you allowed yourself to be wrong sometimes? How do you think your classmates would really respond?

User: Maybe they wouldn’t think too much of it. But I still feel like it would change how they see me.

Consultant: It’s natural to worry about what others think, but many people recognize that everyone makes mistakes. In reality, it often shows that we're human and learning. Let’s consider how you might challenge that belief—what evidence do you have that making mistakes will lead others to think less of you?

User: I don’t have much evidence, honestly. I just feel like it’s a big deal. 

Consultant: It’s good that you’re recognizing that there’s not much evidence. Sometimes, our feelings can lead us to believe things that aren’t based on reality. Can we work on reframing that thought together? For instance, what if making a mistake was just a part of learning and growing?

User: I think that could help. It makes sense that everyone learns from their mistakes, but it’s hard to feel that way in the moment.

Consultant: Absolutely, it can be difficult in the moment. What if you practiced thinking, "It’s okay for me to make mistakes; everyone does," whenever those anxious thoughts come up? How would that change your experience?

User: I think it would make me feel a bit lighter. It might help me take a step back and not take things so seriously.

Consultant: That's a great realization! It sounds like you're starting to see how re-framing your thoughts can have a positive effect. Making these small adjustments can help you feel more comfortable speaking up in class. Have you thought of any situations where you can practice this new mindset?

User: I guess I could start by answering questions I feel more confident about, or maybe even just raising my hand when I have an idea, even if I'm not 100% sure.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea, Xiaomi. Starting with what you feel more comfortable with can help build your confidence gradually. Also, we can create a plan for you to reflect on your experiences afterward. How would you feel about journaling your thoughts after participating in class?

User: I like that idea! It might help me see that I’m making progress even if I still feel nervous.

Consultant: Exactly! It will allow you to recognize the steps you're taking, no matter how small. It gives you a chance to celebrate your progress and understand that feeling uncomfortable doesn't mean you're failing. How are you feeling about implementing this plan?

User: I feel a bit more motivated. I think this could really help me.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. As we work together, we'll also focus on building more interpersonal skills to ease your feelings during social interactions. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good. I could use some tips on how to talk to others more comfortably.

Consultant: Of course, we'll work on strategies that make conversations easier for you. Is there a specific situation you've encountered recently that made you feel anxious in social settings?

User: Yes, I went to a gathering recently, and when people started talking to me, I didn't know what to say. I felt really awkward.

Consultant: Social gatherings can be daunting. It’s common to feel a bit lost in conversations sometimes. What if we practiced some simple conversation starters or responses that you could use next time? 

User: That sounds helpful! I could use some prompts to feel more prepared.

Consultant: Great! Let’s think of a few. For example, you could ask someone about their favorite subjects or hobbies. What interests you about those topics? 

User: I enjoy talking about music. I could ask about what music people like or if they play any instruments.

Consultant: That's a fantastic topic! Sharing your own interests can also create a connection. Practicing those kinds of questions can ease your anxiety and make conversations flow more naturally. How do you feel about trying this in your next gathering?

User: I feel more excited to try it out now! It feels like a good way to connect with others.

Consultant: I'm really happy to hear that! Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. As we continue, we’ll work on reinforcing these skills and building your confidence further. How are you feeling about our progress today?

User: I feel like I’ve learned a lot. I see that I can manage my feelings better and take steps towards talking to others.

Consultant: That's a wonderful takeaway! You’ve shown great openness today to challenge your thoughts and seek improvement. Just remember, it's okay to take things at your own pace. If you encounter any roadblocks, we’ll address them together. 

User: Yes, I’ll definitely keep that in mind. Thank you for your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’re making, Xiaomi. Remember, I’m here for you as you continue this journey. Let’s meet again soon to follow up on how everything is going. 

User: Sounds good! I look forward to it!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaomi! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Well, I've still been feeling quite anxious when interacting with my peers. I often find myself avoiding social situations, and I really want to change that.

Consultant: I hear you. It's understandable to feel anxious, especially when it comes to social interactions. Let's explore that further—what specific situations make you feel the most anxious when you're around your friends?

User: I get really nervous when I'm with them, especially in larger groups. I worry that I won't know what to say or they'll think I'm weird.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s common to feel that way in social situations. Can you tell me what thoughts run through your mind when you're about to join a group of friends?

User: I often think that they won't like me or that I'll embarrass myself. It makes me want to stay away from them.

Consultant: Those are definitely challenging thoughts, and they contribute to your feelings of anxiety. Let’s try to identify some alternative thoughts that could help you feel more at ease. For example, is there any evidence that supports or contradicts these thoughts about your friends?

User: I mean, I don’t think they dislike me. They’ve been nice to me before, but I just can’t shake off the nerves.

Consultant: It’s good that you can recognize that there are positive aspects to your friendships. Let’s try a small experiment: next time you're in a social setting, how about you start with a simple, low-pressure conversation with just one friend? What do you think about that?

User: That sounds doable. I could try that. I just hope I don’t get too anxious.

Consultant: I believe you can do it, Xiaomi. Remember, it’s okay to feel some anxiety; it’s a part of the process. If you feel comfortable, try focusing on your friend and the conversation rather than how you think others might perceive you. How does that sound?

User: It makes sense. I think focusing more on the conversation could help me not overthink things so much.

Consultant: Yes! That’s a positive shift in mindset. Also, consider preparing a couple of topics or questions beforehand that you can bring up. Would you feel more confident if you had some ideas in mind?

User: Yes! That could work. It might help me feel less lost in the conversation.

Consultant: Great! Let’s think of a few topics together. What are some things you enjoy discussing with your friends?

User: I like talking about the shows we watch and music we like.

Consultant: Perfect! You could start with a question like, "Have you seen the latest episode of that show we both like?" It opens up the conversation naturally. How do you feel about that approach?

User: I think it could work! I'm excited to see where the conversation can go.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! I'm proud of you for being willing to step outside of your comfort zone. How do you feel about potentially having a follow-up discussion with your parents about how they can support you too?

User: I think I might talk to my mom about it. She can help me feel more comfortable, and she always listens.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan. Building that support system at home is important, too. Do you have any ideas on how to express your feelings about social situations to her?

User: I guess I could tell her that I feel anxious and maybe ask for her advice on talking to my friends.

Consultant: Yes, expressing your feelings clearly can really help her understand your experience. She might have some useful advice or even share similar experiences. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds good, actually. I think it could help me feel better.

Consultant: Remember, communicating with your mom can reinforce your support system and strengthen your courage. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about your progress in managing your anxiety?

User: I feel more optimistic about it. I think I have some good plans to try out. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Xiaomi! You’ve made great strides today. As you continue to practice these skills, remember to be kind to yourself. It takes time and effort, but you're definitely on the right path. 

User: Thank you! I'm looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: Me too! I’m here to support you whenever you need. Keep me updated on how things go with your friends and your mom. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaomi! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've been trying to talk more with my dad, especially after that family gathering. It felt a bit easier, but I still get anxious when I want to express myself.

Consultant: That's a good start, and I'm glad to hear about your effort. It sounds like you're making progress with your dad. Can you tell me what kind of thoughts or feelings come up for you when you want to speak to him?

User: I often feel like my words might not come out right, or that he won't really listen to me. Sometimes I worry that I’ll just make things awkward.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those worries, especially when trying to connect with someone. Can you think of a specific moment when you felt that anxiety while talking to him? What went through your mind?

User: Yes, during our last conversation, I wanted to tell him about school, but I thought he might be too busy or uninterested. I ended up saying very little.

Consultant: It sounds like you were concerned about his reaction. What emotions did that worry stir up in you at that moment?

User: I felt a mix of anxiety and disappointment. I wanted to share more, but then I just froze.

Consultant: That makes sense. Wanting to connect yet feeling stuck is a tough spot to be in. Let's explore this anxiety a bit further. What do you think might be the worst outcome if you do try to share your thoughts, even if it's not perfect?

User: I guess I worry he might think I'm being bothersome or that I’m not interesting enough to talk to.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that. It’s important to challenge those thoughts—Is there any evidence that supports those fears? Or could there be another outcome?

User: I think he might actually be happy to hear from me, but I just get caught up in worrying about it. 

Consultant: That's a valuable insight! It shows that you have a more positive possibility to focus on. Have you ever thought of approaching the conversation in a light-hearted way to ease that tension? 

User: That could work! Maybe if I crack a joke or start with something fun, it’ll feel easier to talk.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Humor can really help lighten the mood. How do you feel about making a plan for your next conversation with your dad? 

User: I’m nervous but excited about it. I think having a plan will help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: Planning can indeed provide a sense of direction and calm. What specific topics or fun anecdotes do you think you could share with him to initiate the conversation?

User: I could tell him about a funny thing that happened at school with my friends. I think he’d find that interesting.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic opener! Sharing light-hearted experiences can encourage him to engage more with you. How do you feel thinking about trying this approach?

User: I feel a lot more confident now, and even a bit excited to give it a shot!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Confidence is key. Let's think about how you can reinforce this new strategy. Besides humor, what other skills or techniques could help you feel more at ease in these chats?

User: Maybe reminding myself that it’s okay to make mistakes? It’s not all about being perfect in a conversation.

Consultant: Absolutely! Being accepting of mistakes can really reduce pressure. Would you feel comfortable practicing those thoughts before your next chat? 

User: Yes! I think I'll write them down and have them in mind before I talk to him.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid approach. Writing them down can serve as a great reminder. Let’s set a goal. What do you hope to achieve from your next conversation with your dad?

User: I want to feel relaxed and actually exchange some thoughts instead of just keeping quiet.

Consultant: That's a wonderful goal! Feeling relaxed will create a better atmosphere for conversation. After your next chat, can we plan to reflect on how it went and any feelings that came up?

User: Yes, I’d like that. It’ll help me see what worked and what I can improve.

Consultant: Great! Reflection is a powerful tool for growth. Now, let’s wrap up today's session. What’s one takeaway or learning you want to hold on to from our conversation today?

User: I think it's that I can approach my dad with a lighter attitude, and it’s okay to be imperfect.

Consultant: That's a fantastic takeaway! Embracing imperfections can lead to more genuine connections. I believe you're on the right path, Xiaomi. I’m looking forward to hearing how your next conversation goes!

User: Thank you! I feel more motivated now to try out what we discussed. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember, you're not alone in this, and every little step counts. Until our next session, take care, and we’ll talk soon about your progress!

User: Bye! I’ll keep you posted!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaomi! It’s great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel better, actually. I’ve been participating more in class activities, and my classmates seem to appreciate my contributions. It’s nice to feel recognized.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve been building your confidence through those interactions. Can you tell me more about how it felt to connect with your classmates?

User: It felt really good! I was nervous at first, but once I started talking, I realized that I had a lot to share, and people were actually listening to me. It was a huge relief.

Consultant: It’s great that you were able to express yourself and felt heard. This is an important step in improving your communication skills. What strategies did you use to manage your nerves during those moments?

User: I reminded myself that everyone is there to learn and support each other. I also practiced what I wanted to say beforehand, which helped me feel more prepared.

Consultant: That preparation seems to have helped you significantly. Recognizing that everyone is in the same boat can also bring comfort. How do you feel about applying this practice in other settings, like at home?

User: I think it’s going to be a bit tougher at home because my mom can be strict. I want to communicate better with her, but sometimes I just freeze up.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Home environments can sometimes be more challenging due to the dynamics in place. What specific interactions do you find difficult with your mom?

User: Mostly when I want to talk about things that matter to me. I feel like she might not understand or might respond too harshly. 

Consultant: It sounds like you’re concerned about her reactions and how they might impact your ability to open up. What do you think might help alleviate that fear?

User: Maybe if I approach the conversation with something lighter first, it could help ease us into the more serious topics.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Starting with lighter topics can create a more relaxed atmosphere. Have you thought about any specific topics you could start with?

User: I could share something funny that happened at school or ask her about her day. That might help!

Consultant: Perfect! Those are good ways to engage her gently before moving into deeper conversations. How do you feel about trying that approach?

User: I feel more confident about it. Maybe I won’t hesitate as much if I start with something light.

Consultant: That's the spirit! It’s all about taking those small steps. Additionally, what feelings come up when you think about initiating a serious conversation with her after discussing lighter topics?

User: I still feel a bit anxious, but I think it’s manageable if I prepare for it.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize those feelings of anxiety. Preparation can indeed make a big difference. Let’s practice together. What might you say to her if you were to try this approach?

User: I might say, “Hey Mom, something funny happened at school today! After that, I’d like to talk to you about something that’s been on my mind.”

Consultant: That sounds really approachable and clear! It opens the door for both light-heartedness and deeper conversations. How does saying that out loud feel to you?

User: It feels less daunting when I say it out loud. I think I can do this!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s all about taking action and practicing. Let’s reflect on the progress you’ve made so far. What do you think has been your biggest accomplishment since we started our sessions?

User: Really, just being able to express myself in class and preparing to communicate with my mom has been huge for me.

Consultant: That’s significant growth! It shows your dedication to improving your communication and relationships. How can you continue to build on that confidence moving forward?

User: I guess I can keep practicing with classmates and at home. I also want to set small goals for each week when it comes to conversations.

Consultant: Setting those small, achievable goals is a great strategy. It creates a sense of accomplishment and keeps you motivated. How would you like to celebrate your progress as you achieve these goals?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to something nice after reaching each goal! 

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely way to acknowledge your efforts! We're close to wrapping up our sessions, but reflect on what you’ve learned. How can you maintain these strategies in the future to ensure your continued growth?

User: I think I need to remind myself regularly about everything we've discussed and keep practicing, even when it feels uncomfortable.

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping that awareness and perseverance will be key. Remember, you’re always welcome to return if you need support, and you have the skills to manage your emotions and improve your relationships.

User: Thank you so much for your help! I feel a lot more prepared for the future now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaomi! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Best of luck as you continue to grow and communicate effectively. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaomi! It’s great to see you again. Today, I’d like to reflect on your progress since we last met. How are you feeling about your recent experiences and improvements at school?

User: Hi! I feel pretty good actually. My grades have improved after the semester exams, and I shared that with my parents. The atmosphere at home seems to be getting better, too.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re feeling more confident with your academic progress and that your relationship with your parents is also improving. How did sharing your accomplishments with them make you feel?

User: I felt proud, and my parents seemed happy too. It’s nice to see that they appreciate my efforts. 

Consultant: It’s amazing when our efforts are recognized. A positive family atmosphere can really impact our overall well-being. As you reflect on this progress, what specific changes have you noticed in yourself?

User: I've noticed that I'm more motivated to study and take on new challenges. I used to feel overwhelmed, but now I approach things with a better mindset.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift! It sounds like you’re developing greater resilience. What do you think contributed to this change in your mindset?

User: I think the conversations we had helped. You encouraged me to believe in myself. Also, I’ve been practicing some of the strategies we discussed.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It takes effort to change our thinking patterns and behaviors. Let’s build on that. What kind of strategies have you found most helpful so far?

User: I’ve been trying to set smaller goals and reward myself when I complete them. It makes studying feel less daunting.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Setting smaller, achievable goals can help maintain motivation and reduce feelings of being overwhelmed. Are there any areas where you still feel uncertain or challenges that you face?

User: Sometimes I still feel a bit anxious before big assignments or exams. I want to ensure I keep managing that.

Consultant: It's normal to feel anxious in those situations. Let’s discuss how we can navigate that anxiety. What thoughts typically come to mind when you feel this way?

User: I start thinking that I might not do well and then I panic, forgetting what I studied.

Consultant: I see. That’s a common response. Can we work on challenging those anxious thoughts together? What evidence do you have that you won’t do well, especially considering your recent improvements?

User: I guess I don't have solid evidence. I did well in the last exams, but I just fear that it was a fluke.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those fears, but recognizing your accomplishments can help counter those negative thoughts. What would you tell a friend who expressed similar worries about their exams?

User: I would tell them that they’ve worked hard and that they’re capable of succeeding.

Consultant: Exactly! You have the same capability, and applying that perspective towards yourself can make a big difference. Would you be open to practicing positive affirmations before your next exam?

User: Yes, I think that could help! 

Consultant: Great! Let’s craft a few affirmations together that resonate with you. For example, “I have prepared well, and I am capable of doing my best.” How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I like that it's simple and direct.

Consultant: Perfect! You can repeat that to yourself leading up to the exam. Let’s also think about practical steps for managing any anxiety on the day of the exam. Have you considered any relaxation techniques?

User: I’ve heard of deep breathing, but I haven’t tried it yet.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be very effective for calming nerves. Perhaps we could practice a short breathing exercise now, so you can feel how it works?

User: Sure, I’d like to try it.

Consultant: Alright, let’s take a deep breath in for four counts, hold it for four counts, and then slowly exhale for six counts. Ready? (Starts breathing exercise) Inhale… 1, 2, 3, 4, hold… 1, 2, 3, 4, and exhale… 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. How did that feel?

User: That felt surprisingly calming. I think I can use that before exams.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Incorporating such techniques can really help in managing stress. As we wrap up, let’s summarize your progress and strengthen your coping strategies. What do you think you’ve achieved during our time together?

User: I’ve learned to believe in myself more and I have new strategies for handling anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic takeaway! Remember, keeping a growth mindset and applying what you’ve learned can foster continued improvement. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate all the help you’ve given me. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaomi. It’s been a pleasure working with you. As you move forward, trust in your abilities, and know that you have the tools to manage any challenges ahead. You’re always welcome to return if you ever need support. 

User: Thank you! I will keep that in mind.

Consultant: Take care, and I wish you all the best in your future endeavors. Goodbye for now!
