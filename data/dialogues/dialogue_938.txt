Consultant: Hello, I'm glad that you're here with me today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, it's been tough. I still feel low and struggle with my self-esteem. Sometimes I think about what happened, and it just makes everything feel worse.

Consultant: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden right now. Can you describe what thoughts or feelings come up when you think about what happened?

User: I think about how I failed to handle everything, and that just amplifies my feelings of being isolated and not good enough. It's like I'm stuck in this loop of negativity.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly challenging. You mentioned feeling isolated and not good enough. Can we explore these thoughts together? What evidence do you think supports those feelings of inadequacy?

User: I guess I feel this way because I’m not where I thought I would be at my age. I see friends moving forward with their lives, and I feel like I'm just standing still.

Consultant: It’s natural to compare yourself with others, but it's important to remember everyone's journey is different. Could there be alternative ways to view your current situation, other than feeling stuck?

User: I know, but it's hard to see it that way. I sometimes remind myself that I've been through a lot. But the feeling of being behind still creeps in.

Consultant: That's a significant realization—you've faced challenges that many might not understand. Let's consider your feelings of being behind. Can you think of some positive steps you've taken recently, even small ones?

User: I suppose I've been trying to go for walks and talk to my parents more, but it still feels insufficient.

Consultant: Those are positive steps, and it's commendable that you're making an effort to connect with your parents. How do you feel after those walks or conversations?

User: They do help a bit. My parents are supportive, but sometimes I worry that I burden them with my problems.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel that way. It shows you care about your family's feelings. However, maintaining open communication can strengthen your bond with them. What do you think would happen if you shared your feelings with them?

User: I fear they might see me as weak. I don’t want to add to their stress.

Consultant: I understand that concern. But sharing your feelings can often relieve some pressure on you. Your parents might value the opportunity to support you rather than seeing it as a burden. What if we thought about how to approach that conversation?

User: Maybe I could start by telling them I’m just struggling a bit? That might be easier than sharing everything all at once.

Consultant: That sounds like a good approach! Starting with small steps can help ease both you and them into the conversation. How do you think you would feel after talking to them?

User: I think it would relieve some pressure, knowing I’m not carrying everything alone.

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing that you're not alone in your struggles is crucial. Let's shift gears a little. Could we talk about any social interactions you might have had recently? How did those make you feel?

User: Honestly, I've been avoiding socializing. I feel awkward and think people might judge me for what happened.

Consultant: Avoidance can feel like a safe option, but it might reinforce those feelings of negativity. What would be a manageable social situation for you to try, perhaps with close friends or family?

User: I could try inviting a friend over for a movie. It feels low-pressure compared to going out.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! It can be a great way to reconnect without too much pressure. How do you feel about making that invitation?

User: I’m a bit nervous, but I think I could do it. It might be nice to just hang out.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous, but taking that step can bring a sense of accomplishment as well. Would you like to set a goal for when to reach out to your friend?

User: Maybe by the end of this week? That gives me some time to think about it.

Consultant: That’s a realistic timeframe! Remember, it's just an invitation, and you have the control over how much you want to share. Let’s talk about how you can manage any overwhelming feelings that come up before or during the invitation.

User: Maybe I can just remind myself that it’s okay to feel nervous and that my friend is there to support me.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Acknowledging your emotions rather than fighting them can help you feel more grounded. How do you think this openness about your feelings will change your perspective in social situations?

User: I hope it will make me feel more at ease, knowing that it’s acceptable to be vulnerable.

Consultant: Absolutely! Vulnerability can foster deeper connections. As we wrap up today, let's reflect on the insights you've gained. What do you feel is the most significant takeaway from our conversation?

User: I realize I need to be kinder to myself and accept that it's okay to reach out for support, even if it’s messy.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway. Remember, progress is often not linear, and every small step counts. I'm proud of the progress you’ve made. How do you feel moving forward after our session today?

User: I feel a bit hopeful and ready to try talking to my friend. It feels manageable now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember to take things at your own pace and give yourself grace along the way. I'm here to support you. If you need anything, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you. I appreciate your support. It's nice to talk about these feelings openly.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm always here for you whenever you need to express yourself. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaol, welcome back to our session today. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi. I've felt a bit better since my parents came to visit. But I still feel a sense of worthlessness and I'm battling these low moods. It's tough to shake off how I feel about myself.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel a mix of emotions. Having your parents nearby can provide some comfort. Can you share more about the feelings of worthlessness or any specific thoughts that come to mind when you feel this way?

User: I often think that I’m not good enough, especially compared to my friends. They seem to be doing so much better in life. I feel like I’m stuck and I don’t know how to move forward.

Consultant: It’s tough when we compare ourselves to others, and it can really shape how we see our own self-worth. Why do you think you feel that way about your friends' achievements? What thoughts cross your mind when you make those comparisons?

User: I guess I feel like I’ve failed to meet my own expectations. I look at my friends' success and think that they must think I'm beneath them. It makes me feel even worse about myself.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be incredibly heavy to carry. Let’s try to challenge that perspective a bit. Can we explore whether there’s evidence for the idea that your friends look down on you? What might be an alternative way to think about your situation?

User: I know they care about me and have been supportive. It’s just hard to see it when I’m feeling low. I tend to focus on the negatives when I’m in this state.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re recognizing the support you have, which is a positive step. In those moments of feeling low, it’s natural to latch onto negative thoughts. What do you think would help you shift your focus to the positives instead?

User: I think talking to someone or writing things down might help. I can see that the feelings I experience are not completely accurate.

Consultant: Writing can indeed be a powerful tool. It allows you to express your thoughts and feelings and perhaps see them from a different angle. If you were to start a journaling practice, what kinds of positive things would you want to write about?

User: I could write about my small achievements, like how I manage to care for patients at work, or even how I reached out to friends when I felt down. Those moments matter too.

Consultant: Absolutely, those are significant achievements, and recognizing them can help build your self-esteem. How do you feel about setting a goal of journaling a few times a week to focus on those positive aspects?

User: I think that could be helpful. It would give me something to focus on instead of just my low feelings. I’d like to try that.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan, Xiaol! As you continue this practice, let’s also consider exploring some social situations. What are your thoughts on gradually engaging with friends or stepping out a bit more?

User: That feels a bit daunting. I worry about being judged or not fitting in. But I know isolating myself won't help me either.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel anxious about social interactions, especially when experiencing low moods. How about we brainstorm some small steps you could take to gently ease into social situations, like reaching out to a friend for a casual chat?

User: I could try texting a friend just to check in. It seems manageable, and it would help me feel connected again.

Consultant: Checking in with a friend sounds like a wonderful first step. It’s a way to engage without overwhelming yourself. How do you think you’ll feel after sending that message?

User: I think it might lighten my mood a little. I do miss talking to them and sharing what’s been going on.

Consultant: Reaching out can definitely help strengthen those connections. Let’s focus on that action, and we can talk about it in our next session. Also, how do you feel about scheduling a time for reflection after your journaling or social interactions?

User: I like that idea. It would be good to assess how I’m feeling at those moments and see if there’s any change.

Consultant: Fantastic! Reflecting on those experiences can help reinforce the positive thoughts and feelings. Before we wrap up today, is there anything else you want to focus on or discuss regarding what we talked about?

User: I think I’m good for now. I have some ideas to work on, and I feel a bit lighter after talking.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Xiaol! Remember, it's a journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. I'm glad we could discuss these strategies today. I am looking forward to hearing how it goes in our next session!

Consultant: Hello, L! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I'm feeling a bit better, I guess. The group support has been really helpful, but I still have moments of doubt about my self-worth.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that the group support has made a positive impact. It's completely normal to experience doubts about self-worth. Can you tell me more about the moments when you feel this way?

User: Well, sometimes I just feel like I'm not good enough, especially in comparison to others. It’s hard to shake that feeling off.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, L. Comparing ourselves to others can often lead to feeling inadequate. When you experience these feelings, what kind of thoughts come to your mind?

User: I often think about my failures and how others are doing so much better, especially my friends and my brother. It makes me feel so small.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy to carry. Let's explore them a bit. When you think about your brother or friends, is there a specific situation that triggers this comparison?

User: Yes, I feel it when I see them succeeding in their careers or getting positive feedback, while I’m still figuring things out.

Consultant: It sounds like their successes are highlighting your own struggles. Do you think these thoughts are reflecting the whole picture of who you are and what you’ve achieved?

User: I guess not. I have my own strengths, but sometimes it feels overshadowed by everyone else’s achievements.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s essential to recognize your own strengths. Would you like to practice identifying some of those strengths together?

User: Sure, that sounds helpful.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start by listing three accomplishments you’ve achieved in your nursing career that you feel proud of.

User: Hmm, I’ve successfully managed several patient care plans, received positive feedback from my supervisors, and I feel I make a difference when comforting patients.

Consultant: Those are wonderful achievements, L! You should be proud of them. How do you feel when you reflect on those accomplishments?

User: I feel a little happier and more confident when I think about them.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Acknowledging these positive experiences can help shift your perspective. Now, let’s talk about emotional regulation techniques. Have you heard of deep breathing exercises?

User: I have, but I haven't tried them much.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be a great tool to manage stress. Would you be open to trying a deep breathing exercise together right now?

User: Yes, I would like to try that.

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four, hold it for four, and then slowly breathe out through your mouth for a count of four. Ready? Inhale… 1, 2, 3, 4… hold… 1, 2, 3, 4… now exhale… 1, 2, 3, 4. How did that feel?

User: It felt calming. I think I should do this more often.

Consultant: I'm glad you felt calm. Remember, it’s all about practice. The more you integrate this into your routine, the easier it will get during stressful moments. What situations do you think might trigger anxiety for you where you could use this technique?

User: I think I could use it before I go into a tough situation, like at work when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity to use deep breathing. Let’s also talk about how the group discussions have affected you. Do you feel more comfortable sharing your emotions with others now?

User: Yes, I feel a sense of belonging in the group, and it’s nice to know I’m not alone in feeling lost.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear you’ve found a sense of belonging. Connecting with others can bring a lot of healing. How do you think this connection can help you cope with your feelings of loss?

User: It makes me feel supported and understood. I think it helps lessen the burden of my emotions.

Consultant: Exactly! Support is key. Moving forward, would you be open to sharing your experiences with the group more frequently?

User: Yes, I’d like to share more. I think it could help both me and others.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset, L. Sharing can foster connection and understanding. As we wrap up today’s session, how do you feel about the strategies we discussed? 

User: I feel hopeful. I have some concrete steps to take.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember that you’re not alone in this journey. Embracing your strengths and using breathing techniques can help you navigate through challenges. I believe in your ability to grow and find positive energy moving forward.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, L! Let’s continue to build on this progress in our next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, little L! I'm glad to see you again today. I want to check in on how you've been feeling since our last session. Can you share what's been on your mind lately?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better, but I still struggle with feelings of sadness and frustration. I’ve talked with some of the other patients during group therapy, and it helps a little. But I still feel like my emotions are all over the place.

Consultant: It's great to hear you've found some support in your group discussions. Connecting with others can often help us feel less alone. Can you tell me more about the emotions you're experiencing and how they are affecting you?

User: Well, sometimes I feel really overwhelmed and just want to shut down. I think about my family and my responsibilities, and that makes it worse. I worry that I’m not living up to their expectations or even my own.

Consultant: That sounds very challenging, feeling overwhelmed by expectations both from yourself and others. It’s understandable to struggle with that. Can you think of a specific moment when these feelings became really intense for you?

User: Yes, there was a day when my coworkers were really busy, and I felt like I was falling behind. I started to feel anxious and tearful, and I just wanted to escape. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way when under pressure. How did you cope with those feelings in that moment? Did you reach out for support, or did you choose to handle it on your own?

User: I mostly just tried to hide it. I didn’t want anyone to think I was weak, so I just kept pushing through. But inside, I felt awful.

Consultant: It’s understandable to want to appear strong, but hiding our feelings can sometimes add to our emotional burden. If you could express those feelings without fear of judgment, what do you think you would say?

User: I would say that I need help and that I’m scared of not being enough. I wish it was easier to ask for support.

Consultant: Expressing those feelings takes a lot of courage. Acknowledging that you need help is an important step. What if we could explore some ways to reach out for support that feel more comfortable for you?

User: That could be helpful. I just don’t know how to start. 

Consultant: Let’s think about small actions you could take. What about starting with someone you trust, perhaps a close friend or family member? How might you approach them about how you're feeling?

User: I think I could talk to my brother. He has always been supportive, but I feel like I’m burdening him.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. However, support often strengthens relationships. How do you think your brother would react if you shared your struggles with him?

User: I believe he would be understanding. We’ve always had a good bond, but I feel guilty about worrying him.

Consultant: It’s normal to have those feelings. It may help to remind yourself that sharing might bring you closer and help him understand what you're going through. What do you think about trying to express those thoughts to him?

User: I think I could try that. Maybe just talking about it would relieve some of the pressure I feel.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step! What would be a good time for you to have that conversation with him? 

User: I could probably do it this weekend when we have time to sit down. 

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan. Remember, it’s okay to share your feelings. You might feel lighter after expressing what’s on your mind. How are you feeling about this idea now?

User: I feel a little nervous but also somewhat relieved. I think it could help me.

Consultant: That's a healthy reaction! It's normal to feel nervous before opening up to someone. Just take it one step at a time. Are there any specific things you’d like to say when you have this conversation?

User: I want to express how I've been feeling and let him know I sometimes struggle. I think that’s a good starting point.

Consultant: Absolutely! Starting with your feelings can help set the tone for an open conversation. After you talk to him, I’d love for you to share how it went during our next session. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I feel more hopeful about the idea now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It's important you take these steps at your own pace. Before we wrap up today, are there any other emotions or thoughts you want to explore together?

User: I think we’ve covered a lot for today. I appreciate the support. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I appreciate your openness today. Remember, it takes time to process these changes, and every small step counts. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!

User: Thank you! I will. I'm feeling more motivated to try speaking with my brother now.
###################
Consultant: Hello, L! I'm glad to see you again. It’s great to hear that you’ve been exploring your inner feelings through creative activities like painting. How are you feeling today?

User: Hi. I'm feeling a bit better overall, but sometimes I still get those waves of sadness. The painting does help, but I just wonder if I can keep that calm feeling for longer.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re beginning to notice some positive changes, and it’s normal to have fluctuations in emotion. Let’s talk more about that calm feeling you experienced while painting. Can you describe what it felt like for you?

User: When I was painting, I felt this sense of peace wash over me. It was like I could forget everything else, even if just for a moment. I want to hold onto that feeling.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Capturing that sense of peace could be really beneficial for you. What do you think you could do outside of painting to help maintain that calm in your daily life?

User: Maybe I could try to set aside some time each day for creative activities or even just some quiet time to reflect. It just gets challenging with work and everything.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Establishing a routine that includes creative activities and mindfulness could help you maintain that feeling. What kind of time frame do you think would be realistic for you to set aside for yourself each day?

User: I think maybe 20 to 30 minutes a day would be doable. I don’t want to overwhelm myself, but I really want to make it a habit.

Consultant: That sounds very reasonable and manageable. Building it gradually into your routine can help turn it into a habit without feeling overwhelmed. What kind of creative activity besides painting are you interested in incorporating?

User: I’m not sure. I’ve thought about journaling or maybe even trying some other forms of art, like clay or crafting. 

Consultant: Those all sound like excellent options! Journaling, in particular, could be a powerful way to express your thoughts and feelings. If you feel comfortable, we can explore how you might integrate journaling into your routine. What do you think?

User: I think journaling could be really helpful. Sometimes I just have all these thoughts racing, and it would be nice to get them out on paper.

Consultant: Absolutely! Writing can be a fantastic way to observe and process your emotions. Would you like to discuss some prompts or themes you could focus on in your journaling to support your emotional exploration?

User: Yes, that would be great! I could use some help figuring out where to start.

Consultant: How about starting with daily reflections? You can write about what made you feel calm and at peace, like your painting sessions. Another option could be to express any feelings that arise during the day. Would that resonate with you?

User: Yes, definitely! I like the idea of reflecting on the calming moments. It might help me appreciate them more.

Consultant: That’s a lovely approach. Acknowledging and appreciating those moments can strengthen your ability to find calm. Now, thinking about those challenging times, what feelings or thoughts do you notice surface when you experience sadness?

User: I often feel overwhelmed and like I'm not good enough. It's a pretty dark cloud that hangs over me sometimes.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty in sharing that. It’s essential to recognize those feelings as they arise. When those thoughts come up, we can work on identifying them and understanding if they are true or perhaps a bit distorted. Would you like to practice that now?

User: Sure, I’d like to try.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment. When you notice that overwhelming feeling and the thought of not being good enough, could you try to identify the evidence that supports that thought?

User: I guess I think about times I made mistakes, like not performing well at work or in my personal life. 

Consultant: That’s completely understandable—we all have moments of self-doubt. However, it’s important to balance those thoughts with reminders of your strengths and past successes. Can you think of a recent achievement or something positive you've done that counters that negative thought?

User: I did receive positive feedback from my supervisor about my patient care lately. I suppose I can remind myself of that.

Consultant: That’s an excellent example! Recognizing your achievements is crucial, especially when negative thoughts arise. How could you incorporate this positive feedback into your daily reflections?

User: Maybe I could include it in my journaling when I reflect on my days. That could help me flip the script on the negative thoughts.

Consultant: Absolutely! Integrating those positive reminders into your journaling will reinforce a more balanced view of yourself. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the strategies we discussed?

User: I feel much more hopeful! I’m excited about trying out journaling and setting aside creative time.

Consultant: I'm so pleased to hear that, L! You've made significant progress. As you continue this journey, remember to be gentle with yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you find yourself struggling again. How do you envision your emotional state improving over the coming weeks?

User: I think if I stick to these routines, I can reduce my sadness and find more peace. I’m feeling more optimistic about the future.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset to have! Let’s check in during our next session to see how these strategies are working for you, and we can adjust as needed. Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings today, L. You’re doing an amazing job.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance. I'm looking forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao L! It's great to see you again. You've made significant progress since our last meeting. How are you feeling today?

User: Hi! I'm feeling quite good, actually. My mood has been relatively stable, and I’m optimistic about moving forward. But I do have some concerns about what happens after I leave the hospital.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear your mood is stable and you’re feeling optimistic. It's normal to have concerns about moving on. Could you share what specifically worries you about leaving the hospital?

User: I think I'm worried about whether I can maintain this positive mindset outside of here. It feels safe in the hospital, where everything is structured, but what if I can't handle things on my own?

Consultant: That’s a very valid concern. It’s understandable to feel apprehensive about transitioning back to everyday life. Let’s explore what aspects of your current situation feel supportive and how you might recreate those outside. What do you think has helped you feel safe and supported here?

User: I really appreciate the routine and the support from the staff. They’ve been there to listen and help me talk through my feelings. I’m not sure I'll have that outside.

Consultant: Having a structured routine and support is indeed very important. We can work together to establish a plan that incorporates both. What kind of support network do you think you can create when you go home? 

User: I have some friends and family, but I'm not sure how open I can be with them about what I've been going through. I'm worried they'll judge me or not understand.

Consultant: It’s common to feel unsure about sharing such personal experiences. Remember, not everyone may fully understand, but having at least one person you can be open with can make a difference. Would you feel comfortable discussing how you might approach talking to someone you trust? 

User: I think I could talk to my brother. He’s always been supportive, but I feel embarrassed sharing how I struggled. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but sharing can often lead to deeper connections. Perhaps you could start by sharing how you’ve been feeling recently, without going into every detail. How does that sound to you? 

User: That sounds manageable. I guess I could begin with just saying I’ve been working on my mental health, which is true.

Consultant: That sounds like a great starting point! It allows you to share your journey without feeling overwhelmed. Now, apart from your brother, are there any community resources or groups you could connect with for additional support? 

User: I’ve heard about some local support groups for mental health, but I’m hesitant to join. I’m nervous about meeting new people.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous about new situations. Joining a support group can provide a sense of belonging and allow you to connect with others who have similar experiences. How about exploring just attending a meeting once to see how it feels? 

User: That might be doable. I guess I can just go and not commit to anything long-term yet.

Consultant: That's a great approach! It’s all about taking small steps. What other activities do you think you could engage in to maintain your emotional well-being after leaving the hospital? 

User: Maybe I could start journaling again. I used to find it helpful to express my thoughts on paper. 

Consultant: Journaling is an excellent idea! It allows you to reflect on your feelings and track your progress. Would you consider setting aside some time each day, even if it’s just a few minutes, to write about your experiences? 

User: Yes, I could definitely try to do that. I think it would help me process things better.

Consultant: Absolutely! It can be a powerful tool for processing emotions. As you prepare to leave the hospital, do you feel there are specific strategies you’ve learned here that you want to take with you? 

User: I think having a daily routine and practicing mindfulness could really help. 

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies to take with you! Mindfulness can help manage stress in the moment, and having a routine can provide structure. How do you plan to incorporate mindfulness into your daily life? 

User: I could start with some short meditation sessions, maybe even just five minutes each morning. 

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Starting small makes it more manageable. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on the progress you've made. What do you feel has been your greatest accomplishment during your time here? 

User: I think just understanding that it’s okay to ask for help and knowing I can work on my feelings has been huge for me.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization, and it will serve you well as you transition back into daily life. Remember, you have the tools and support around you. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I feel much more confident about what’s ahead now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao L! I’m proud of the progress you've made, and I believe you can continue this journey. If you ever need to talk again or need additional support, you know where to find me. 

User: I will. Thank you for everything! 

Consultant: It's my pleasure! Take care of yourself, and I wish you all the best as you move forward. Goodbye for now!

User: Goodbye!
