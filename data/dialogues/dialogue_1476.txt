Consultant: Hello, Xiao Cai! I'm glad to see you today. Before we start, I'd like to talk about how you've been feeling lately. Can you share a bit about what's been going on?

User: Hi. I don't know... I just get really angry sometimes, especially with my classmates. Like recently, I pushed a kid I don't like and we ended up fighting. I just don't know why I lose my temper so quickly.

Consultant: It sounds like you're dealing with some really strong emotions, and it's been difficult for you to manage them. Let's explore this together. Can you tell me more about what you feel before you explode with anger?

User: Yeah, I feel this heat rising inside me, and all I can think about is how much I don't like that person. I just can't help it, I feel like I need to do something.

Consultant: I see. That rising heat and strong feelings can be really overwhelming. It makes sense that when you feel that way, you might react impulsively. What do you think triggers those feelings of anger for you?

User: I think it's mostly when people annoy me or when things don’t go my way. But sometimes, I just feel the anger without even knowing why.

Consultant: It's helpful that you've noticed those triggers. Understanding what annoys you can be the first step in managing your reactions. Can you think of any specific situations that have made you feel angry recently?

User: Well, during recess, there was this kid who was bothering me, and I just... I couldn’t control myself. I pushed him away and said some mean things.

Consultant: It sounds like that moment was really intense for you. When you look back at it, how do you feel about your actions afterward?

User: I feel bad because I know it’s wrong, but in the moment, I just can't think straight. It's like I’m not myself.

Consultant: That's an important insight, Xiao Cai. Recognizing that you don’t feel like yourself when you’re angry is a step towards understanding your emotions better. What do you think might help you before those intense feelings take over?

User: I really don’t know. I just want to stop feeling this way. I don’t want to hurt people or get in trouble anymore.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. Wanting to change is a great first step. We can learn some methods to help you manage those feelings before they escalate. Would you be open to trying some techniques?

User: Yes, I’d really like to learn how to calm down.

Consultant: Great! One technique is to identify the physical signs of anger, like that heat you mentioned. When you notice those signs, it can be a cue for you to take a moment and breathe deeply. Would you like to try practicing that together?

User: Sure, how do I do that?

Consultant: First, let’s practice deep breathing. When you start to feel angry, take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four... and then exhale through your mouth for a count of four. Let’s do that a few times now. 

User: Okay, like this? (pauses to practice breathing)

Consultant: Exactly! How do you feel after practicing that?

User: I do feel a bit calmer actually. It’s nice to have something to focus on.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Focusing on your breath can be a powerful tool. It's also helpful to think about alternatives to reacting with anger. Can you think of a different way you might respond when someone annoys you?

User: Maybe I could just walk away or talk to a teacher instead of yelling or pushing?

Consultant: That’s a very positive strategy! Walking away or seeking help from someone can prevent the situation from escalating. How do you think you will feel if you try this next time?

User: I think I would feel better because I wouldn't get into trouble, and I wouldn’t hurt anyone.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about choosing a different path. What would be a good reminder for you to use these new techniques when you start to feel angry?

User: Maybe I can write it down or tell my sister about it so she can remind me.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Having someone support you can make a big difference. As we wrap up today, let's reflect on what we've learned. How can you use these strategies to manage your anger in the future?

User: I guess by breathing deeply and trying to walk away instead of reacting right away. I want to try that.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Xiao Cai. Remember, it’s okay to have those feelings, but how you choose to respond is what matters. I'm proud of your efforts today, and if you ever feel stuck, you can always come back for more support. 

User: Thanks! I feel like I have some good ideas now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing how it goes next time. You're showing such great determination, and I believe you can manage your feelings better. Let's check in again soon.

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Cai! It’s great to see you here today. I understand that you've been feeling a bit frustrated about your emotions lately. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?

User: Hi. I've been really upset. In Chinese class, I kept making noise and then the teacher criticized me. I lost control and ended up shouting and throwing things. I don't like it when I act like that, but I just can't help it sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like you felt really overwhelmed in that moment. It's understandable to feel that way when things don't go as planned. What do you think triggers those strong feelings for you?

User: I think when I feel criticized or when I’m told what to do, I just get really angry. It's like I can't control myself. I wish I could just stay calm.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It must be really tough to feel that anger and frustration. Let's explore together: what would it look like for you to stay calm when you're faced with those criticisms?

User: I guess I want to just take a deep breath and not shout. Maybe I can talk back to the teacher without being rude. I just need to know how to do that.

Consultant: That’s a great goal! Staying calm is a valuable skill. Can you think of any specific situations, besides the classroom, where you’ve felt this way and wanted to respond differently?

User: Yes! Sometimes at home when my dad gets angry, I just want to yell back at him or push my sister. It feels like no one understands me.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel misunderstood and to want to react when emotions are high. Let's try to break that down a bit. When you feel that anger, what kind of thoughts run through your mind?

User: I think it’s unfair that I’m being yelled at. I feel like no one cares how I feel, and I just get really mad.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling hurt and frustrated. Those thoughts can indeed escalate your feelings. What if we look at those thoughts more closely? Is there another way to think about those situations?

User: I guess I could think that maybe they are just upset too and not really against me. But it’s hard to remember that when I’m angry.

Consultant: That's a very insightful observation! It's a great step to recognize that their reactions might not be personal. Next time you feel that anger rising, would it help to remind yourself of this perspective?

User: Maybe. But I still feel like I need to express that I'm upset without losing control. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Expressing your feelings is important. We can work on finding better ways to let others know how you feel without letting the anger take over. Would you like to role-play a situation to practice this?

User: Okay, I’m willing to try that. What should I say?

Consultant: Let’s say the teacher just criticized you again. You could start by taking a deep breath. Then, instead of reacting with anger, try saying something like, "I feel frustrated when you criticize me. Can we talk about what I can do better?"

User: Hmm, that sounds better. It feels less aggressive.

Consultant: Exactly! Using "I" statements helps you express your feelings without pointing fingers. What do you think would be your next step to practice this?

User: I think I could practice that with my sister. When we argue, I can tell her how I feel instead of yelling.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea, Xiao Cai! Practicing with your sister can help you get used to expressing yourself calmly. How do you feel about trying this out this week?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but excited to try. I really want to improve.

Consultant: That’s a great attitude! Feeling nervous is normal, but it shows you care about making a change. Let’s set a goal—can you try this at least three times with your sister or anyone else?

User: Yes, I can do that. I hope it goes well.

Consultant: I’m sure you’ll do great! Remember, it’s all about practice. Before we conclude today, let’s recap what strategies we discussed.

User: Okay! I need to take deep breaths, remember it’s not personal, and use "I" statements to express how I feel.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve got it! And if you find yourself struggling, it’s okay to pause and take that breath. We’re building skills, and it takes time.

User: Thanks! I feel a little more ready to handle things now.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xiao Cai! I'm proud of the steps you're taking. Remember, it’s okay to reach out if you need more support. I look forward to hearing how your practice goes next time. Don't hesitate to come back if you feel overwhelmed. 

User: I will! Thanks for your help today. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! Take care and see you next time!

Consultant: Hi there, Xiaocai! I’m glad you’re here today. I’d love to hear about what’s been on your mind lately.

User: Hello! I’ve been feeling really confused about how to handle conflicts, especially after what happened in the morning class. I got into a fight with the class president over the points he deducted from our group. 

Consultant: I see, that sounds frustrating. It’s tough to balance emotions with rules sometimes. Can you tell me more about how you felt during that situation?

User: I felt really angry and unfairly treated. It was like I just couldn’t control myself anymore. I wanted to express my feelings, but things escalated so quickly.

Consultant: It sounds like your feelings were really strong in that moment. When you felt angry, what kind of thoughts were racing through your mind at that time?

User: I thought that he was being unfair and that I shouldn't just accept it. I felt like I had to fight back to stand up for myself.

Consultant: Standing up for yourself is important, but it can be tricky to manage those feelings while communicating. Have you had a chance to think about other ways to express your discontent without resorting to confrontation?

User: Not really. I’m just not sure how to say it without getting angry. I don’t want to seem like I’m weak or letting them walk all over me.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It’s important to express how you feel without feeling weak. Maybe we can explore some ways to communicate your feelings more calmly. Would you be open to trying that?

User: Sure! I’d like to know how I can do that.

Consultant: Great! One approach we can use is called “I statements.” For example, instead of saying "You are unfair," you can say, "I feel upset when rules change suddenly." This way, you're expressing your feelings without blaming the other person. What do you think about that?

User: That sounds like a better way! I haven’t thought about it that way before.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! We can practice this together. Let’s say you're upset about a rule. Can you try to express that using an “I statement”?

User: Hmm... I guess I would say, “I feel frustrated when I don’t get to explain my side before points are taken away.” 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a perfect example. How does expressing it that way feel compared to how you usually address conflicts?

User: It feels less aggressive. I think it might help me stay calm better.

Consultant: Absolutely! And it also invites others to understand your feelings, which can lead to better conversations. Can you think of a situation where you might use this “I statement” approach in the future?

User: Maybe the next time I feel that a rule doesn't make sense. I can tell my teacher how I feel instead of just acting out.

Consultant: That sounds like a smart plan! By using this technique, you'll not only express your emotions but also open the door for a conversation. What do you think would be a good first step to put this into practice?

User: I could prepare what I want to say, maybe even write it down before talking to someone, so I don’t forget.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Preparing ahead can really help you stay focused on expressing yourself calmly. Is there anyone specific you’d like to practice this with first?

User: Maybe I’ll start with my sister. She usually understands me, so it might be easier.

Consultant: That’s a good strategy! Talking to someone you trust can help you feel more comfortable. Additionally, it gives you the chance to experiment with these new skills. How do you feel about trying this out with her?

User: I feel hopeful! I really want to change how I react in these situations.

Consultant: I’m really happy to hear that. It’s a great step towards managing your emotions better. This curiosity about interactions will help you learn and grow. Now, let’s discuss how you can celebrate even small successes as you practice these skills.

User: I guess if I successfully express myself without fighting, I could treat myself with a special snack or something.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Celebrating your achievements, no matter how small, will encourage you to keep practicing. As you work on these new skills, remember to be patient with yourself. Change takes time.

User: Thanks! I feel like I have a clearer idea of how to handle it now.

Consultant: You're welcome, Xiaocai! I’m proud of the progress you’re making. Before we end today, what is one thing you’re most looking forward to trying this week?

User: I’m looking forward to talking to my sister and seeing how that goes. I think I can do it!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! I believe in you. Remember, the goal is not perfection but progress. Let’s check in next time on how it went. You’ve got this!

User: Thank you! I can't wait for our next session.

Consultant: Of course! Take care, and I look forward to hearing how everything goes next time. Goodbye!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaocai! I'm glad to have you here today. How have you been feeling about your school activities lately?

User: Hi! I've been curious about the group activities at school. I really want to get along better with my classmates, but sometimes I still have small fights with them.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're curious and want to improve your relationships. Those small conflicts can be challenging. Can you tell me more about what happens during those moments of tension with your classmates?

User: Well, sometimes we disagree on what to do, and I can get really frustrated. There are times when it ends up in a pushing match.

Consultant: I understand. Frustration can be a strong feeling when things don’t go as planned. What do you think triggers that frustration during group activities?

User: I think when I feel that nobody listens to my ideas, I get upset. Then I just want to make sure my voice is heard, even if it means arguing.

Consultant: That makes sense. Feeling unheard can be very frustrating. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come to mind when you feel that way during the activities?

User: I often think, "Everyone else is ignoring me," or "If I don't fight for my ideas, they won't take me seriously."

Consultant: Those thoughts can certainly add to your frustration. I wonder if you'd be open to exploring alternative ways to express your ideas without leading to conflict. What do you think?

User: Yeah, I guess that could help. But it’s hard to change how I react in the moment.

Consultant: I completely understand that—it can be challenging to adjust our reactions when emotions are high. Let’s work together on finding some strategies that can help you express your thoughts while keeping things calm. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I’d like to try.

Consultant: Great! One approach could be to practice using “I” statements, like “I feel frustrated when my ideas aren’t heard. I would appreciate if we could talk about them together.” How does this approach make you feel?

User: I think that might work. It seems less aggressive than just arguing.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s a way to communicate without escalating tension. I’d encourage you to try it in your next group activity. Can you think of a situation where you could use this?

User: Yeah, we have a project coming up. I could try using “I” statements during our discussions.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic opportunity! How can we set a goal for you to use this strategy during your project discussions?

User: I want to remind myself before each meeting to use those “I” statements. I’ll even practice them a bit beforehand.

Consultant: Practicing beforehand is a wonderful idea! It can help you feel more prepared. What else do you think might help you remember to do this?

User: Maybe I could ask a friend to remind me during the meeting, so I don’t forget.

Consultant: Perfect! Having someone to support you can make a huge difference. What do you feel might be a good way to ask them for that help?

User: I could just tell them that I’m trying to communicate better and ask them to nudge me if I start getting frustrated.

Consultant: That sounds very clear and straightforward. How does that make you feel about working with your friend on this?

User: I feel more confident, actually. It’s good to have someone on my side.

Consultant: That’s excellent! Confidence is key when working in a team. How do you think your classmates will respond to your attempts to communicate differently?

User: I hope they will understand and take me seriously. At least I’m trying, right?

Consultant: Absolutely! Trying is the first step, and your efforts will show them that you want to collaborate positively. What skills do you think you could additionally develop to enhance your teamwork experience?

User: Maybe I could learn to listen better and really understand what others are saying instead of just waiting to speak.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic insight! Active listening is an important skill in any group. How might you practice this in your next group activity?

User: I’ll focus on really paying attention when others are talking and see if I can summarize what they say before adding my thoughts.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach to show you value their input, and it will likely help reduce misunderstandings. How are you feeling about your progress today, Xiaocai?

User: I feel hopeful! I have some really good ideas to try and I’m excited to work on them.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It sounds like you’re developing a more positive mindset about team interactions. Remember to be patient with yourself as you practice these new skills. Is there anything else on your mind that you'd like to discuss today?

User: No, I think that’s it for now. I’m looking forward to putting these ideas into practice.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! I'm excited for you too. Remember, practicing these new skills will help build your confidence. Until we meet again, take care and keep me updated on your progress!

User: Thank you! I will. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hi Xiaocai! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling about your role in the team lately?

User: Hi! I feel pretty good. I realized that I actually enjoy leading activities and sharing my ideas. It feels exciting, but I also worry about whether I can do it well.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing some excitement about leadership, but also some anxiety about your performance. What do you think would help you feel more confident in taking on these new responsibilities?

User: Maybe if I could practice more or get some feedback from others. I want to make sure I'm doing a good job.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense! Practicing and receiving feedback can definitely help. When you think about the feedback you’ve received in the past, how did it make you feel? 

User: Sometimes it feels great, and other times, I get a bit frustrated if it's not very positive. It's like I want to do well but also feel scared to mess up.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way. Balancing the desire to succeed with the fear of making mistakes can be tough. Can you tell me about a time in your recent activities when you received feedback that was helpful? 

User: Yes! Last week during our group project, my classmates said that I organized the tasks really well. It felt good to hear that.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! It sounds like you successfully demonstrated your leadership skills. How did you feel in that moment when they acknowledged your efforts?

User: I felt proud. It was nice to see that my work was recognized. 

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! It's important to celebrate those moments. How do you think you can build on that positive experience in your future activities?

User: I guess I can take more initiative. If I see something that needs to be done, I should just go for it instead of waiting for someone else.

Consultant: That's a great plan! Taking initiative can help reinforce your leadership skills. What specific actions do you have in mind for when you're part of a team?

User: I could volunteer to set up meetings or ask my classmates for their opinions more often. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid approach! Engaging with your classmates can also help you feel more connected as a leader. How do you feel about reaching out for their opinions?

User: Actually, I think it could be fun. I could learn from them too!

Consultant: Absolutely! It's a two-way street. Not only will you contribute your ideas, but you’ll also gain insights from your peers. What might be a challenge for you in this process?

User: I guess I could feel nervous when they don’t agree with my ideas. I’ve had that happen before, and it made me upset.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It's natural to feel concerned about differing opinions. If that happens, how might you respond to those feelings constructively?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to have different opinions. I just need to listen and maybe adapt my ideas.

Consultant: Perfect! Reminding yourself that differing opinions are normal can really help you stay grounded. What strategies can you use to manage your feelings during those challenging moments?

User: I could take a deep breath and maybe think about how I can find common ground instead of feeling defensive.

Consultant: That's a fantastic strategy! Deep breathing can help ease anxiety, and focusing on common ground fosters collaboration. How do you feel about trying out these strategies in your next team activity?

User: I'm feeling more confident about it now! I want to try approaching my team with these ideas.

Consultant: That's great to hear, Xiaocai! Setting those intentions can pave the way for a successful experience. Before we wrap up, what do you think will be your biggest takeaway from our conversation today?

User: I think being proactive and knowing how to handle feedback better will help me a lot.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing the importance of proactivity and feedback is a significant step toward enhancing your leadership skills. As you try out these new strategies, remember to celebrate your successes, no matter how small.

User: Thanks! This session really helped me to see things differently. 

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Keep practicing these skills, and it's okay to come back anytime if you want to talk more. You'll do great moving forward!

User: Thank you! I will!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Cai! I'm glad to see you again. I understand that you’ve been receiving positive feedback from your teachers and classmates recently. How have you been feeling about that?

User: Hi! Yeah, it feels good to hear that my behavior is improving. I think I've been trying hard to control my emotions better. But sometimes it's still tough at home.

Consultant: That's great to hear about your improvement at school! It’s normal that things can feel challenging at home, especially with the dynamics in your family. Can you share what specific things make it tough when you're with your family?

User: Well, my dad is often really stressed and can get angry easily. I feel like I have to be careful around him. My sister and I end up arguing a lot too.

Consultant: It sounds like there's quite a bit of tension at home, especially with your dad's stress and the fighting with your sister. That must be challenging for you. How do you usually feel during these arguments or moments of tension?

User: I feel frustrated and sometimes even scared. I don’t like to fight, but it just happens. I don’t know how to stop it.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. You’ve mentioned wanting to control your emotions better. When you feel frustrated, what thoughts go through your mind in those moments?

User: I often think that no one understands me, or I feel like I have to defend myself. Sometimes, I just want to yell or push back.

Consultant: Those thoughts of not being understood and feeling defensive are quite common. It's important that we explore them. What do you think happens when you act on those thoughts, like yelling or pushing back? 

User: It usually makes things worse. My dad gets angrier, and my sister just keeps arguing. Then I feel guilty afterwards.

Consultant: It’s insightful that you recognize this pattern. You feel guilty after, which shows that you care about the outcome. Let’s think about a different approach. If you didn't react in those moments, what might happen instead?

User: Maybe if I stayed calm, we could talk instead of fighting. But it’s hard to stay calm when I'm really upset.

Consultant: Yes, staying calm when you're upset can be difficult. What if we come up with some strategies together that you could try next time you feel those strong emotions? 

User: That sounds good! I’d love to find a way to handle things better.

Consultant: Wonderful! One approach could be to take deep breaths when you begin to feel frustrated. Breathing can help calm your body and mind before you respond. Do you think you could try that? 

User: I can give that a try. I just need to remember to do it.

Consultant: That’s a great attitude! Reminders can help. How about pairing that with counting to five before reacting? This could give you a moment to gather your thoughts. What do you think?

User: Counting sounds like a good idea! I can try to count in my head when I start to feel angry.

Consultant: Exactly! This way, you create space between your feelings and your actions. It’s like giving yourself a moment to choose how to respond. How do you feel about potentially using that technique?

User: I feel pretty hopeful. It seems like it could really help!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let’s also consider talking to your dad and sister about how you all can communicate better when tensions rise. Would that be something you’d feel comfortable trying?

User: I think so! If we can all talk about it, maybe it would help. 

Consultant: That’s a courageous step! Open communication could lead to a better understanding among you all. How do you think you could approach that conversation?

User: I could ask them if we can sit down together and talk about how we feel when we argue. Maybe I can explain that I want to fix it.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Expressing your feelings and intentions can really help build understanding. Remember, it's okay to keep practicing these skills. It takes time. How do you feel about our conversation so far and the strategies we discussed?

User: I feel really good! I have some things to try now. I think I can make a difference at home!

Consultant: Absolutely, you already have a solid foundation from your progress at school. Remember, it's all about consistent practice, and I'm here to support you. Would you like to set a plan to check in on how these strategies are working for you in our next session?

User: Yes! I’d like that. I want to keep improving.

Consultant: Perfect! We can review your experiences and adjust strategies as needed. Keeping track of your feelings can also be helpful, so perhaps you could keep a journal about your interactions at home? 

User: That sounds like a good idea! I’ll try to write down what happens and how I feel.

Consultant: Wonderful! Journaling can provide insight into your thoughts and feelings and help reinforce your learning. As we wrap up today, let’s take a moment to reflect on your progress. What would you say has been the most significant change for you recently?

User: I think it’s that I’m more aware of my feelings. I’m trying to control them instead of just exploding.

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement, Xiao Cai! Awareness is the first step toward change. Remember, you have the tools to manage your emotions better, and you’re not alone in this journey. I look forward to hearing how things go at our next session!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’m feeling more confident now. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm really proud of the progress you've made. Take care, and I can't wait to hear about your experiences next time. Bye for now!

User: Bye!
