Consultant: Hello, I'm glad to see you today. Let's discuss what's been on your mind. Can you share with me how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi. It's been really tough. I've felt extremely oppressed and down lately. The boys at school exclude me, and I just feel like I lack the qualities they have, which makes me anxious and self-critical.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. Feeling excluded and struggling with those self-doubts can be very heavy. Can you tell me more about what led to these feelings? Were there specific incidents that made you feel this way?

User: Yes, I recently had some conflicts with a few boys at school. It made me feel really isolated and worsened my mood. I just can't shake off this feeling of pressure.

Consultant: I understand. Conflicts can be very distressing and can affect how you see yourself in relation to others. I want to help you explore these interactions further. How do you usually react when you find yourself in those situations with your classmates?

User: I tend to withdraw or avoid those boys altogether. It's like I fear their reactions, and I don’t want to face rejection, so I just keep to myself.

Consultant: It's understandable to want to avoid uncomfortable situations. However, withdrawing may also make you feel more isolated, which can increase the anxiety you're experiencing. What do you think would happen if you tried to engage with them instead?

User: I worry that they would just reject me again or make fun of me. It feels safer not to take that risk.

Consultant: I hear you. The fear of rejection can be very powerful. Let's try to break this down together. What evidence do you have that they would reject you again? Are there instances where they might have reacted positively?

User: Well, I can't say for sure they would reject me. There are moments when they seem friendly, but my mind just jumps to the worst-case scenario.

Consultant: It’s common for our minds to focus on negative possibilities, especially when we're feeling vulnerable. It's worth exploring those positive moments. How do those moments make you feel about yourself?

User: Those moments give me a bit of hope, but they quickly fade when I remember the negative interactions.

Consultant: That hope is important! Perhaps we can work on recognizing the balance between those positive and negative experiences. What if we looked at it from a different angle? If a friend faced what you're facing, what advice would you give them?

User: I guess I’d tell them to give it a go, that not every situation will end badly. 

Consultant: That's a great perspective! It shows you already have some helpful insights. Now, would you be willing to try applying that same advice to yourself? How might you approach a situation with your classmates if you were to act as your own supportive friend?

User: I think I would try to engage them in a conversation, maybe start with something casual, like a shared interest or something.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach! Starting with common ground could help ease the tension. What might be a first step you could take next time you're in a similar situation?

User: I could maybe say something related to our class activities to break the ice. That feels a bit less scary.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Breaking the ice is a good strategy to reduce the pressure. How do you think you'll feel after trying that out?

User: I feel like it might make me anxious, but it could also feel empowering to take that step.

Consultant: Feeling anxious is perfectly natural, especially when trying something new. However, that sense of empowerment is important. It’s a sign that you’re challenging yourself, which is a positive step forward. How can we prepare you to manage any anxiety you might feel when you try this?

User: Maybe I could remind myself to take deep breaths beforehand or have a positive mantra in mind.

Consultant: Those are excellent techniques! Deep breathing helps calm the body, and a positive mantra can shift your mindset. What mantra might you choose for these situations?

User: Something like, “I am capable and deserving of connection.”

Consultant: That's a powerful mantra! By affirming your worthiness of connection, you're reinforcing a positive belief about yourself. Let’s wrap up today’s session by summarizing what we've discussed. What have you learned about yourself and your interactions with others?

User: I learned that I tend to focus on negative experiences and avoid interactions because of fear. I can challenge this perspective and take gradual steps to engage with my classmates. 

Consultant: That’s a great realization! You’ve shown a lot of insight today. Remember, building connections takes time, and it's okay to feel anxious as you navigate this. What strategies do you think will help you maintain this progress?

User: I can practice my mantra and those breathing techniques before engaging with them. And I need to remind myself of the times when things went well.

Consultant: Exactly! By preparing yourself in this way, you’re setting yourself up for success. Before we conclude our sessions, I want you to know that it’s okay to feel apprehensive, but you have the skills to handle these situations. I look forward to hearing how it goes next time. 

User: Thank you, I appreciate your help. I feel a bit more hopeful about trying to connect with them.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m glad to hear that. Remember, you are not alone in this process. If you ever feel overwhelmed again, don’t hesitate to reach out. Good luck, and take care of yourself!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. Before we begin, could you share how you've been feeling lately, especially about your interactions with your classmates?

User: Hi, I've been feeling really conflicted. I want to connect with my classmates, but I'm scared of being rejected. I recently tried to reach out, but I think I came on too strong, and now I feel like I've messed things up.

Consultant: It sounds like you're in a tough spot right now, wanting to connect but also feeling anxious about how your efforts are received. Can you tell me more about what happened during your recent attempts to interact?

User: Well, I tried to join a conversation with some guys, but I think I might have overdone it with my enthusiasm. They seemed to back away, and now I feel embarrassed. It’s like I can't find the right balance.

Consultant: I understand how that can feel really disheartening. You're striving for connection but worrying that your approach might not be right. What thoughts went through your mind when you noticed their reaction?

User: I thought maybe they just didn’t like me or found me annoying. Then I felt a wave of insecurity, like I just don't fit in.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. It's understandable to feel insecure after an experience like that. What emotions did this trigger within you?

User: I felt embarrassed and anxious, like I just wanted to disappear. It makes me question if I should even try to talk to them again.

Consultant: It sounds really tough to handle those feelings of embarrassment and anxiety. It’s great that you're willing to discuss this. Can we explore together how these thoughts and feelings connect to your desire to interact with others?

User: Sure. I guess I want to be liked and accepted. But when I feel rejected, it just hits me really hard.

Consultant: That desire for acceptance is something many people experience, and it’s completely valid. It seems like rejection amplifies your feelings of insecurity. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that pop up whenever you feel rejected?

User: I often think I’m not good enough, or that people will always find me annoying. I guess I have this fear that they’ll judge me.

Consultant: Those thoughts can certainly be damaging. You've mentioned feeling “not good enough” and fearing judgment. How do you think these thoughts affect your actions in social situations?

User: I think they make me overcompensate, trying too hard to be likable. And then when it backfires, I feel worse.

Consultant: It makes sense that overcompensating would lead to feelings of frustration when things don’t go as planned. What might happen if you took a step back and tried to approach social interactions with a different mindset?

User: I don’t know… maybe I could try to be more relaxed? But I worry that if I don’t try hard enough, people will still ignore me.

Consultant: It’s a common worry, but being relaxed can often create better connections. How about we explore some small steps you can take to practice this new approach? 

User: Okay, that sounds good, but I'm not sure what those steps would be.

Consultant: One way to start could be to set a small goal for interactions—like saying hello to someone without overthinking it. What do you think about that?

User: That seems manageable, but what if I feel too anxious to do it?

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel anxious. You could try a simple breathing exercise before approaching someone—it might help calm those nerves. Would you like to practice that together?

User: Yes, I’d be willing to try that. I think it could help.

Consultant: That’s a great choice! Let’s take a moment to breathe deeply together. Inhale… then exhale. It's a simple but effective way to reduce anxiety. Can you feel any difference?

User: A little. It helps to just focus on breathing for a moment.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Now, let’s talk about how you might apply this breathing technique before interacting with classmates. How do you feel about connecting it to your small goal?

User: That sounds like a plan. If I can manage my anxiety a bit, maybe it will help when I say hello.

Consultant: Absolutely, that's a positive link between managing anxiety and achieving your social goals. As you experiment with this, what kind of thoughts might you want to remind yourself of to stay motivated?

User: I guess I could tell myself that it’s okay to be myself, and not everyone will dislike me.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful affirmation! Reminding yourself that being yourself is enough can change how you approach interactions. How about we check in on your progress next time we meet?

User: Yes, that would be helpful. I want to see if I can actually use those steps.

Consultant: Perfect! Remember, it’s about taking small steps and being kind to yourself along the way. I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes. 

User: Thanks! I appreciate your help today. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: Hello! It’s great to see you again. How are you feeling today? I’d like to hear about any recent experiences that might be on your mind.

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite lost lately. At a recent class event, I couldn't interact with a girl I like, and it really made me doubt myself. I feel I don't deserve to connect with girls.

Consultant: I’m really sorry to hear that you’re feeling this way. It’s understandable to feel disappointed when things don’t go as we hope, especially in social situations. What kind of thoughts crossed your mind during that event?

User: I kept thinking that I must be embarrassing or that she wouldn’t like someone like me. It just made me feel really low and self-critical.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound overwhelming. It’s tough to feel that way about yourself. Let’s explore that a bit. When you think about not deserving to connect with her, how does that affect your emotions? 

User: It makes me feel even more anxious and insecure. I think I’m not interesting enough for her or anyone, to be honest.

Consultant: It seems like you’re really doubting your worth. This inner critic can be very harsh. Can you share a moment when you felt valued or interesting? 

User: Hmm… I once had a good conversation with my friends about our hobbies, and I felt like they enjoyed talking to me.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive experience! It’s a reminder that you do have qualities and interests that can connect you with others. Would you be willing to try to identify some of those qualities more regularly?

User: I guess I could try, but it feels difficult to believe those qualities matter when I'm feeling down.

Consultant: That’s completely valid. It can be hard to see the positives during tough times. What if we work on acknowledging those good moments more consciously? We could create a list of qualities you like about yourself.

User: That could help, actually. I have a hard time remembering them in the moment, though.

Consultant: Let's make a note of them together now. What are some qualities or talents you have that you enjoy or that others might appreciate about you?

User: I think I'm a good listener, and I can draw pretty well. I also try to be supportive of my friends.

Consultant: Those are wonderful qualities! Being a good listener and supportive friend are essential traits that build connections. How do you feel reflecting on these positive aspects of yourself?

User: I feel a little better, but I still wonder if girls really care about that stuff.

Consultant: It’s normal to question how people perceive us, but many enjoy authentic connections over superficial traits. Think about the qualities you admire in others. Wouldn’t you appreciate them in someone as well?

User: Yes, that's true. I often admire friends for being kind or genuine rather than just for looks.

Consultant: Exactly! And those qualities often create deeper connections. What if we role-play a scenario where you interact with a girl, using those appreciated qualities? 

User: That could be interesting! It might help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you’re at a gathering, and you spot someone you’d like to talk to. How would you initiate a conversation using your listening skills?

User: Maybe I could start by complimenting something they like, like a book or a piece of art nearby.

Consultant: That’s a solid way to start! Complimenting can open the door for conversation. After that, you can ask them about their interests. How do you feel about trying that out in a role-play?

User: I think it sounds good, but I'm still nervous about how they might react.

Consultant: It's natural to feel nervous; what we can do is practice lowering those feelings of anxiety. Imagine a successful interaction first. What would that feel like for you?

User: It would feel really nice, maybe even freeing in a sense.

Consultant: Let’s keep that feeling in mind. When we focus on the potential for positive interaction, it can shift our mindset. Are you ready to visualize this scenario together?

User: Yes, I can try that. It’s kind of empowering thinking that it could go well!

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember, it’s about connecting through understanding and authenticity. Focus on being yourself. If we go step-by-step, it won’t feel so overwhelming.

User: That makes sense. If I take it slow, maybe I can manage those feelings better.

Consultant: Absolutely! Slow it down and allow yourself to feel comfortable. If you encounter any setbacks, remember those positive qualities you have, as they will help you bounce back.

User: I appreciate this. It feels good talking about these things. I hope to build more confidence over time.

Consultant: I believe in your potential. Each step you take contributes to that confidence. As we wrap things up today, what’s one action you think you can commit to before our next session?

User: I want to reach out to a friend and share my thoughts about this. It might help to get their perspective.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic step! Sharing can alleviate some pressure and build support. I look forward to hearing about how it goes next time. Thank you for opening up today.

User: Thank you for listening and guiding me. I really feel a bit lighter now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a process, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. Take care until next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you came in today. I’d like to understand how you’re feeling right now. Can you tell me more about what's been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite anxious, especially after some classmates brought up my health issues from the past. It’s like I’m being reminded of it all over again, and I can’t help but doubt myself.

Consultant: It sounds really challenging to have those reminders come up, especially from your peers. Can you share a bit more about how those discussions affect your emotions and thoughts about yourself?

User: Yeah, every time it happens, I feel this wave of anxiety. I start to think that maybe I’m not as capable as I want to be, and I feel embarrassed about my health issues. It makes me want to avoid social situations.

Consultant: I completely understand how those feelings can be overwhelming. It’s natural to feel embarrassed and anxious in those situations. Let’s work together to explore what those thoughts are during those moments. What goes through your mind when you feel this anxiety?

User: I usually think things like, “What if they see me as weak?” or “I can't do anything right.” It's like I'm judging myself harshly.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really tough to deal with. You’re not alone in feeling this way, and it’s important we address those judgments. What kind of feelings do those thoughts trigger in you physically and emotionally?

User: I feel tightness in my chest, and I become really self-conscious. It's like I just want to disappear when that happens.

Consultant: That tightness must be quite uncomfortable to experience. It seems like your thoughts are closely tied to those physical sensations. Let’s challenge those thoughts a bit. Do you think there's a chance that you might be exaggerating how others see you or the situation?

User: I guess so. I mean, not everyone is as critical as I think they are. Sometimes, I just feel like I don't belong.

Consultant: It’s good that you can recognize that. If a friend were feeling this way, how might you encourage them to view the situation differently?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone has flaws and that they shouldn’t care what others think too much.

Consultant: That’s a kind perspective. Now, how could you apply that same advice to yourself? It could be a valuable technique to practice positive self-talk, just like you’d offer support to a friend.

User: I guess I could try telling myself it’s okay to have imperfections and that I can still be valuable to my peers.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s all about reframing your thoughts to cultivate a kinder self-image. Let’s think of some situations where you can practice this. Have you participated in any activities or groups recently?

User: Yes, I joined a sports team last month, but I felt nervous about being judged.

Consultant: That’s a great step forward! Just being part of a team is a wonderful opportunity to connect with others. How did you feel during your time with the team?

User: Actually, it was kind of fun! I forgot about my worries for a while and felt accepted.

Consultant: That’s excellent to hear! It seems like being involved with your team helped shift your focus. How might you continue to use those positive experiences to build your confidence moving forward?

User: Maybe I could set some small goals for myself in practice and try to focus on my progress instead of my worries.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic approach! Setting achievable goals can help you build on those positive experiences. What’s one small goal you could commit to in your next practice?

User: I think I’ll aim to engage in at least one conversation with a teammate and focus on enjoying the game without worrying about judgment.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! It’s all about taking those small steps to foster a positive mindset. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on how you can carry this confidence into your daily life. What do you think might help you maintain these positive thoughts moving forward?

User: I could keep reminding myself of the fun I had and the friendships I’m building. Plus, I can practice that positive self-talk daily.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflection and self-talk are powerful tools. As we conclude today’s session, remember that you’re not alone in this. You’re making progress, and I believe you can carry this confidence forward. If you ever feel overwhelmed, I encourage you to reach out again. 

User: Thank you so much. This has really helped me feel more positive about things.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to have been able to support you today. I look forward to hearing about your continued progress. Stay strong and take care!

Consultant: Hello there! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit different actually. Participating in the group project has really helped me feel more confident. I even enjoyed working as a team.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like the group project has had a positive impact on your confidence. Can you share more about what aspects of the teamwork you enjoyed the most?

User: I liked how we could all contribute ideas and support each other. It felt good to be part of something and not just alone.

Consultant: Being part of a supportive team can be very empowering. It’s great that you experienced this connection. What were some of the contributions you made to the group?

User: I suggested some ideas for our project and felt comfortable sharing them. Usually, I would hesitate, but this time I spoke up.

Consultant: That's impressive! Speaking up takes courage, and it’s a big step towards building your confidence in social situations. How did it feel for you to share your ideas openly?

User: It felt rewarding. I was a bit nervous at first, but once I started talking, it got easier. I didn’t feel judged at all.

Consultant: That is an important realization. It's not uncommon to feel nervous before speaking up, but it seems like you found a supportive atmosphere. Has this experience changed how you view your interactions with others in general?

User: Yes, I think so. I feel more open to engaging with others now. I used to worry about what everyone thought of me, but now I feel like I can just be myself.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift in your perception! Embracing your authentic self can lead to more meaningful connections. What strategies do you think could help you maintain this openness in future interactions?

User: I could try to remind myself that everyone has their insecurities, and it's okay to be myself. Maybe I could also set small goals to engage more in conversations.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent strategies! Setting small goals can help gradually build your confidence in social settings. What kind of goals do you think you’d like to set for yourself?

User: Maybe I could aim to strike up a conversation with someone new in class each week. That feels manageable.

Consultant: That’s a great goal! Engaging with new people can really enrich your social experiences. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel excited and a bit nervous, but I want to try. It sounds like a good way to stretch my comfort zone.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel a mix of excitement and nerves. Facing these feelings can lead to growth. What do you think might help you combat any anxiety about these conversations?

User: I think preparing a few topics to talk about in advance might help. I could also practice with friends before trying with someone new.

Consultant: Those are smart approaches! Practicing can boost your confidence. Additionally, if you encounter any setbacks, remember that it’s part of the learning process. How would you feel about handling setbacks?

User: I think I have to remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes. I shouldn't be too hard on myself.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! Being kind to yourself is essential for building resilience. Is there a specific situation in the future where you plan to try these new strategies?

User: There’s an upcoming study group, and I think I’ll use that opportunity to practice engaging with everyone.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! Connecting in a study group can be both productive and socially enriching. How will you prepare for this upcoming group?

User: I’ll think about interesting questions or topics to bring up and maybe encourage others to share their thoughts too.

Consultant: Encouraging others to share is a fantastic way to create a welcoming environment. It shows you care about their input as well. How does the thought of leading the conversation make you feel?

User: It feels a bit daunting, but also empowering. If I can help make everyone feel comfortable, it’d be worth it.

Consultant: Absolutely! Fostering comfort in group settings can enhance everyone’s experience. As you continue working on these skills, what do you hope to gain in terms of personal growth?

User: I want to feel more confident in social situations and not let my anxiety hold me back. I’d like to be someone others can rely on.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful aspiration! Building connections and being a reliable friend are valuable traits. As you pursue this, remember to celebrate your progress, no matter how small. What do you think will be your biggest challenge on this journey?

User: I guess overcoming my initial anxiety will be the toughest part. Sometimes, I still feel like I don’t fit in or worry about judgment.

Consultant: That’s a common feeling. The key is to acknowledge those thoughts without letting them control you. Would it help to remind yourself of the positive feedback you've received from others?

User: Yes, I think I’ll keep those positive moments in mind when I start to feel anxious.
