Consultant: Hello, Xiao Zhao! I'm glad you joined me today. Before we get started, I want to check in with you about how you've been feeling lately. 

User: Hi. I’ve been quite overwhelmed. The pressure from my studies is really getting to me, especially after failing two courses last semester. I feel like I've disappointed my family, and it's making me anxious all the time.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. Feeling overwhelmed and anxious, especially when there are high expectations from your family, can be very challenging. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts or feelings come up when you think about these academic pressures?

User: I keep thinking that if I don’t do well in my courses, I’ll let everyone down. It makes me feel like I’m not good enough, and then I can't focus on my studies. I end up feeling even more anxious and just want to give up.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially being the first in your family to go to university. That’s a lot of pressure. When those thoughts about not being good enough pop up, what emotions do you notice in your body or mind?

User: I feel really heavy in my chest and my mind races. Sometimes, I can’t even sleep because I’m so worried about how I’m performing. 

Consultant: It sounds like that anxiety is impacting both your physical well-being and your ability to rest. Let's try to identify some of the thoughts that are contributing to that racing mind. What specific thoughts go through your head when you're lying awake at night?

User: I usually think about all the things I haven’t done right. Like how I didn't study enough or how my family is counting on me. It's like a loop that just won't stop.

Consultant: That loop can be exhausting. When you think about those responsibilities and how your family is counting on you, is there a specific belief that comes up for you?

User: I feel like their hopes hinge on my success. If I fail, then I will be disappointing them big time, and I can’t let that happen.

Consultant: That's a powerful belief to hold onto. It's clear you care deeply about your family's hopes. But let’s explore this—if a friend were in your situation, what would you say to her about dealing with that kind of pressure?

User: I’d probably tell her that it's okay to fail sometimes and that she shouldn’t be so hard on herself. But I can’t help but think that I'm different.

Consultant: It's insightful of you to recognize that you would give a friend that kindness! What if we tried to apply that same understanding to yourself? What would change if you allowed yourself to have a more compassionate view of your experience?

User: I guess I would feel less burdened and maybe even more motivated to try again. It’s just hard to think that way when I feel so anxious.

Consultant: It makes sense that it would be challenging. Let’s discuss some coping strategies that could help you handle these feelings. Have you tried any activities or techniques that help reduce your anxiety in the past?

User: Not really. Sometimes I try to study hard to distract myself, but it doesn’t really help. I just feel more stressed.

Consultant: That’s a common approach, but it can sometimes add to the pressure. Instead, what if we brainstormed some activities that could help you relax and recharge? 

User: I’ve heard of meditation and breathing exercises, but I’ve never really tried them.

Consultant: Meditation and breathing exercises can be effective tools for managing anxiety. Would you be willing to set aside a few minutes each day to practice them? We could establish a small routine to help you get started.

User: That sounds doable. I’d like to try, but I’m not sure if it will really work for me.

Consultant: It’s completely okay to feel uncertain. How about we set a goal to try it for a week? We can meet again to see how it went and discuss any feelings or thoughts that came up.

User: That seems reasonable. I’ll try to do it for a week and see how I feel. 

Consultant: Excellent! Also, as you move forward, remember to be gentle with yourself. It's okay to have ups and downs. Let's focus on your progress in adjusting to university life. What are some small steps you feel you could take this week to create a better study routine?

User: I think maybe I could set specific times to study instead of trying to cram it all in last minute. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Setting specific study times may help create structure. How about we also explore your schedule? Is there a way to include breaks and relaxation time to make it more manageable?

User: Yes! I can schedule short breaks after studying to do some stretching or take a walk.

Consultant: That sounds great! Having those breaks is important for maintaining focus and reducing stress. After trying these strategies for a while, how will you know if they are helping you?

User: If I find myself feeling less anxious and possibly getting more done, I think that will be a good sign.

Consultant: Those are clear indicators! Tracking those feelings can be really helpful. Remember, it's a process, and small changes can lead to significant results over time. 

User: I appreciate that. It helps to think that it’s a process and not just something I have to fix all at once.

Consultant: Exactly! We’re working towards understanding and adapting at a pace that feels comfortable for you. I believe in your capability to manage this. As we wrap up today, what’s the most important takeaway for you from our session?

User: I think it’s that I can be compassionate to myself and try new strategies to handle my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic takeaway! Remember, you’re not alone in this. I’m here to support you, and we can continue to work on these strategies together. Would you feel okay to meet again next week to check in?

User: Yes, that sounds good. I’ll try my best and see how it goes.

Consultant: Great! I look forward to hearing about your experiences. Have a wonderful week, Xiao Zhao!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Zhao! I'm glad you could join me for this session. How are you feeling today, especially with the new semester starting?

User: Hi. I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed. The new courses seem much harder, and I’m worried I won’t keep up. After failing two exams last semester, I’m just anxious about everything.

Consultant: It sounds like the increased difficulty in your courses is really weighing on you, especially after the disappointment you felt last semester. Let's talk more about that. What specifically makes you feel anxious right now?

User: I think it’s just the pressure to meet expectations—my family really hopes I can succeed in university and help them out. It feels like a lot is riding on me, and sometimes I doubt whether I can do it.

Consultant: I can see that the expectations from your family add extra stress on top of the challenges you're facing. It's completely understandable to feel anxious in such a situation. How do you typically notice this anxiety manifesting in your daily life?

User: I find it hard to concentrate when I'm studying, and I often stay up late because I can’t seem to calm my mind. It just keeps racing with all the things I need to do.

Consultant: That sounds really exhausting. It seems like the anxiety is impacting your ability to study effectively and also affecting your sleep. Have you tried any strategies to help manage this anxiety when you’re studying or winding down for the night?

User: Not really. I just try to push through and tell myself I should do better, but it doesn’t seem to help.

Consultant: It’s common to feel that way, but pushing through can sometimes make anxiety worse. Have you heard of techniques like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation? They can help calm your mind and body.

User: I’ve heard of them, but I’ve never really tried anything like that. How do they work?

Consultant: Deep breathing involves taking slow, deep breaths to help signal your body to relax. Progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing and then slowly relaxing different muscle groups to relieve physical tension. Would you like to try a simple deep breathing exercise together now?

User: Sure, I’m open to trying it.

Consultant: Great! Let's take a moment. Close your eyes if that feels comfortable. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four… hold that breath for a count of four… now exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Let’s do this a few times together.

User: That felt a bit nice. I could feel some tension easing off.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! This can be a helpful tool to use when you start feeling overwhelmed or anxious—try incorporating it into your study breaks. How do you think that might help your concentration while studying?

User: I think if I take short breaks to breathe, it could help clear my mind, making it easier to focus. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking breaks to breathe can recharge your mind. Now, let’s shift our focus a bit. I’d like to talk about time management. How do you currently organize your study schedule?

User: Well, I try to follow my classes, but I often put off studying until the last minute. It doesn’t really work out well.

Consultant: Procrastination can often lead to more anxiety, especially when deadlines are approaching. We can create a more structured schedule together. What if we started by breaking your study goals into smaller, daily tasks? 

User: That sounds like it could help. I usually get overwhelmed just thinking about everything at once.

Consultant: Exactly! Breaking tasks down can make them feel more manageable. For example, if you have a big assignment, you could outline it over a few days. Would you like to try outlining your next steps right now?

User: Yes, I’d like that. What should I start with?

Consultant: Let's pick one subject you find most challenging. What would that be?

User: Probably chemistry. I really struggled with it last semester.

Consultant: Okay, for chemistry, let’s set a goal for this week. How about dedicating at least 30 minutes each day to review your notes or read some chapters? Does that sound feasible?

User: I think I can manage 30 minutes. That’s not too overwhelming.

Consultant: That’s perfect! Schedule those 30 minutes as you would a class, and stick to it as best as you can. Let’s check in about your progress next time. 

User: I will definitely try that. I like having a clear plan.

Consultant: Excellent! Remember, it’s about making steady progress. As you practice this, you’ll likely find it helps with your confidence too. How are you feeling about your plan for managing your studies?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Having a plan takes some of the pressure off.

Consultant: I’m really pleased to hear that! Also, I want to touch on another aspect. How do you feel about your social relationships here at university?

User: It’s hard for me to make friends. I feel shy and out of place in group settings, which makes me feel lonely.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It’s common to feel shy in new environments. Building social connections could really help alleviate that loneliness. What small steps do you think you could take to reach out to others?

User: Maybe joining a study group or attending some social events could help me meet people.

Consultant: Those are wonderful ideas! Starting with study groups can provide a natural way to connect over common interests. Would you be comfortable trying to join one this semester? 

User: Yes, I’d like to. It might be a good way to meet classmates too.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step forward! Remember, it's about taking small actions. How are you feeling about our session today?

User: I feel like I’ve learned some practical ways to handle my anxiety and study more effectively. It feels good to have a plan. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiao Zhao! It’s been nice to see your progress. In our next session, we can discuss how the study group goes and any new challenges you might encounter. You’ve got this!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I’m looking forward to our next conversation too.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and I’ll speak with you soon.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Zhao! I'm happy to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been struggling a bit with meeting new people at university. I really want to connect with my classmates, but I feel so anxious when I try to approach them. 

Consultant: I understand that feeling anxious about social interactions can be really challenging. You're hoping to create connections with your classmates to feel less lonely. Can you tell me more about a specific situation that felt particularly difficult recently?

User: Well, I tried to chat with a few classmates in the lab a couple of days ago, but I just ended up standing there feeling awkward. I thought I would ask them about our assignment, but I chickened out. 

Consultant: It sounds really tough to be in that situation, feeling like you wanted to reach out but then hesitating. What thoughts were going through your mind when you found yourself feeling awkward?

User: I kept thinking they wouldn't want to talk to me, and maybe they think I'm not interesting enough. Those thoughts just made it harder for me to say anything. 

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts were quite discouraging for you. Let's explore them together. How much evidence do you think supports the idea that they wouldn't want to talk to you? Could there be other explanations for their behavior?

User: I guess there isn't really much proof. They were just busy, and I might have misjudged their reactions. But I still felt very self-conscious. 

Consultant: That’s a significant insight, Xiao Zhao. Recognizing that their behavior might not be a personal rejection is a big step. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them to think?

User: I would probably tell them that they should just try to be themselves and take the chance to talk. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s a good reminder to treat yourself with the same kindness you would offer a friend. Let's try to frame your thoughts differently. Instead of worrying about being interesting, what if you focused on simply enjoying the moment of meeting new people?

User: That makes sense. If I think about enjoying the interaction, maybe I won’t focus so much on what they think of me. 

Consultant: That's a great shift in perspective. Now, what do you think could be a small step you can take to start practicing this new mindset in your next social interaction?

User: I could try to ask one of my classmates a simple question about the class, maybe about homework. It doesn’t need to be a big conversation.

Consultant: That sounds like a very manageable plan! Starting with a simple question can help ease you into the conversation. How do you feel about trying that?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also a bit excited. It’s not a huge step, so maybe I can do it.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous, but it’s wonderful that you’re feeling some excitement as well. After you take this step, how would you like to reflect on the experience? 

User: I think I would like to journal about it afterward, to see how I felt and what I learned from the interaction.

Consultant: Journaling is a wonderful way to process your experiences. We can discuss it in our next session. Now, let’s also think about a few positive affirmations you could tell yourself when feeling anxious before these interactions. What could be a comforting phrase for you? 

User: Maybe something like, “I am worthy of connection, and it’s okay to be myself.” 

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation! Repeating that to yourself can really help in moments of self-doubt. How do you feel about practicing this affirmation before your next interaction?

User: I think I can do that. It feels empowering to remind myself that I’m worthy of connections. 

Consultant: I’m so glad you feel empowered by it! As you embrace these interactions with this new perspective and affirmation, it can really help build your confidence. What’s one thing you would like to remember when you face challenges in social situations?

User: I want to remember that it takes time to build relationships and that it’s okay to feel a bit uncomfortable at first. 

Consultant: That’s a great realization, Xiao Zhao. Building connections can indeed take time. It’s important to be patient with yourself in this process. Let's plan to check in on your progress next time. 

User: Yes, I’m looking forward to it! Thank you for helping me work through my feelings today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. Remember to keep practicing those affirmations and your small social interactions. I'll see you next time!

User: See you next time! I'm feeling more optimistic now.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Zhao! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I'm feeling pretty good. I attended a group activity at school recently and enjoyed interacting with my classmates. It was a nice change for me.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear you had a positive experience interacting with others. What did you enjoy most about the group activity?

User: I think being able to talk and laugh with my classmates was really enjoyable. It made me feel a bit more connected, which I haven't felt for a while.

Consultant: It sounds like that connection is important to you. How do you feel this experience has impacted your confidence in social situations?

User: I feel a bit more confident, like maybe I can engage more with others. But I still worry about whether they will like me or want me around.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those worries, especially when you’re trying to build new connections. Are there specific thoughts that come up when you’re in those social situations?

User: Yes, sometimes I think, "What if I say something silly?" or "What if they don’t want to talk to me?" Those thoughts make me hesitate.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Xiao Zhao. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit. How often do you find these worries happening compared to when you feel more relaxed and connected with others?

User: I think it happens quite a lot, to be honest. When I feel relaxed, I can enjoy myself, but when I'm in my head, those worries take over.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight. It seems that your mindset influences how you experience social interactions. Have you noticed if there are specific situations where these worries are stronger?

User: Yes, usually when I meet new people or join a conversation with groups I don’t know well.

Consultant: That makes sense. Encountering new situations can trigger those worries. What would happen if you challenged those thoughts a little bit? For instance, when you think, "What if I say something silly?" how could we reframe that thought?

User: Maybe I could think, "It's okay to be imperfect, and others might appreciate my honesty." 

Consultant: That’s an excellent way to reframe it! Embracing imperfection can really help in feeling more relaxed. Can you think of a time when being yourself was well-received by others?

User: There was a moment during the group activity when I made a joke, and everyone laughed. It felt nice.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful moment! It shows that when you allow yourself to be authentic, it can lead to positive experiences. How can you carry that feeling into future social interactions?

User: I think I can remind myself of that moment and tell myself that it’s okay to joke around and be more relaxed.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy. Remembering those positive experiences can really reinforce your confidence. In addition to this, what new interests or activities would you like to explore that could also help you engage with others more?

User: I’ve been thinking about joining a club or doing more group activities. I recently found out that there’s a painting club at school.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Joining a club can provide a structured way to meet people with similar interests. How do you feel about taking that step to join the painting club?

User: I feel a little nervous but also excited. It sounds like a nice opportunity to connect with others.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel both nervous and excited. Maybe you could think of it as a chance to express yourself creatively while meeting new friends. What’s one small step you can take to get started?

User: I could attend the first meeting and see how it goes. Just observe before jumping in.

Consultant: That sounds like a wise approach. Attending the meeting allows you to gauge the environment without pressure. What do you think you might take away from that experience?

User: I hope to feel more comfortable and see if I enjoy the club atmosphere.

Consultant: That’s a great expectation to have. What about the thoughts from earlier—how will you remind yourself to focus on enjoying the experience rather than worrying?

User: I could set a reminder on my phone that says, “Focus on fun, not perfection,” to help me remember.

Consultant: That sounds like an effective reminder! Keeping your focus on enjoyment rather than perfection can help reduce anxiety. As we wrap up, how do you feel about the progress you've made today?

User: I feel optimistic! It's nice to think that I can take small steps toward meeting new people and trying new things.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Remember, every small step counts. What would you say is the biggest takeaway from today's session?

User: I think it's the importance of reframing my thoughts and focusing on my experiences rather than worries. 

Consultant: Exactly! Keep practicing that. I'm really proud of the progress you've made. Looking ahead, how can you maintain this momentum and support your new social connections?

User: I’ll keep engaging in activities and practicing positive thoughts. I feel more determined now.

Consultant: That's a great mindset to adopt! You've built a solid foundation, and I believe you have the skills to continue developing those social connections. Remember, if you need any support, I'm here for you. Congratulations on your progress today!

User: Thank you! I feel lighter and more hopeful!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Zhao! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been doing okay. I feel better about the new friends I've made in the club, and my confidence has improved a little. But I still worry about how to keep those relationships strong.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear that your confidence has improved and you’re finding joy in your new friendships! Let’s dive into that. What specific aspects of maintaining those relationships feel challenging for you?

User: I guess I worry that I might not be able to connect with them as well or that they might lose interest in me. I really want these friendships to last.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those worries when we form new connections. Building lasting friendships often requires consistent effort and communication. What have you noticed about your interactions with these friends so far?

User: I’ve been trying to reach out more often and join their activities, but sometimes I feel nervous about initiating conversations or suggesting things to do together.

Consultant: It's great that you're making an effort to engage! Nervousness is a common experience when stepping into new social situations. What if we explored some ways to ease that nervousness? Would that be helpful for you?

User: Yes, I think that would help. I just don't want to come off as awkward or overbearing.

Consultant: Totally understandable! Let’s consider some strategies together. One approach could be to start with small questions or light topics that show your interest in their lives. Would you feel comfortable trying that?

User: I would, but I often second-guess if my questions are too boring or if they even want to talk to me.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to have those doubts. Often, people appreciate someone who genuinely wants to know more about them. You might find that your friends enjoy sharing about themselves! Can you recall a time when you felt a good connection with them during a conversation?

User: Yes, there was a time when we were discussing our favorite movies, and I felt engaged! They seemed really interested in what I had to say.

Consultant: That sounds like a great moment! You can build on that experience. Have you thought about preparing a few topics or questions in advance that you can use when you’re feeling uncertain?

User: That could be a good idea. Maybe I should write down some questions I find interesting.

Consultant: Exactly! Having a few go-to topics can help ease your nerves and make it easier to initiate conversations. What types of things would you be interested in asking them about?

User: I think I could ask about their hobbies or music preferences. Those topics seem fun to discuss.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent choices! How do you think turning these ideas into action would change the way you feel about your friendships?

User: I think I’d feel more confident and relaxed knowing I have something to talk about and that I can really engage with them.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization, Xiao Zhao! Being proactive about planning conversations can definitely boost your confidence. Moving forward, what steps do you think you could take to implement this idea in your next interaction with them?

User: I can start by choosing one or two questions to ask in our next club meeting. Maybe I’ll share something about myself too!

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Sharing about yourself can encourage them to open up as well. As we wrap up today's session, how are you feeling about these strategies we’ve discussed?

User: I feel more hopeful and excited. It seems manageable now, which is a relief!

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’ve made great progress in acknowledging your feelings and taking steps toward maintaining these friendships. Remember, it’s all about the little moments and consistency. I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’m looking forward to sharing my experiences.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Zhao! Best of luck with your interactions, and I'll see you next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Zhao! I'm really happy to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hello! I feel quite good actually. I've been able to complete significant tasks this semester, and I even improved my academic performance. It makes me feel a bit more hopeful about the future.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It sounds like you've made some meaningful progress. Let’s take a moment to reflect on that growth. What specific achievements are you most proud of recently?

User: I think I'm most proud of passing my biology class after struggling last semester. It felt really good to see my hard work pay off.

Consultant: That’s a huge accomplishment, and it’s clear that your efforts are starting to show results! How has this success impacted your feelings about yourself and your studies?

User: I feel more confident now. I used to doubt myself a lot, but now I believe I can handle my studies better. It’s like a weight lifted off my shoulders.

Consultant: It’s great to see you building confidence! Let’s build on that. Considering your accomplishments, what new goals or aspirations do you have for your personal development moving forward?

User: I want to maintain this good momentum. I think I need to set clearer goals for my studies and also become more involved socially. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Let’s break it down a bit. What academic goals would you like to set? 

User: I’d like to aim for at least a B in all my classes next semester. I think it's realistic if I keep up with my studies.

Consultant: Setting a goal of achieving at least a B is certainly realistic and measurable. What strategies do you think could help you reach this goal?

User: I could create a study schedule and stick to it. I also think forming study groups could help me understand the material better.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! A study schedule will provide structure, and study groups can enhance your learning through collaboration. How do you feel about making social connections as part of your goals?

User: I’m a bit nervous about that. I’m generally shy, but I recognize that it’s important for my overall experience. 

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel shy when it comes to socializing. Remember, building new relationships takes time and effort. Would you be willing to start with small steps, like talking to one person in your class? 

User: That sounds manageable. I could try to chat with someone after class to begin with.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Starting small can help ease anxiety. What other social goals do you have in mind?

User: I think I would like to join a student organization or club related to my field. It could help me meet new people with similar interests.

Consultant: Joining a club is a wonderful idea! It not only allows you to meet new friends but also helps you expand your knowledge in your field. Do you have any clubs in mind that you might want to join?

User: Yes, I’ve seen some advertisements for a biology club. I might be interested in joining that.

Consultant: The biology club sounds like a perfect fit for you! Engaging in activities you enjoy can significantly enhance your university experience. How do you plan to approach joining the club?

User: I think I’ll attend their first meeting and see how it goes. If it feels right, I can join.

Consultant: That’s a sensible way to approach it. Just remember, it’s okay to feel a little nervous; many others will likely feel the same. We can also prepare some questions or icebreakers for you to use if you’d like.

User: I’d appreciate that. Just having a few lines ready could help ease my anxiety.

Consultant: Absolutely, let’s brainstorm together. For instance, you might ask others what projects they're working on or share your interests in biology. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! It makes me feel a little more prepared already.

Consultant: Fantastic! Preparation can really boost your confidence. As we wrap up today’s session, how are you feeling about the goals we discussed?

User: I feel really positive! Having a plan and knowing my next steps makes me excited.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’ve made significant progress, and setting these new goals will help you continue to grow. Remember, it’s all about taking it one step at a time. 

User: Thank you! I feel more equipped to handle everything now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! You’ve done a great job today. As we conclude, remember that you have the tools to manage your growth. I’m here if you need further support. 

User: I appreciate that. I’ll definitely reach out if I need help.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Good luck with your goals, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!

User: Thank you! See you next time!
