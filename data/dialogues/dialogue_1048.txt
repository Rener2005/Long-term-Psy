Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling extremely anxious. The pressure from imminent exams is overwhelming, and being away from school hasn't helped. I thought a break would give me relief, but the anxiety is still there, especially with those terrifying thoughts creeping in.

Consultant: I can see how difficult this must be for you, being stuck between trying to rest and still feeling overwhelmed by anxiety. Let's delve into those feelings a bit more. What specific thoughts or situations trigger your anxiety the most right now?

User: Mainly, it’s the fear of failing my exams and the thought that I might not be able to handle it. The thought that I'm failing my education is really frightening. It spirals into thoughts that lead me to question my worth and even those scary suicidal thoughts.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of weighty thoughts that are intensifying your anxiety. I want to validate those feelings; they are severe and can feel isolating. Can you recall what thoughts exactly go through your mind when you start feeling this way?

User: I often think about how disappointing it would be to my family if I fail, and then I question whether I’d ever recover from not succeeding. It leads to memories of times I wasn't happy, like when I was trying medication for my anxiety, and the side effects scared me. I just can't shake the fear.

Consultant: Acknowledging those fears is an important step. Let’s explore those thoughts. When you think about disappointing your family, how does that actually make you feel in the moment? What emotions arise from that thought?

User: I feel a heavy, sinking feeling in my stomach and tightness in my chest. It’s like there’s this overwhelming weight on me. It can sometimes get so heavy that I feel like I can't breathe.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are very physically impactful for you, creating a visceral response. Let’s challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that failing would lead to such drastic consequences? Are there any counterarguments to those thoughts?

User: I mean, I’ve gotten through tough situations before, and my family has always said that learning is a process. They would want me to try my best, even if it doesn't lead to immediate success. But still, my mind just seems to default to failure.

Consultant: It's helpful to recognize that despite those fears, you have evidence of your resilience and supportive family as well. So, what could a more balanced thought look like when you find yourself spiraling into those fears of failure? 

User: Maybe something like, "I can give it my best shot, and that’s enough.” It feels impossible to tell myself that though, especially when my anxiety surges.

Consultant: That’s a great reframe! “Giving it your best shot” is a more compassionate perspective. Let's also think about how to ease that anxiety surge. Have you tried any techniques to help ground yourself when those feelings start escalating?

User: I’ve tried deep breathing, but sometimes I forget about it in the moment. I guess I'm worried it won’t work for me anyway.

Consultant: It's natural to feel skeptical about techniques when you're feeling anxious. How about we create a little reminder system or a simple checklist that you can keep by your study space? Something to prompt you to use those techniques when you feel the anxiety rising. 

User: That could be helpful! Maybe if I put it in front of my desk, I'd remember to use it. I could also write down those positive thoughts to remind myself of them when I get anxious.

Consultant: Absolutely! Having visual reminders can encourage you to pause and take a breather. Let’s draft a couple of positive affirmations together. How about we start with the one about giving your best? 

User: Sure, I could say something like, "I’m trying my best, and that’s enough." It might help keep me focused.

Consultant: That’s a great affirmation! It’s simple yet powerful. As you think about returning to school, what other resources or support systems do you feel you might need to help with your anxiety?

User: I think talking to someone, maybe a classmate or a counselor at school, would help. I’ve been avoiding people because I feel ashamed of my situation, but connecting might make me feel less alone.

Consultant: Reaching out for support is a strong and positive choice. It’s understandable to feel ashamed, but remember that many people face similar challenges. How would you feel about setting a goal to reach out to someone before returning to school?

User: I think that would be good. Maybe I could message a friend tomorrow and just see how they’re doing. That doesn't sound too intimidating.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect first step! Small connections can be really impactful. As we wrap up today, let’s recap what we've discussed. What do you think will stick with you from today’s session?

User: I liked the idea of positive affirmations and having reminders nearby. It makes me feel like I can take control back in some way. Plus, reaching out to friends feels a bit less overwhelming now. 

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Li! Recognizing what you can control is a huge step forward. As you look towards returning to school, remember that it’s okay to feel mixed emotions. If those overwhelming feelings come back, you now have strategies to help manage them.

User: Thank you, that really helps. I’ll try my best to integrate these strategies. 

Consultant: You're welcome! I'm proud of the progress you're making, and I look forward to seeing you next time. Take care, Li.

User: You too. Talk soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li. I'm glad you're back for our session. I've been thinking about our last conversation. How have you been feeling about returning to school?

User: Hi. Honestly, I'm feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety. I really want to go back and study, but the thought of facing my coursework and dealing with my anxiety again is really overwhelming.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of conflicting emotions right now. On one hand, there's a desire to return to your studies, but on the other, there's a fear of anxiety and the thoughts that come with it. Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you about returning to school?

User: I worry that once I go back, I won't be able to handle the pressure. I fear that my anxiety will take over like it did before, and I might even have thoughts of self-harm again. It scares me to think I could go back to that dark place.

Consultant: Your fear of falling back into that dark place is completely understandable, especially given what you've been through. It's important to acknowledge those feelings. Can we explore what those thoughts look like for you? What comes to mind when you think about facing your coursework?

User: I just think I won't be able to keep up with my classmates, and that I’ll fail. Sometimes, I think everyone will be better than me, and that makes the anxiety worse. 

Consultant: It sounds like there are some strong negative beliefs about your abilities and how you'll compare to others. Would you say that some of these thoughts might be a bit extreme? For instance, is it possible that you're underestimating your strengths or focusing too much on the potential outcomes?

User: Yeah, I guess I do tend to think the worst of the situation. It’s like my mind jumps to the worst-case scenario right away, no matter how small. I don't know how to shake those thoughts off.

Consultant: That’s a common challenge, and acknowledging it is a great first step. What if we tried to challenge those thoughts? For example, if a friend were feeling the same way you do now, what advice would you give them regarding their worries and fears about returning to school?

User: I suppose I would tell them to remember their past successes and that they’ve handled tough situations before. I would encourage them to take it one step at a time, rather than thinking about everything at once.

Consultant: That’s great insight! Remembering past successes can be a powerful strategy. What if we applied that same approach to your situation? Can you list some past achievements or moments where you managed to overcome challenges, even small ones? 

User: Well, I did manage to finish my assignments before I paused my studies, and I used to do well in my exams when I was focused. 

Consultant: Those are significant accomplishments, Li! It shows that you have the capacity to succeed even amidst challenges. Now, let’s think about how you can apply that mindset when you return to school. What steps could you take to create a supportive environment for yourself?

User: Maybe I could set smaller goals for each day to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Like, just focusing on one subject at a time instead of all of them at once.

Consultant: That sounds like a very effective strategy! Breaking tasks into smaller, manageable parts can help reduce anxiety. Additionally, how about incorporating some relaxation techniques when you feel overwhelmed during your studies? 

User: Yeah, I’ve heard about deep breathing and mindfulness, but I haven’t really tried them yet. 

Consultant: That’s perfectly okay! We can explore those techniques together. Mindfulness can help keep you grounded in the present moment, reducing the intensity of those anxious thoughts. Would you be willing to commit to trying out such techniques before we meet again?

User: Yes, I think I can try to incorporate them. Deep breathing sounds especially helpful.

Consultant: Wonderful! It’s all about finding what works for you and creating a routine that makes you feel more comfortable. Just remember to be patient with yourself as you adjust. What else do you think might help you as you prepare to return to school?

User: I think it would help to talk with my friends about how I’m feeling. Maybe they could support me and understand what I’m going through.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your feelings with friends can provide valuable support and help you feel less isolated in your experiences. It’s good to have that connection with others. As we wrap up for today, let's reflect on your progress. What are some strategies you feel confident in using as you prepare for your return to school?

User: I feel more confident about setting smaller goals, using deep breathing techniques, and talking to my friends. It feels a bit less daunting now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Li! Remember, it’s all about taking one step at a time. Keep these strategies in mind as you move forward. You’ve already shown great resilience in facing your challenges. If you encounter any difficulties, don't hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! That really helps to know I have a plan and support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made today. Just remember to keep reminding yourself of your strengths. Looking forward to our next session, and take care in the meantime.

Consultant: Hello Li! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! Well, to be honest, I've been feeling quite disappointed. I tried going back to classes, but I couldn't focus at all. It just made me doubt my ability to adapt again.

Consultant: It sounds tough. You're feeling disappointed because you expected to return to school and feel more in control, but it didn’t go as planned. Can you tell me more about what was going through your mind during the class?

User: I kept worrying about my performance, and all I could think about was how everyone else seemed fine. It felt overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, feeling overwhelmed while comparing yourself to others. What specific thoughts were you having that contributed to that feeling of being overwhelmed?

User: I thought things like, “I’m going to fail,” or “What’s wrong with me that I can’t keep up?” It made me feel even worse.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very negative and unhelpful. It seems like they contributed to your anxiety. Can we explore how those thoughts affect your feelings? How does thinking, "I’m going to fail," impact your emotions?

User: It makes me feel anxious and helpless. I dread going back to class again because I fear I’ll fail.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. But let's think critically about those thoughts. How much evidence do you have that supports the idea you will fail?

User: I guess there isn't solid evidence. It’s more about my fear. I just can't shake that feeling.

Consultant: It’s quite common to feel fear without much evidence. If a friend was in your position, what would you say to them? How would you encourage them to view the situation differently?

User: I would probably tell them it’s okay to struggle and that they should take it step by step. Maybe I should do that too.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! Taking it step by step can be very helpful. How about we create some small, achievable goals for you as you return to your studies?

User: That sounds like a good idea. I’d like to try.

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s brainstorm some small goals that you can focus on in your studies. What’s one small thing you could do this week to help yourself feel more comfortable returning to class?

User: Maybe I could commit to attending just one class and preparing for it a little each day leading up to it.

Consultant: That sounds like a very manageable goal! Preparing each day can build your confidence and reduce anxiety. How would you feel about setting a specific plan for that?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful about it now. Setting a plan makes it feel less daunting.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let’s outline your plan. What day will you attend that class, and what specific preparation can you do each day leading up to it?

User: I’ll attend the class next Monday. I can review my notes each day for at least 30 minutes.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Each day you review your notes will not only prepare you but also boost your confidence. How will you keep track of your progress this week?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal to note how I feel about my preparation and any thoughts that come up.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Journaling can help you process your thoughts and celebrate small victories. Would it be helpful to include positive affirmations in your journal as well?

User: Yeah, I think positive affirmations could really help combat those negative thoughts.

Consultant: Absolutely! By reinforcing positive messages about your abilities, you can challenge those negative thoughts. What’s a positive affirmation you could use this week?

User: I might say, “I am capable of adapting and learning at my own pace.”

Consultant: That's a powerful affirmation! Repeating that to yourself can help shift your mindset. How do you feel about using that affirmation along with your study plan?

User: I feel more confident, actually. It’s nice to have something positive to focus on.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear, Li! As we move forward, let’s make sure to celebrate your successes, no matter how small. How do you think you’d feel if you successfully attended your class and did your preparation?

User: I think I would feel proud of myself, and that might help reduce my anxiety in future classes.

Consultant: Exactly! Creating a sense of achievement can lessen anxiety. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we've discussed and the goals you've set. What stands out to you as the most important takeaway from our session?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is that I can take things one step at a time, and I have the tools to help me cope with my anxiety.

Consultant: That's a wonderful realization! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Do you feel ready to implement your plan this week?

User: Yes, I really do! Thank you for your support. I feel much more motivated to face my challenges now.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Li! You've made significant progress today. Remember, I'm here to support you, so don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Best of luck with your plan, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!

User: Thank you! I’m excited to share my experiences in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially after participating in that club activity?

User: Hi! I actually feel pretty excited about the club activity. It was nice to interact with my classmates, and I didn't feel as anxious as I usually do. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like that experience has had a positive impact on your emotions. What do you think contributed to you feeling less anxious during the interaction?

User: I think I was just so focused on having fun and engaging with others that I didn't dwell on my worries. It felt refreshing to be part of a group again.

Consultant: It sounds like immersing yourself in the moment really helped. That's an important realization! How do you want to build on this experience moving forward?

User: I'd like to participate in more social events and continue to feel this way. Hopefully, it will help reduce my anxiety about social situations.

Consultant: That's a great goal. As you plan to engage in more social activities, what are some thoughts or feelings that come to mind when you think about them?

User: Honestly, I worry that I might not be able to keep up with conversations or that I might say something awkward.

Consultant: I understand this feeling of apprehension. It's common to have these worries, but let's examine them closely. What evidence do you have that these thoughts might not be entirely accurate?

User: I guess I haven't been awkward in the last activity, and people seemed to enjoy our conversation. But I still have this nagging fear it could happen.

Consultant: It's excellent that you can recognize the evidence of your success! What if we tried to challenge that fear a bit? How would you advise a friend if they were feeling the same way about joining conversations?

User: I'd probably tell them to focus on listening and to relax. I guess I should remind myself of that too.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on listening can often ease the pressure of feeling like you need to perform. How does that thought make you feel about your next social event?

User: It makes me feel a little better! I think if I approach it with an open mindset, I might have a good experience again.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset to have! It might help to set small goals for yourself during these events, like initiating one conversation or asking a question. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds doable! I will definitely try to start a conversation with someone. 

Consultant: Great! Let's also think about strategies for when you start feeling anxious. What are some things you can remind yourself of in those moments?

User: Maybe that it’s okay to be nervous and that most people feel the same way at times. 

Consultant: Yes! That’s an important reminder. Perhaps you can also think of the successful interaction you had last time. How can we further prepare you for any anxiety that might arise?

User: I could practice some small talk topics in advance, just to feel a bit more prepared.

Consultant: Excellent approach! Practicing a few topics can help build your confidence. Is there anything specific you’d like to discuss or prepare for, particularly related to those social situations?

User: I guess I should think of topics that interest both me and others. Maybe I can ask about hobbies or classes.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Starting a conversation with shared interests can encourage engagement. How do you feel about using this strategy in your next social interaction?

User: I feel excited! It seems easier when I have a plan. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about enjoying the experience, not just the outcome. As we wrap up, how do you feel about the progress you've made since our last sessions?

User: I feel much more hopeful! Engaging in social activities has helped, and I'm looking forward to improving even more.

Consultant: It’s fantastic to hear that you’re feeling more hopeful. Keep practicing those skills, and remember that it’s okay to feel anxious from time to time. You’re doing great! If challenges arise, we can address them together in our future sessions.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I'll definitely keep working on it.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li! I'm proud of your progress and your willingness to face challenges. I look forward to hearing how your next social experience goes. Take care!

User: Thank you! I will. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm really glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling quite good, actually. My recent exam results were better than I expected, which has motivated me to keep studying. I feel a sense of hope about my academic performance. 

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear that you're feeling more motivated and hopeful about your studies. Can you tell me more about how you’re maintaining this positive momentum?

User: Sure! I’ve been sticking to my study schedule and completing assignments on time. I feel like I’m getting the hang of things, although I still worry sometimes.

Consultant: It's understandable to have some worries, especially with the pressure of studying. What specific worries have been on your mind lately?

User: I worry about whether I can keep up this performance and if the anxiety will come back. Even though I'm doing better, I still feel that creeping fear sometimes.

Consultant: It's very normal to have those fears, even with improvements. Could we explore what triggers this creeping anxiety for you? What do you think might happen if the anxiety returns?

User: I think if it comes back, I might start struggling with my studies again. I don't want to go back to where I was before. 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It sounds like you’ve made significant progress and you want to protect that achievement. What strategies have you used to handle your anxiety so far?

User: I’ve mostly tried to distract myself when I start feeling anxious and focus on my studies. I also talk to some friends to help me relax.

Consultant: Those are great strategies—you’re using distraction and support from friends. Have you noticed any specific moments when these strategies have worked particularly well for you?

User: Yes, when I talk to my friends, it really helps. Once we start discussing light-hearted topics, I forget about my worries for a while.

Consultant: It's great to hear that talking with friends brings you relief. It’s important to have those support systems. How about your study habits? Have you noticed any particular techniques that help you feel more focused and less anxious while studying?

User: I’ve started breaking my study sessions into shorter intervals, which makes it more manageable. I feel less overwhelmed that way.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Shorter intervals can help create a sense of accomplishment and reduce anxiety. Have you been able to reflect on your progress in studying like this?

User: Yes, I’ve been trying to keep a journal where I write down what I accomplish each day. It’s nice to see my improvement.

Consultant: Keeping a journal is a wonderful idea! It not only helps in tracking your progress but also allows you to celebrate your achievements. What do you think you’ll do next in terms of setting your study goals?

User: I want to aim for higher grades in my next exams. Maybe I can incorporate some new subjects into my study plan to keep things interesting.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! Setting your sights on new subjects can not only challenge you but keep your studies engaging. How do you plan to incorporate that into your current routine?

User: I’m thinking of dedicating some time each week to explore these subjects and seeing how I manage them alongside my existing workload.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a solid plan! Experimenting with new subjects while maintaining your current workload can offer a refreshing change. How do you feel about balancing these new activities with your existing studies?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I also see the potential for growth. I just need to remind myself to take one step at a time.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset! Taking it step by step will allow you to manage any feelings of overwhelm as they come up. How can you remind yourself of this approach when you start feeling anxious again?

User: I think I can write a note to myself with reminders about my progress and how to handle stress. That might help keep me grounded.

Consultant: Writing a note sounds like a very effective strategy! It will serve as a tangible reminder of your strength and the progress you’ve made. What other self-care activities can you include to further support your emotional well-being?

User: I’d like to start doing some light exercise and maybe practice mindfulness or meditation to help clear my mind.

Consultant: Incorporating exercise and mindfulness into your routine can be hugely beneficial for managing anxiety. Is there a specific type of exercise you enjoy or think would be enjoyable for you?

User: I like going for walks. It gets me moving and clears my head.

Consultant: Walking is a fantastic way to combine physical activity with mental relaxation. If you could set a goal for how often you’d like to walk each week, what would that look like?

User: I’d love to aim for at least three times a week. That feels achievable while allowing me to balance my studies.

Consultant: That sounds very attainable and a good balance for you. Consistency is key, and three times a week is a great start! If we reflect on our discussion today, what do you see as your main takeaways or action items moving forward?

User: I think I need to focus on maintaining my journaling, setting specific goals for my studies, and integrating self-care practices like walking and mindfulness into my routine.

Consultant: Those are excellent takeaways! I believe these strategies will help you sustain your progress and manage your anxiety more effectively. As we wrap up our session, how do you feel about the direction you’re headed?

User: I feel optimistic and empowered to tackle my studies and manage my anxiety. I believe I'm capable of achieving my goals.

Consultant: That's a wonderful feeling to have! You should be proud of the progress you've made. Remember, you have the tools you need to continue moving forward. If you ever feel the need for support again, just know that I'm here for you. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your guidance a lot. I feel ready to take on these new challenges!

Consultant: It’s my pleasure, Li! I’m excited to see how you continue to grow and achieve your goals. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! Welcome back to our session today. I’m glad to see you. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I've been doing quite well actually. I’ve been managing my anxiety better and even started getting back into my studies. It feels good to have a routine again.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It sounds like you’ve made significant progress in managing your anxiety and establishing a routine. Can you share more about what strategies you’ve been using to handle your emotions and studies?

User: Sure! I’ve been practicing mindfulness and trying to set small, achievable goals for my study sessions. Breaking things down into manageable tasks really helps me stay focused.

Consultant: Mindfulness and setting small goals can be very effective strategies. How do you feel when you accomplish these smaller tasks? 

User: I feel a sense of achievement, which boosts my confidence. It reassures me that I can handle my workload without becoming overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Celebrating those small achievements is important for building confidence. Have you noticed any particular situations or triggers that still cause you anxiety?

User: Well, sometimes I still feel anxious before social events or group study sessions. I worry about how I’ll perform or if I’ll be able to contribute.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel anxious in social situations, especially when there’s pressure to perform. Can you recall any specific thoughts that come to mind in those moments that might contribute to that anxiety?

User: Yes, I often think things like, “What if I can’t keep up with the conversation?” or “What if they think I’m not knowledgeable?” 

Consultant: Those thoughts can certainly create pressure and anxiety. Let’s explore those beliefs a bit. Are there any instances where you felt positively received during group activities?

User: Actually, there have been times when my input was appreciated and I even had fun. But I seem to forget those moments when I’m feeling anxious.

Consultant: That’s a common experience—focusing on negative outcomes rather than positive ones. What evidence do you have that supports those anxious thoughts? 

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence. It’s more about my fear of judgment and not wanting to look foolish.

Consultant: Fear of judgment can be very powerful, but it’s important to recognize that it often isn’t grounded in reality. If a friend were in a similar position, how do you think they would talk to themselves?

User: They’d probably remind themselves that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay to not know everything.

Consultant: Exactly! What if you applied that same understanding to yourself? How might that change your experience at these events?

User: I suppose if I reminded myself that it’s okay to not have all the answers, I’d probably feel less anxious and more open to engaging.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy way to approach it. We can also develop a plan for how you can actively practice this mindset in your next social situation. What do you think about that?

User: That would be helpful. I’d like to try reframing my thoughts while facing those situations.

Consultant: Great! Let's outline some specific thoughts you can replace the anxious ones with. How about, "I am prepared to contribute, and it’s okay to ask questions if I'm unsure"?

User: I like that! It feels more reassuring to think that way.

Consultant: Perfect! As you start to apply this strategy, remember to celebrate your successes, no matter how small. How do you feel about setting up a follow-up plan to evaluate how this goes in your next few social situations?

User: I think that would be useful. It would help keep me accountable and focused.

Consultant: Excellent! We can check in on your experiences and refine your strategies as needed. Additionally, it might also help to establish a support system. Who can you reach out to in moments of doubt?

User: My friends have been supportive. I think I can talk to them when I’m feeling anxious.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Having supportive people around you can make a big difference. As we approach the end of our session, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed and prepare for the next steps.

User: Sure! We covered my anxiety during social situations, worked on reframing my thoughts, and discussed involving my friends for support. 

Consultant: That’s right! And it sounds like you have a solid plan moving forward. Remember, every little step counts. You’ve already achieved so much. How do you feel about all the progress you’ve made?

User: I feel optimistic and proud of the steps I’ve taken. It’s reassuring to see I can manage my anxiety better now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! You’ve built a strong foundation for yourself, and I believe you can continue to grow. If you ever need additional support, remember I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your guidance and support.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Li! It's been a pleasure working with you. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Goodbye for now! 

User: Goodbye!
