Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyi! I'm really glad to see you today. How are you feeling right now? 

User: Hi. I don't know… I feel really lonely at school. I try to talk to my teachers and classmates, but it just doesn’t go well. 

Consultant: That sounds tough, Xiaoyi. Feeling lonely, especially when you're trying to make connections, can be really challenging. Can you tell me a bit more about those experiences? 

User: Well, I just feel like nobody understands me. I sometimes get angry when I try to fit in, but it only makes things worse. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel frustrated when you're having trouble connecting with others. Anger can be a response to that feeling of isolation. Do you notice any specific thoughts that come to mind when you feel this way? 

User: I often think, “Why am I even trying? No one wants to be friends with me.” 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite heavy and discouraging. It sounds like you might be judging your efforts pretty harshly. How does that make you feel when you think that way? 

User: It makes me feel even more alone and sad. Sometimes I just want to give up trying. 

Consultant: I can see how those feelings can be overwhelming, Xiaoyi. It's tough when you feel like giving up. Let's explore those thoughts together. What if someone else was in your position? What would you tell them? 

User: I guess I would say that it’s okay to keep trying and that it takes time to make friends. 

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective. If a friend were to tell you those thoughts of feeling unwanted, how would you help them view the situation differently? 

User: Maybe I’d tell them to focus on small interactions, like smiling at someone or saying hi instead of stressing over making friends right away. 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Focusing on small steps can help ease the pressure. Let’s talk about how you could apply that to your situation at school. What do you think would be a small step you could take next time? 

User: Maybe I can try to say hi to a classmate tomorrow. 

Consultant: Yes! That’s a wonderful plan and a positive step forward. How do you feel about trying that? 

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also a little hopeful. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous when trying something new, but it’s also great that you're feeling hopeful. Let’s think of ways to manage that nervousness. What could you do if you start to feel anxious before saying hi? 

User: I could take a deep breath and remind myself that it's just a simple hello. 

Consultant: That's an excellent strategy! Deep breathing can help ground you. Additionally, reminding yourself that it’s just a small step is very calming. How do you feel when you think about using those strategies? 

User: It makes me feel a little more confident about it. 

Consultant: Fantastic! Building confidence takes time and effort, and you’re already showing a willingness to try. Let’s shift a moment to talk about your feelings at home. How are things going with your parents? 

User: I feel like they don’t get how I’m feeling either. My dad is always busy and my mom just wants me to study more. 

Consultant: It seems like you’re feeling unsupported at home, which can be really frustrating. Communication with parents is really important, especially when you’re feeling this way. Have you had a chance to share your feelings with them? 

User: Not really. I don’t think they’d understand. 

Consultant: I understand that concern. It can feel daunting to express yourself. Would you like to discuss ways to communicate your feelings to them so they might understand better? 

User: That could help… I just don’t know how to start. 

Consultant: Starting is often the hardest part. Perhaps you could write down how you feel and give it to them. It would give you a chance to express your feelings without feeling overwhelmed. What do you think about that idea? 

User: That sounds easier than talking. I could try that. 

Consultant: Great! Writing can be a powerful tool for expression. As we move forward, remember to be kind to yourself during these processes. You’re taking important steps towards understanding and communication. How do you feel about the plan we’ve discussed today? 

User: I feel a bit lighter. It’s nice to talk about this. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiaoyi. Talking can really help lighten the load. As we wrap up today, is there anything specific you want to focus on for our next session? 

User: Maybe I can think about how the small steps go this week and what I could write to my parents. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Reflecting on your steps will help us see what’s working and what we can adjust. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time we meet! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You're welcome! You've done well today, and I'm here to support you. Take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyi! I'm glad you're here today. I understand that you've been feeling angry and unfairly treated recently. Can you share more about what's been happening at school?

User: Hi. Yes, I’ve been really upset. I had a fight with a classmate because I didn’t follow the teacher’s instructions. I feel like I’m always being pressured by the rules, and it doesn’t feel fair at all.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're feeling cornered by the school's rules and that it has led to conflicts with your classmates. Can you tell me more about what specifically made you feel so pressured?

User: Well, the teacher keeps saying I don't listen, but I feel like I was just trying to express myself. It seems unfair that I get blamed for everything.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling misunderstood and that your intentions are not being recognized by your teacher. When you find yourself in those situations, what thoughts are running through your mind?

User: I just think that it’s not right. I feel like no one is listening to me or considering my feelings, and it makes me really angry.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way—feeling unheard can lead to frustration. Do you notice any specific thoughts that come to your mind when you feel this anger?

User: I guess I think things like, “They don’t care about me,” or “I have to fight back to make them understand.” 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite intense. Let’s look at them closely. When you think, “They don’t care about me,” what emotions does that bring up for you?

User: It just makes me feel more upset and alone. I want to be understood, but it seems impossible sometimes.

Consultant: Being understood is an important need for everyone, especially in times of conflict. In those moments, how do your feelings influence your actions during disagreements with your teachers or classmates?

User: I tend to either shout back or just shut down. I don’t know how to argue without losing my temper.

Consultant: Those reactions are common when someone feels backed into a corner. What if we explored some different ways to express yourself calmly during conflicts? What do you think about that?

User: I would like to try that, but I’m not sure how. It’s hard to not react immediately.

Consultant: Absolutely! It can be a challenge to pause before responding. One way we can practice this is by recognizing your triggers. What situations tend to make you feel the most impulsive?

User: Mostly when I feel like I'm being attacked, or not listened to. That just makes me snap.

Consultant: Recognizing those triggers is a significant first step. Let’s consider how you can respond differently when you feel that way. What if you took a moment to breathe and ask yourself, “Is there another way I can express this?”

User: That could work, I guess. But I sometimes just feel overwhelmed in the moment.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed. Would you be open to practicing a short breathing technique together to help you stay calm when you start feeling that way?

User: Sure, I’m willing to try!

Consultant: Great! Let’s go through it: Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold it for a count of four, and then exhale through your mouth for a count of four. Let’s do it together a couple of times. 

User: *Breathes in and out* That feels a bit relaxing actually!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! This technique can serve you well in moments of stress. Remember, it’s about giving yourself that pause. Can you think of a recent situation where you could have used this technique?

User: Yes, I think I could have used it during the fight with my classmate. I got so angry right away.

Consultant: That’s an insightful observation. Next time you feel that anger rising, try to remember your breath. Now, let’s talk about how you can communicate your feelings without escalating the situation. What does that communication look like to you?

User: I guess I would want to tell them how I feel without being aggressive. Maybe just express that I don’t appreciate being blamed.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach. You might say, “I feel upset when I’m blamed because I want to be understood.” How does that feel to say?

User: That sounds okay! It feels good to say it without shouting. I like that approach!

Consultant: I’m really glad you’re feeling more positive about it. Let’s also think about your mom for a moment. How has communication with her been lately?

User: Honestly, it’s not going well. She often thinks I’m just being difficult when I express how I feel. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough, especially when you’re trying to express your needs. If you could change one thing about how you communicate with her, what would it be?

User: I want her to listen to me without jumping to conclusions. Maybe share how I feel gently. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! Have you thought about how to start that conversation with her?

User: I haven’t, but I guess I could tell her I want to share something important when we’re both calm?

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Establishing a calm moment will help both of you understand each other better. How do you think that might change your relationship with her?

User: I hope it would help her see my side more and reduce some of the conflicts we have.

Consultant: That’s a hopeful outlook! As we wrap up today’s session, what is one insight or strategy that resonates most with you and that you can take away from our discussion?

User: I think the breathing technique and learning to communicate my feelings calmly are the most important. They could really help me!

Consultant: Those are excellent tools, Xiaoyi! I'm proud of you for being open to these strategies. Remember, it’s about progress, and you’re already on that path. If difficulties arise, just recall these techniques, and don’t hesitate to reach out next time.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyi! I'm glad you came in today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been really trying to talk to my mom about what I’m going through, but it just feels so frustrating. She keeps saying I don't understand what the real world is like.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiaoyi. It seems like you're feeling helpless and disappointed with the way things are going at home. Can you tell me more about the specific conversations you've had with your mom?

User: Well, I tried to explain to her that I feel a lot of pressure at school and that I need support, but she just brushed me off. It makes me feel like she doesn’t care.

Consultant: I can see how that would make you feel sad and unheard. It's important to have your feelings validated. What do you think you could do differently in your next conversation with her to help improve the situation?

User: I guess I could try to explain my feelings more clearly, but I'm scared that she will just dismiss me again.

Consultant: That fear is completely understandable. It’s challenging to put yourself out there when you’ve faced rejection before. How about we explore some strategies together that might help you communicate more effectively with her?

User: Sure, I’d like that. I just want her to understand how stressed I am.

Consultant: Let’s start by thinking of a specific feeling you want to express to her. What is it that you would like her to know about your stress?

User: I want her to know that I feel overwhelmed and anxious about my schoolwork, which is why I need her support.

Consultant: That’s a good foundation. Now, how about framing it in a way that opens up the conversation? You could say something like, "Mom, I really feel overwhelmed with my schoolwork right now, and I could use your understanding." What do you think?

User: That sounds okay, but what if she interrupts me?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. If she interrupts, you might try saying something like, "Can I finish my thought first?" This way, you're asserting yourself while also showing her that you want to share your feelings fully. How does that resonate with you?

User: I think I might actually be able to try that. I just need to be brave.

Consultant: Yes, bravery is key! Remember that it’s okay to be nervous. What you’re trying to achieve—better communication—is worth it. Let’s discuss how you can prepare yourself mentally before speaking with her.

User: I think I might need to remind myself that my feelings are valid, regardless of how she reacts.

Consultant: Exactly! Reminding yourself that your feelings are important can help increase your confidence. You can also practice deep breathing before the conversation to calm any nerves. Would you like to try some breathing exercises with me now?

User: Yes, I’d like that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in together… hold it for a moment… and now slowly breathe out. How does that feel?

User: It helps a bit. I’m still nervous, but it feels nice to breathe like this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Breathing can be a powerful tool to help you manage anxiety. Besides communicating with your mom, are there any other situations where you're feeling anxious?

User: Yes, I feel anxious when I have to work in teams at school. I worry that I won't be able to contribute enough.

Consultant: That’s a common concern, especially in teamwork settings. Can you think of any past experiences where you successfully contributed, even if it was just a small way?

User: I guess there was a project where I helped organize our ideas. It felt good to take charge a little.

Consultant: That’s a great example! You showed leadership and contributed positively. Remember that teamwork is about sharing strengths. What strengths do you think you can bring to future team projects?

User: I’m good at planning and being organized, I suppose.

Consultant: Those are valuable skills! Perhaps you could suggest taking the lead on planning in your next group project? How do you think your team would respond to that?

User: I think they might appreciate that. Maybe they’ll see I can help them stay on track.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking the initiative can change how your peers view you and can ease your anxiety. As we continue our sessions, we'll work on building these skills even more. Are you feeling a bit more empowered about upcoming situations?

User: Yes, I feel a bit better now. It’s just hard to shake the anxiety sometimes.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to experience anxiety, especially in challenging situations. Remember, it takes practice. You're on the right path, and with each step, you'll build your confidence. Before we wrap up today’s session, is there anything specific you want to focus on for next time?

User: I’d like to talk more about how to handle anxiety during group work.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan. We can dive deeper into strategies to boost your confidence and manage those feelings next time. Thank you for sharing today, Xiaoyi. Remember that communication and self-awareness are key parts of your journey. See you in our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyi! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been really stressed about this group project at school. I just can't seem to communicate well with my teammates, and it makes me anxious.

Consultant: I understand how challenging group projects can be, especially when communication doesn't go smoothly. Can you tell me what specifically makes you feel anxious about interacting with your teammates?

User: I worry that I’ll say something wrong or that they won’t listen to me. Sometimes, I even doubt my ideas and think they aren’t good enough.

Consultant: Those thoughts can definitely contribute to your anxiety. Let's explore those feelings a bit more. When you're in those situations, what kind of thoughts go through your mind just before you speak up?

User: I keep thinking that I’ll mess up or that they’ll judge me. It's like I freeze up and can't express what I want to say.

Consultant: That’s a tough place to be, feeling frozen by those thoughts. It sounds like you might be experiencing some cognitive distortions. Have you noticed if those thoughts have any evidence supporting them? 

User: Not really. I mean, they haven’t actually judged me out loud, but I just feel that way.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those fears, but it’s important to challenge them. If a friend were in your shoes, how would you advise them to see their thoughts differently?

User: I guess I would tell them that it’s okay to make mistakes and that everyone has good ideas.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! Now let's apply that to your situation. What would it look like for you to replace the thought “I’ll mess up” with something more positive and supportive?

User: Maybe I could think, “It’s okay to share my ideas, and they might actually be helpful.”

Consultant: I love that reframe! It acknowledges your fear but also opens the door for positive thoughts. How do you think adopting that mindset will help you during your group discussions?

User: I think it would help me feel more confident and less scared to speak up. 

Consultant: Exactly! Confidence is key. Let’s also think about practical strategies you can use when you feel that anxiety creeping in. Have you considered any specific actions you might take to facilitate better communication with your group?

User: I could try to prepare what I want to say in advance and maybe even practice a bit before the meeting.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant idea! Practicing can make a significant difference. How about we set a small goal for your next group meeting? What do you hope to accomplish?

User: I want to share at least one of my ideas and see how they react to it.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic goal! It’s a manageable step towards building your confidence. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. How do you feel about that plan?

User: I feel good about it. I'm nervous, but I think it’s doable.

Consultant: It's perfectly fine to feel nervous! That’s a natural reaction. Let’s also think about ways to celebrate your success afterwards, no matter how small. Any ideas?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to something nice afterward, like a favorite snack or a little time on my video games.

Consultant: Great idea! A treat can be a nice way to reward yourself. As we wrap up today's session, let’s recap what you've learned and how you plan to move forward. What stands out to you from our conversation?

User: I guess the biggest takeaway is recognizing that my fears might not be based on reality, and that I can work on my confidence by practicing.

Consultant: Exactly! You're gaining valuable insights about your thoughts and starting to cultivate a more positive mindset. How do you feel about your ability to handle that project now?

User: I feel much better! I actually believe I can do it now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiaoyi! Embracing that belief in yourself is a huge step forward. Remember, you have the tools you need to face this challenge. I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes in our next session!

User: Thank you! I feel more optimistic about everything now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and I’ll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyi! It's great to see you here today. I’m really looking forward to our session. Can you tell me how you’ve been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling really happy. I received some praise during an extracurricular activity, and it made me realize that I have strengths in other areas too. It’s been nice to see myself in a different light.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Xiaoyi! Recognizing and appreciating our strengths can be very uplifting. How do you think this new awareness of your abilities has changed your outlook on yourself?

User: I think I’ve started to believe in myself more. Before, I often felt like I wasn’t good at anything. Now, it feels like I can achieve more than I thought I could.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant shift! Believing in our abilities is an essential part of building self-confidence. Can you share an example of something you’ve accomplished recently that made you feel proud?

User: Well, I helped my friend with her homework, and she did really well on the test. It felt good to be able to contribute and support her like that.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic example, Xiaoyi! Helping others can often reflect our own strengths. How did it feel to see your friend succeed because of your support?

User: It felt amazing! I felt like I was actually good at something and it was nice to hear her say thank you.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! It’s important to celebrate these moments. Reflecting on your strengths is a key part of reinforcing your self-image. How do you think we can keep building on this positive feeling in our session today?

User: I’d like to focus on how I can keep recognizing my abilities and maybe even find more things I’m good at.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal. Let’s work on identifying more strengths and examples that reinforce your positive self-image. Can you think of a situation where you felt proud of yourself besides the homework incident?

User: There was a time I joined a school project on environmental issues, and I was chosen to present our findings. That felt really good too.

Consultant: Presenting can be quite challenging, and it sounds like you did a great job! How did you prepare for that presentation, and how did it feel to be recognized for your efforts?

User: I practiced a lot, and my teammates were supportive. When I finished, they all clapped and cheered. It was really encouraging!

Consultant: That support from your teammates must have been incredibly affirming. Moments like that can be powerful in reinforcing our confidence. What do you think helped you prepare so effectively for the presentation?

User: I think being part of a supportive team made it easier. I felt less alone and was motivated to do well for them as well as for myself.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful insight, Xiaoyi. The support we receive can greatly influence our performance. Moving forward, how can you seek out or encourage that kind of support in other areas of your life?

User: Maybe I can share my goals with friends more often and ask for help when I need it. I think that would really help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your goals and seeking help can foster both your growth and strengthen your connections. Now, let's focus on a way to maintain this positive mindset. Can you think of any techniques you might use to remind yourself of your strengths regularly?

User: I could make a list of my achievements and read it when I feel down. 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Having a tangible reminder of your accomplishments can boost your confidence. Would you like to write down a few of your key strengths and achievements together now?

User: Yes, I would love that! 

Consultant: Great! Let’s start with the homework helping and the successful presentation. What are a few more you can add?

User: Hmm, I also helped organize a school event, and I think I did a good job with that too! 

Consultant: Excellent! That shows your ability to take initiative and work with others. What else comes to mind?

User: I think I’m good at drawing. My art teacher has praised my work before, too.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Art can be very expressive and shows creativity. It’s another strength that contributes to your unique abilities. So now you have a list of accomplishments and strengths. How do you feel having compiled this?

User: I feel proud! It makes me realize there are many things I can do well.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! This recognition of your skills can truly shape the way you view challenges ahead. How can you integrate this positive outlook into your daily routine?

User: I could start each day by reminding myself of something I’m proud of or looking at this list.

Consultant: That sounds like a powerful practice! Consistently reminding yourself can reinforce your positive self-image. As we wrap up today, I’d love to know—how confident do you now feel about facing new challenges?

User: I feel much more confident! I think I can approach challenges with a better mindset now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful progress, Xiaoyi! You’ve done great work today in recognizing your strengths and accomplishments. If you encounter self-doubt, remember this feeling and the evidence of your capabilities. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help in seeing the positives in myself. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Remember, you have the tools to continue building your confidence. Always feel free to come back and share your progress. Have a great day!
