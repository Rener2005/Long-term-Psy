Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you're here today. I understand you've been feeling quite anxious lately, especially in your work environment. Can you share more about how this is affecting you?

User: Hi. Yes, it's been really tough. I feel this overwhelming urge to glance at my male colleagues out of the corner of my eye, and then I end up feeling guilty and ashamed. It's making it hard for me to concentrate on my work.

Consultant: That sounds very difficult, and I can see how it would be really stressful for you. You mentioned feeling guilty after these experiences. Can you tell me more about what thoughts go through your mind when this happens?

User: I keep thinking that people might interpret my sideways glances the wrong way, like I’m being inappropriate. I feel like I'm not in control of myself, and it just spirals into more anxiety.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel anxious when you're worried about how others perceive you. Let's explore your thoughts further. When you glance at your male colleagues, what specific thoughts do you have that contribute to your anxiety?

User: I think things like "What if they think I'm interested in them?" or "What if I make them uncomfortable?" It feels like no matter what I do, I can't win.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are very intense and create a lot of pressure for you. Would you say these thoughts feel very extreme or unrealistic at times? 

User: Yes, exactly! Sometimes I realize they’re not based on any real evidence, but in the moment, it’s hard to shake them off.

Consultant: Great insight! It seems like you're recognizing the difference between your thoughts and reality. Let's discuss how we might challenge and reframe those thoughts together. What would you say if a friend had similar worries?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay and that they shouldn’t worry too much about what others think. That’s easier said than done when it’s me, though.

Consultant: That's a kind perspective to have for a friend. It might be helpful to apply that same kindness to yourself. What if we replace the thought "What if they think I'm interested?" with something more balanced? 

User: I guess I could think, "I'm just working, and my focus is on my job, not on them." That sounds better, but it’s hard to remember when I'm feeling anxious.

Consultant: Absolutely, it's a challenge, especially under stress. Let's work on creating a simple reminder phrase to help anchor that thought when you're in those situations. How about "I’m here to work"?

User: That could work! I will give it a try.

Consultant: Wonderful! Now let's move to understand your feelings about eye contact with your husband. It seems there's some conflict there as well. Can you tell me more about that?

User: With my husband, I often look away because I feel uncomfortable. I know I should connect with him, but it feels too vulnerable.

Consultant: It’s important to feel safe in those interactions, and feeling vulnerable can be really tough. What are your thoughts about eye contact in your marriage?

User: I feel like if I don’t make eye contact, I’m not showing him that I care. But at the same time, I don’t know how to overcome that fear.

Consultant: It's a challenging situation, wanting to connect but feeling hesitant. What would it look like for you to practice small moments of eye contact with your husband without feeling overwhelmed?

User: Maybe I could start by making eye contact for just a few seconds at a time, like during dinner. That feels manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like a very doable approach! You could even tell him what you’re practicing so he can support you. Would that make it easier?

User: Yes, that would help me feel less alone in this. I think he would understand.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Creating a supportive environment is important. As we wrap up today, let's summarize what we've discussed. 

User: Sure! We've talked about my anxious thoughts at work and how to challenge them, as well as my difficulties with eye contact with my husband.

Consultant: Yes, and you’re on your way to exploring those challenges with actionable strategies. What is the biggest takeaway for you from our session today?

User: I think it’s about being kinder to myself and practicing small changes. I can start working on the eye contact with my husband, and I'll remember my reminder phrase at work.

Consultant: That's a fantastic realization! I'm proud of the progress you've made today, Li. Remember, it’s a process, and you're already taking the right steps. If you need help or support, I'm here for you.

User: Thank you so much! I feel a bit lighter after this session. I'll keep practicing what we talked about.

Consultant: It’s my pleasure, Li. I look forward to hearing about your experiences when we meet next. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, I'm glad you're here for our session today. I've been looking forward to hearing how you've been feeling lately. Can you share what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really anxious, especially around my husband. I can’t seem to look him in the eye without feeling overwhelming guilt. It’s affecting our relationship, and I don’t know how to fix it.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of inner conflict about eye contact with your husband, which is causing you stress and guilt. Can we explore a bit more about what those feelings are like for you when you try to make eye contact?

User: Yes, every time I think about looking at him, I feel this knot in my stomach. I worry that he’ll be upset with me or that I’m letting him down. I don’t want to hurt him, but I also want to feel connected.

Consultant: That’s a really tough position to be in, wanting connection but feeling that anxiety. It’s understandable that you’d want to avoid situations that make you feel uncomfortable. Can you recall a specific moment recently when you wanted to look at him but didn’t?

User: Just last night at dinner, I wanted to engage in conversation, but I kept looking down at my plate. I could feel the tension building between us, and it made me even more anxious.

Consultant: I can see how that would create a cycle of anxiety and avoidance. It sounds like you're trapped between wanting to connect and fearing the outcome. What do you think would happen if you tried to look him in the eye during a moment of conversation?

User: I’m afraid I might just freeze or that he’ll think I’m being rude. I have this thought that I’m just not good enough for him, and it makes the whole situation worse.

Consultant: It sounds like you're caught in a negative thought pattern that affects your confidence during those interactions. Let's try to examine that fear a little more closely. What evidence do you have that looking at him would be seen as rude, or that you’re not good enough for him?

User: Well, he sometimes seems frustrated when I don’t respond or engage. I feel like my inability to look at him makes it seem like I don’t care, even though that's not true.

Consultant: That’s an important realization—your feelings do not reflect your true intentions. Let’s challenge that thought. If a friend were in a similar situation, how would you suggest they view their behavior and their partner's reactions?

User: I guess I would tell them that their partner probably understands they might be nervous and that it’s okay to be vulnerable. Maybe they need patience too.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s great that you can have that perspective for a friend. Now, how can we apply that same understanding and patience to your situation with your husband? 

User: Maybe I could remind myself that he loves me regardless of my nervousness. I just need to take it slow.

Consultant: That’s a positive approach. Taking it slow can help ease the pressure. How about we set a small goal for our next session? Perhaps you could practice making eye contact for just a few seconds during a conversation with him. What do you think about that?

User: That sounds manageable. I think even a few seconds would be a good start. I’ll try to remind myself that it’s okay to be vulnerable.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful step forward! And remember, it’s just practice. It’s okay if it doesn’t go perfectly. How do you feel about expressing these feelings to your husband as you try this?

User: I think it might help to let him know I’m working on it. He’s usually really supportive. I just hope he understands.

Consultant: Communication is key, and sharing your efforts can strengthen your relationship. I believe he would appreciate your honesty. How do you feel about preparing to talk to him about your goals?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also encouraged. I think having that conversation might ease some of my anxiety.

Consultant: That makes sense. Nervousness is a natural response to change, but it shows you're ready to take action. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize your goals for next week.

User: Alright! I’ll work on making eye contact for a few seconds and have a conversation with my husband about it.

Consultant: Excellent! You’re taking meaningful steps towards improving your connection with him. Remember, be gentle with yourself throughout this process. If you ever feel overwhelmed, it’s okay to pause and breathe. 

User: Thanks, that helps a lot. I appreciate your support.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that. I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey, and I’m here to help you navigate it. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you today. Before we dive into our session, could you share with me how you've been feeling lately regarding your social interactions at work?

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty anxious. I find it hard to look at my colleagues during conversations, and it’s really affecting my ability to feel comfortable at work. I feel disappointed because I want to have better relationships with them, but I don't know how to change things.

Consultant: It sounds like you're in a tough spot, feeling anxious and disappointed about your interactions. What specific situations at work tend to make you feel most uncomfortable?

User: Well, during team meetings, I often avoid eye contact. I can feel the tension, and it's awkward. I just want to be contributing and feeling connected to my colleagues, but it feels so hard.

Consultant: I understand that these meetings can be really challenging for you. Looking back, can you recall a recent meeting where you felt particularly anxious? What thoughts were going through your mind at that moment?

User: I remember worrying that people would think I’m unfriendly or disinterested. When I look up, I feel exposed and start panicking a bit.

Consultant: That’s very understandable. It seems like you have a belief that if you look at your colleagues, they might judge you negatively. How does that belief affect your feelings during these meetings?

User: It makes me feel even more anxious, and I just freeze. The expectation feels too high, and I want to disappear sometimes.

Consultant: It looks like there's a cycle here—your thoughts lead to anxiety, which then influences your behavior in those meetings. Let’s explore this a little further. Can you think of any instances where a colleague looked at you and it felt okay?

User: Sometimes I notice a colleague smiling at me, and for a second, I feel a bit more relaxed, but then I quickly look away.

Consultant: That smile might indicate a positive interaction. How do you think your reaction changes the dynamic in those situations?

User: I guess when I avoid looking back, I miss out on those small moments that could help ease the tension. 

Consultant: Exactly, Li! It’s good to recognize that avoiding eye contact can escalate feelings of disconnect. I’d like us to work on gradually changing this pattern together. Would you be open to trying some small steps to engage more during these interactions?

User: Yes, I think I’d like to try. I just worry it won’t work.

Consultant: That’s completely normal to feel that way. What if we set a small goal for the next meeting? Perhaps, you could try making brief eye contact with someone for just a few seconds? What do you think?

User: I could try that. Maybe just with one person first.

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! How do you think you might feel after attempting that?

User: I might feel a bit more confident, if it goes well. But I’m also scared of messing it up.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel scared. Let's brainstorm together some supportive thoughts you could remind yourself of during the meeting. How about something like, “It’s okay to take small steps, and my colleagues might appreciate my effort”?

User: I like that idea. I could remind myself that trying is more important than getting it perfect.

Consultant: Absolutely, that’s a fantastic mindset! It’s all about progress, not perfection. After the meeting, would you be willing to take a few moments to jot down your thoughts on how it went? 

User: Yes, I can do that. Writing it down might help me see things more clearly.

Consultant: Perfect! This will allow us to review your experiences and celebrate any successes, no matter how small. How does that feel for you?

User: It feels good to have a plan. I like that I can reflect on it afterward.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we prepare for our next session, remember to be gentle with yourself. This process takes time and practice, and recognizing your feelings is a step forward. 

User: Thank you, I really appreciate your support. I felt understood today.

Consultant: I'm always here to support you, Li. Before we end today, is there anything else that’s been on your mind you’d like to discuss?

User: No, I think I covered everything I wanted to. I feel a little lighter now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It’s great to see you feeling lighter. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Remember, you’re not alone in this. 

User: Thank you so much! I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: See you next time, Li! Take care.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm really glad to see you here today. I know you've been participating in a self-help group and gaining some insights about your experiences. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been feeling more aware of my feelings and behaviors, but I still struggle with social situations. I often feel anxious and hesitant to engage with others.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re becoming more aware! Understanding these feelings is an important first step. Can you share a specific social situation that has made you feel anxious recently?

User: Well, the other day, I attended a small gathering with colleagues, and I felt very out of place. I wanted to join the conversations but kept holding back because I was worried about saying the wrong thing.

Consultant: I can understand how uncomfortable that must have been for you. It sounds like the fear of making a mistake held you back from participating. What thoughts were going through your mind at that time?

User: I kept thinking they wouldn't be interested in what I had to say. I would feel embarrassed if they reacted negatively.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite powerful and disheartening. It sounds like you were anticipating a negative reaction. Can we explore how that thought affects your feelings during interactions?

User: Definitely. When I think that way, I usually feel anxious, which makes me even less likely to speak up. It’s like a cycle.

Consultant: That's an important insight, Li. Recognizing that cycle can help us challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that your colleagues wouldn’t be interested in your input?

User: I suppose I don’t really have any solid evidence. It’s just a feeling I have based on past experiences of being shy.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way given your past. However, it's crucial to test those thoughts with evidence. If you were to observe another person in your situation, what advice would you give them?

User: I’d probably tell them to just be themselves and share their thoughts, that it’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: That’s very compassionate advice! Now, why do you think it’s easier to give that advice to someone else rather than yourself?

User: I guess I’m my own worst critic. I’m much harsher on myself than I would be to a friend.

Consultant: I can relate to that feeling. It’s common for many people to be self-critical. How might you begin to apply that same kindness to yourself in social situations?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that everyone's learning, including me.

Consultant: That's a wonderful strategy! Applying self-compassion can significantly help in reducing anxiety. Is there a specific situation coming up where you can practice this new mindset?

User: I have another gathering next week, and I want to try participating more actively. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great opportunity! What’s one small step you could take to prepare for that gathering?

User: I could write down a few topics I'd feel comfortable discussing, so I have something to fall back on if I feel nervous.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Having those topics in mind can help you feel more prepared. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel a little more confident just thinking about it. It feels manageable.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! As you prepare, remember to be patient with yourself. What do you think might help you to stay calm if you start feeling anxious during the gathering?

User: I could practice some deep breathing exercises before I go in. That might help calm my nerves.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a fantastic tool for managing anxiety! It’s great that you already have a plan. How do you feel about the support you've been receiving from your self-help group?

User: I find it really helpful. Sharing experiences with others who understand makes me feel less alone.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Community support can be incredibly valuable. How might you further utilize that support to bolster your confidence in social settings?

User: I could maybe discuss my goals with the group and get their input, which could motivate me.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive plan! Getting feedback and encouragement from others can really boost your confidence. 

User: Yes, it definitely could. I feel more hopeful about trying to engage next week.

Consultant: I’m pleased to hear that, Li! As we wrap up, let’s reflect on what you’ve learned today and how you can continue to apply it moving forward.

User: I’ve learned that I can challenge my negative thoughts and practice being kinder to myself. I feel ready to go to that gathering with a new mindset.

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress! Remember, it’s all about gradual and steady steps. You have the tools and support you need. If challenges arise, know you can always return for guidance. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel really encouraged after talking with you.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to hear that. I look forward to hearing about your experiences at the next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! It's great to see you again. I appreciate your positive attitude towards your challenges. Let’s talk today about how you can apply the social skills you've learned in group therapy to your daily life. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit nervous but also excited. I really want to try using those new techniques, but sometimes I doubt if I can do it in real situations.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous when trying something new, especially in social situations. Can you share a specific scenario or situation where you’d like to apply these skills?

User: Sure! There’s a gathering at work coming up, and I would like to engage more with my coworkers instead of just standing there quietly. But I worry that I might say the wrong thing or be awkward.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re really wanting to connect with your colleagues, which is a great step forward. What specific thoughts come to mind when you imagine yourself at this gathering? 

User: I keep thinking that everyone will be watching me and judging what I say. It's really overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds quite anxiety-provoking. Let’s explore that thought a bit. What evidence do you have that they are judging you? 

User: I guess I don't have any real evidence. It’s just a fear that I’ve built up in my mind.

Consultant: A lot of times, our fears can feel very real, but they might not always be based on reality. If a friend were in your position, what do you think you would tell them?

User: I’d probably tell them that people are usually too focused on themselves to judge others so harshly.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective! Remembering that can help you to reframe your thoughts. What do you think would happen if you approached the gathering with that mindset?

User: I think I would feel a bit less pressure and might even enjoy talking to others.

Consultant: Exactly! Let’s turn that thought into a strategy. Can we plan small interactions you can have at the gathering that feel manageable for you?

User: Maybe I could start with a simple "Hi" to someone I know and see where that leads?

Consultant: That's a fantastic start! A simple greeting can open up many possibilities. What else could you say after that to keep the conversation going?

User: I could ask about their weekend or any updates on work tasks.

Consultant: Perfect! Those are friendly and open-ended questions. How do you feel about setting a goal to initiate at least two conversations during this gathering?

User: Setting a goal sounds good. I think I can do that.

Consultant: Great! Setting small, achievable goals can boost your confidence. After the gathering, let’s reflect on how it went. What will be your plan for the post-gathering reflection?

User: I’ll ask myself what went well, what I struggled with, and what I can improve next time.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach. It helps you learn and adjust for future situations. Now, let’s also discuss how you can manage any anxiety you feel right before the gathering. What techniques do you think might help?

User: I’ve been practicing some deep breathing techniques. I could use those to calm myself down before I go in.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a wonderful tool! It’s great that you have that in your toolkit. How do you feel about combining that with your greeting strategy? 

User: I think that would make me feel more ready!

Consultant: Fantastic! You’ve got a solid plan in place. Let’s check in on your progress in our next session. How are you feeling about all the strategies we discussed today?

User: I feel more confident and excited. I think I have a good plan now!

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Li. Always remember that trying is a success in itself. Before we wrap up, is there anything else on your mind today?

User: No, I think we covered everything. Thank you so much for your support!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of the progress you’re making. Remember, it’s all about the journey, and I'm here for you. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm delighted to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite good, actually. I've been trying to apply the strategies we've discussed, and I feel more confident now. I'm able to communicate more openly with my husband and colleagues.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're making significant progress in expressing yourself and building connections. Can you share some specific situations where you felt this improvement?

User: Sure! Last week, I had a team meeting at work and I actually spoke up about my ideas. Usually, I just stay quiet, but this time I felt brave enough to share, and my colleagues responded positively.

Consultant: That’s a great achievement! Speaking up in a team setting can be daunting, especially if you’ve been reserved in the past. How did it feel to express your thoughts during that meeting?

User: It was a mix of nervousness and excitement. I felt good afterward, like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. But I still worry about whether I’ll be able to keep this up.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a bit anxious about sustaining these changes. It sounds like you've taken a big step forward. What do you think helps you feel more confident in those situations?

User: I think the strategies we've practiced, especially focusing on positive self-talk, have helped. I remind myself that my input is valuable and that people want to hear what I have to say.

Consultant: That's an excellent strategy, Li! Positive self-talk can significantly influence how we perceive ourselves in social situations. Let’s build on that. How can you ensure that you maintain this positive mindset moving forward?

User: I suppose I can keep reminding myself of my past successes, like the meeting, and try to reflect on those moments when I feel uncertain.

Consultant: Reflecting on past achievements is a fantastic way to reinforce your self-confidence. Have you thought about setting any specific goals for your social interactions in the coming weeks?

User: Yes, I want to make it a goal to initiate at least one meaningful conversation with someone at work each week. That way, I can keep practicing and not slip back into my old habits.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Gradually increasing your interactions can help solidify the progress you've made. What kind of conversations do you envision initiating?

User: Maybe discussing project ideas or even asking about their weekend plans. I think small talk can lead to more meaningful exchanges.

Consultant: Absolutely! Small talk is a great way to build rapport. How do you feel about stepping into those conversations? Are there any concerns that arise?

User: I still feel a bit anxious about how they will respond. What if they don't seem interested? 

Consultant: That’s a common concern. Remember, not every interaction will go perfectly, and that's okay. What evidence do you have that people will not be interested? 

User: Well, I don’t have any specific evidence. It’s mostly just a fear I have in my mind.

Consultant: It sounds like this fear may not be based on reality. If your colleagues have responded positively in the past, that’s a good indicator of potential positive interactions in the future. How can you challenge this fear further?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that everyone has their own stresses and concerns, and that it’s not always about me. 

Consultant: Exactly! By shifting your focus away from self-doubt and considering the mutual nature of conversations, you can alleviate some of that pressure. How do you feel about testing this approach in your next interaction?

User: I feel a bit more relaxed thinking about it that way. It makes it seem less daunting. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It's important to approach these situations with a sense of curiosity rather than fear. Is there anything else you're hoping to work on today as we wrap up?

User: I think we’ve covered a lot already! I just want to ensure I stay consistent with my goals and keep building my confidence.

Consultant: That’s a great focus. As we end our session, let’s summarize your progress. You’ve acknowledged your growth in communication, identified key strategies that help, and set practical goals for continued improvement. 

User: Yes, I feel proud of how far I’ve come, and I’m ready to keep pushing myself.

Consultant: Wonderful attitude, Li! Remember, consistency is key, and it’s okay to take small steps. You've shown remarkable resilience. If you ever feel stuck, reflect on your successes. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support and guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure to work with you. You’ve gained valuable skills, and I have no doubt you can navigate future challenges. As you continue this journey, don't hesitate to return if you need more support. Take care!

User: Thank you! I will. Goodbye!
