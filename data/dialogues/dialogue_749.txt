Consultant: Hello! Welcome back to our session today. I’m here to support you. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling quite anxious and frustrated. The pressure from class activities is really weighing me down, and I had a conflict with my friend Zhang over our project. It's been tough to deal with everything.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like the conflict with Zhang and the pressure from your class activities are causing you a lot of distress. Can you tell me more about how you’re feeling about the situation with Zhang?

User: Well, we had different ideas for the class activity, and when I suggested mine, he just shot it down. It made me feel really invalidated and angry. I didn’t expect that from him.

Consultant: That sounds really disappointing and hurtful. It's natural to feel angry when our ideas aren’t appreciated, especially by someone close to us. How has this conflict affected your feelings towards your classmates and your responsibilities?

User: I feel like my classmates don’t understand me. It’s discouraging, and I’m even more afraid of sharing my thoughts in group discussions now. I just want to avoid conflict altogether.

Consultant: It’s understandable to want to avoid conflict, especially when it leads to feeling misunderstood. But avoiding it might also be making you feel more isolated. Let’s explore that a bit. What thoughts cross your mind when you think about participating in group discussions now?

User: I keep thinking that if I share my ideas, they might be rejected again, just like Zhang did. It feels like I’m just setting myself up to be hurt again.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re worried about rejection, which is completely normal. Sometimes, our minds jump to the worst-case scenarios. How do you feel when you think about those automatic thoughts of rejection?

User: I feel anxious and really insecure. It makes it harder for me to concentrate on my work. I end up staying up late worrying about all of this.

Consultant: It sounds like this anxiety is impacting your sleep and overall well-being. Let’s take a step back. How would you describe your self-worth in relation to your friends and classmates? 

User: I guess I feel like my worth is tied to how others perceive me. If they criticize my ideas, it feels like they are criticizing me as a person.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight. It seems that you're connecting your self-worth to external validation. Let’s think about this: if a friend you care about was in your shoes, how would you encourage them to view their worth?

User: I’d tell them that their value doesn’t depend on others’ opinions and that every idea is valid even if it’s not accepted. 

Consultant: That’s a beautiful perspective. It seems you already have some understanding of self-worth. How might you apply that to your own situation? 

User: I suppose I need to remind myself that my ideas are still valuable, regardless of others’ reactions. Maybe I shouldn’t take things so personally.

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing that your ideas have value can help reduce the fear of rejection. Now, how about thinking of one small step you can take to share your thoughts in a less intimidating way? 

User: Maybe I can start by expressing my ideas in smaller group settings first before bringing them up in larger discussions.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Taking small steps can help build your confidence. What do you think might happen if you share your ideas in a smaller group?

User: I think I’d feel less pressure and could get more supportive feedback, which might help me feel better about sharing in larger groups later.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a constructive way to approach it. As we work through this, remember that it’s okay to feel anxious, but it’s also important to take care of yourself. What strategies can you think of to help manage your anxiety before trying to share your ideas?

User: I could try deep breathing exercises or maybe even write down my thoughts before sharing them, just to organize my mind a bit.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies! Deep breathing can help calm your nervous system, and writing can clarify your thoughts. How do you think implementing these strategies will impact your sleep?

User: I hope it will help me relax more, and I can fall asleep without worrying so much. If I have a plan, maybe my mind won’t race at night.

Consultant: That’s a really positive outlook! Having a plan can bring you some peace of mind. As we wrap up this session, what are your main takeaways from our conversation today?

User: I’ve realized that I should separate my self-worth from others' opinions and that sharing my ideas in smaller groups can help me gradually build confidence.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight, and it shows great progress! I'm glad you’re thinking of ways to improve the situation. Remember, these skills take practice, but they can lead to meaningful change. 

User: Thanks! I feel a bit more hopeful about being able to manage my feelings and improve my relationships.

Consultant: I’m so pleased to hear that! It’s been great working together today. Just remember, it's normal to have ups and downs as you navigate these changes. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out. Until next time! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and will try to keep these strategies in mind. Looking forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad you're here today. Before we start, I'd like to check in with how you're feeling. Can you tell me what’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious. There’s this pressure from class work, and I can’t seem to sleep well. It feels like everything is piling up.

Consultant: That sounds tough, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. You're dealing with pressure and sleeplessness. What do you think is contributing the most to this anxiety for you?

User: It's mostly the stress of trying to communicate better with my classmates. I even tried talking to Zhang to ease our relationship, but it hasn’t really helped. 

Consultant: It sounds frustrating not seeing progress with Zhang. I want to explore your feelings about this situation a bit more. What thoughts come to your mind when you think about your attempts to connect with him?

User: I’ve been feeling a lot of self-doubt. I heard some classmates say negative things about me, which just makes me feel more isolated and less confident.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you hear negative comments. Those thoughts can be quite heavy. Can you describe how these thoughts affect your emotions and actions when interacting with your classmates?

User: Well, I just end up avoiding them because I worry they think I’m not good enough or something. I feel really alone.

Consultant: Avoiding those situations can feel like a safe option, but it often ends up reinforcing your feelings of isolation. Let's consider your thoughts about yourself—do you think they’re accurate or could there be another perspective?

User: I guess I might be being too hard on myself. I used to be confident, but now I just feel like I'm struggling.

Consultant: It's good that you're recognizing that. What evidence do you have that supports your negative thoughts about yourself? Are there moments that suggest otherwise?

User: I mean, I’ve done well in school before, but lately, it just doesn’t feel like it matters. 

Consultant: It’s important to acknowledge those past successes, Wang. They’re part of who you are. Can you think of a time when you felt confident about your abilities, even in difficult situations?

User: There was a time in the past when I helped my team win a project. I felt proud of that.

Consultant: That’s a great example! Helping your team is a significant achievement. How might you use that experience to challenge your current feelings of inadequacy?

User: I suppose I could remind myself that I can still succeed and it’s okay to face challenges.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reframing your perspective like that can empower you. Now, let’s talk about some strategies to build on that confidence. What kind of small actions could you take to gradually encourage more positive interactions with your classmates?

User: Maybe I could start with just saying hi or joining in on discussions, even if it's just a small comment.

Consultant: That's a wonderful start! Engaging in small ways can help ease anxiety and build that confidence back up. How do you feel about trying that this week?

User: It sounds manageable. I think I’ll give it a try!

Consultant: Good to hear! Remember, it's a gradual process, and each step is a victory. What other support do you think you might need in this journey? 

User: I think it would help to keep talking about my feelings and fears. It’s reassuring to share them.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. Regular check-ins can make a big difference. As we move forward, what do you think you’ll focus on in our next session to continue this progress?

User: I’d like to explore why I feel so anxious about others' opinions of me and ways to cope with that.

Consultant: That sounds like a valuable focus. Understanding those triggers will help us develop more effective strategies for you. Before we end today, let’s summarize what we discussed. How do you feel about the progress we’ve made?

User: I feel a bit lighter. Talking about my achievements gives me hope, and I’m excited to try some new things.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear, Wang! Remember, the journey is ongoing, and it’s okay to feel anxious sometimes. We will continue to build on these positive experiences. Just know I'm here to support you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate that. I feel like I can tackle things a little better now.

Consultant: I'm really glad you feel that way. You’ve already taken an important step today. Let’s carry this momentum into our next session! If anything else comes up before then, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: I will. Thank you so much for today!

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, Wang, and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad to see you again. It sounds like you've been experiencing some positive changes recently. Can you tell me how you've been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling somewhat better, but I still have a lot of anxiety, especially with class responsibilities. I had a good experience trying to participate more during a class event, and I noticed classmates were more welcoming.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear about your experience with your classmates! It's a positive step toward improving your confidence. Can you share what feelings or thoughts arose during that event?

User: I felt a mix of excitement and fear. I was nervous about how they would react, but when they responded positively, I felt relieved and even a little proud of myself.

Consultant: It sounds like your courage to engage with your classmates brought a sense of accomplishment. What do you think made it easier for you to participate this time?

User: I think I was just tired of letting my anxiety hold me back. I wanted to see if I could do it, even if it was scary.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! You've identified a strong motivation to face your fears. It’s important to acknowledge your bravery. How did you feel about interacting with your classmates afterward?

User: Afterward, I felt lighter. It was nice to have a positive experience. But then I started worrying about whether I can keep that up in future interactions.

Consultant: That’s a common concern, especially after a positive experience. Let's explore that worry further. What worries you most about future interactions?

User: I'm afraid I'll revert to being shy and that they won't be as nice again. I don't want to lose this newfound connection.

Consultant: I completely understand your concerns, and it’s natural to want to maintain those connections. However, let’s look at some strategies to help you feel more secure. What positive thoughts can you remind yourself of when you start to feel anxious about interacting with them again?

User: I guess I could remind myself that I was brave once and that it worked out. I should focus on that instead of my fears.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Focusing on your success can help counter those anxious thoughts. Let’s practice that together. If you find yourself feeling anxious, how about saying to yourself, "I can do this again; I’ve done it before"?

User: That sounds helpful. I can do that. 

Consultant: Excellent! Now, let’s think about some practical ways to continue building on that positive experience. Are there any specific situations coming up where you might want to apply these strategies?

User: I have another group project meeting next week, and I want to participate more.

Consultant: That’s a perfect opportunity! How can you use your positive self-talk during that meeting?

User: I can remind myself of the positive response from my classmates when I spoke up last time, and tell myself it’s okay to be a little nervous.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy, Wang! Acknowledging that it's okay to feel nervous can help normalize those feelings. Alongside that, have you thought about any small steps you could take to engage during the meeting?

User: Maybe I could prepare a couple of points to bring up beforehand to feel more prepared.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Preparing points can help boost your confidence. How would you feel about writing those down before the meeting?

User: I think that would help a lot. I would feel more confident going in.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s also think about post-meeting reflection. After the meeting, how will you assess your experience and acknowledge your efforts?

User: I could write down what I said and how I felt afterward, and hopefully recognize any positive moments.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflecting on your experience can reinforce your progress. What if you made it a goal to highlight at least one positive interaction or accomplishment after each session?

User: That sounds like a meaningful practice. I could see how I’m improving over time.

Consultant: Yes! Tracking your growth can be incredibly affirming. Lastly, as we work on these strategies, how do you feel about your confidence moving forward?

User: Honestly, I feel a little more hopeful now. Like, I can really do this.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It seems your confidence is beginning to solidify. Remember, the more you practice these strategies, the easier it will become. If you ever face challenges, I’m here to help you navigate them.

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your support. I’m really looking forward to applying all of this.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Wang! I'm proud of the progress you’re making. Just remember to be gentle with yourself as you navigate these interactions. I can't wait to hear about your experiences next time. Take care!

User: You too! Thank you for believing in me.

Consultant: Always! You've got this! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again, and I'm glad to hear about your recent success in leading the group discussion. How have you been feeling overall since our last session?

User: Hi! I've felt a bit more confident since leading that discussion. But the anxiety about my responsibilities is still hanging over me, especially with all the group projects.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that your confidence has improved! Feeling anxious about responsibilities is quite common. Can you tell me more about what specific aspects of your responsibilities are causing you the most anxiety?

User: I guess it’s the fear of not meeting everyone's expectations. I want to contribute well, but sometimes I feel overwhelmed by the pressure.

Consultant: It sounds like you really care about doing well and meeting those expectations, which is admirable. However, that pressure can be quite heavy. How do you think this fear impacts your ability to work on your projects or get a good night’s sleep?

User: I find it hard to concentrate, and then I end up staying up late trying to catch up. It’s a cycle that just makes everything worse.

Consultant: That cycle can indeed be challenging to break. Let’s explore this together. When you think about the expectations you have, what thoughts come to mind that might be contributing to your anxiety?

User: I often think that if I don’t do things perfectly, I’ll let everyone down. It really stresses me out.

Consultant: That sounds quite overwhelming. Let’s try to unpack that thought a bit. What evidence do you have that not being perfect would actually lead to letting everyone down? 

User: Well, I suppose I don’t really have solid evidence. It’s more of a fear than anything concrete. 

Consultant: It’s insightful that you recognize it as a fear. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about dealing with that pressure?

User: I’d probably tell them that nobody is perfect and that it's okay to make mistakes. I guess I should give myself that same advice.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! It’s important to be as kind to yourself as you would be to a friend. Let’s consider some alternative thoughts you can use when you start feeling that pressure again. What would be a kinder way to remind yourself that it's okay to not be perfect?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that doing my best is enough and that I can learn from any mistakes.

Consultant: Exactly! That shift in thinking can be really powerful. As we continue, let’s focus on how you can reinforce this new mindset. Have you thought of any practical steps or activities that might help you implement this thinking?

User: Perhaps I could set smaller, more achievable goals for my projects instead of trying to do everything at once.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Breaking things down into smaller goals can create a sense of accomplishment and reduce feelings of being overwhelmed. How do you feel about planning out your tasks with that approach?

User: I think that would help a lot. It feels less daunting just thinking about it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. How do you think adopting this approach will affect your sleep and overall anxiety levels?

User: I hope it’ll help me feel more at ease and maybe allow me to sleep better, since I won’t be stressing about unfinished tasks.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive outcome to aim for. Along with setting smaller goals, have you considered trying any relaxation techniques or mindfulness practices to help with sleep?

User: I’ve heard about mindfulness but never really tried it. I’m not sure where to start.

Consultant: Mindfulness can be a wonderful tool for managing anxiety and improving sleep. It’s about being present in the moment and acknowledging your feelings without judgment. Would you be open to exploring a simple mindfulness exercise we could try together?

User: Sure, I’d be willing to give it a try. 

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s take a moment. I invite you to close your eyes if you’re comfortable. Take a deep breath in, hold it for a moment, and then slowly breathe out. As you do, visualize any tension leaving your body. How does that feel for you?

User: It feels calming, actually. I can feel the tension easing a little.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Practicing this regularly, especially before sleep, can really help calm your mind. How else can we incorporate this practice into your daily routine?

User: Maybe I could take a few minutes every night before bed to do this. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! Consistency can make a huge difference. As we wrap up today’s session, can you share what you find most valuable from our conversation?

User: I think identifying my fears and realizing I can challenge them was really enlightening. Plus, the mindfulness exercise feels like something I could actually do.

Consultant: I’m glad that resonated with you. Your insights today show your growth and willingness to embrace change. As we move forward, remember that it’s okay to seek support and continue practicing self-compassion. 

User: Thank you! I definitely feel more equipped to handle my anxiety and responsibilities now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. Remember, our journey doesn’t end here. When you encounter challenges, you have tools to manage them. Looking forward to seeing you in our next session to check on your progress! Take care until then.

User: Thank you! I’ll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad to see you again for our session today. It sounds like you've been experiencing some positive changes in your life recently. How are you feeling about those developments?

User: Hi! Thank you for having me. I've been feeling quite a bit better since I reconnected with Zhang. The positive feedback on my class responsibilities has really boosted my confidence. However, I'm still a bit worried about maintaining these relationships and my sleep quality.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling more confident and that your sleep has improved! Let's build on that positive energy. What strategies do you think will help you in maintaining this relationship with Zhang and your confidence moving forward?

User: I think keeping regular communication would help. I also want to ensure I don't stress too much about my responsibilities in class.

Consultant: Keeping that communication open is a healthy approach. It helps to maintain connections. How have you been managing your thoughts related to stress and responsibilities in class?

User: Well, I tend to overthink. I sometimes imagine that if I don’t perform perfectly, everyone will think less of me. This thought really freezes me up!

Consultant: That sounds frustrating. It seems like you might be experiencing a common cognitive distortion, where you’re expecting perfection from yourself. Can we explore the thoughts that come to your mind when you feel this way? What specific thoughts do you have in those moments?

User: I often think things like, "If I don't get this right, I’ll disappoint everyone," or "I’ll ruin everything." 

Consultant: Those thoughts can definitely add to the pressure you feel. Let’s examine the evidence behind them. How realistic are those fears? Is there a chance that others might be more understanding than you expect?

User: I guess they would be. My friends have been supportive, and Zhang said I’m doing well.

Consultant: Exactly! Their support is an important reminder that you're not alone in this. Let's think about replacing those extreme thoughts with more balanced ones. What might a more realistic thought be in response to those fears?

User: Maybe something like, "I’m doing my best, and that’s enough," could work for me. 

Consultant: I like that shift! It encourages self-compassion. How do you feel when you consider giving yourself that message instead?

User: It feels relieving, actually. It’s nice to think I don’t have to be perfect.

Consultant: That relief is a positive feeling to embrace. Now, let’s think about practical steps you can take to ensure you're applying this mindset. What kind of activities can you engage in that remind you to stay balanced and grounded?

User: I could practice mindfulness or even do some simple breathing exercises when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Excellent choice! Mindfulness can really help in staying present and reducing anxiety. How do you think you will integrate mindfulness practice into your daily routine?

User: I think starting with just five minutes of meditation in the morning would be manageable. I can also use breathing exercises during classes, especially before giving presentations.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Starting small is often effective. How do you feel about this strategy now that we’ve discussed it?

User: I feel more confident about it! Having a plan makes me feel more in control.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it's about finding a balance and being kind to yourself along the way. As we wrap up today, let's summarize what you've learned and how you'll maintain these positive changes. What strategies are you taking away with you?

User: I’m going to practice positive self-talk, stay connected with my friends, and incorporate mindfulness into my day.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies, Wang! It's important to continue recognizing your progress. How will you remind yourself to keep these practices active in your daily life?

User: I think I’ll set reminders on my phone! Maybe have a little note at my desk as a prompt.

Consultant: Great ideas! This will help maintain those positive practices. Remember, building and maintaining relationships and your confidence is a process. If you ever feel overwhelmed, you can always revisit these strategies. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel much more prepared now.

Consultant: You're welcome, Wang! I'm proud of the progress you've made. Enjoy the journey ahead, and remember you're always welcome to come back for support. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good overall. The pressure has lessened a bit since I did well on my mid-term exams. But I still find myself thinking a lot about my responsibilities and future. 

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling good after your exams! That achievement is something to be proud of. Can you tell me more about what responsibilities are on your mind and how they are impacting you?

User: Well, I have this class project coming up, and I'm worried about managing my time effectively. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed and question whether I can pull it off.

Consultant: It sounds like that project is weighing on you a bit. Feeling overwhelmed is understandable. How does this overwhelm affect your daily routine or sleep?

User: It doesn't help my sleep at all. I keep tossing and turning, thinking about the project and schoolwork. I just want to avoid that anxious feeling.

Consultant: That makes sense. Sleep is essential for your overall well-being, and constant worrying can disrupt it. Let's explore together—what strategies have you tried so far to manage that anxiety and improve your sleep?

User: I’ve tried going to bed earlier and even doing breathing exercises, but my mind keeps racing. I still find it hard to shut down my thoughts at night.

Consultant: Those sound like good steps! However, it can be tough to quiet the mind. Would you be willing to share what specific thoughts tend to race through your mind when you're trying to sleep?

User: Mostly, I think about what I need to do for the project, and I also worry about what others expect from me. I sometimes second-guess my abilities, too.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite powerful, especially when they lead you to doubt yourself. Let's take a closer look at this. Do you think these thoughts are based on evidence, or might they be a bit extreme at times?

User: I guess they are a bit extreme. I tend to assume that if I don’t do well, it will be a complete disaster. 

Consultant: It’s common to have such all-or-nothing thinking, but it doesn't have to define your experience. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you say to encourage them?

User: I would tell them that one project doesn’t define their worth and that it's okay to ask for help if needed.

Consultant: What a supportive perspective! You’re absolutely right. One project is just one part of your journey. How might you apply that kind of thinking to your own situation?

User: I could remind myself that doing my best is what truly matters and that I can reach out for support if I feel stuck.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a healthier way to view it. Now, let's think about some specific actions you can take to feel more prepared while also addressing your anxiety. What do you think would help you feel more in control of this situation?

User: Maybe breaking the project into smaller tasks would help. If I set clear goals each day, it might relieve some pressure.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Breaking tasks down can make them feel less daunting and more manageable. How do you feel about creating a simple schedule together that includes these smaller tasks?

User: I’d like that! Having a plan could help me stay focused and reduce my anxiety.

Consultant: Great! Let's outline a few tasks and set some realistic deadlines. Also, as part of your schedule, we can add some time for self-care—perhaps some activities that make you feel good or relax you?

User: Yes, I think I need more balance. Maybe I could set aside time for reading or hobbies I enjoy.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Prioritizing self-care can really enhance your mood and productivity. Let’s start developing those tasks and integrating breaks into your schedule. What’s the first task you’d like to tackle?

User: I want to start by researching the topic for my project this week. That way, I’ll know where to focus.

Consultant: Excellent choice! Make sure to set a specific time for this task so it feels more structured. How about setting a timeframe for this research and scheduling your self-care activities afterward?

User: That sounds good! I’ll allocate certain hours for research and then take a break to relax and do something I love.

Consultant: Perfect! This balanced approach will support your progress while also nurturing your well-being. After we draft that schedule, how can you remind yourself to stay positive and engaged throughout the process?

User: I could write myself an encouraging note to look at when I feel overwhelmed. Something like, "You've got this, take one step at a time.”

Consultant: That’s a lovely idea! Positive affirmations can be very powerful in moments of stress. Would you like to try setting up a small daily reminder or ritual to reinforce that mindset?

User: Yes! I could take a moment every morning to read that note and visualize my progress.

Consultant: A daily ritual sounds like it could set a positive tone for your day. I can already see you taking proactive steps toward your goals! How do you feel about our conversation today?

User: I feel more hopeful and less burdened. It’s nice to break it all down and have a plan.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! You've made significant strides today. Before we wrap up, what other ways can you think of to maintain your emotional well-being moving forward?

User: I think keeping up with my hobbies, staying organized, and reaching out to friends for support will help a lot.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies! Maintaining social connections and engaging in things you enjoy will definitely support your mental health. As we conclude today’s session, remember that you are capable of managing your emotions and challenges. 

User: Thank you! I feel much better equipped to handle everything now.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m so proud of your growth today. If you ever feel overwhelmed again, remember these strategies. I look forward to our next session to check on your progress. Take care, Wang!

User: Thanks, I will! See you next time!
