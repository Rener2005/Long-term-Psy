Consultant: Hi there! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello. I've been feeling really uncertain about my and my wife's future. We both want to leave behind our past and live a normal life, but the thought of fitting into society seems overwhelming.

Consultant: It sounds like both of you have a strong desire to move on from the past, but there’s anxiety about how to integrate into normal social life. Can you tell me more about specifically what aspects of this transition feel the most daunting to you?

User: I think it's mostly about finding a job and making new friends. We want to engage in healthy activities, but we're not sure where to start or who to connect with.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. Finding a job and making new connections can be quite challenging, especially when you’re aiming for a fresh start. What kind of activities do you think would be enjoyable for you both to pursue? 

User: We’ve talked about joining a local sports club or attending community events. It just feels intimidating to walk into a place where everyone seems to already know each other.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel intimidated. Social situations can be tough, especially when you're trying to build new connections. What if we looked at some small steps you could take to ease into these situations? 

User: Maybe we could start by attending something low-key, like a community workshop, where it’s more about learning than socializing?

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Workshops can provide structure and reduce the pressure to socialize immediately. What kind of workshops have you and your wife considered? 

User: We were thinking about a cooking class or an art workshop. Something fun and creative.

Consultant: Both of those options could be wonderful! They encourage interaction in a more relaxed environment. Have either of you had any experience with cooking or art that could help you feel more confident going in? 

User: We’ve cooked together a bit at home, and I used to paint when I was younger, so I guess we do have some background in those areas.

Consultant: That's fantastic! Your past experiences can definitely serve as a bridge to engage with others in those workshops. How about setting a goal to find and sign up for one of these classes in the next week?

User: That sounds doable. I think committing to it would help us take a step forward.

Consultant: Excellent! It’s all about taking manageable steps. Aside from the workshops, do you have thoughts on how you could support each other emotionally during this transition? 

User: We’ve been trying to communicate more openly about our feelings. However, sometimes it feels like we just end up stressing each other out instead of helping.

Consultant: Open communication is a great start! It’s natural to feel stressed when discussing such significant changes. What if you set aside time to share your thoughts, but also focus on uplifting each other by recognizing small achievements you both make?

User: I like that idea. Positive reinforcement could help reduce the stress and keep us motivated.

Consultant: Absolutely! Celebrating even small victories together can enhance your bond and encourage you both. What’s one small achievement from the past week you could celebrate together?

User: We went for a walk and talked about our goals for the future. That felt good.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful achievement! Walking and discussing your goals is a positive way to bond and focus on the future. As you continue these walks, consider planning to share not just what you want to achieve, but also how you’re feeling about the steps you’re taking.

User: That makes sense. I think we’ll start doing that. 

Consultant: Fantastic! This is about building a supportive system between you two. As we move forward, remember that managing anxiety around these changes is key. What are some strategies you think could help when those anxious feelings arise?

User: We could remind ourselves of our progress and how far we've come. Maybe even practice some breathing exercises.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Reminding yourselves of your progress can help ground you, and breathing exercises can be very calming. Would it help if we practiced a simple breathing technique together now?

User: Sure, that sounds helpful.

Consultant: Great! Let’s try this. Inhale slowly through your nose for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and exhale through your mouth for a count of four. Ready? 

User: Yes, let’s do it.

Consultant: Inhale... 1, 2, 3, 4... hold... 1, 2, 3, 4... exhale... 1, 2, 3, 4. How did that feel? 

User: I think it helped a bit. I feel a little more centered.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Practicing techniques like this can be very beneficial in the moment. As we look to conclude today’s session, let’s reflect on your progress and the steps we discussed.

User: We’ve made a plan to attend a workshop, and we’ll also support each other emotionally while focusing on our achievements.

Consultant: Those are solid steps. Remember to be gentle with yourselves as you navigate this transition. You’ve accomplished a lot already. What will be your primary focus for the coming week?

User: Signing up for that workshop and having a goal-oriented discussion with my wife.

Consultant: Sounds like a great plan! You’ve made significant strides today. I'm here if you need support in the future. Don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about things now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm glad to support you. Take care, and I look forward to hearing how it goes next time.

Consultant: Hello Zhang! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, it's been a bit tough. My wife and I are feeling anxious because of the financial pressure. We're trying to stay focused on our recovery, but it's hard to find jobs and the stress is really getting to us.

Consultant: I can imagine how overwhelming that must feel. It sounds like you are both trying to prioritize your recovery while dealing with these financial challenges. What specific aspects of the job search are causing you the most stress right now?

User: It's just frustrating. With our past, finding a job seems almost impossible. Each time we apply, we fear rejection or that they'll find out about our history. It's discouraging.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. Rejection can feel very discouraging, especially when you're putting yourself out there. Let's explore together—what do you think could help you cope better with these feelings of discouragement during your job search?

User: I guess if I could just get one interview, it would make a big difference. But then I'm worried about how to explain my past if it comes up.

Consultant: Getting an interview would indeed be a positive step. It's understandable to worry about how to address your past, but you also have your history of overcoming challenges. What might be a way you could frame your past positively during interviews?

User: Maybe I could focus on the fact that we're committed to our recovery now. I think I could say something about how those experiences have taught me a lot about perseverance.

Consultant: That's a great approach! Highlighting your commitment and what you've learned can show potential employers your growth. How would you feel practicing how to bring that up in a conversation?

User: I would feel a bit better having a plan. I think just saying it out loud might help ease my anxiety.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing can build your confidence. Let's take a moment to think about how you might explain your journey in a brief but impactful way. What would you want to include?

User: I would want to mention how far I've come, that I'm focused on my future, and that I’ve learned a lot through my experiences.

Consultant: That sounds like a powerful narrative, Zhang! Sharing your journey can help connect with those who hear it. Are there other steps you think you could take to create more opportunities for yourself in the job market?

User: Maybe I should look into job training programs or community services that help people like us. I haven't done that yet.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent idea! Engaging with community resources can provide not only support but also valuable networking opportunities. Do you have any specific programs in mind that you could check out?

User: I've heard of a couple of local organizations that help with job readiness. I might reach out to them.

Consultant: That would be a proactive step forward! Connecting with these organizations could help you gain skills and confidence as well. What feelings do you have about reaching out for help through these programs?

User: I feel hopeful about it, but also a bit nervous. It’s always hard to open up to new people.

Consultant: Feeling nervous is completely normal when starting something new. It might help to remind yourself of your progress so far. How do you think you could manage those nerves before reaching out?

User: I might remind myself that this is part of my recovery journey, and it’s okay to ask for help. That helps shift my perspective a bit.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift indeed! Recognizing that reaching out for help is a strength can change how you view those interactions. Are there additional strategies you’d like to work on to ease your anxiety during these moments?

User: Maybe I could practice some breathing exercises. I used to use them, and they helped.

Consultant: Breathing exercises can be very effective for managing anxiety. Would you like to discuss a simple technique we can incorporate into your routine?

User: Sure, that would be great!

Consultant: A common method is the 4-7-8 technique: breathing in for 4 seconds, holding for 7 seconds, and exhaling for 8 seconds. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds doable. I can start practicing that before interviews or when I feel anxious.

Consultant: Perfect! Practicing that technique can help calm your mind. Let’s also think about how you can support each other and maintain connection with your wife during this process. What are your thoughts on that?

User: We usually talk about our day, but maybe we could make it a point to share our job search experiences more openly. 

Consultant: Great idea! Open communication with each other can provide support and reduce feelings of isolation. What specific ways can you schedule those discussions?

User: We could set aside time each evening to check in with one another—just to share our progress and feelings.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Consistent check-ins can help both of you feel connected and supported. As we wrap up today, how are you feeling about your next steps forward?

User: I'm feeling more hopeful and having a clearer plan makes me less anxious. I appreciate this conversation.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Zhang! Remember, taking small steps is important, and you’re not alone in this journey. When we meet next, we can discuss how things have progressed with your job search and any challenges you face. 

User: That sounds good. I look forward to it. Thank you!

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and I look forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello Zhang! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling lately about your involvement in the community support group?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite hopeful, actually. Engaging with others in the community has been a positive experience for both me and my wife. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like participating in the group has been beneficial for you. Can you tell me more about what you've enjoyed most about this experience?

User: We’ve been able to connect with some really supportive people. It feels good to be a part of something and to share our experiences with others who understand.

Consultant: Connection is so important, and it’s great that you’re building relationships with people who understand your journey. Have there been any challenges while trying to maintain those new friendships?

User: Sometimes, it’s hard to communicate with my wife. We still struggle with talking openly, especially about our past. I feel like I need to fix that to keep things going well.

Consultant: That’s a really insightful observation. It sounds like you recognize the importance of improving communication with your wife to support both your relationship and your new friendships. What are some specific areas you think you struggle with when it comes to communication?

User: I think we both get defensive or shut down when discussing certain topics. It can lead to awkward silence, and that frustrates me because I want us to be on the same page.

Consultant: I can see how that would be frustrating. Feeling stuck in silence can really hinder progress. What do you think makes you or her defensive during these discussions?

User: I guess it’s a mix of fear and the past. We’ve both been through a lot, and it brings back memories that we don’t want to face. 

Consultant: It’s completely natural for past experiences to impact your current interactions. Recognizing this is a significant step. What strategies have you tried to help ease these conversations?

User: We’ve tried talking when things are calm, but sometimes it just feels too overwhelming, and we end up avoiding deeper discussions altogether.

Consultant: Avoidance can often feel like a safer option, but it can prevent growth within your relationship. What if we explored ways to approach these deep discussions in a less overwhelming manner?

User: That sounds worth trying. I want to learn how we can talk about these things without feeling so anxious.

Consultant: Absolutely! One approach could be setting aside specific times to talk, where both of you feel comfortable. How would you feel about creating a safe space for these conversations?

User: I think that could help. If we know there’s a time to talk, it might reduce the pressure during other moments. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight! You could even engage in some light activity beforehand to ease into the conversation. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds manageable. I think we could go for a walk or do something we both enjoy first.

Consultant: Perfect! Starting with a shared enjoyable activity can create a positive atmosphere. Would you like to discuss specific topics or guidelines for when you do have these conversations?

User: Yes, I’d like some tips on how to keep the conversation constructive, especially if things start to get tense.

Consultant: A good tactic is to use “I” statements. For instance, instead of saying “You always…” try “I feel…” This way, it focuses on your feelings rather than placing blame. Do you think that could help?

User: I think so. It sounds like a way to express myself without putting her on the defensive.

Consultant: Exactly! This small shift can significantly help in reducing defensiveness. Additionally, ensuring both of you have equal time to share can create a sense of balance. How does that resonate with you?

User: That resonates well. I want to make sure we’re both heard.

Consultant: That’s a vital aspect of communication. How about we recap and set a plan for your next steps after today’s session?

User: Sure! I’d like to focus on setting up these discussion times and using “I” statements.

Consultant: Sounds like a solid plan! How do you feel about putting this into practice in the coming week?

User: I feel hopeful. I really want this to work. 

Consultant: That's great to hear! Remember, it's a journey, and there might be ups and downs. Be gentle with yourselves. 

User: Thank you. I’ll keep that in mind. I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You're welcome! If any obstacles arise, we can address them together. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next time.

User: Me too! Thanks again for your help.

Consultant: Take care, Zhang. You’re making significant strides, and I’m here to support you. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm really glad you're here today. It sounds like you've been going through a tough time with the communication issues in your marriage. How are you feeling about that right now?

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty lost and frustrated lately. My wife and I can't seem to agree on our future plans, and it makes me feel helpless. I genuinely want to improve our relationship, but I don't know how.

Consultant: I can see how this situation would leave you feeling stuck and frustrated. It’s great that you have the desire to work on your relationship. Can you tell me more about the specific disagreements you and your wife have been facing?

User: Yeah, well... I want us to focus on stabilizing our lives and maybe starting a business together. But she seems more concerned about moving on from our past. It's like we're not on the same page at all.

Consultant: That’s understandable. You have a vision for stability and growth, while she might be focused on healing from past experiences. This divergence can understandably create tension. Have there been any specific conversations that escalated these differences?

User: Yes, last week we had a heated discussion about finances. I feel like we need to plan for our future, but she kept bringing up our past mistakes. It felt like she didn't even want to consider my ideas.

Consultant: It sounds like that discussion really highlighted the gap in your perspectives. When you feel like your ideas aren't being considered, it can be really disheartening. How do you usually express your thoughts and feelings during these conversations?

User: I try to explain my points clearly, but sometimes I end up raising my voice out of frustration. I don't want to, but I just feel so overwhelmed when she doesn't seem to listen.

Consultant: It's valid to feel overwhelmed, especially when emotions run high. Raising your voice often indicates a buildup of stress. We can work on some communication techniques that help both of you express yourselves while ensuring you feel heard. Would you be open to exploring some of those strategies?

User: Sure, that sounds helpful. I want her to feel heard too, but I don't know how to do that effectively.

Consultant: A great first step is practicing active listening. This means really paying attention to what your wife says without planning your response while she’s speaking. How do you think you could implement that during a conversation?

User: I guess I could try to focus on her words more and maybe repeat back what I heard to confirm my understanding before sharing my own thoughts.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic approach, Zhang! Confirming your understanding can help bridge the gap. Additionally, using "I" statements instead of "you" statements can prevent the conversation from feeling accusatory. For example, saying "I feel frustrated when..." instead of "You never listen..." How does that sound to you?

User: I see how that can change the tone of the conversation. I often feel defensive when she says something like that. So, if I frame it differently, it might help us connect better.

Consultant: Exactly! Framing it in a way that reflects your feelings can create a more open environment for dialogue. Let’s practice that. Can you think of something you’d like to express to her and reframe it using "I" statements?

User: Okay... I want to tell her that I feel anxious when we talk about the future, but I'm scared it'll come across as blaming her for not understanding me.

Consultant: That’s a great start! You could say something like, "I feel anxious when we discuss the future, and it sometimes feels overwhelming for me." Notice how this focuses on your feelings rather than placing blame. Envision how she might respond to that.

User: I think she might be more receptive to that. It doesn’t accuse her of anything. I just hope she understands where I’m coming from.

Consultant: Absolutely, that’s the goal! Acknowledging your feelings openly can foster mutual understanding. How about we brainstorm some follow-up questions you can ask her after expressing this?

User: Maybe I could ask her how she feels about our future plans after I share my thoughts, or what she thinks about my feelings of anxiety.

Consultant: Yes, those are excellent questions! They invite her to share her perspective, which is key in fostering dialogue. It's all about creating a space for both of you to express yourselves. How are you feeling about these strategies now?

User: I feel more hopeful, actually. These approaches seem attainable, and I like how they focus on communication rather than conflict.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Zhang! Remember, improving communication is a process, and it takes time. As you practice these techniques, you'll likely find that your discussions become more constructive. What do you think would be a good next step for you in this process?

User: I think I’ll try this approach in our next conversation about future plans. I’ll focus on expressing my feelings first and practicing active listening.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Checking in with yourself and staying calm will also help. How do you feel about the progress you've made today towards improving your relationship?

User: I feel like I have some useful tools now. It's encouraging to know there's a way to talk about these issues without them blowing up.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! It’s about building trust and creating an environment where both of you feel safe to share. As a reminder, practice makes perfect, and it’s okay if it feels awkward at first. How do you envision maintaining this progress moving forward?

User: I’ll try to remind myself of these techniques every time we're in a tough conversation. And if it works, I’m sure she’ll notice the positive change.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reinforcing those positive experiences can further build trust over time. I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress at our next session. Remember, you’ve got the potential to create a more collaborative relationship. How are you feeling as we wrap up today’s session?

User: I feel good! I’m leaving with a plan, and I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that, Zhang! You've taken important steps toward improving your communication and rebuilding trust in your relationship. Remember, I'm here for you whenever you need further support. Take care until next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're back for this session. It seems like you're feeling positive about your relationship and future plans. How can I assist you today?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel hopeful after improving communication with my wife. We’ve been discussing our future together and it seemed to bring us closer.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Improved communication can really enhance trust in a relationship. Can you share what specific changes you've noticed in your relationship since working on communication strategies?

User: Well, we are better at expressing our feelings and listening to each other. It feels like we’re on the same team now, rather than against each other.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve made significant progress in collaboration. That's a great foundation. How do you envision this teamwork helping you both in planning for your future?

User: I think it helps us set mutual goals and support each other in achieving them. We’re starting to talk about things like finances and our life together more openly.

Consultant: That’s a positive step! Setting mutual goals is crucial in reinforcing your partnership. Have you been able to identify any specific short-term or long-term goals together?

User: Yes, we’re discussing saving for a house and possibly starting a family in the next few years. 

Consultant: Those are important goals. It sounds like you’re planning for a stable future. How do you feel about dividing responsibilities or roles in achieving these goals?

User: I think we need to clarify our roles. We both have different strengths, but we sometimes end up overlapping or avoiding discussing who does what.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize the importance of clarifying roles. This can help prevent misunderstandings. Can you think of a way to communicate these roles without it feeling confrontational?

User: Maybe we can sit down and list our strengths and responsibilities to see where they fit best. 

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach! Listing strengths can help you both understand each other better and assign roles naturally. Would you like to outline some steps on how to start this discussion?

User: Sure! I think we could start by setting aside some time this weekend to sit down together and share our thoughts. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! Setting aside dedicated time can make the conversation feel more intentional. What emotions do you anticipate experiencing during this discussion?

User: I hope to feel calm and open, but I can be a bit anxious about bringing up differences. 

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel anxious, especially when discussing sensitive topics. Have you considered any strategies to manage that anxiety before starting the conversation?

User: I think taking deep breaths and reminding myself that we’re on the same team could help. 

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies to manage anxiety. Deep breathing can help you stay centered, and reminding yourself of the mutual goal reinforces the teamwork aspect. How confident do you feel moving forward with this conversation?

User: I feel quite confident now that I have that in mind. 

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Confidence will surely set a positive tone for your discussion. Can you think of any potential challenges that may arise during your talk, and how you might address them?

User: I’m worried we might get defensive if we don’t agree on responsibilities, but I’ll try to keep the conversation focused on finding solutions.

Consultant: Being proactive about potential defensiveness is wise. Keeping the focus on solutions will help maintain a productive conversation. Would it be helpful to agree on a signal to pause if things get heated?

User: Yes, I think that’s a good idea! We can use a phrase like "let’s take a step back" if we start to feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s a solid strategy! Agreeing on a phrase can provide a safe space to regroup. How do you feel about the overall progress you and your wife have made so far?

User: I feel really proud of what we've accomplished. Our communication is stronger, and I believe we’re genuinely committed to each other’s happiness.

Consultant: That’s an admirable realization! Recognizing your commitment is very empowering. What do you think is the most significant change in your relationship due to these efforts?

User: I think it’s the trust we’ve built; it allows us to be more vulnerable with each other.

Consultant: Trust is indeed the cornerstone of any strong relationship. It sounds like you're cultivating a nurturing environment. How do you plan to maintain this momentum moving forward?

User: I guess by continuing to communicate openly and regularly checking in about our goals. 

Consultant: Regular check-ins will certainly help you both stay aligned. It might also be helpful to celebrate small achievements along the way. How do you feel about that idea?

User: I love it! Celebrating even small milestones could keep our motivation high.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! Celebrating victories can reinforce positive behaviors. As we wrap up today’s session, how do you feel about the strategies and steps we’ve discussed?

User: I feel excited and ready to put these ideas into action, especially the role discussion.

Consultant: I'm thrilled to hear that! It sounds like you're on a promising path. Remember that it’s okay to take things step by step. If challenges arise, you can always revisit our strategies. If you need to talk again in the future, I'm here for you.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. I’m looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: You're welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care, and good luck with your conversation this weekend!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good. My wife and I have been making progress, and it's nice to feel a sense of accomplishment. We're enjoying life more and trying to maintain the improvements we've made.

Consultant: That sounds great! It’s wonderful to hear that you both are enjoying life and feeling more accomplished. Can you tell me a bit more about the specific changes you've noticed?

User: Sure! We’ve started spending more quality time together, like going for walks and cooking meals. We even had a game night! It feels like we're really building our lives again.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Engaging in enjoyable activities is so important for your well-being. How does it feel to be able to do these things together now?

User: It feels amazing. We used to be trapped in a negative cycle, but now it's like a weight has been lifted. I feel more connected to her, and we are both more optimistic about our future.

Consultant: It's heartwarming to hear how positively your relationship is flourishing. With this newfound connection, what are some strategies you both think might help you maintain this positive trajectory?

User: I think continuing to set small goals together will help. Plus, being open about how we’re feeling can prevent misunderstandings.

Consultant: Setting small goals is a great approach! It can help create a sense of direction without overwhelming yourselves. Can you share some examples of the small goals you might set?

User: Maybe planning our week each Sunday and seeing what small activities we can do together. Even little things like trying a new recipe could be fun.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! It seems like creating a structure will help you both stay engaged. How do you feel about sharing your feelings with each other when something is bothering you?

User: I think it's important, but sometimes it can be awkward. We’ve been working on it, though. I guess it's about finding the right moment.

Consultant: Absolutely, timing can make a big difference. Maybe you could establish a routine where you both check in with each other regularly. How does that sound to you?

User: That could work! A quick chat before bed or during dinner might make it easier to talk about our feelings.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical plan. Regular check-ins could create a safe space for both of you to express any concerns. Are there any specific concerns you feel you might need to discuss in the future?

User: I worry about slipping back into old habits. Although everything feels great now, I’m still cautious.

Consultant: It's completely natural to have those concerns, especially given your past experiences. What do you think could help you both prevent that from happening?

User: Maybe if we could keep each other accountable. Like, if one of us starts feeling down or tempted, the other could step in and help out.

Consultant: Accountability can be a powerful tool! Having each other’s support can reinforce your commitment to staying positive. Are there any other resources or strategies you’ve found helpful?

User: We've been reading some self-help books, and they provide great insights. I think we could also look into community groups or activities to keep us engaged.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Connecting with others who share similar experiences can provide additional support and motivation. How do you feel about exploring new community activities together?

User: I’m excited about that! It’s a great way to meet new people and reinforce the positive changes we’re making.

Consultant: It definitely is! It seems like you both are on a path filled with potential. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize the progress you’ve made and the strategies you want to implement moving forward.

User: Sure! We discussed maintaining communication, setting small goals, and exploring community activities as ways to support our growth.

Consultant: Exactly! You both have accomplished so much already, and it’s important to celebrate that. Do you feel more confident in your ability to manage your progress now?

User: Yes, I do! I feel like we have a solid plan to keep moving forward together.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Zhang. It’s important to acknowledge your achievements and stay proactive. This will be our last session for now. Should you ever feel the need for support again, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you so much for your guidance. It’s been really helpful!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Best of luck on your journey ahead, and take care of each other.
