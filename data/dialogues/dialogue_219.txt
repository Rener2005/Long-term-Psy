Consultant: Hello, Xiaomei! I’m glad to see you today. I want to start by acknowledging how difficult things have been for you recently. Can you share more about how you’re feeling right now?

User: Hi. I feel frustrated and lost. I’ve been struggling with negative thoughts about myself. It feels like I can’t escape from this darkness that surrounds me. 

Consultant: It sounds incredibly overwhelming. You mentioned feeling like you're surrounded by darkness—what do you think contributes to those negative thoughts about yourself?

User: I think it's because I have failed my exams and I feel embarrassed about not being able to handle the pressure. I keep thinking that I’m letting everyone down, especially my family.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel this way after facing such challenges. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. When you think about letting your family down, what specific thoughts come to mind?

User: I can't stop thinking that they expected me to succeed, and now I feel like I've disappointed them. I also feel like others see me as a failure.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Xiaomei. It seems like there’s a lot of pressure you’re placing on yourself based on what you believe others expect from you. How do those thoughts make you feel in your day-to-day life?

User: I feel anxious all the time. I avoid social situations, afraid of being judged or pitied. I also just want to disconnect from everyone because I feel so ashamed.

Consultant: It makes sense that you’re seeking solitude as a way to cope with those feelings. However, isolating can also reinforce those negative thoughts. Let’s work on identifying some specific thoughts that make you feel this way. Can you recall a moment recently when you felt this anxiety?

User: Yes, when I was supposed to return to school for the semester, all I could think about was seeing my friends and how they would view me after everything that happened. I just didn't want to face them.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, especially with the fear of judgment lingering. Let’s break down this thought: What if your friends have understanding and kindness instead of judgment? How likely do you think that is?

User: I guess there’s a chance they wouldn’t be as harsh as I imagine. But it's hard to believe. I just feel so trapped in my own mind.

Consultant: It can be hard to challenge those negative beliefs about how others perceive us. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about their fears regarding re-connecting with friends?

User: I would probably tell them that their friends care about them and that everyone has struggles. They shouldn’t feel ashamed.

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate response. Why do you think it's easier to be kind to others than to yourself in this situation?

User: I think it's because I know what it feels like to struggle, so I want to help others. But for myself, I just feel like I should do better. 

Consultant: Self-compassion is a powerful tool, Xiaomei. It’s okay to remind yourself that you’re also allowed to struggle and that making mistakes is part of being human. How do you feel about practicing some self-compassion in your thoughts?

User: I’m not sure how to start, but it sounds good. Maybe I could try being less harsh on myself?

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s aim to reframe some of those negative thoughts into more supportive and understanding ones. For example, instead of saying, “I’m a failure,” you might say, “I’m doing my best during a difficult time.” How does that feel to say?

User: It feels a little easier, I guess. I can see it’s not all black and white. 

Consultant: That's a great realization! Embracing that complexity can free you from the pressures of absolutes. Let's explore what specific activities could help you reconnect with your friends, starting slowly. What’s one small step you might consider taking?

User: Maybe I could text a friend and see how they’re doing. Just a low-pressure way to connect.

Consultant: That seems like an excellent idea! Reaching out in that way gives you a chance to take a step without feeling overwhelmed. What can we do to make sure you follow through with that?

User: I can set a reminder for myself and maybe plan what I want to say beforehand.

Consultant: Perfect! Planning can help ease the anxiety of reaching out. And remember, it’s okay to take things at your own pace. Once you've reached out, how about sharing with me how it went in our next session?

User: I can do that. It might be a little nerve-wracking, but it feels like a good step.

Consultant: That's the spirit, Xiaomei! Taking these small steps is essential. Let’s also work on some strategies to manage your anxiety when it arises. Are there any relaxation techniques you've heard of that might help?

User: I’ve heard about deep breathing but haven’t really tried it. 

Consultant: Deep breathing can be very effective! Would you like me to guide you through a brief breathing exercise we can practice together now?

User: Yes, I’d like that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s try this: Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four... hold it for four... and exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Let’s do that a couple of times together. Ready? Inhale... hold... exhale. 

User: Like this? It feels calming.

Consultant: Yes, exactly! Keeping that kind of practice in your toolkit can help whenever anxiety surfaces. How do you feel after that exercise?

User: I feel a little lighter, like I can breathe more easily.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Regularly practicing these techniques will help you manage anxiety more effectively. Before we wrap up today, which key takeaways do you feel have been most helpful for you?

User: Understanding my thoughts better and trying to be kinder to myself are valuable lessons. Also, taking small steps towards reconnecting with friends feels doable.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you have a good plan moving forward. Don’t forget, it's courageous to reach out and share your feelings. Remember, we’ll keep working on these strategies together. 

User: Thank you so much for today. I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaomei! I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care until then.

Consultant: Hello, Xiao! Welcome to today's session. I'm here to support you. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling a mix of emotions. While I appreciate my family's concern during my time at home, I can't shake off this overwhelming anxiety about going back to school. 

Consultant: It's understandable to feel both supported and anxious at the same time. Let's dive deeper into your feelings. Can you share what specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about returning to school?

User: When I think about it, I feel like I won't fit in anymore. I worry that my classmates have moved on and that I will struggle to catch up academically. 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really challenging. It seems you're worried about social connections and academic performance. What emotions do those thoughts bring up for you?

User: They make me feel pretty hopeless and inadequate. I often feel like I’m not good enough to be back at school.

Consultant: It’s tough to manage those feelings of inadequacy. Would you say these thoughts are automatic for you, meaning they come to mind without much reflection? 

User: Yes, definitely. As soon as I think about going back, I start spiraling into these negative thoughts.

Consultant: Let’s work together to identify those automatic thoughts more clearly. What exactly do you tell yourself when you start feeling that way?

User: I tend to think things like, "I won't be able to keep up," or "No one will want to talk to me." 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite distressing. Have you noticed if there are patterns or specific triggers that lead to these thoughts about school?

User: I notice that when I'm alone or when I see old photos of my classmates, those thoughts hit harder.

Consultant: It makes sense that solitude and reminders of the past could trigger those feelings. How do you usually cope when those negative thoughts arise?

User: I mostly try to distract myself with movies or sleeping, but it doesn't really help.

Consultant: Avoidance can be a common coping mechanism, but as you've noticed, it often doesn't resolve the underlying anxiety. Could we explore a different technique together, like challenging those negative thoughts?

User: Sure, I'm open to trying something. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s start by evaluating the validity of those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you won't fit in at school?

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence. It’s just what I feel.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! Feelings don’t always reflect reality. If a friend had similar thoughts, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably reassure them that it's normal to feel that way and that they can always reconnect.

Consultant: That's wonderful advice. You can apply the same compassion to yourself. Let’s try reframing some of those automatic thoughts into more supportive ones. How might you rephrase "I won't fit in" into something more balanced?

User: Maybe I could say, "It’s been a while, but I can reconnect and things may not be as bad as I fear."

Consultant: Exactly! That sounds much healthier and realistic. Let’s practice that new thought whenever the anxiety rises. How do you feel about trying that?

User: I feel a bit hopeful about it. 

Consultant: That’s a great start! Now, as we plan for your return to school, could we discuss some gradual steps you could take to face this anxiety?

User: Yes, I think taking small steps sounds good.

Consultant: For instance, you might start by reaching out to just one friend before you go back to school. How does that sound?

User: That sounds less intimidating. Maybe I can text someone to catch up?

Consultant: Perfect! Connecting with just one person can be a great way to ease back into the social environment. Let’s also think about some activities you enjoy to incorporate into your routine.

User: I love reading and drawing. I could start doing those things more often.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful. Engaging in activities you enjoy will help boost your mood and build your confidence. Would you like to set some specific goals around these activities?

User: Yes, I could aim to read for 30 minutes each day and spend some time drawing.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! It sounds achievable and enjoyable. As we summarize today’s session, what do you feel has been your biggest takeaway?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is recognizing that my thoughts don’t always reflect reality and learning to challenge them.

Consultant: That’s an essential realization. We also talked about proactive steps to reconnect and engage in enjoyable activities. How can you remind yourself to use those new strategies?

User: I can write them down and keep them visible, maybe on my desk or phone.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Keeping reminders close by will be helpful. Remember, it's perfectly normal to feel nervous about returning, but with each small step, you're making progress. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome. I'm proud of the steps you're taking. If you ever need further support, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care, Xiao!

User: Take care! I’ll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hi, I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I feel like I'm making some progress with communicating with my family, but I still feel really lonely sometimes. Social situations still make me nervous.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're making some effort to improve communication with your family. Those feelings of loneliness and nervousness in social situations can be really challenging. Can you share a bit more about a recent social event that made you feel this way?

User: Sure, I went to a family gathering last week. I tried to participate more in conversations, but I still felt awkward and disconnected. It was like I was there, but not really there, if that makes sense.

Consultant: That makes perfect sense. It sounds like even though you were physically present, emotionally you felt a bit detached. What were some specific thoughts that crossed your mind during that gathering?

User: I kept thinking that people were judging me or that I wouldn’t have anything interesting to say. It made me want to just fade into the background.

Consultant: Those thoughts can definitely amplify feelings of anxiety. Let's explore them a little. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that people were judging you? Have any of them actually expressed that?

User: No, actually. No one said anything negative. I guess it’s just my own insecurities talking.

Consultant: It's understandable to have those insecurities. A lot of people struggle with similar thoughts. If a friend shared those feelings with you, what would you say to help them see things differently?

User: I would probably tell them that their worth isn’t determined by what others think and that it’s okay to just be themselves.

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate perspective! How can we apply that understanding to your own thoughts in those situations? What alternative thought could you cultivate instead of feeling judged?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone has their insecurities, and that it’s fine if I don’t always know what to say. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing that everyone has their own challenges can be freeing. It could help to shift your focus to being present in the moment rather than worrying about others’ perceptions. Moving forward, how might you practice this during your next social interaction?

User: I could remind myself to just enjoy the conversations and focus on listening rather than how I’m being perceived.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful approach! Listening is such a valuable skill. It creates space for genuine connection. What activities do you enjoy that could help you practice engaging with others?

User: I love cooking and I was thinking about maybe inviting a couple of friends over to cook together.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Cooking together can foster a relaxed atmosphere, and it gives you something to focus on, which might ease some of that anxiety. How do you feel about planning that?

User: I feel a bit excited but also nervous. What if it doesn’t go well?

Consultant: It’s normal to feel nervous, especially when trying something new. Remember, the goal is to have fun and connect, not to be perfect. If something doesn’t go as planned, how could you reassure yourself in that moment?

User: I could tell myself that it’s okay to make mistakes, and that the important part is that we’re all together.

Consultant: Exactly! Keeping the focus on connection rather than perfection can really help alleviate some of the pressure. How do you think your feelings of loneliness might shift as you continue to practice more open communication with others?

User: Maybe I would start to feel more included and less isolated. I hope that by being more open, I can also strengthen those relationships.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! Being open can build stronger connections and may alleviate some of that loneliness you feel. Let’s talk about setting a small goal for your next gathering. What’s one step you can take to make it happen?

User: I think I could send out the invitation this weekend! 

Consultant: That sounds great! Sending out the invitation is a proactive step towards fostering connection. How do you feel about that commitment?

User: I feel good about it. It makes it seem more real and I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You’re actively creating opportunities for connection, which is a positive change. As we near the end of our session, let’s reflect on what you’ve learned today. What stands out to you the most?

User: I’ve realized that my worries about being judged are mostly in my head. I also learned that focusing on being present can really help.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! Reinforcing that understanding can help you in future social situations. Lastly, as we wrap up, what strategies do you think you can use going forward to maintain openness in your expression while managing potential social pressures?

User: I can remind myself to focus on enjoying the moment and to practice self-compassion if I feel anxious.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! You’ve made great strides today. You’re recognizing the importance of self-compassion, and I believe those strategies will help you significantly in your social interactions. If you ever need to revisit these strategies or talk about your progress, I’m here for you.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help today. I feel more hopeful about moving forward.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad you feel hopeful, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to be more open with my family, but I still feel a bit guarded. It's like I want to express myself, but I’m not sure how to do it comfortably.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're working on being more open. Feeling guarded is completely normal, especially when you're exploring new ways to express yourself. Can you tell me more about what specific situations make you feel this way within your family?

User: Well, during the last family gathering, I wanted to share some of my thoughts, but I hesitated. I worry about how they'll react or if they'll really understand me.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. It sounds like you're concerned about their reactions, which is understandable when trying to share your true self. What do you think could help you feel more secure in expressing those thoughts?

User: Maybe if I knew how they might respond positively, I’d feel more comfortable. I’d love to hear their support, but it’s hard to know if I should take that risk.

Consultant: Seeking support and positive feedback from your family is a valid desire. It might be helpful to think about small ways to express yourself, where the risk feels lower. Can you think of a smaller topic or idea that you might share with them?

User: I could talk about my favorite hobbies. That feels safer than sharing my deeper feelings.

Consultant: That's a wonderful start! Discussing hobbies could open the door to a more relaxed conversation. How do you think your family might respond to that?

User: I think they would be interested. They usually like hearing about what I'm passionate about, but I still worry about steering the conversation to something deeper afterward.

Consultant: It’s important to take things at your own pace. Starting with hobbies could build your confidence. After sharing, you might find that it leads to more personal topics naturally. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds good! I like the idea of gradually moving to deeper subjects. I just hope I won't feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: That's a valid concern. Remember, you can always gauge your comfort level. If you start to feel overwhelmed, it's okay to pause or redirect the conversation. Would it help you to set a small goal for your next family gathering?

User: Yes, I think having a small goal would help. Maybe I could aim to share at least one hobby and see how it goes?

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Setting a simple target like that will allow you to test the waters without feeling too much pressure. How will you prepare for that conversation?

User: I think I’ll plan what I want to say about my hobbies beforehand and practice it a bit. That might help me feel more confident.

Consultant: Practicing can definitely make a difference! It’s a good way to reduce anxiety about unexpected reactions. How do you feel about sharing your practice with me now?

User: Sure! I can share about my interest in painting. I’ve been doing it a lot lately.

Consultant: Painting sounds amazing! What aspects of painting do you enjoy the most?

User: I love the way it helps me express my emotions. It's like a relief whenever I pick up a brush and let my feelings flow.

Consultant: That's beautiful, Xiao! Creating art can be such a therapeutic outlet. By sharing this with your family, you might also inspire them to engage with your feelings more deeply. How does that make you feel?

User: It makes me feel a bit more excited to share! I didn’t think about it that way—that it could inspire them to connect with me.

Consultant: Absolutely, sharing your passion can spark meaningful conversations! It's also a way for them to see a different side of you. Do you think they would enjoy hearing your story about how painting helps you relax?

User: I think they would! They usually enjoy hearing my experiences. I feel more optimistic about it now.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to see you feeling optimistic! Remember, this process of self-expression is a journey. Each small step contributes to your comfort and confidence. How do you want to continue this exploration after our session today?

User: I will definitely share my hobby at the next gathering. I’d like to write down some of my thoughts about painting and what it means to me, just in case I get nervous.

Consultant: Writing things down is an excellent strategy! It gives you a reference to turn to if you feel uncertain. Before we wrap up today, is there anything else you want to discuss regarding your family interactions or your self-expression?

User: I think I’m good for now! I feel more prepared and less anxious about the next gathering.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! You’ve made significant progress today, and I believe this approach will help you delve deeper into expressing yourself. Remember, you're not alone in this process. If you need support, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance. Speaking with you helps me a lot.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xiao! It’s truly my pleasure to assist you. I look forward to hearing how your family gathering goes next time!
###################
Consultant: Hi there! I'm really glad you could come today. How have you been feeling lately with your blogging and the process of self-expression?

User: Hi! I've been feeling somewhat peaceful since I started writing my blog. It allows me to express my thoughts and share my journey. But I also worry about going back to school. It feels like a big step.

Consultant: It's great to hear that writing has brought you some peace. It seems like expressing yourself through your blog is important for you. When you think about going back to school, what specific thoughts or feelings come up for you?

User: I mostly feel anxious about it. I'm afraid I won’t be able to keep up with my studies like before. I worry that my mental state won’t handle the pressure.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Transitioning back to school after a break can be daunting. Can you share a bit more about what you envision your return to school looking like? 

User: I hope that I can manage my time better and find a balance between studying and taking care of my mental health. 

Consultant: Finding that balance is essential. What strategies do you think you might use to help maintain your mental health while studying?

User: I think setting realistic goals for each study session could help, as well as taking regular breaks. I also want to keep writing in my blog because it really helps me process my thoughts.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent strategies! Writing can serve as a supportive outlet for you. Have there been any specific moments while writing your blog that made you realize its value in your healing journey?

User: Yes, when I share my struggles and see that others relate, I feel less alone. It's comforting to know that I'm not the only one going through such tough times.

Consultant: That connection is powerful. It seems like your blog not only serves as an outlet but also fosters a sense of community. How does this realization change your perspective on returning to school?

User: It makes me feel a bit more hopeful. If I can manage my writing and connect with others, maybe I can find a similar sense of support at school.

Consultant: Absolutely! Leverage that support system you’ve built through your blog. As you think about returning, what are some specific goals you would like to set for your academic journey?

User: I want to aim for completing my assignments on time and participating in class. I want to stay engaged, but I also want to give myself grace if things become overwhelming.

Consultant: Setting those goals is a fantastic approach. Giving yourself grace aligns well with self-care. How do you think you can remind yourself to practice this self-compassion during potentially stressful times?

User: I could write reminders in my planner to check in with myself and take breaks when I need them. Maybe even journal specifically about my self-compassion.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Checking in with yourself is crucial. Have you thought about how you might handle any setbacks while returning to school?

User: I guess if I do struggle, I could reach out to friends or my professors for help. I need to remember that it's okay to ask for support.

Consultant: Yes, seeking support is a sign of strength, and it’s important for you to build that network. What do you feel might be the biggest challenge for you in maintaining this mindset?

User: I think my biggest challenge will be the fear of not meeting my expectations or failing. 

Consultant: It’s natural to feel that way. Let's look at that fear. Can you identify any thoughts that may be magnifying your sense of pressure concerning expectations and failure?

User: I often think that if I don't succeed, I’ll disappoint myself and others, especially my family.

Consultant: That’s a heavy burden to carry. How realistic do you think those expectations are? Would you say they are aligned with your current situation and goals?

User: I guess they are a bit unrealistic, especially considering what I’ve been through recently. I need to remind myself that my worth isn't solely measured by academic success.

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing that your worth goes beyond academic performance is crucial. If a friend were in your position, what would you say to them about their feelings and expectations?

User: I'd tell them that it’s okay to take things one step at a time and to be kind to themselves. They shouldn’t carry the weight of expectations alone.

Consultant: Wonderful advice! You deserve that same kindness. Going forward, how might you incorporate this mindset into your everyday life and studies?

User: I will challenge myself to focus on progress over perfection and remind myself that it’s more important to learn than to just succeed.

Consultant: That’s an excellent outlook! Progress over perfection often leads to deeper learning and personal growth. As we wrap up today, what are the key takeaways that you’d like to focus on as you prepare for this next chapter?

User: I want to prioritize self-compassion, set realistic goals, and keep writing. I also want to remind myself that I can always ask for help when I need it.

Consultant: Those are fantastic points to focus on. Thank you for sharing today. Remember, approaching school as a new beginning can be exciting. I'm confident that you have the tools to navigate this journey. If you ever need guidance, I'm here for you. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your support and guidance. I feel much better about going back now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to hear that. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaomei! Welcome back to our session. I'm really glad to see you. How are you feeling today about your plans to return to school?

User: Hi! Thanks for having me. I'm feeling pretty hopeful, actually. I can't say I'm completely free of concerns, but I'm not as anxious as before about going back to school.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive shift! It's great to hear that you're feeling hopeful. Can you tell me more about what made you feel less anxious about returning?

User: Well, I’ve been writing a lot in my blog about my experiences and the changes I’ve gone through. Speaking with friends has also helped me see things in a new light.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you’ve found writing and communication to be beneficial. Reflecting on your experiences can be a powerful tool for personal growth. What specific changes have you noticed in yourself through this process?

User: I’ve become more aware of my thoughts and feelings. I've learned to challenge some of my negative beliefs, like thinking I would never manage to keep up with my studies.

Consultant: That's an important realization. Challenging negative beliefs can lead to a healthier mindset. Are there any specific beliefs or thoughts that you want to address as you plan your return to school?

User: Yes, I tend to think that if I struggle even a little, it means I’m failing. I really want to overcome that mindset.

Consultant: Understanding that struggle is a natural part of the learning process is crucial. What if we explored ways to view difficulties as opportunities for growth instead of failures?

User: That sounds helpful. I guess it would be better to think of them more like stepping stones, rather than setbacks.

Consultant: Exactly! Stepping stones imply progress. How might you remind yourself of this perspective when challenges arise in your studies?

User: Maybe I could create a little reminder or mantra that I can keep visible at my study space. Something like, “Growth comes from challenges.”

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Visual reminders can be quite effective. As you prepare to return, what practical steps can you take to ensure you feel supported during your transition?

User: I think I need to establish a routine before I actually go back to school. Starting with small tasks will help me feel more organized, I believe.

Consultant: A routine can definitely give you a sense of structure and control. What kinds of small tasks are you thinking about including in your routine?

User: I could start by setting aside a specific time each day to review some study materials or even just organize my notes. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Setting specific times for study can help you build a rhythm. Are there any potential challenges you foresee that might disrupt this routine?

User: I worry that if I have a bad day or feel overwhelmed, I might just give up on my plan altogether.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have concerns about that. What strategies might you implement to help you stay on track during those tougher days?

User: I suppose I could have a backup plan, like taking a break if I’m feeling overwhelmed but still setting a small task to complete afterward, even if it’s minor.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Allowing for breaks while challenging yourself to do something manageable can help maintain balance. How does that make you feel about facing difficult days in the future?

User: I feel more empowered knowing that I can give myself grace while also holding myself accountable.

Consultant: Empowerment is key. It's about finding that balance. As we reflect on your progress, what do you consider your biggest achievement in this journey so far?

User: I think my biggest achievement is recognizing my own growth and actually wanting to return to school. It feels like a big step forward.

Consultant: That’s a significant milestone! Recognizing your growth is crucial, and your desire to return to school shows your resilience. Moving forward, how can you ensure that you maintain this positivity?

User: I think I should keep writing and expressing my thoughts, plus having regular check-ins with friends for support.

Consultant: Keeping those connections open and expressing your feelings are excellent strategies. As we prepare to conclude our session, what are your thoughts on everything we discussed today?

User: I feel really good about everything! I have specific action steps I can take instead of just worries swirling in my head. Thank you!

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’ve made wonderful progress today. Remember, it’s important to celebrate these successes. If you ever feel overwhelmed, you can always refer back to the strategies we discussed. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your journey when you return!

User: Thank you! I will definitely keep in touch and let you know how things go.
