Consultant: Hello, Xiaolin! I'm glad you're here today. Let's start by discussing how you've been feeling lately. What has been on your mind?

User: Hi. I’ve been really stressed out with graduation coming up. I keep questioning whether I’ll be able to find a job and if I’m even ready for it. It makes me feel really anxious.

Consultant: I see. You're feeling a lot of pressure and uncertainty about your future, which is completely understandable. Can you tell me a bit more about what specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about graduating and job searching?

User: I often think that I might not be good enough to get a job, and I keep comparing myself to my peers who seem more confident and accomplished. It makes me feel really down.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of negative self-talk and comparisons. When you think these thoughts, how do they affect your feelings and motivation to complete your studies?

User: Whenever I think I’m not good enough, I just get overwhelmed and don’t want to study at all. It’s like I freeze up, and I keep putting off my assignments.

Consultant: It sounds like this fear of inadequacy is really impacting your ability to focus on your studies. Let's explore that. What evidence do you have that you aren’t good enough? Can you think of any specific examples that contradict that belief?

User: Well, I did well in my exams last semester, and I have been involved in projects at school. But those moments feel so distant compared to how I feel now.

Consultant: Those achievements are important! It's easy to forget your successes when you're feeling overwhelmed. What if we tried to challenge that negative thought by focusing on your accomplishments instead? How might you reframe your thinking about your capabilities?

User: Maybe I could think that I've actually done well before, and I shouldn’t be so hard on myself. But it’s hard to shift my mindset.

Consultant: That's a great recognition! It is challenging, but practice can help. Let’s start by keeping a journal of these positive experiences and times when you felt confident. How do you feel about trying that?

User: That sounds like it could help. I’d be willing to give it a try. 

Consultant: Wonderful! This is a step towards recognizing your strengths. Reflecting on these moments can gradually shift your focus. What would it feel like for you to write down at least one positive experience each day?

User: I think it could boost my confidence a bit, but I’m still worried about what comes next after school.

Consultant: It's normal to feel uncertain about your next steps. Let's break that down. What are some specific fears you have about entering the workforce? 

User: I’m afraid I won’t find a position that matches my skills. Or I’ll get rejected if I apply for jobs. 

Consultant: Those concerns are really valid, and many people share similar feelings. Let’s take a look at the fear of rejection. What might happen if you do apply and face some rejections?

User: I guess I’d feel embarrassed and question my abilities even more.

Consultant: Understandable. However, rejection is often a part of the process, and it doesn’t define your worth. How would you support a friend going through similar feelings? 

User: I’d tell them to keep trying and that it’s okay to face setbacks.

Consultant: Exactly! You already know how to be supportive. Now, how can you apply that same kindness towards yourself during this process? 

User: I suppose I should treat myself with more compassion and remind myself that it's a learning experience.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Being kind to yourself can greatly reduce stress. What if we also set some small, achievable goals for your job search process, so you feel more in control?

User: That sounds like a good idea. I think setting smaller goals might make me less anxious about the whole thing.

Consultant: Let's brainstorm some small, concrete steps you can take towards your job search. What’s one thing you’d feel comfortable starting with?

User: Maybe updating my resume and looking for potential positions would be a good first step.

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a tangible goal. Aim to finish updating your resume this week and maybe dedicate some time to searching for job postings. How does that feel?

User: It feels manageable. I think I can handle that.

Consultant: Great! By taking these manageable steps, you’re gradually building your confidence. There’s more room for growth in this process too. How else can we prepare you to handle any challenges along the way?

User: If I face rejection, maybe I can remind myself of my past achievements and treat it as a chance to learn.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remembering your achievements and framing rejections as learning opportunities will help you stay resilient. Let's also schedule follow-ups to discuss your progress. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I feel a bit more hopeful about this process now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiaolin. Remember, progress can take time, and it’s okay to have ups and downs. Let’s continue to explore these strategies together in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to our next meeting and to see how I can apply what we discussed today.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Keep up with those journals and the small steps we talked about. You’re doing great, and I believe in your ability to manage these challenges. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaolin! It's nice to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling quite anxious again. I tried to make a study plan, but I keep doubting myself and find it hard to stick to it. It's really frustrating.

Consultant: I hear that you're experiencing frustration and anxiety around your study plan. Can you tell me more about what makes you doubt yourself when trying to stick to your goals?

User: I think it’s mostly because I worry that I’ll fail again. Every time I try to start, those negative thoughts creep in, telling me I’m not capable of following through.

Consultant: It sounds like those negative thoughts are quite powerful for you. What specific thoughts come to mind when you start feeling that way?

User: I often think, “I won’t be able to do this,” or “I’m just wasting my time.” It makes me want to give up before I even start.

Consultant: I understand. Those thoughts can really undermine your confidence. Can we explore how those thoughts make you feel in the moment? What emotions do they bring up for you?

User: They make me feel really anxious and a bit hopeless. I find it hard to concentrate on anything when I'm feeling this way.

Consultant: It’s understandably distressing to feel that way. Have you noticed any patterns when you feel this anxiety about your planning and studies?

User: Yes, it usually happens when I sit down to work, and suddenly, I just feel overwhelmed and unfocused.

Consultant: That feeling of being overwhelmed can be a major barrier. If we could break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable steps, do you think that might help reduce that feeling of overwhelm?

User: Maybe, but I’m not sure if I’ll be able to complete even small tasks. What if I can’t do that either?

Consultant: It’s completely normal to worry about that. Let's take a step back—can you remember a time when you successfully completed a small task? How did that feel for you?

User: I do remember finishing a small project a while back. It felt good, actually. But it seems so long ago now.

Consultant: That’s a great memory to hold onto! Feeling that sense of accomplishment, no matter how small, can be a strong motivator. What if we set a tiny goal for this week that could help you regain that sense of achievement?

User: I think setting a small goal could help. But what if I can't accomplish even that?

Consultant: It's possible to feel nervous about setting goals, but remember, the goal should be very small and achievable. It could be something like studying for just 15 minutes a day. Do you think that’s something you could try?

User: Yes, I could probably manage that. It sounds less intimidating.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Starting small can help build your confidence over time. After you accomplish this goal, we can talk about how it felt and what it might mean for you moving forward.

User: Okay. I’ll try to study for 15 minutes daily. I hope it goes well.

Consultant: Great, I’m proud of you for taking this step! Let’s also think about how you can reward yourself after achieving this goal. What would feel like a nice reward for you?

User: I like the idea of treating myself to a snack I enjoy after I finish studying.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely reward! Giving yourself something to look forward to can significantly motivate you. How about we also plan to check in on how you felt after trying this?

User: Yes, that would be helpful. I guess it’ll give me a chance to talk about how it went.

Consultant: Absolutely! I’m here to support you through this process. Let's also discuss how to manage any negative thoughts that arise when you attempt to study. Would it be okay to have some strategies in place for that?

User: Sure, having some strategies would definitely help.

Consultant: One technique we can use is to challenge those thoughts—when you notice a negative thought like, “I won’t be able to do this,” try asking yourself, “What evidence do I have that this is true?” or “Can I think of a time when I succeeded?”

User: That sounds like it might help. I can try to reason with myself like that.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Remember, it’s about being kind to yourself, too. It’s okay to have doubts, but challenging them will help you regain some of that confidence. You’re doing very well so far!

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful now. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, each step you take, no matter how small, is a step forward. You have the ability to work through this. 

User: I’ll keep that in mind. I just need to take it one step at a time.

Consultant: Exactly! And I believe you have what it takes. Let’s plan to touch base again next week to discuss how it went and any feelings that come up. You're not alone in this!

User: Thanks, I appreciate it! I’ll do my best with the small goal and look forward to our next chat.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaolin. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress. Take care, and remember to be gentle with yourself as you move forward.

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Lin! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I've been a bit low. I tried to speak up in class to boost my confidence, but I felt tense and ended up making mistakes. Now, I doubt myself even more.

Consultant: I can sense how frustrating that must feel for you, especially when you put in the effort but don’t see the results you hoped for. Can you describe what thoughts ran through your mind when you felt you made those mistakes?

User: I thought everyone must think I'm incompetent. It's like I can't shake off the feeling that I completely failed.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. Let’s explore these thoughts together. When you think that everyone sees you as incompetent, how does it make you feel emotionally? 

User: It makes me feel ashamed and really anxious. I start to worry that I won't be able to speak up ever again.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way after a stressful experience. Let’s take a closer look at those thoughts. Do you think they might be a bit extreme or one-sided?

User: Maybe... I mean, I know that everyone makes mistakes, but at that moment, it felt like the end of the world.

Consultant: It’s common for us to magnify our failures in our minds. Can you think of any evidence that suggests you're not incompetent, perhaps from past successes or positive feedback you've received?

User: Well, I did give a presentation last month, and the professor said I did well. But I sort of dismissed it because of the mistake in class.

Consultant: That’s a valid point! You had a success recently, and it’s important to recognize that. If a friend came to you expressing the same doubts after a failure, what advice would you give them?

User: I’d probably tell them not to be too hard on themselves and to keep trying.

Consultant: Exactly! You can apply that same kindness to yourself. Let’s think about how we can gradually expose you to social situations to build up your confidence. What would be a relatively easy step you could take towards speaking in class again?

User: Maybe I could start by sharing my thoughts with friends in smaller groups first?

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Focusing on smaller groups can help ease the anxiety. How about we set a goal for you to share at least one idea with your friends in the coming week? 

User: I can do that! I think that will help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Fantastic! After you try it, we’ll reflect on the experience together. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel a bit excited but also still nervous. 

Consultant: That’s perfectly normal! Excitement and nerves often go hand-in-hand, especially when trying something new. Let’s remind ourselves that every small step counts. How about you keep a journal of how you feel before and after this sharing? 

User: That sounds helpful! I can write down my thoughts and how I felt during it.

Consultant: Great idea! Writing can provide clarity and reinforce your progress. I encourage you to also note any positive feedback you receive. It’ll help shift your focus from the negatives. How do you feel about the idea of starting this journal?

User: I think that would really help me keep track of my progress, and remind me of the good moments!

Consultant: Absolutely! It can be empowering to reflect on those positive moments. When we meet next time, we can discuss what you wrote and how it went for you. Is there anything else on your mind today? 

User: I’m just nervous about how my friends will react. 

Consultant: That’s understandable. Getting feedback from others can feel vulnerable. It’s important to remember that true friends will support you regardless of how you express yourself. Would it help to think of some positive scenarios that might happen when you share?

User: Yes, that could help ease my worries.

Consultant: Let’s brainstorm. What do you think your friends might say if you share something insightful or funny?

User: They might laugh or agree with me, which would make it feel more relaxed.

Consultant: Exactly! Positive interactions can reinforce your confidence. As you prepare for this, try to visualize those scenarios—seeing yourself succeeding can really help. 

User: I’ll definitely try that! It feels less daunting when I think about it positively.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! You’ve got a lot of potential, and I believe with each positive experience, you'll start to build your confidence. Let’s continue to work on this together.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Lin. I'm here for you. Remember, every step forward is progress. I'll look forward to hearing about your journal and your experiences next time! 

User: I will! Thanks again. 

Consultant: Take care, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Lin! Welcome back to our session. I’m really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last talk?

User: Hi! I’ve been trying to connect with more people, but honestly, I still feel quite nervous. It’s a struggle to be myself around others sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like you're still experiencing some tension when interacting with others, despite your efforts. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel nervous in social situations?

User: Well, I often worry about what others think of me. I feel like I need to say the right things, and that pressure makes me freeze up.

Consultant: I see. It’s common to have those worries, especially when trying to build new connections. What do you think would happen if you allowed yourself to be a bit more vulnerable in these situations?

User: I guess I’m afraid that if I show my true self, people might not like me. It seems safer to stay quiet or act like someone I’m not.

Consultant: That’s an understandable concern. Vulnerability can definitely feel risky. But what if being your authentic self could actually help you build stronger connections? What would that look like for you?

User: I suppose it would mean being more open about my thoughts and feelings. But I still don’t know if I can do that.

Consultant: How about we explore some ways to gradually increase your comfort with being open? We could start with small steps, like sharing a personal opinion in a casual conversation. How do you feel about that idea?

User: That sounds manageable. I think starting small could help, but I still worry about being judged.

Consultant: Judging can feel very overwhelming. However, let’s challenge that thought a bit: Is it possible that others are just as focused on their own feelings and worries rather than judging you?

User: I guess that makes sense. Sometimes I forget that everyone has their own insecurities.

Consultant: Exactly! We all have our own struggles, and often people are more understanding than we expect. How about we practice some common social scenarios together? This might help you feel more prepared.

User: Sure, I’d like that! What scenarios do you think we should try?

Consultant: Let’s start with a friendly conversation at a group gathering. Imagine someone asks you about your hobbies. How would you respond now, and how might that change if you felt more confident?

User: Right now, I’d probably mumble something like “I don’t really have any,” but if I felt confident, I might share about my interest in music.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Sharing your hobbies is a wonderful way to connect with others. What steps can you take to feel more comfortable expressing that interest?

User: I think I could practice saying it out loud before I go to an event. Maybe writing it down would help too.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Practicing can make a significant difference. What benefits do you foresee from sharing your interests with others?

User: I hope it would spark conversations. Maybe I’d meet people who share similar passions.

Consultant: That’s a positive way to look at it. Exploring shared interests can indeed build a deeper connection. After trying this out, how would you assess your comfort level in social situations?

User: If it goes well, I might feel more confident about engaging in future conversations. But if it doesn’t, I might feel disheartened.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those mixed feelings. Remember, it's about the journey, not just the outcome. We can celebrate small victories along the way. How do you think you can stay motivated after a tough interaction?

User: I could remind myself of the progress I’ve made so far. I’ve been trying to connect more, which is already a step forward.

Consultant: That’s a healthy approach! Reflecting on your progress can help build self-compassion. What other techniques or activities can you incorporate to boost your confidence during social interactions?

User: Maybe I could attend more events and challenge myself to speak to at least one new person each time.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Each small effort will reinforce your skills. Let’s also discuss some relaxation techniques to reduce anxiety before these events. How does that sound?

User: That sounds useful! I often feel overwhelmed right before going out.

Consultant: Let’s try some deep breathing exercises. They can help calm your nerves. You could also visualize a positive interaction before stepping into a social setting. How comfortable do you feel about trying that?

User: I think I can definitely give that a shot. Visualizing sounds like a good idea.

Consultant: Great! Incorporating those techniques could enhance your experience. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss or questions you have about your social interactions?

User: I think I’m good for now. I’m just grateful for these insights.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiao Lin! Remember, you’re making meaningful progress. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Keep practicing, and take care of yourself!

User: Thank you! I’ll work on this and see how it goes.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Lin! I'm glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better actually. I received some praise from my teacher and classmates for my performance in a practical activity. It made me feel more confident.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like that recognition had a positive impact on your self-esteem. Can you tell me more about what you felt when you received that praise?

User: I felt surprised and happy. I usually don't get compliments, so it really lifted my spirits. I started to think maybe I could do well in other things too.

Consultant: It’s great that you felt such a boost in your spirits! What do you think contributed to your success in that practical activity? 

User: I guess I worked really hard and tried to be prepared. Also, I had a supportive team that made working together easier.

Consultant: It sounds like hard work and teamwork played a significant role in your success. How do you think you can use that understanding for future challenges?

User: I realize that preparation and support from others can help me succeed. I guess I just need to remember that I can rely on my strengths.

Consultant: Absolutely, remembering and leveraging your strengths will be important. What specific strengths do you think you can build upon moving forward?

User: I think my ability to work well in a team is a big strength. Also, I can be quite dedicated when I set my mind to something.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strengths to have! It’s important to recognize them. How do you feel about setting some future goals based on these strengths?

User: I think I’d like that. Setting goals might help me stay focused and keep improving.

Consultant: Let's explore that together! What are some specific goals you have in mind that align with your strengths and the success you've experienced?

User: Maybe I could aim to take on more responsibilities in upcoming projects. Also, I want to improve my public speaking skills since I find it challenging.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent goals, Xiao Lin. Taking on more responsibilities can be a great way to apply your teamwork skills, and improving your public speaking will definitely boost your confidence further. How do you feel about tackling public speaking specifically?

User: Honestly, it makes me a bit anxious. I worry about being judged or making mistakes.

Consultant: That’s a common concern. Let's talk about those feelings. Can you identify what thoughts come to mind when you think about public speaking?

User: I think a lot about how others might perceive me. I often tell myself that I’ll fail or look foolish.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts create a lot of anxiety for you. Let's work on questioning those beliefs. How do you think you could challenge the thought that you'll fail or look foolish?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay not to be perfect.

Consultant: That's an excellent approach! It’s true that mistakes are part of the learning process. What if we reframe that thought to focus on learning rather than perfection? 

User: Yes, that sounds much better. If I think about it as an opportunity to learn, I might feel less pressure.

Consultant: Exactly! Each experience is a chance to grow. How would you like to practice this new mindset moving forward?

User: Perhaps I could start by participating in smaller group discussions to build my confidence before speaking publicly.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Gradual exposure can help reduce anxiety. What steps could you take to set these discussions up?

User: I could join study groups or volunteer to lead some small discussions in class. 

Consultant: Those are practical steps! As you start to implement them, pay attention to your thoughts and feelings. How can you remind yourself of your strengths during these times?

User: I think I should keep a journal to reflect on my successes and the positive feedback I receive. 

Consultant: Keeping a journal is an excellent way to reinforce your positive experiences and build self-affirmation. How do you feel about starting this journaling practice?

User: I feel excited about it! I think it might help me keep track of my progress.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It's a positive step. As we prepare to wrap up today's session, what insights do you take away regarding your self-worth and future?

User: I realize that acknowledging my strengths and successes is crucial. I feel more confident in my ability to grow and achieve my goals.

Consultant: You’ve made fantastic progress today, Xiao Lin. Remember to cherish your strengths and the positive experiences. How can you maintain your motivation for your goals going forward?

User: I’ll set reminders for myself to review my journal and keep reflecting on my achievements.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! You've developed a clearer path for your growth today. If you ever feel uncertain, remember that you can always rely on your strengths. Our sessions have been useful, and I believe you have the tools to navigate your journey ahead.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance. I'm looking forward to implementing everything we discussed.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I believe in your potential. This is our last session for now, but you have taken great steps forward. Remember, you're always welcome to return if you need support in the future. Take care and best wishes on your journey ahead!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaolin! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling surprisingly good actually. After that recruitment event, I gained some confidence. It feels like I have a clearer direction for my future career.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Gaining clarity and confidence in your career is a significant step forward. Can you share more about how attending that recruitment event made you feel?

User: Sure! I was really nervous going in, but once I started talking to the companies, I felt like I was actually able to engage well. It was a relief to receive positive feedback.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you were able to interact positively with the companies. What specific feedback did you receive that stood out to you?

User: They appreciated my enthusiasm and said I communicated well. I never thought I could do that, so it was really encouraging.

Consultant: That's a fantastic validation of your abilities, Xiaolin! It sounds like those interactions helped reinforce a positive view of your communication skills. How has that impacted your feelings about your professional capabilities?

User: I feel more confident in my skills now. I used to doubt whether I could keep up with others in my field. But now, I think maybe I can succeed.

Consultant: That's a significant shift in perspective. Doubting oneself can hold us back, but it sounds like you're beginning to see what you're capable of achieving. What does that success look like for you?

User: I envision myself securing a solid internship that allows me to learn a lot. I want to make the most of this opportunity and gain practical experience.

Consultant: That’s a clear and practical goal! Gaining hands-on experience often solidifies what you've learned in school. What steps do you think you need to take to achieve this internship?

User: I think I need to prepare my resume better and keep applying. Maybe even reach out to professionals for advice.

Consultant: Those are excellent steps! Preparing your resume and networking can certainly enhance your chances. Do you feel you have a strategy in place for reaching out to professionals, or would you like to brainstorm some ideas?

User: I haven’t really thought about it much. I guess I could start by looking for alumni from my university working in companies I admire.

Consultant: That's a brilliant idea! Alumni connections can be very valuable. You can relate to their experiences and they might be willing to help. How do you feel about reaching out to them?

User: I feel a bit anxious thinking about it, but I know it could be beneficial.

Consultant: It's normal to feel anxious about reaching out, especially to those you may not know well. We can explore some techniques to reduce that anxiety. For example, what if you wrote down a few points you want to discuss? Would that help you feel more prepared?

User: Yes, that does sound like a good idea! Having a plan might make it feel less daunting.

Consultant: Absolutely! Planning can make a big difference. Let’s identify a few topics or questions you might want to ask these professionals. What would you want to learn from them?

User: I’d like to ask about their experiences in their careers, and what skills they think are most important for someone starting out.

Consultant: Those are excellent questions that could provide valuable insights. As you think about approaching them, remember that they were once in your position, so they might relate to your experiences. How do you feel about setting a goal for initiating those conversations?

User: I think that would be helpful! Maybe I could aim to reach out to one person each week.

Consultant: That’s a realistic and achievable goal! By setting this weekly target, you can gradually build your confidence. How does setting this plan make you feel about your next steps?

User: I feel like I have a clearer path now. I think this will help me stay motivated!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Motivation is key to progressing in your career. Let’s reflect on what you’ve accomplished so far. You've gained clarity about your goals, developed your communication skills, and identified actionable steps. What do you think is your biggest takeaway from our discussions today?

User: I realized that I’m more capable than I thought, and that taking small steps can lead to bigger opportunities.

Consultant: That's a valuable realization! Recognizing your capabilities and the importance of incremental steps can keep you moving forward. As we prepare to wrap up today's session, what strategies do you think will help you maintain this positive momentum?

User: I think keeping a journal about my experiences might help. Writing down my feelings and progress could keep me on track.

Consultant: A journal sounds like a fantastic idea! It can serve as a reflective tool that reinforces your progress and helps you manage any challenges. I believe you’re equipped with the right mindset to continue growing. Remember, you're not alone on this journey— I'm here to support you whenever you need. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance. I’m feeling really positive about moving forward.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaolin! I'm excited about the progress you've made and look forward to hearing about your successes in the future. If you ever feel uncertain, don’t hesitate to reach out. Have a great week ahead!

User: I will! Thank you for everything. 

Consultant: Take care, Xiaolin! Until next time!
