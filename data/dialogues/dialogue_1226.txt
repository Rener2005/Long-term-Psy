Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really down. It's hard to shake off the sadness from the breakup, and I find myself alone a lot, just crying.

Consultant: I hear you, and it sounds like you’re going through a very tough time. Dealing with a breakup can be incredibly painful. Can you tell me more about what feelings come up for you when you think about your situation?

User: I just feel so lost and empty. Sometimes, I think maybe I don’t even want to go on anymore. It's hard to see the point in anything.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry. It's understandable to feel that way after a loss. Let's explore those feelings a bit more. What thoughts do you have when you're feeling this way?

User: I keep thinking that I must not be good enough. Maybe that’s why he left me. It makes me feel worthless.

Consultant: It’s really important to recognize how those thoughts are affecting you. So, if I understand correctly, you’re feeling worthless because of the breakup? Can we brainstorm together about how true those thoughts really are?

User: I guess so. But when I think about it, it just feels like it must be true. If I was worth it, he wouldn’t have left.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, and it’s completely valid to have those thoughts. However, let’s challenge that perspective a bit—what other explanations could there be for his decision to leave?

User: Maybe he just didn’t see a future with me or wanted something different. But that still hurts, and I don’t know how to move past it.

Consultant: Absolutely, that can be a painful realization. It's difficult when someone else’s choices impact how we feel about ourselves. What if we considered that his choice doesn’t reflect your worth? How might it change the way you see yourself?

User: I suppose it could help to think that it was his choice, not mine. But, it’s just hard to convince myself of that.

Consultant: It’s understandable to struggle with that idea, especially now. Let’s work on developing a mindset where you can remind yourself of your inherent worth. What are some things about yourself that you value or appreciate?

User: Well, I guess I’m a good friend and I try to help others when I can. I enjoy art, too.

Consultant: Those are wonderful qualities to recognize! You have much to offer to the world around you. How about we focus on those strengths and find ways to enjoy your interests, like art, as a way to express your feelings?

User: Yeah, that might help. I haven't been painting much since the breakup, but I used to love it.

Consultant: Reconnecting with art can be a therapeutic way to channel your emotions. Perhaps we can set some small goals for you to engage with that hobby again. What do you think?

User: Yeah, that sounds possible. Maybe I could set aside some time each week to paint.

Consultant: That's a great start! Finding a creative outlet can aid in processing your feelings. Just to check in with you—how are you feeling about your social interactions? Have you considered reaching out to friends or family?

User: I feel really isolated. I haven’t talked to anyone about this. It’s just easier to stay alone.

Consultant: Isolation can often make things feel heavier. It might help to reach out even just to share a bit. Is there someone you feel comfortable talking to, even if it’s just a little?

User: I don’t know... Maybe I could text a friend. But what would I even say?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. You could start simple—just saying you've been going through a tough time and would love to catch up. How does that sound to you?

User: I guess I could try that. It feels a bit scary though.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel scared when reaching out. What we can do is work on dealing with that anxiety together. Let’s plan how you might handle those feelings when they arise.

User: Okay, I’d like that. I just want to feel a little better and not so alone.

Consultant: That’s a good goal. We can also develop some coping strategies for when those feelings of loneliness hit. How about some grounding techniques or distractions that can help?

User: That sounds useful. I’d like to learn more about those.

Consultant: Absolutely! Grounding techniques can be very helpful. These are ways to bring your attention back to the present moment. For instance, focusing on your breathing or describing your surroundings in detail can draw you out of your overwhelming emotions. Would you like me to guide you through one now?

User: Yes, please. That could really help.

Consultant: Alright! Let’s take a moment. Close your eyes, if you feel comfortable, and take a deep breath in… and out. Now, focus on five things you can see around you. 

User: I see my desk, a poster, my bed, my laptop, and my paints.

Consultant: Great! Now let’s switch to four things you can feel—maybe the chair you're sitting on or the air on your skin.

User: I can feel the fabric of my chair and my feet on the ground. It’s nice to focus on something different.

Consultant: Wonderful job! This technique can be a comforting tool when emotions feel overwhelming. Just remember, it’s okay to have feelings and to express them. We can continue practicing these techniques and exploring how you can manage your emotions more effectively.

User: Thank you. This is actually really helpful. 

Consultant: You’re doing incredibly well by being here and open to this process. As we approach the end of today’s session, let’s recap what you’d like to carry forward from our conversation. 

User: I think I’ll try to reach out to a friend and start painting again. That feels doable.

Consultant: Those are fantastic steps! Remember, this journey is about progress, not perfection. Before we finish, how are you feeling about everything we've discussed today?

User: I feel a little lighter, actually. I know it’s not resolved, but it helps to talk about it.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! It’s a positive step forward. Remember, you can always return if you need more support. Keep focusing on what matters to you, and take care of yourself. 

User: Thank you, I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. To be honest, things have been quite tough. I still find myself upset about my breakup, and now with finals approaching, I feel overwhelmed. It’s hard to even think about studying.

Consultant: I can really sense the weight of those feelings. Balancing the emotional fallout from a breakup with academic pressures sounds incredibly challenging. Can you tell me a bit more about what specific thoughts come to mind when you feel overwhelmed?

User: I keep thinking that I won’t be able to do well in my exams. Sometimes, I feel like I’m not smart enough or that I’m just going to fail.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem very heavy and discouraging. It’s understandable to worry about performance, but let’s take a moment to explore these feelings. What kind of emotions do those thoughts bring up for you?

User: I feel anxious and a little hopeless. It’s like I’m stuck—and I don’t know how to fix it.

Consultant: It makes sense that you’re feeling anxious and stuck given the weight of those thoughts. Let’s look at the idea of not being smart enough. Can you recall any evidence that supports or contradicts that belief?

User: Well, I’ve done well in my classes before, but my mind just keeps telling me that I'll mess up this time.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. You've had successes before, but it sounds like you’re focusing more on potential failure than on those achievements. How might you reframe that thought to acknowledge both sides?

User: Maybe, I could think that even if things don’t go perfectly, I’ve done well before and can do it again?

Consultant: That’s a great start! Recognizing your past successes can help to balance those negative self-thoughts. If a friend were feeling this way, how might you encourage them to view their situation?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on their strengths and to remember that exams are just one part of their journey, not the whole story.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate approach! Now, let’s try to apply that perspective to your situation. What are some strengths you can remind yourself of when you feel overwhelmed by these exam thoughts?

User: I’m good at analyzing questions and have a decent memory. I know I study hard, even if I sometimes doubt myself.

Consultant: It sounds like you have some confidence in your abilities, which is fantastic. How might you use that self-awareness to help ease your anxiety as exams draw closer?

User: I guess I could make a study plan and stick to it, reminding myself of my past successes along the way.

Consultant: Absolutely! A structured plan can be very supportive. Additionally, it can create a sense of control which often helps reduce anxiety. Can we brainstorm what your study plan might include?

User: I think I should schedule specific topics for each day and maybe include some breaks to avoid burnout.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical strategy! Breaks are essential. How about also adding in some time to do activities that help you relax and recharge? 

User: That would be nice. I often forget to take care of myself when I get stressed.

Consultant: Prioritizing self-care is so important, especially when you're under pressure. What kinds of activities do you enjoy that could help you recharge during your study breaks?

User: I like going for walks or listening to music. Maybe I could combine those!

Consultant: Combining those sounds like a lovely idea. Walking can clear your mind, and music can elevate your mood. As you prepare for your finals, let’s also consider how to address the emotional residue from your breakup. How do you currently cope with those feelings?

User: I usually just keep everything inside. It's hard to talk about it or even think about it.

Consultant: That’s understandable, but holding those feelings in can add to your burden. Would you be open to exploring ways to express those feelings, whether through journaling or talking with someone you trust?

User: I haven’t really thought about journaling. That could be good to get some of these thoughts out.

Consultant: Journaling can be a powerful tool for reflection and emotional release. It’s like giving yourself permission to feel and process your emotions. How do you feel about starting a journaling practice?

User: I think I could really benefit from that. I’ll give it a try!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful step forward! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize some strategies you can take with you. How will you manage your study time alongside your emotional well-being?

User: I’ll create a study plan, remind myself of my strengths, take regular breaks to walk and listen to music, and start journaling to process my emotions.

Consultant: That sounds like a balanced approach! Remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process. Do you feel more equipped to handle the upcoming challenges?

User: I do! I think I have clearer steps to take, which feels encouraging. 

Consultant: I’m truly glad to hear that! Remember, it’s okay to reach out for support when you need it. If you find yourself struggling, you can always return to our sessions. I wish you all the best with your studying and emotional journey. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and suggestions. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care of yourself, and I look forward to hearing how things go for you next time we speak.
###################
Consultant: Hello there! It’s great to see you today. I’d love to hear how you’ve been feeling lately and what’s been on your mind.

User: Hi! I’ve been really struggling with my sleep. It feels like I just can’t get a good night’s rest, and it’s starting to affect my studies. I really want to find a way to sleep better.

Consultant: I can see how frustrating that must be for you, especially since it’s impacting your studies. To start, can you tell me more about your sleeping patterns recently? How have they changed?

User: Well, I used to sleep pretty well, but since my breakup two months ago, I've found myself lying awake for hours. Sometimes I feel really anxious about not getting enough sleep, which makes it even harder.

Consultant: That sounds like a tough cycle you’re in. Anxiety about sleep can definitely make it harder to actually fall asleep. Can you share what thoughts go through your mind when you're trying to sleep but can’t?

User: I keep worrying about my exams and how tired I’ll be. I think, “What if I fail?” or “I won't do well because I can't concentrate.” 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite overwhelming. It’s understandable to feel anxious, especially with exams approaching. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit. How do you feel when you think, “What if I fail?” 

User: I feel panicked and my heart races. It’s like I can’t breathe, and I just want to escape that feeling.

Consultant: That panic must be really uncomfortable. Would you say that this thought is based on evidence or past experiences, or does it feel more like a fear of the unknown?

User: It feels more like a fear of the unknown, but sometimes I think about past results and worry they might repeat.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s easy to connect past experiences to present fears. What if we tried to test that thought? If a friend were worried about a similar situation, what advice would you give them?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on what they can control and to study a little at a time instead of stressing about the end result.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! It sounds like focusing on what’s manageable could help ease some anxiety. Let’s think about how you can apply that to your situation. Could we break down your study sessions into smaller, more manageable tasks while also focusing on your sleep habits?

User: Yeah, I think that would help. If I have a plan, I might feel less overwhelmed.

Consultant: Exactly! Creating a plan can provide structure. Let’s talk about your sleep habits. Have you established any nighttime routines to signal to your body that it’s time to wind down?

User: Not really. I usually just sit on my phone until I feel tired, which is pretty late.

Consultant: I see. Using your phone before bed can actually make it tougher to fall asleep. What do you think about trying a more relaxing routine, like reading or practicing some breathing exercises before sleep?

User: That could be worth a try! I used to enjoy reading.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Reading can help your mind relax. Also, consider setting a regular bedtime to help regulate your body's internal clock. How does that sound to you?

User: I think setting a bedtime is a good idea. It would help me structure my evening better.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s start small—maybe choose a bedtime that allows you to get enough rest before your study sessions. We can also focus on creating a calm environment in your room. How does that sound?

User: I’d like that. I’ll try to make my room more comfortable and quiet.

Consultant: Great! And remember, if you find those anxious thoughts creeping back in at night, you can remind yourself of the steps you’re taking to improve your sleep. How do you feel about that plan?

User: I feel hopeful! Having a plan makes it feel less daunting. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As you try these new routines, keep track of how your sleep changes and how you feel during the day. We can discuss your progress in our next session. Do you have any last thoughts or feelings you want to share today?

User: I’m just grateful for the support. I’m feeling a bit more positive about facing my exams and my sleep problems.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m really proud of the steps you’re taking. Remember, it’s okay to take this process one day at a time. I’m here to support you. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time! 

User: Thank you! I look forward to our next session too.

Consultant: Hello! I'm happy to see you again. How have you been since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a little better, actually. After that birthday party, I found myself wanting to socialize more. It was nice feeling cared for by others. 

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like the birthday party had a positive impact on you. Can you tell me more about what aspects of that experience made you feel good?

User: Well, I was surprised that I enjoyed being around people again. I hadn’t felt that way for a while. I liked seeing my friends being happy and engaging with everyone.

Consultant: It seems that being in that social setting brought you some joy and a sense of connection. How do you think these feelings might affect your willingness to join in more social activities?

User: I think I might be more open to participating in things now. I realize that it can be nice to be included. But I still feel nervous about it.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about socializing, especially after a period of withdrawal. What specifically makes you feel anxious when you think about participating in social activities again?

User: I worry about feeling out of place or that people might not want to engage with me. I have these thoughts that maybe I’m just not interesting enough to be around.

Consultant: I understand how that could be really tough. Let’s take a closer look at that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you aren't interesting enough to be around?

User: I guess there isn't really any solid evidence. It's just what I tell myself when I'm feeling down.

Consultant: It sounds like this thought may be a cognitive distortion, something that everyone experiences from time to time. Can you think of any moments where your friends genuinely enjoyed your company?

User: Actually, yes. At the party, people were laughing and joking with me. I joined some conversations, and I remember one of my friends said they appreciated my stories. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful! It seems like you have had meaningful interactions before. How does remembering these moments affect your thoughts about socializing now?

User: It makes me feel a little better. I guess I have good moments to draw from when I think about socializing.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s important to remind yourself of those positive experiences. Let's think about some small steps you can take to get back into social settings. What feels manageable for you?

User: I think it would help to start with small gatherings. Maybe I could invite a couple of friends over for a movie night or something low-key.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Organizing a movie night is a great way to reconnect without too much pressure. How does that idea make you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel excited about it! But I am still a little scared that it won’t go well.

Consultant: It's totally okay to feel a mix of excitement and nervousness. What could you do to prepare for this gathering to help ease those worries?

User: I could plan a few movies ahead of time and maybe even have some snacks ready. That way, I’ll feel more in control.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Having a plan can really help ease anxiety. How would you feel about sharing this idea with a friend to get their input or support?

User: I think I could definitely do that! Talking about it might help me feel more confident.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your plan can also help create a sense of accountability. How can you make sure to keep that momentum going after the movie night?

User: If it goes well, I might want to organize more get-togethers in the future. I would also love to try new activities with friends.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset! Exploring new activities can broaden your social network. How do you feel about potentially trying things like a group sport or a class together?

User: I actually really like that idea! Doing something fun together would definitely make it easier to interact with others. 

Consultant: Fantastic! What kind of activities are you interested in pursuing first, now that you’re feeling ready to socialize?

User: I’ve been thinking about joining a dance class. I’ve always loved dancing, but I’ve never done it in a group setting.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent choice! Dance classes can be a fun way to meet new people and express yourself. What’s the first step you can take toward joining that class?

User: I could look up local classes online and see what options are available. 

Consultant: Yes, that sounds like a perfect start. Setting that intention to explore these options can keep you moving forward. How do you feel about the progress you’ve made in our sessions?

User: I feel like I’ve learned a lot about handling my feelings and how to reconnect with others. I’m more hopeful now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember that it's a journey, and you're taking meaningful steps. How might you keep track of your feelings and progress as you move forward?

User: I think I might keep a journal to write down my thoughts and experiences. It could help me reflect on everything.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Reflecting can provide valuable insights and keep you motivated. As we wrap up today, what’s one key takeaway you would like to remember from our discussion?

User: I want to remember that it's okay to feel nervous, and that I have the ability to socialize and connect with others again.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway! Embracing your feelings while being open to connection is an important step. I'm proud of the progress you've made. If you ever need to talk again, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session!

Consultant: Hello G! It's great to see you again. I'm glad you're continuing to explore ways to improve your mental health. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling a bit better. Learning more about emotional management has helped me understand things more clearly, but I still have moments when I feel down or anxious.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that you're feeling a bit better. It's a positive sign that you're gaining some clarity. Can you share more about those moments of feeling down or anxious? What triggers those feelings for you?

User: Well, sometimes I just feel really lonely, especially when I see my friends hanging out together. I start to think that I'm missing out or that they don't really need me around.

Consultant: It sounds like seeing your friends can bring up feelings of loneliness and worry about your place in their lives. What specific thoughts come to mind when you feel that way?

User: I often think that they wouldn't miss me if I weren't there, and that maybe they are happier without me. It makes me feel really sad.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite heavy and can understandably lead to feelings of sadness. Let's explore them a bit. On a scale of 1 to 10, how much evidence do you think supports the idea that your friends wouldn't miss you?

User: I guess I would say maybe a 7? Sometimes it feels that way, but I also know they have invited me to things before.

Consultant: It's insightful that you recognize there's some evidence against that thought, like past invitations. What might be another perspective to consider about your friends' feelings towards you?

User: Maybe they still value our friendship, and it just doesn't always appear that way when I'm feeling down. I think I hold onto the negativity more.

Consultant: That’s a very healthy perspective! It seems you're beginning to challenge that negative belief. How about we practice creating a kinder inner dialogue? What would you want to say to a friend who felt the way you do?

User: I would tell them that they're important and that friends care about them, even if they don't hang out all the time.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful thought! You deserve to speak to yourself with that same kindness. How could you remind yourself of this when you feel down?

User: I could write it down and maybe even say it out loud to myself when I'm feeling lonely.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! It can be powerful to verbalize those positive affirmations. Now, think about other activities that might help you feel less lonely. What have you enjoyed doing in the past?

User: I used to enjoy painting and going for walks, but I haven't done those things lately.

Consultant: Those sound like fulfilling activities. How about we set a goal for you to incorporate one of those into your week? How does that sound?

User: I think that would be great! Maybe I could go for a walk tomorrow.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect start! A walk can help clear your mind and lift your spirits. As you prepare for your walk tomorrow, what emotions do you hope to experience?

User: I hope to feel a sense of peace and freedom. Just enjoying the moment without overthinking.

Consultant: That's a wonderful goal! Being present can be refreshing. Let's also think about how you'll handle any negative thoughts that might arise during your walk. How could you remind yourself to stay in the moment?

User: I could focus on my breathing and remind myself that it’s okay to just enjoy the scenery around me.

Consultant: Excellent strategy! Mindful breathing and awareness of your surroundings can ground you. As we look forward, how can you ensure that you keep these practices in mind moving ahead?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal to write down my thoughts and feelings after I walk, so I can reflect on my emotions regularly.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Journaling can be a great way to process your feelings and track your progress. Speaking of progress, let’s take a moment to reflect on what you’ve learned in our sessions. What do you think has been your biggest takeaway so far?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is understanding the importance of challenging my negative thoughts and being kinder to myself.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! Being kind to yourself can truly make a difference in how you navigate your feelings. As we approach the end of our session today, what do you feel you can commit to implementing in your daily life to maintain this positive momentum?

User: I commit to going for walks, practicing positive self-talk, and writing in my journal regularly.

Consultant: That sounds like a strong plan! It's clear you've put a lot of thought into this. Lastly, let's talk about how you can prevent slipping back into older habits. What strategies could you use to remind yourself of the progress you've made?

User: Maybe I could create a small reminder, like a sticky note, that says "You're valued!" and place it somewhere I see every day.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant and simple reminder to keep you focused on your self-worth. I’m proud of the progress you’ve made, G. Remember, it’s all about small steps. As we wrap up today, just know that I believe in your ability to maintain this progress. If you ever feel overwhelmed again, don't hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. I feel more confident about handling my emotions now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It's been a pleasure working with you. I look forward to hearing about your journey next time. Take care and remember to be gentle with yourself. 

User: I will! Talk to you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been better, actually. I feel more stable now, and I've started joining some activities with my classmates. It seems like things are slowly improving.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re making significant progress. Can you share more about what activities you’ve been participating in?

User: I've joined a study group and went to a few dormitory events. It felt good to be around people again, even though I was a bit nervous at first.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel nervous in social situations, especially after a period of withdrawal. What do you think motivated you to join those activities?

User: I realized that isolating myself wasn’t helping me at all. I miss the interactions and support from my friends, so I decided to give it a try.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Acknowledging what you miss is an important step in re-engaging with others. How did it feel to reconnect with your classmates?

User: It felt refreshing! I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the conversations and laughter. It made me remember why I liked being social in the first place.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It sounds like you’re rediscovering the joy of connection. Have you noticed any changes in your emotional state since you started participating more?

User: Yes, definitely! I feel more confident and less anxious. I still have moments of doubt, but they’re not as overwhelming as before.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re feeling more confident. Can you identify any specific strategies that helped you manage those moments of doubt?

User: I’ve been trying to challenge my negative thoughts when they arise. Instead of thinking everyone is judging me, I remind myself that people are generally supportive.

Consultant: That’s a powerful strategy! Challenging negative thoughts can significantly change how you perceive social situations. Can you share an example of a time when you practiced this?

User: Sure! At the last dorm event, I felt out of place and thought everyone was looking at me. But then I remembered that I was there to have fun, just like everyone else. I focused on enjoying myself instead.

Consultant: Excellent response! Shifting your focus from what others might think to your enjoyment is a significant step in reframing your thoughts. How has that affected your willingness to engage with others?

User: I feel more open to joining in now. I believe I can enjoy myself without worrying so much about how I appear to others.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful breakthrough! Embracing your authenticity can lead to more fulfilling interactions. What goals do you have moving forward in maintaining this progress?

User: I aim to keep participating in group activities and maybe even organize something myself. I think that would help solidify my growth.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Organizing an event can really enhance your confidence and allow you to contribute to the community. What kind of event do you have in mind?

User: I was thinking of hosting a study session or a game night. Those were always fun!

Consultant: Both of those options sound engaging! Hosting will not only help others but also reinforce your social connections. What support or resources do you think you might need as you consider this?

User: I might need some tips on how to organize things smoothly and maybe a little encouragement from friends to help me feel more confident.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Having a support system can aid your efforts. Would you like to brainstorm some specific steps to prepare for your event?

User: Yes, that would be helpful! I want to make sure I don’t feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Let’s start with the basics. Creating a simple plan for your event can help alleviate pressure. What tasks do you think you could break down?

User: I can start by choosing a date, then inviting people, and finally planning some activities. I’ll focus on one task at a time.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Taking it step-by-step can prevent feelings of overwhelm. How can you remind yourself of your progress as you plan?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal of my feelings during the process, noting down any positive experiences or feedback I receive.

Consultant: Keeping a journal sounds like a great idea! Reflecting on your successes can bolster your confidence and serve as a reminder of how far you’ve come. 

User: I feel excited just thinking about it! It’s nice to have a plan to look forward to.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Excitement is a wonderful emotion to carry with you. As we near the end of our session today, what are your main takeaways?

User: I realized that facing social situations can be enjoyable, and I have strategies to help manage my doubts. Plus, planning an event sounds like a fun way to continue growing.

Consultant: Those are excellent takeaways! You have made remarkable progress, and I believe you’re well on your way to continued growth. Remember that you can always reach out for support if you need it.

User: Thank you! I appreciate the encouragement and guidance. I feel more prepared for what’s next.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Remember, the skills you’ve learned will support you moving forward. Take care, and I wish you all the best!

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to continuing this journey.
