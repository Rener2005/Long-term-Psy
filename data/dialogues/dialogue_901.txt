Consultant: Hello, Jiang! I'm glad you're here today. I understand that you’ve been feeling a bit lost and helpless lately. Could you tell me more about how you’ve been feeling and what brought you to this session?

User: Hi. Lately, I’ve been feeling really down. Since I transferred schools, I haven't been able to adapt well, and sometimes I question the point of studying at all. It’s like everything is just a mess.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of confusion and distress regarding your new environment and your studies. Want to share more about your thoughts around studying and how it connects to what you're feeling?

User: Yeah, I guess I just don’t see the value in it anymore. I used to think school was important, but now it just feels like a burden. And my parents keep pushing me to do better, which makes it worse.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It seems like the pressure from your parents is adding to your frustration. Can you share what specific thoughts come to mind when you think about your studies and your parents’ expectations?

User: Well, I often think that no matter how hard I try, I’ll just fail. And when my parents talk about my future, it feels like they don’t understand how difficult things are for me right now.

Consultant: It must be overwhelming to feel like there’s a disconnect between their expectations and what you’re experiencing. Let’s explore this further—what emotions do those thoughts bring up for you?

User: I feel a mix of anger and sadness. It's like I want to do well, but I can't seem to get myself motivated, and then I just feel guilty about not trying harder.

Consultant: Your frustration and guilt make sense, considering your circumstances. It sounds like you are caught in a cycle of negative feelings. Have you noticed any specific situations lately that trigger these thoughts or feelings?

User: Definitely. For example, when I see my classmates talking about future plans, I feel left out and then I just want to avoid everyone. It’s like I’m isolating myself, but I don’t know how to stop.

Consultant: Feeling left out can be really painful, and avoiding social interactions can sometimes feel like the safest option. But it seems to create more distress. Why do you think avoiding them feels easier right now?

User: I think because facing them reminds me of how I’m struggling. It's easier to just stay in my comfort zone, even if I know it’s not helping me.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. You’re trying to protect yourself from feelings of inadequacy. What if we looked at this avoidance behavior and how it affects your thoughts and emotions? 

User: Okay, I guess I just feel like it’s all too much sometimes. It’s hard to break that cycle on my own.

Consultant: Absolutely, it can be quite challenging to break free from those patterns alone. Let’s identify small steps we could take together to help ease that pressure. What might be one manageable action you could take this week to engage with your studies or social life?

User: Maybe I could try talking to one classmate? Just to see if that makes me feel better or more connected to them.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Reaching out to someone could help you feel more connected and break that isolation. How confident do you feel about approaching them?

User: Honestly, I feel a bit nervous about it. What if they don’t want to talk to me?

Consultant: It’s normal to feel nervous, especially when reaching out. Let’s challenge that thought. Is there a chance they might be open to talking? What alternative thoughts could help you feel more confident?

User: I guess I could think that they might also be looking for a connection. Maybe they feel the same way.

Consultant: That’s a constructive perspective! You’re recognizing that they might have similar feelings. Shifting your thinking in that way can really help. What’s one affirmation you could tell yourself before approaching them?

User: Maybe something like, “It’s okay to reach out because we’re all in this together?”

Consultant: That sounds like a powerful affirmation! It could definitely help ease some of your fear. When you do connect with that classmate, how do you think that might change how you feel?

User: I hope it would make me feel a bit less alone and possibly even less pressure about my own situation.

Consultant: Absolutely! Building connections can often alleviate feelings of isolation. As we continue our sessions, we can explore ways to strengthen these connections and manage the pressure you feel. Shall we talk more about your feelings towards your parents and their expectations next time?

User: Yes, that sounds good. I think that’s a big part of what’s been bothering me.

Consultant: Great! I look forward to delving deeper into that with you. Remember, taking small steps is key. You’re doing well by acknowledging these feelings. Thank you for sharing today, Jiang.

User: Thank you for listening. It really helps to talk about it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. I’ll see you next time, and we’ll continue working through this together!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jiang. I'm glad to see you today. It seems like you've been going through some tough times lately. What's been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been really frustrated with my family, especially my mom. I feel like she doesn't understand me, and it's making me so angry and helpless.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It’s understandable to feel that way when communication is difficult. Can you tell me about a recent situation that made you feel especially upset?

User: Just last week, we had a huge argument about my schoolwork. She keeps pushing me to do things her way, and I just want to be heard.

Consultant: It feels like you’re wanting to express your own needs and opinions, but there's a lot of pressure from your mom. How did that argument make you feel?

User: I felt really angry and trapped. It seems like no matter what I say, she just doesn't listen. It makes me want to shut down even more.

Consultant: That sounds frustrating and isolating. It's tough when we don't feel heard. I'm interested to know what thoughts go through your mind in those moments when you feel like shutting down.

User: I often think that maybe I'm not good enough, or that I should just do what she wants to avoid conflict. But then I get more upset because I feel like I’m losing my own voice.

Consultant: It seems like there's a battle between trying to please your mom and wanting to assert your own identity. Can we identify specific thoughts that come up when you feel pressured by her?

User: I think about how I just want to be respected and how tired I am of feeling this way. Sometimes I even think she’ll never change.

Consultant: Those thoughts must be heavy to carry. When you consider the idea that she might never change, how does that impact your emotions and actions in the household?

User: It makes me feel hopeless. I start feeling resentful and I don't know how to talk to her without getting into another fight.

Consultant: Hopelessness can really weigh on us. How about we explore a different perspective? What might happen if you approached her with your feelings in a different way?

User: I guess if I could just tell her about my feelings calmly, things might be different. But I'm not sure how to start that conversation.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Jiang. Starting the conversation calmly can certainly create a different atmosphere. What if we practiced how to express your feelings and needs to her?

User: That would be helpful! I want to be able to express myself without it turning into a fight.

Consultant: Absolutely, let’s break it down. You might start by stating how you feel. For example, you could say, "I feel frustrated when I feel like my opinions aren’t considered." How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds okay, but I’m still worried about how she will respond. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. Would it help to envision her response? What do you think would be a reasonable reaction from her?

User: I hope she would listen. Maybe she would feel bad about our fights and try to understand me better.

Consultant: That's a positive thought. It can be beneficial to envision an open dialogue. How would you feel if she reacted positively, as you hope she would?

User: I’d feel relieved and maybe even a bit closer to her. It’s just hard to imagine that happening.

Consultant: It can indeed be hard to imagine change, especially when things feel stuck. We can prepare you for different responses. What other strategies can you think of that might help you feel more confident in the conversation?

User: I could practice what I want to say before talking to her. That way, I won't freeze up when I'm nervous.

Consultant: Practicing is an excellent idea! It might ease some of that anxiety. Additionally, would writing down your feelings help you organize your thoughts before the conversation?

User: Yes, writing it down might really help me clarify my thoughts and calm down a bit.

Consultant: Wonderful. Writing can create clarity and reduce anxiety. Would you like to set a specific time to try this out? We can talk about your experiences in our next session.

User: Yes, I’d like to try that. I’ll aim to talk to her over the weekend.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan. Remember, it’s okay if it doesn’t go perfectly; it’s a step toward improving communication. How do you feel about our discussion today?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I think I have some strategies now, and it helps to talk about it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. It’s a positive step forward. Keep in mind that adjusting family dynamics takes time, and each effort counts. We'll continue to work on this together.

User: Thank you, I appreciate it. I feel like I have some tools to work with now.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Jiang! It's great to see you taking these steps. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember, you’re not alone in this.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jiang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to stay out of family conflicts, but I still feel a bit unstable emotionally. It's like I'm trying to avoid confrontation, but my feelings are still all over the place.

Consultant: It sounds like you're making an effort to reduce conflicts, which is a positive step. However, it's understandable that your emotions are still fluctuating. Can you share more about what those feelings look like for you?

User: Well, sometimes I feel anxious or sad, especially when I think about my interactions with my mom. I know arguing doesn't help, but I still feel this underlying tension.

Consultant: That tension sounds challenging. You mentioned feeling anxious and sad—what specific thoughts come to mind when you're experiencing those emotions?

User: A lot of times, I think I'm not good enough or that I’ll never be able to connect with my mom again. It’s frustrating because I want to have a better relationship with her.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite heavy to carry. It’s important to recognize how they can impact your emotions. Would you say these thoughts are more extreme or negative? 

User: Yes, definitely. I often find myself jumping to conclusions, thinking that if we argue again, it will mean we’ll never get along. 

Consultant: That sounds like a common cognitive distortion—believing the worst-case scenario. Let’s explore that idea a bit. What evidence do you have to support that thought? Is there another way to view the situation?

User: I guess I don’t really have solid evidence. It's more of a feeling. I know we've had good moments together too.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you recognize those good moments. Perhaps we can challenge that negative thought. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably tell them that relationships have ups and downs and that one argument doesn’t define the whole relationship.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you already have a more balanced perspective. How do you think you can apply that mindset to your own feelings?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that it’s normal to have disagreements and not to take them as a sign that everything is doomed between us.

Consultant: That's a wonderful realization! Now, let’s think about how you can express those feelings when they arise. How might you communicate your emotions to your mom in a way that fosters understanding?

User: I could try being open about my feelings without blaming her. Like saying I feel anxious when we argue, instead of accusing her directly.

Consultant: That's a significant step! Honest communication is key. And when you share those feelings, how do you think you might feel in return? 

User: It could be a relief to get it off my chest. I think it would help to create more understanding between us, which is what I want.

Consultant: Absolutely. It can feel freeing to express yourself honestly. Let's move to a new idea. Have you thought about engaging in social activities outside of your family interactions? 

User: Not much. I guess I have been too focused on home issues, but I would like to reconnect with friends.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! What kind of activities or gatherings do you think would help you reconnect with your friends?

User: Maybe joining a club at school or hanging out with some friends I haven’t seen in a while. 

Consultant: Those sound like excellent ideas! Those social interactions can offer you support and even help you feel more confident. How do you envision implementing this in the coming week?

User: I could reach out to a couple of friends and see if they want to meet up. It might take some courage, but I think it could be good for me.

Consultant: Taking that step is commendable! It’s normal to feel a bit nervous, but those interactions can have a positive impact on your emotional state. How about we discuss some strategies to manage any anxiety you might feel about reaching out?

User: Yes, I’d like that. Sometimes I get overwhelmed thinking about it, and I end up not doing anything.

Consultant: One approach could be to set small, manageable goals—like sending a text instead of planning a whole outing immediately. Would that feel more comfortable for you?

User: That sounds doable. If I send a text and they respond positively, I think I would feel encouraged to meet up too.

Consultant: Exactly! By breaking it into smaller steps, it feels less intimidating. Remember to acknowledge your progress as you take these steps. 

User: I will try to do that. It’s hard for me to celebrate small steps, but I see how it’s important.

Consultant: Yes, recognizing those small victories can build your confidence over time. Looking back at our session today, what are some key takeaways for you? 

User: I think it’s about challenging my negative thoughts and actively trying to connect with friends. I feel like I have some strategies to work on.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Jiang! I’m so glad you feel you have strategies to explore. Remember, reaching out and expressing your feelings can make a significant difference. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit lighter talking through all this. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, it’s perfectly okay to feel uncertain; you have the tools to navigate through those feelings. If you need further support, I'm here for you.

User: I appreciate that. I’ll keep working on these strategies and look forward to our next session!

Consultant: Great! I look forward to hearing about your progress. Take care, Jiang, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jiang! I’m really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better, I guess. I’ve reached out to a couple of classmates, and it felt nice to connect again. But I still find myself hesitating to join larger group activities.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're reaching out to your classmates! That shows you’re taking steps to rebuild those connections. What do you think is holding you back from participating in larger group activities?

User: I think I’m just worried about how I’ll fit in. It’s been so long since I've been fully social, and I fear that I might not know what to say or do.

Consultant: Those feelings are completely understandable. It can be challenging to join social situations after some time away. Can you remember a specific instance where you felt uncertain about fitting in?

User: Yes, there was a study group I was invited to last week. I wanted to go, but I kept thinking about how everyone would be talking and interacting, and I was afraid I would just sit there not knowing what to contribute.

Consultant: That sounds like a tough situation to face. When you thought about that study group, what specific thoughts went through your mind that made you feel anxious?

User: I thought things like, “What if they don’t want me there?” or “What if I say something embarrassing?” It just spiraled from there.

Consultant: Those thoughts are definitely common in social situations. It's interesting to see how they made you feel. What emotions did these thoughts bring up for you at that moment?

User: I felt really uneasy and even a bit sad. Like I was missing out on something good because of my fear.

Consultant: It’s tough to feel that way, especially when you’re eager to reconnect with your peers. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit further. How much evidence do you think supports the idea that they wouldn’t want you there or that you would embarrass yourself?

User: I suppose I don't have concrete evidence. My friends were actually encouraging me to join. I just let my worries take over.

Consultant: It’s insightful that you noticed your friends’ support. What if you considered this situation from a different perspective? For instance, how would you advise a friend who felt the same way about joining a group?

User: I’d probably tell them to just give it a try—everyone feels awkward sometimes, and it’s okay. 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s very supportive advice. If you were to apply that same thinking to yourself, how might you approach the idea of joining the next social gathering?

User: Maybe I could just go and see how it feels, rather than overthinking it? I could remind myself that it’s normal to feel a bit awkward.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Trying to approach it with curiosity rather than pressure might lighten the situation. How do you feel about setting a small goal for yourself to improve your confidence in social settings?

User: I think I could try setting a goal to join one group activity this week, even if it’s just for a little while.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, Jiang! It will give you a chance to practice. What activity are you considering for this week?

User: There’s a club meeting I used to attend. I think I’ll try to go back to that.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant choice! Revisiting a familiar environment can help ease your worries. How do you think you might feel after attending?

User: I believe it would help me feel more connected again, and it might reduce my anxieties for future activities.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re really opening up to the possibilities! After trying this activity, what would you like to reflect on in our next session?

User: I’d like to talk about how it went and see if I can notice any improvement in my social confidence.

Consultant: Absolutely! I’m excited to hear about your experiences. Remember to be kind to yourself as you step into these situations. What are some ways you can remind yourself of your progress between now and then?

User: I could keep a small journal of my thoughts and feelings after each social interaction. 

Consultant: That’s a great idea, Jiang! Journaling can help you capture your experiences and emotions, allowing you to see your growth over time. Is there anything else you’d like to explore today?

User: Not really, I think we’ve covered a lot. I feel more motivated to re-engage socially now!

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! It’s been wonderful working with you on this, Jiang. Remember, each little step counts towards your confidence and connection with others. Looking forward to hearing how things go!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Take care, Jiang, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jiang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better socially since I've reconnected with some of my old friends. But I still worry a lot about my studies and what the future holds for me.

Consultant: It sounds like reconnecting with friends has been positive for you, which is great to hear! Let's explore those worries about your studies further. Can you share what specifically you’re concerned about regarding your academic future?

User: I feel overwhelmed sometimes, especially thinking about college and what I want to study. I’m not sure if I have enough time to figure everything out and still do well in school.

Consultant: That’s understandable, Jiang. It’s quite common to feel pressure when planning for the future, especially in your final year. Let’s break it down a bit. What subjects or areas have sparked your interest recently?

User: I’ve really enjoyed subjects like psychology and literature this year. They feel more engaging than some of my other classes.

Consultant: That’s a good start! It seems like you have some interests that resonate with you. How do you think you could explore those subjects further, perhaps in relation to your future studies?

User: I guess I could look into psychology programs for college. I’m just worried if I’m good enough to pursue something like that.

Consultant: It’s natural to have doubts about your abilities. Let’s reflect on your strengths. What achievements or skills do you possess that could support you in pursuing psychology?

User: I think I’m a good communicator and enjoy listening to others. I often help my friends with their problems. 

Consultant: Those are valuable skills in psychology! Communicating effectively and understanding others are essential parts of that field. How does recognizing your strengths make you feel about studying psychology?

User: It makes me feel a bit more confident, I guess. Still, I’m worried about the competition in college and what if I don’t succeed?

Consultant: Those concerns are valid, Jiang. Many students face competition and fear of failure when applying to college. Have you thought about small steps you could take to prepare yourself for that journey?

User: I haven’t really planned much. I suppose I could maybe start by reading more about psychology or talking to people in that field.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent idea! Gaining knowledge about psychology and networking with others can help ground your interest. How would you feel about setting specific, manageable goals to help you start this journey?

User: I think setting up some specific goals could help me. I could aim to read a new psychology book each month or follow some psychology-related accounts online.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies! How about we set a plan for how you might structure your time to incorporate those activities alongside your other studies?

User: That sounds good! I’ll need to see where I can fit in these goals without stressing over my school assignments too much.

Consultant: Absolutely, balance is key. How about we look at your current study schedule and see where we might be able to make adjustments?

User: I usually study for a few hours every day after school. I could possibly reduce my study time for subjects that I find less challenging and use that time for psychology.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach! Prioritizing your interests while managing your workload can keep your motivation high. How do you feel about adjusting your study plan to allow for this?

User: I feel more positive about it! I hope it does help my mood and keeps me engaged in learning.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s all about making incremental changes that align with your goals. If you encounter any challenges, what strategies could you use to address them?

User: I think I might reach out to my friends for support if I’m feeling lost. They can help keep me motivated.

Consultant: That’s a great support strategy! Leaning on your social connections can provide encouragement when things feel tough. How do you feel about maintaining both your academic and social life as you work towards these goals?

User: I feel like I can balance both! Engaging with friends while pursuing my academic interests makes a lot of sense to me now.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization! Balancing academics and social life can greatly enhance your overall happiness and success. Before we wrap up, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed about your goals.

User: Sure! I plan to read a psychology book each month, follow psychology-related content, and adjust my study schedule to make time for these activities, all while reaching out to friends for support.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Jiang! It’s all about creating a supportive environment for yourself while pursuing your interests. How are you feeling about the progress you've made today?

User: I feel really good. I have a clearer idea of how to move forward, and I’m excited about these new goals!

Consultant: That’s fantastic! I’m really proud of you for taking these steps. Remember, you can always come back if you need further guidance or support. You’re doing an amazing job. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help. I feel much more ready to face my challenges now.

Consultant: You’re incredibly welcome. I believe in your abilities, Jiang. Keep progressing, and I look forward to hearing about your achievements next time we meet.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jiang! I'm glad to see you today. Before we jump in, how have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing better, actually. I've been more engaged in school activities and have finally found a rhythm that works for me. It's a relief!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Finding a rhythm can really help with managing both study and social activities. Can you share a bit more about what specific successes you've experienced lately?

User: Sure! I've been participating in group projects more actively, and I feel like I contribute well. My grades have also improved slightly, which boosts my confidence.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re really making progress in both your engagement and your academic performance. How does that increase in confidence feel for you?

User: It feels great! I used to doubt my abilities a lot, but now I feel more capable and willing to take risks, like speaking up in class or suggesting ideas during group work.

Consultant: That’s such a positive shift! So, let’s reflect on these achievements. What do you think has contributed to your ability to speak up and engage more confidently?

User: I think it's about feeling supported by my peers and teachers. They really encourage participation, which makes it easier for me to express myself. 

Consultant: It’s fantastic that you have supportive people around you. How does that support impact your mindset when facing new challenges?

User: It definitely eases my worries. I used to overthink everything and feel scared of judgment, but now I’m learning to accept that it’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: That's a significant insight! Accepting that mistakes are part of the learning process is crucial. As you look ahead, do you anticipate any upcoming challenges that might test this new confidence?

User: Yes, I have several upcoming exams, which makes me a bit nervous. I'm worried that I might revert back to overthinking.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. When you feel nervous about exams, what thoughts usually come to your mind?

User: I often think that I can’t handle the pressure and that everyone else is doing better than me. It makes me anxious thinking I might fail.

Consultant: It sounds like you're facing some self-doubt, which is common during stressful periods. How do you think those thoughts affect your performance during exams?

User: They really distract me. It’s hard to focus when I’m constantly worrying about comparisons and failure.

Consultant: Let’s challenge those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you won’t perform well, and could there be other factors influencing your exam performance?

User: Well, I guess I've done well in practice tests recently. Maybe I’m just letting my fears get the better of me.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like your practice tests are a much better indicator of your capabilities than those anxious thoughts. What would you tell a friend who felt the same way, facing similar fears?

User: I would encourage them to focus on their preparation and remind them that it’s okay to feel nervous, but that they’re capable of doing well.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! Applying that same advice to yourself can be empowering. Let’s talk about some strategies to help you maintain that positive mindset and focus during the exam period.

User: Yes, that would be helpful! I want to avoid falling back into old habits.

Consultant: One approach is to incorporate regular study routines with breaks and positive affirmations. Would you be willing to try scheduling short study sessions with breaks and reminders of your achievements?

User: That sounds manageable. I think having a structured plan could help me stay focused and calm.

Consultant: Absolutely! Creating a plan can help reduce feelings of overwhelm. We can also explore mindfulness techniques to help you stay present and manage anxiety during study sessions. How does that sound?

User: I like that idea! I’ve heard about mindfulness but never tried it. 

Consultant: Mindfulness can be a great tool. We can practice some techniques together next time! For today's session, let's recap your advancements and set some goals for the upcoming weeks. How does that feel?

User: It feels good! I’m looking forward to seeing how it all comes together.

Consultant: Fantastic! And remember, acknowledging the progress you've made is vital for maintaining a positive mindset. Do you feel prepared to handle the exams with the strategies we've discussed?

User: Yes, I feel much more confident now! Thank you for putting things into perspective.

Consultant: You’ve done all the hard work, Jiang! Just remember that it’s about progress, not perfection. As we wrap up today, what would you say is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think it's that I can control how I think about challenges, and that I have support around me which can help me manage my fears.

Consultant: Exactly! Keeping that support in mind will help you navigate through the upcoming challenges. You’ve come a long way, and I'm proud of you. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance and support.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Jiang! Remember, it’s okay to reach out if you need additional support. You’ve built some great tools for yourself. Until next time, take care and keep believing in yourself!

User: I will! Thank you again!
