Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ming! I'm glad to see you today. I’d like to start by understanding how you've been feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really frustrated. School is tough, and sometimes I just freeze up when I try to work with other kids. I guess I’m just not good at making friends.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling a bit stuck, especially when it comes to socializing at school. What specific situations make you feel the most uneasy?

User: Well, when I’m in class and the teacher asks us to group up, I feel really anxious. I worry about saying the wrong thing or being left out.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable, feeling anxious in those situations. It’s challenging to be in a group and to worry about fitting in. Can you tell me more about what thoughts go through your mind when you experience that anxiety?

User: I keep thinking, "What if they don’t want me in their group?" or "What if I mess up what I say?"

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really stressful. It’s like there’s a pressure to perform or be accepted by others. How do those thoughts affect how you feel in those moments?

User: They make me feel really nervous and like I want to avoid the situation altogether. I get really quiet and then feel even worse.

Consultant: Avoiding those situations makes sense if you're feeling that way. But it can also reinforce your anxiety, right? What do you think would happen if you tried to face those situations instead?

User: I guess I might actually enjoy it, but I’m scared I’ll embarrass myself.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel scared of embarrassing yourself. What evidence do you have that you would embarrass yourself? Have there been times when things went better than you expected?

User: Well, there was one time when I worked on a project with a friend, and it turned out well. But that felt different because I knew him.

Consultant: That’s a great example! You were able to work well with someone you felt comfortable with. What if you tried to build those comfortable connections with other classmates too? 

User: I would like to, but I’m not sure how to start. 

Consultant: Let’s think about some small steps you could take to engage with them. What are some activities in school where you might have the opportunity to interact with others?

User: We have group activities in gym class. I could try to talk to someone there.

Consultant: That sounds like a good idea! Starting with something you’re already involved in can help make it feel less daunting. What would be a small, manageable goal for you in gym class?

User: Maybe I could ask someone to be on my team or talk to them while we’re playing.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! By reaching out, you’ll create opportunities for connection. How do you feel about trying that in your next gym class?

User: I’m really nervous thinking about it, but I think I want to try.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel nervous, but it sounds like you're willing to give it a shot. Remember to be kind to yourself, regardless of the outcome. Let’s also think about how to acknowledge your successes, no matter how small.

User: I guess if I ask someone to join, and they do, that’s a success, right?

Consultant: Absolutely! Every step you take counts. How about we try keeping a journal to write down those little achievements and how they made you feel?

User: That could help. Sometimes I forget the good moments.

Consultant: Yes, reflecting on positive experiences can boost your confidence! We’ll do this each week, and you can share those moments with me during our sessions. What do you think?

User: I think I like that idea. 

Consultant: Great! So let’s set a plan for your next session. How about we focus on your experience in gym class and your journey with your journal? 

User: That sounds good. 

Consultant: I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences. Remember, you're not alone in this, and taking small steps can lead to big changes. 

User: Thanks, I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Ming. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. I believe in you! 

User: Thank you. I feel a bit better now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You’re making positive strides. Let’s check in on this progress next time and keep building on it.

User: Sounds good! 

Consultant: Take care and see you next time, Xiao Ming! 

User: Bye!

Consultant: Hello there! I'm really happy to see you for our session today. I understand that you've been feeling anxious about social situations, especially with your attempts to join school activities. Can you share how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Yeah, I've been feeling really anxious when I try to be with others. I just worry about making mistakes or that nobody will want to talk to me.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, especially when you want to make connections. Let's explore that a bit more—when you're in those group situations, what specific thoughts go through your mind that make you feel anxious?

User: I think a lot about how I might embarrass myself or that I won’t fit in. Sometimes I feel like everyone else is just more fun to be around.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are pretty heavy. They can really amplify your anxiety. If we break it down, what feelings do those thoughts create for you in those moments?

User: I feel really nervous, like my heart is racing and my hands get all sweaty. I just want to leave.

Consultant: That's understandable, and it sounds quite uncomfortable. Let’s acknowledge that you're experiencing these feelings. What do you think would help you feel more at ease in those social interactions?

User: I guess if I could just feel confident and not worry about what everyone thinks, that would help a lot.

Consultant: Confidence is a great goal. To build that, we might need to challenge those thoughts you have during social situations. For example, you mentioned thinking that you might embarrass yourself. How true do you think that thought really is? Is there evidence to support it?

User: I don’t know. I guess sometimes I do okay, but I focus too much on the bad times.

Consultant: That’s a good observation! It's common to focus on the negatives. Let’s try to replace those extreme thoughts with more balanced ones. If a friend said they felt like they’d embarrass themselves in a similar situation, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably say that everyone makes mistakes and it’s okay to not be perfect.

Consultant: Exactly! That perspective can help ease the pressure on yourself. So, let’s explore situations where you've interacted positively. Can you think of a time when you enjoyed talking with someone or felt more comfortable?

User: Yeah, I had a good conversation with a classmate during a project last week. It felt nice.

Consultant: Wonderful! That’s a great example! What do you think contributed to that positive experience?

User: We were focused on the project, and we were laughing a lot. It made me feel more relaxed.

Consultant: Sounds like you can thrive in a supportive environment. That’s a helpful insight! Would you be willing to set a small goal for our next session—like talking to a classmate about something you both share interest in?

User: Um, I could try that. But what if they don’t want to talk to me?

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to have that worry, but remember to consider the possibility that they might be open to chatting too. What if you approached it with a simple question related to your interests? 

User: I guess I could try asking them about the project again. That sounds easier.

Consultant: Absolutely! It sounds like a great plan. Before we run out of time, let’s talk about some relaxation techniques that can help reduce your anxiety before you approach someone. Have you ever tried deep breathing techniques?

User: No, I haven’t. How does that work?

Consultant: It’s quite simple! You take a slow, deep breath through your nose, hold it for a second, and then breathe out through your mouth. This signals your body to relax. Would you like to practice that with me now?

User: Okay, I can try.

Consultant: Great! Let’s do it together. Inhale through your nose... hold... and now exhale through your mouth. How did that feel?

User: It was nice. I felt a bit calmer.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Breathing like that can really help you center yourself in those moments of anxiety. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve talked about. You've identified some anxious thoughts and ways to challenge them, as well as a real-life experience where socializing went well. 

User: Yes, I remember. I’ll try to think of those good moments.

Consultant: Perfect! And don't forget to use the breathing technique whenever you need a little calm. Before we meet again, if you can practice engaging in small talk, it will be a great step forward. You’re doing so well!

User: Thanks! I really appreciate your help. I’ll definitely try my best.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember, it’s all about small steps. I believe in you, and I'm here to support you. If you feel overwhelmed, it’s okay to reach out before our next session. Until then, take care!

User: I will. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoming! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been thinking a lot, especially about the group project. I tried to share my ideas, but I'm still worried they wouldn’t accept me. I feel like avoiding speaking up.

Consultant: It sounds like you really want to contribute, but there's a fear of being rejected. That's completely understandable. Can you tell me more about what went through your mind when you tried to share your ideas?

User: I thought they might laugh at me or think my ideas are stupid. I felt really nervous.

Consultant: I can see how those thoughts would make you anxious. When you thought about them laughing or dismissing your ideas, how did that make you feel in the moment?

User: It made me feel small and embarrassed. I just wanted to disappear.

Consultant: Feeling small is tough, especially when you're trying to put yourself out there. Let's explore those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that they would laugh at or dismiss your ideas?

User: I don't know. They've never really laughed at anyone before, but it just felt like they might.

Consultant: It's good to notice that you're expressing a fear that may not have evidence backing it up. If a friend was in your position, sharing great ideas and feeling unsure, what would you tell them?

User: I guess I would say to just give it a try and that their ideas might be good.

Consultant: Exactly! You have a compassionate side that recognizes value in others' ideas. Now let’s focus on you. There might be a way to practice sharing your thoughts. Would you be open to trying a role-playing exercise today?

User: Sure, that sounds interesting.

Consultant: Great! Let's simulate a situation. Imagine your group is brainstorming ideas. I’ll act as one of your classmates, and you can practice sharing your idea with me. How does that sound?

User: Okay, I can try.

Consultant: Perfect! Whenever you're ready, go ahead and share an idea with me.

User: Um, I think we could use a poster for our project to make it look more interesting.

Consultant: That’s a nice idea, Xiaoming! Posters can really enhance a presentation. How do you feel about my response?

User: It felt good that you liked it. But I'm still worried others won’t feel the same.

Consultant: That’s a common fear, but just remember, it’s about sharing what you think. Practicing this will help build your confidence. Let’s try again. This time, imagine I'm someone who might have a different reaction. Try sharing again, and I’ll respond differently.

User: Okay. I think we could use a poster for our project to make it look more interesting.

Consultant: Hmm, I’m not sure about that. Posters are a bit old-fashioned, don’t you think?

User: I... I guess so. Maybe it’s not a good idea.

Consultant: It’s easy to feel discouraged when faced with criticism, but it doesn’t mean your idea is bad. Remember, even if someone doesn’t jump at your idea, it’s still worth sharing. How does that feel when you hear that?

User: I understand. It doesn’t mean my idea itself is bad, just that people have different opinions.

Consultant: Exactly! Having differing opinions is part of group dynamics. Now, let’s think of ways to handle criticism in the future. What could you say or do when someone challenges your idea?

User: I could say that I think it could work, and ask what they think would work better?

Consultant: That’s a constructive approach! Asking for feedback shows you’re open to discussion while still valuing your own ideas. How do you feel about this strategy?

User: It feels okay. I think it could help me respond better.

Consultant: I'm proud of you for thinking through this! You've done an excellent job today. Let’s recap what we worked on: you practiced sharing ideas, dealt with different types of feedback, and identified a strategy for responding. What's one key takeaway for you from today?

User: I think I learned that my ideas are worth sharing, no matter what others think.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization, Xiaoming! Remember, your voice matters. What will you take with you into your next group interaction?

User: I’ll try to share my ideas and handle feedback better. I want to believe in myself more.

Consultant: I believe in you too! It's a journey, and each step counts. Just remember to practice and be kind to yourself along the way. If you face any difficulties, we can address them together in our next session. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I feel a bit more confident now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Confidence builds with each experience. We'll continue working on this, and I look forward to seeing how you feel next time. Take care until then!

User: Thank you! See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ming! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I feel a bit happy because the teacher praised my project in technology class, but I still can't shake off the doubts about my abilities. It's hard to believe I did well.

Consultant: I see. It's wonderful that you received praise for your project, but it sounds like those doubts are still very strong. Can you tell me more about what thoughts go through your mind when you doubt your abilities? 

User: I often think that maybe the project was just luck, or that the teacher was being nice because it's part of their job. I feel like I could have done it better.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem to be affecting how you perceive your achievements. It's common to downplay our successes, especially when we're critical of ourselves. What would you say if a friend shared similar feelings about their accomplishment? 

User: I would probably tell them to be proud of what they did, but I guess I can’t follow my own advice.

Consultant: That’s an insightful point. It's easier to support others than to support ourselves. Let's try a little exercise. Can you think of three specific things you did well with that project? Writing them down might help you see your successes more clearly. 

User: Hmm, I designed the project myself and explained everything to the class. I even answered some of their questions afterwards. 

Consultant: Those are fantastic achievements! You should be proud of yourself for taking the initiative and sharing your work with others. How do you feel writing those down makes you think about your abilities?

User: I feel a little better; I guess I did do well after all. But what if I mess up in the future?

Consultant: It's normal to worry about the future, but remember, no one is perfect. We all make mistakes. Instead of focusing solely on what could go wrong, can you think of how you've learned from past experiences, even when things didn’t go as planned? 

User: Well, I learned a lot from my science project before this one. I made mistakes, but it taught me how to improve.

Consultant: Exactly! Each experience helps you grow. Maybe we can keep a diary where you write down your achievements and what you learned from any challenges. Over time, this can help reinforce your self-esteem. Would you be willing to try this?

User: That sounds helpful. I think I can manage that. 

Consultant: Great! Let's also think about how to celebrate your successes, no matter how small. How do you usually celebrate when you do something well? 

User: I usually don’t celebrate; I just move on to the next thing. 

Consultant: How about we create a small celebration ritual for your achievements? It could be as simple as sharing it with a family member or treating yourself to something you enjoy. What do you think of that?

User: That could be nice. I like the idea of telling my mom about it. 

Consultant: Perfect! Sharing your successes can make them feel even more real. Remember, acknowledging your achievements is an important step in building your confidence. How does that make you feel?

User: I feel a bit more confident just thinking about it.

Consultant: That's fantastic! With each small step, you'll gradually build a stronger sense of self. As we continue, we can work on developing your social skills and finding ways to feel more comfortable in social situations. Does that sound okay to you?

User: Yes, that would be nice. I want to get better at speaking with others.

Consultant: I'm here to help you with that. We can practice some strategies together, so you feel more prepared for interactions. What situations make you feel most anxious when dealing with others?

User: Group projects make me nervous because I worry about what to say.

Consultant: I understand. Group settings can be challenging. We can practice some phrases or questions that you can use in those situations to help you feel more engaged. How does that sound? 

User: Yeah, that would help. I often feel lost in groups.

Consultant: Let’s start with your strengths! You’ve done well with explaining your projects. What could you say to initiate a conversation with your peers in a group project?

User: Maybe I could ask them what they think about my ideas.

Consultant: That’s an excellent start! Asking questions is a great way to get involved. Try to think of it as collaborating rather than just speaking up. How do you feel about trying this in your next group project?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think I can do it.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable! Remember, practice makes it easier over time. If you think about it as a chance to learn and connect rather than a test, it may help ease your nerves. 

User: I hadn’t thought of it that way. Maybe that’s a better approach.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on the process rather than just the outcome can help shift your mindset. Let’s make a plan for how you can approach this next group project when it comes up. 

User: That sounds good! I like having a plan.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s summarize what we talked about today. You’ll keep a diary to log your achievements and what you learned from challenges. You’ll also try to initiate conversations in group projects by asking for feedback. 

User: Yes, that’s right! 

Consultant: Perfect! I'm proud of the progress you're making. Remember, it’s all about small steps. We'll continue to work on enhancing your confidence and social skills together. How are you feeling about everything we've discussed today? 

User: I feel more hopeful and ready to try these ideas! 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiao Ming! Keep up the hard work, and don't hesitate to share your thoughts with me in our next session. I’m looking forward to seeing you again.
###################
Consultant: Hi there, Xiaoming! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling about your social interactions lately?

User: Hi! I've been trying to be more active in my interactions with classmates. It's still a bit uncomfortable, but I'm feeling less anxious than before.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re making progress in being more proactive. Can you tell me more about a recent interaction with your classmates that stood out to you?

User: Well, during a group project last week, I spoke up to share my ideas. I was nervous, but it went okay, and my classmates listened.

Consultant: That's a significant step, Xiaoming! Speaking up can be tough, especially when you're nervous. How did it feel for you to express your ideas in that situation?

User: I felt proud, but also a bit anxious afterward, wondering if they thought my ideas were silly.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel a mix of pride and anxiety. You put yourself out there! Let’s explore that thought: what evidence do you have that your ideas might be silly? 

User: I guess I don't really have any. They did seem to consider what I said.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like they valued your input, which is great. Let's work on challenging the negative thoughts that creep in after such interactions. How about trying to remind yourself of this experience when those doubts come up next time?

User: That makes sense. I should remind myself that sometimes my ideas are actually good.

Consultant: Yes, and reinforcing that positive self-talk can be really beneficial. What could be a specific phrase you could tell yourself in those moments?

User: Maybe I could say, "My ideas are worth sharing."

Consultant: That’s an excellent affirmation! Now, let’s think about what social situations you might want to practice more in. Are there any upcoming events or gatherings you can engage in?

User: We have an upcoming school fair. I could try talking to more people there.

Consultant: Perfect! The school fair is a great opportunity. How do you feel about setting a small goal for yourself during the fair, like initiating a conversation with a couple of classmates?

User: I could try to talk to at least three new people. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic goal! Remember to take a deep breath and remind yourself of your affirmation. How do you think that will help you when you’re at the fair?

User: I think it will make me feel more confident. I won't just focus on being nervous.

Consultant: Exactly! Shifting your focus to your strengths will help you feel more at ease. After the fair, we can discuss how it went and what you learned. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: Great! Before we end today, let's review some strategies we've discussed. You'll remind yourself of the importance of sharing your ideas and aim to practice during the fair. 

User: Yes, and I will use my affirmation to boost my confidence!

Consultant: Absolutely. This positive mindset will help you continue to progress. Is there anything else you want to talk about today regarding your social experiences or feelings?

User: No, I think that's all for now. I feel more motivated!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear. Your motivation is an essential part of moving forward. Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous, but you’re capable of great things. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xiaoming! It’s been a pleasure to see your development. I look forward to hearing about your experiences at the fair next time. Keep practicing!

User: I will! See you next time!

Consultant: See you then! Take care and keep up the great work!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoming! I'm really pleased to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good. I noticed that I was able to talk with my relatives during the family gathering last week without feeling too nervous. It made me feel more confident.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! You mentioned feeling more confident while interacting with your relatives. What do you think contributed to that experience?

User: I think I was more prepared. I remembered your advice about being myself and just trying to enjoy the conversation instead of worrying too much.

Consultant: It sounds like you really applied what we discussed. That’s a great strategy! How did it feel to be able to engage in those conversations?

User: It felt nice! I was really happy that I could join in and share my thoughts. At first, I was worried I wouldn't know what to say, but it turned out okay.

Consultant: That's a significant achievement, Xiaoming. It’s normal to feel some worry before social interactions, but you’ve shown that you can overcome that. How do you think this confidence will affect your interactions in the future?

User: I hope I can keep feeling this way. Maybe I can talk to more people at school now, not just my friends.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! Expanding your interactions can help you build even more confidence. Are there specific situations at school where you’d like to apply this newfound confidence?

User: I want to participate more in class discussions. Sometimes I hold back because I’m afraid of saying the wrong thing.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. One thing we can work on is expressing your thoughts confidently in class. What do you think would help you feel more comfortable sharing your ideas?

User: Maybe if I practice what I want to say before class, that might help me. 

Consultant: Practicing what you want to say is a great strategy! It can help organize your thoughts, which might ease your anxiety. Would you like to set a small goal for your next class?

User: Yes! I think I could aim to share at least one thought or answer a question next time.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect goal! It’s manageable and will help you gradually build your confidence in class. How do you feel about sharing this goal with a teacher or a classmate for support?

User: I think that would be good! Maybe if someone knows that I want to speak up, they could encourage me.

Consultant: Absolutely! Having someone aware of your intention can provide the support you need. Do you already have someone in mind who could help you with this?

User: I have a friend in class who is really supportive. I might tell him.

Consultant: That’s a great choice! Sharing your goal with your friend can create a support system. How do you feel about your progress overall—from our earlier sessions to now?

User: I feel like I've made good progress! I'm more confident and open to trying new things.

Consultant: You’ve done an impressive job, Xiaoming. It's essential to acknowledge these milestones. As you move forward, what long-term goals do you have for your social interactions or academic performance?

User: I want to feel comfortable talking to anyone, not just family and friends. And I want to do well in school, too, maybe even join some clubs.

Consultant: Those are fantastic long-term goals! Both social confidence and academic success can complement each other. We can explore ways to actively engage in clubs and activities that interest you. What clubs have sparked your interest?

User: I like the idea of joining the science club or the drama club. I enjoy both science and acting a bit.

Consultant: Both options sound exciting! Being involved in clubs can enhance your social skills while pursuing your interests. As we wrap up today’s session, how can we ensure you maintain this momentum?

User: I think setting small goals each week, like speaking up in class and talking to new people, would help me a lot.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan, Xiaoming! Setting small, achievable goals is a powerful way to secure your progress. Remember, it's all about taking gradual steps. I'm proud of how far you've come, and I believe you’re on the right path.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure witnessing your growth. Remember, if you ever feel like you need support again, I’m here for you. Best of luck with your goals, and keep up the great work!

User: I will! Thanks again!
