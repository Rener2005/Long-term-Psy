Consultant: Hello, Zhang. I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious, especially around male classmates and teachers. I still get really nervous, and I find it hard to engage in conversations without panicking.

Consultant: It sounds like that anxiety is still quite present for you, particularly in situations involving young men. Can you think of any specific instances from the past week where this anxiety has affected you?

User: Yes, just the other day in class, when the young male teacher called on me, I felt my face get hot, and I completely blanked. I couldn't focus and missed out on some important points he was discussing—it was really embarrassing.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Zhang. It must have been frustrating to feel that way in class. Can you share with me what thoughts were going through your mind just before the teacher called on you?

User: I was just thinking that everyone would judge me if I said something wrong. I felt like all eyes were on me, and I started to panic about how I would look.

Consultant: I understand. Those thoughts of judgment from others can be very overwhelming. How do you think those thoughts affect your feelings in those moments?

User: They make me feel even more anxious and small. I just want to disappear because I feel like I can’t handle the pressure.

Consultant: It’s understandable to want to escape from such a stressful feeling. But I wonder, are there any thoughts that challenge that belief that everyone is judging you?

User: Sometimes I think that maybe they are too busy focusing on themselves to really care about what I say, but in the moment, it's hard to remember that.

Consultant: That’s a really insightful thought. It's true that people often focus on their own experiences. Let’s work together to hold onto that thought more. What could be a practical way to remind yourself of it in those moments of panic?

User: Maybe I could practice saying to myself, "Everyone has their own worries, and it’s okay if I make a mistake." But actually doing that is a different story.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Practicing self-talk like that can help reshape your response to stress. How about we create a small plan to gradually practice this thought in a safe space first?

User: Yes, that sounds good. I think starting in smaller situations may help.

Consultant: Excellent idea! What do you think would be a manageable situation for you to start practicing in? Perhaps a casual conversation with a classmate?

User: Talking to a classmate sounds doable. I could try starting a brief conversation after class.

Consultant: Perfect. Let's set that as your first step. After you do it, we can discuss how it went and how you felt about it. Are you willing to commit to that for our next session?

User: Yes, I’m willing to try that. I just hope I won't be too nervous.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous, and remember, it’s just a small step. You’re learning to challenge those feelings and thoughts. How do we want to handle the nerves when they start to creep in?

User: Maybe I could take a few deep breaths and remind myself that it’s okay to feel nervous but to just go for it anyway.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Zhang. Feelings of nervousness are just part of the process, and using deep breaths can really help. What else do you think you could do to prepare for that interaction?

User: I could maybe think of a few simple topics to talk about beforehand. That might make it easier.

Consultant: Great strategy! Having some topics in mind can definitely lighten the pressure. What interests you that you could bring up in casual conversation?

User: I could ask about our assignments or maybe talk about something funny that happened in class.

Consultant: I love those ideas—they’re light and open the door for conversation! How does it feel to have these strategies in place?

User: It feels a bit reassuring. I still have some fear, but having a plan is comforting.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that. Acknowledging that fear is part of the process, but you're also taking powerful steps forward. Let’s remember to celebrate that progress. As we continue, how do you feel about consistency and practicing these situations in your daily life?

User: I think if I practice regularly, I could start to feel more confident. But I know it will take time.

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s all about gradual exposure and giving yourself grace as you learn. It’s important to be patient with yourself. What are your thoughts on scheduling our next session to reflect on your experiences?

User: I think that would be helpful. I want to have the chance to talk about how it went and get feedback.

Consultant: That sounds perfect. I'm excited to hear about your progress. Remember, every small step counts, and you’re not alone in this journey. Let’s keep moving forward together, okay?

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful now. I'll do my best to work on it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Zhang. Take care until our next session, and remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. See you soon!

User: See you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! It's great to have you here today. I remember from our last session that you've been feeling anxious about interacting with male classmates. Could you share more about how you've been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling quite embarrassed, actually. I attended a class event, and instead of mingling, I sat alone because I was so scared to talk to the boys. I regret missing out on connecting with my classmates, but I just couldn't help myself.

Consultant: I understand that it must have been really difficult for you to feel that fear in a social situation. It's natural to feel regret about those missed opportunities. Can you tell me what went through your mind when you sat in that corner instead of joining the others?

User: I kept thinking that if I tried to talk, I would embarrass myself. I thought they would judge me, and I would end up making a fool of myself. It felt safer to just avoid it altogether.

Consultant: It seems like those thoughts about being judged made it challenging for you to engage. Let’s explore that a little further. What kind of evidence do you have that would suggest people would judge you negatively?

User: I don't really have specific examples, but I guess I've always felt awkward in social situations. I just assumed they wouldn’t want to talk to me or would think I'm strange.

Consultant: Those assumptions can definitely impact your willingness to engage. If a friend were in your shoes, what advice would you give them about those concerns?

User: I would probably tell them that it's okay to be awkward sometimes and that most people are just focused on having fun. Maybe they wouldn’t be as harsh as I think.

Consultant: That's a valuable perspective! It sounds like part of you recognizes that people aren't as critical as you sometimes believe. How might you apply that thought to your next social event?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s okay to feel awkward and that it’s better to try than to miss out. I could also try to engage in smaller conversations first.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Starting with smaller interactions might help you build your confidence. Are there any specific situations coming up where you could practice this approach?

User: There's another class event next week. I wonder if I could talk to just one person instead of feeling like I have to talk to everyone.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on one person can make it feel less overwhelming. What could be a good opener for you to start a conversation with someone?

User: Maybe I could ask them about a project we’re working on together? That feels less personal, and it’s a shared topic.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect icebreaker! It’s relevant and is likely to spark a conversation. How do you feel about practicing that at the upcoming event?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but excited too. I really want to try and break this cycle of avoiding.

Consultant: It’s great to see that excitement and willingness to face the fear! Remember, it’s all about small steps. What might be a reasonable goal for yourself during the event next week?

User: I think my goal could be to talk to at least one person, even if it’s just a quick chat. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Celebrating that small success will be important too. How would you plan to reward yourself afterward?

User: I could treat myself to something nice, like my favorite snack or some downtime to relax.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely reward. When you think about this upcoming event, what emotions do you experience now compared to when you first started talking about it?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful now, maybe less anxious because I have a plan. It’s still there, though.

Consultant: It’s great to see that shift toward hope! It’s understandable that you’d still feel some anxiety, but having a plan empowers you. As we wrap up today, what’s one key takeaway you’d like to focus on moving forward?

User: I want to focus on challenging my negative thoughts and reminding myself that social interactions can be positive.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway, Zhang! I'll be here to support you in that journey. Remember that it’s okay to take things one step at a time. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time we meet!

User: Thank you, I appreciate your support. I’ll work on my plan and see how it goes.

Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you today! I'm looking forward to our session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been trying to use the techniques we discussed before, but I still feel pretty anxious in social situations. I attended a family gathering recently, and there were some young men there. I really struggled to manage my nerves.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It's understandable to feel anxious in such situations. Can you tell me more about how you felt during the gathering and what techniques you tried to apply?

User: I felt really nervous while talking to them. I would get flushed and couldn't find the right words to say. I tried focusing on my breathing and reminding myself that it was okay to feel anxious, but it didn't help much once I was there.

Consultant: It sounds like you were aware of your nervousness and attempted to calm yourself, which is a positive step! Let’s explore your thoughts during the gathering. What were some of the specific worries that crossed your mind when you were interacting with them?

User: I kept thinking that they would judge me or find me awkward. I was worried they wouldn't want to talk to me, and that made it hard to engage with them.

Consultant: Those concerns are quite common in social situations. You mentioned feeling judged; how do you think those thoughts affected your emotions and behavior when interacting with them?

User: I think my anxiety made me come off as quiet and shy, which probably made the situation worse. I felt like I was just waiting for it to end.

Consultant: It makes sense that those thoughts would lead to feelings of anxiousness and withdrawal. Let's try to identify any cognitive distortions in those thoughts. Could there be another possible explanation or perspective that might not involve judgment from them?

User: Maybe they were just focused on their own conversations and didn’t actually notice how I was acting. But it’s hard for me to think that way in the moment.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a very insightful observation. Sometimes, we can be overly focused on ourselves and forget that others are often wrapped up in their own experiences. What if you were to consider that they might be more understanding than you think?

User: That does help a little to think about. I guess I could try to remind myself of that when I'm in those situations next time.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! It seems like challenging those negative thoughts could help you feel a bit more relaxed. Now, let’s shift our focus towards some practical strategies for those situations. What kinds of social interactions do you find most challenging?

User: I struggle mostly with small talk. I never know what to say, and I freeze up when it’s my turn to speak.

Consultant: Small talk can definitely be tricky! Let’s work on some starter questions or comments you can rely on. For example, asking about their interests or sharing something light about the environment you're in can help. Could we practice some scenarios together?

User: Sure, that sounds good! Maybe I could say something like, "What do you think about this party?" 

Consultant: That’s a great start! It opens up the conversation. Let's try role-playing—you can practice being the one who initiates the conversation while I respond. Ready?

User: Okay, let’s go!

Consultant: Great! Go ahead and start the conversation.

User: Hi! What do you think about this party?

Consultant: I think it's quite lively! The food is really nice. What about you—what’s your favorite part so far?

User: I like the snacks too! I’m just trying to enjoy myself, but I still feel nervous.

Consultant: That’s perfectly normal, and you’re doing well. Remember, it’s okay to pause and take a deep breath. It shows that you’re engaged. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt a bit easier when I said that! I actually had something to talk about instead of feeling stuck.

Consultant: Exactly! The more you practice, the more comfortable you’ll become. We can explore different scenarios and practice responses together. What do you think would be a good practice for you before your next gathering?

User: Maybe I could prepare a few more questions or topics beforehand to feel more confident?

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Bringing some prepared topics can make a big difference. How about we make a list of a few topics you can use in future conversations?

User: Yeah, I’d like that! I think having options would help ease my nerves.

Consultant: Let’s brainstorm together. You could include things like favorite movies, recent travels, or even current events. Are there any specific topics you enjoy that you might want to use?

User: I love talking about movies! I could ask about favorite films or recommendations.

Consultant: Fantastic choice! Movies are a great conversation starter. How does it feel to have some concrete topics prepared?

User: It feels reassuring! I think I’ll feel less pressure knowing I have things to fall back on.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s all about building your confidence gradually. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect—what’s one key takeaway you would like to remember?

User: I think it's about challenging my negative thoughts and being prepared. That could help me feel more in control.

Consultant: Absolutely! By recognizing those thoughts and having a few strategies, you’re taking great steps forward. Remember, it's normal to feel some anxiety, but you’re learning to manage it effectively. I'm proud of the progress you've made.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today. I feel a bit more optimistic about future social events.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It's been a pleasure working with you. Remember, it’s a journey, and every step counts. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Zhang! I'm glad to see you again today. Last time, we talked about how you've been feeling more patient and confident in your interactions with males. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've felt a bit better, actually. During the recent project with that boy, I was nervous, but I managed to communicate more naturally, which is a nice change for me.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It's a positive step that you're starting to feel more at ease in those interactions. Can you share a bit more about how interacting with him felt different this time?

User: I felt less panicked and was able to focus on the task rather than just my anxiety. It was a bit challenging, but I enjoyed it somewhat.

Consultant: It sounds like you were able to shift your focus from your anxiety to the collaborative effort. That’s a significant progress! What specific thoughts were you having during this interaction that helped you stay focused?

User: I kept reminding myself that it's just a project and that he is still a person like me. I told myself it's okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: That's an excellent strategy! By normalizing the experience and reducing pressure on yourself, you’re creating a more positive environment for interaction. How did those reminders affect your feelings during the project?

User: They helped me stay calmer and even made me smile a bit, which I think made him more relaxed too.

Consultant: That's great! It proves that our mindset can influence not only ourselves but also those around us. Now, reflecting on this experience, what do you hope for your next social situation with others, especially with males?

User: I hope to feel even more comfortable and maybe even initiate conversations instead of just responding.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Initiating conversations can feel daunting but also very rewarding. Can you think of a small step you might take to work towards that?

User: Maybe I could practice starting a chat during our next group project or social activity at school.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical approach! Practicing in a group setting can help ease any pressure. What would make starting that conversation easier for you?

User: Perhaps preparing a few topics or questions in advance could help me feel less stuck when trying to speak.

Consultant: That's a brilliant idea! Having a few conversation starters can boost your confidence. What kind of topics do you think might interest your peers?

User: I think discussing the project itself or asking about their experience in school might be good starters.

Consultant: Those are excellent choices! Focusing on shared experiences can make it easier to engage. How do you feel about trying this strategy in your next interaction?

User: I'm feeling more optimistic about it. Knowing I have a plan makes me less anxious. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Remember to be gentle with yourself—it's all part of the learning process. How about we set a small goal for our next session regarding these interactions?

User: I’d like to aim to start at least one conversation in the upcoming week, maybe even more if I feel comfortable.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful and achievable goal! We'll discuss how it went in our next session. How do you feel about your progress so far?

User: I feel really good. I appreciate seeing my improvement and having someone to talk through these situations with helps a lot.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It's important to acknowledge your achievements. As you continue to progress, remember that feelings of anxiety are natural. How can you support yourself if you find it difficult during an interaction?

User: I think I can remind myself of what I’ve learned, take a few deep breaths, and maybe step back for a moment if I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s a practical approach! Self-compassion and taking time for yourself are valuable skills. Is there anything else you want to discuss today?

User: I think we’ve covered a lot! Honestly, I’m just excited to see how things go next week.

Consultant: I'm excited for you too! Your determination to improve your social interactions is commendable. Let's continue building on this positive momentum. I’ll look forward to hearing about your experiences next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance. See you next time!

Consultant: You're welcome, Zhang! Until next time, take care and remember to celebrate your small wins along the way.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I’m glad to see you again. It sounds like you've been making progress since our last session. How are you feeling about your social interactions lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really happy about how things are going. The moment I talked to that classmate at the dance was thrilling, even though it was a bit awkward. It's like I finally did something to challenge myself.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re starting to embrace those moments of connection, even if they feel a little uncomfortable at times. Can you share more about what you enjoyed during that interaction?

User: Well, I felt nervous at first, but once we started talking, I realized I was actually enjoying it. I wasn’t as terrified as I usually am. We talked about our classes and even joked a little.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you found enjoyment in the conversation! It seems that those nerves are starting to ease. What do you think helped you feel a bit more at ease during that interaction?

User: I think it was just focusing on the conversation rather than how I was coming across. I was really curious about what he was saying, which distracted me from feeling too anxious.

Consultant: That's an excellent insight! Shifting your focus to the interaction rather than your feelings can help reduce anxiety. Let's build on that. What do you think your next step could be in continuing to practice these social skills?

User: Maybe I could try talking to more classmates or even join a club. It feels like a good way to practice without too much pressure.

Consultant: Joining a club sounds like a fantastic idea! Engaging with others in a structured environment can provide a valuable opportunity to connect. What kinds of clubs interest you?

User: I’ve always liked music, so maybe a music club. I also thought about a study group as a way to mingle with classmates more comfortably.

Consultant: Both options sound wonderful! They can help you find common ground with others. How would you feel about approaching one of these groups soon?

User: I’m a bit nervous, but also excited. It would be a great way to meet new people who share similar interests.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel both nervous and excited! Let’s explore some strategies to ease that anxiety when you approach these situations. What do you think you could do to prepare yourself before joining a group?

User: I could practice some small talk. Maybe have a few topics in mind to discuss, like our favorite music or classes.

Consultant: That's a smart strategy! Having a few conversation starters can build your confidence. How do you feel about role-playing some scenarios with me now?

User: Sure, that sounds helpful! I think doing a practice run could make me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you walk into the music club and see a few people chatting. You could start with, “Hi, I’m Zhang! I love music, what types do you enjoy?” How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds doable! It feels friendly and open, which is good.

Consultant: Exactly! The goal is to create a connection. Let’s try it. I’ll be the other person. “Hi Zhang! Nice to meet you. I’m Alex. I really love pop music. How about you?”

User: Hi, Alex! I enjoy pop too, but I also like classical music. It helps me relax while studying.

Consultant: “That’s interesting! I haven’t listened to much classical music. What’s your favorite piece?” 

User: My favorite piece is Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. It’s beautiful and calming.

Consultant: “I’ll have to check it out! Do you play any instruments?” 

User: No, but I want to start learning the piano. 

Consultant: You did wonderfully! See how flowing that felt? By sharing personal interests, it encourages a natural and engaging conversation. How did practicing that make you feel?

User: It felt good! I can see how easy it could be to connect with someone if we share interests.

Consultant: That’s exactly right! It’s all about finding common ground. Heading forward, what do you think your next steps will be after today’s practice?

User: I’ll try to find a music club this week and practice my small talk before going. I want to make sure I handle it better than before.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Zhang! Gradual exposure and practice will help reinforce your confidence. Remember, it’s okay to take your time. How do you feel about your ability to approach social situations now?

User: I feel more optimistic and less afraid. I believe I can handle it now, especially with some preparation.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! It’s essential to recognize your progress along the way. As we wrap up today, what key takeaway would you like to carry with you into your next social interaction?

User: I think I’ll focus on enjoying the conversation and not overthinking it, maybe even surprise myself with how well I can connect with others.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic takeaway, Zhang! Embracing the moment can make a big difference. Remember, I’m here to support you as you navigate this journey. Looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm so pleased to see you again today. Last time we spoke, you mentioned that you felt significantly less fearful in social situations and had a more positive attitude. How have things been since then?

User: Hi! Yes, I've noticed a big difference. I feel more comfortable interacting with my team members during our recent activities. It's like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some significant progress. Can you share a specific instance where you felt this change during your interactions?

User: Well, during our last group meeting, I actually spoke up and contributed my ideas without feeling anxious. I even made a few jokes, and everyone laughed!

Consultant: That sounds like a great achievement! Contributing your ideas and being able to joke around shows real growth. How did that experience make you feel?

User: It felt amazing, honestly. I realized I could be myself and that others appreciate my input. It gave me a confidence boost.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It’s great to hear that you felt appreciated. Confidence is such an important part of social interactions. Have you been able to use this newfound confidence in other areas of your life as well?

User: Yes, I think so. I’ve tried to engage more with my classmates rather than just keeping to myself. I even joined a study group, which is something I wouldn't have done before.

Consultant: That's an excellent step forward! Joining a study group can really enhance your connections and create a supportive environment for learning. How have those interactions been for you?

User: At first, I felt a bit anxious about it, but once we started studying together, it felt a lot more natural. Everyone was really supportive, and I ended up enjoying the experience.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that the anxiety subsided and that you enjoyed it. It seems like you are discovering that social situations can be positive experiences. What do you think has contributed to these changes?

User: I think participating in that team activity helped a lot. It made me realize I can be more relaxed around others and even have fun.

Consultant: That's a crucial insight. Engaging in activities where you can connect with people is impactful. As you look toward the future, are there any challenges you anticipate that might influence your social interactions?

User: I worry about the upcoming presentations in class. I don’t want to feel that anxiety again when speaking in front of the class.

Consultant: That’s a common concern, but it’s great that you’re thinking about it. We could work on some strategies to help you cope with those feelings. Would you be open to that?

User: Yes, definitely. I really want to handle that better.

Consultant: Perfect! One technique we could try is visualization. Imagine how you want the presentation to go, picturing yourself confident and calm while speaking. What do you think about this approach?

User: That sounds interesting. I’ve never thought of visualizing it that way.

Consultant: It's a powerful method! It can help reduce anxiety by preparing your mind for success. Let's practice that together. Can you envision how you would like to present confidently in front of your class?

User: Yes, I can see myself standing up there, speaking clearly, and even smiling. I can picture the classmates nodding and paying attention.

Consultant: Great job visualizing it! This imagery can be a motivational tool for you. When do you think would be a good time to practice this visualization before your presentation?

User: Maybe the night before? That way, I can remind myself of it right before I go to bed.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan. It’ll reinforce that confidence in your mind. Apart from this situation, how else do you think you can use your confidence in daily life?

User: I could start initiating conversations more, even with people I don’t know well. That feels a bit scary, but I think I could try.

Consultant: That’s a courageous goal! Starting small could make it easier. Perhaps you could try complimenting someone or making small talk with a classmate. How does that sound?

User: I like that idea. Even just starting with small things could be a good way to build up my confidence more.

Consultant: Exactly! Remember that every small step counts. It’s about progressing at a pace that feels right for you. How are you feeling about our discussion today?

User: I feel really motivated. I’ve recognized how far I’ve come, and I’m excited about applying these strategies.

Consultant: I’m thrilled to hear that! Your progress is commendable, and you have a solid plan moving forward. How about we summarize what you've taken away from this session?

User: I’m planning to visualize my presentation, start conversations with classmates, and remind myself of the positive experiences I’ve had recently.

Consultant: That sounds excellent! You’re taking proactive steps towards personal growth. As we wrap up today, remember that you have the strategies to continue building those social skills. If challenges arise, we can always discuss them in future sessions.

User: Thank you so much! This has been really helpful. I feel ready to face my next challenges.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhang! I’m proud of you for your progress. Take the time to reflect on everything you’ve learned and achieved. If you ever feel the need for support, I'm here for you. Goodbye for now, and take care!

User: Goodbye, and thank you!
