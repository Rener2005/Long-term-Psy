Consultant: Hi Linwen! Welcome back to our session. I'm glad you're here. Let's start by checking in on how you've been feeling lately, especially after the recent exams. What emotions have you been experiencing?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really down and ashamed after my exams. I didn't do well, and my teacher criticized me. It just makes me feel like I’m not good enough.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure and disappointment due to the criticism. It's understandable to feel this way when something important doesn't go as planned. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that come to your mind when you reflect on your exam results?

User: I just keep thinking that I’m a failure and that I’ll never be able to improve. I feel hopeless.

Consultant: Those are really heavy thoughts, Linwen. When you think about being a failure, how does that make you feel emotionally and physically?

User: It makes me feel anxious and makes my heart race. I just want to give up sometimes.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing this. It’s clear that you’re experiencing a lot of anxiety and frustration. Let’s explore those thoughts of “being a failure” a bit more. Can you think of any evidence that supports or contradicts that thought?

User: Well, sometimes I do okay in certain subjects, but when I do poorly, I just focus on that negative experience.

Consultant: That’s an important insight. It seems like you might be leaning towards an all-or-nothing perspective, where you see yourself as either successful or a failure, without recognizing the shades of grey. What would you say to a friend who felt the same way about their performance?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone struggles sometimes and that they shouldn’t be too hard on themselves.

Consultant: Exactly! You can extend that same kindness to yourself. Let’s try to challenge that thought of being a failure. What are some more balanced ways you can describe your abilities or your recent exam experience?

User: I guess I could say that I didn’t do well this time, but it doesn’t define my entire ability as a student.

Consultant: Yes! That’s a much healthier perspective. It's great that you can see that one bad exam doesn't erase your other strengths. Now, let's try to think about some specific steps you can take to improve. What actions could you take to prepare differently for your next exams?

User: Maybe I could study more regularly instead of cramming. I could ask my teachers for help too.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Developing a study routine can really help reduce anxiety and improve confidence. Let’s also think about how to handle those feelings of shame when they come up. What are some coping strategies you might try when you feel overwhelmed?

User: I could take deep breaths or talk to my grandma when I feel bad. That usually helps.

Consultant: Those sound like beneficial strategies, especially talking things out with your grandma. It’s important to have someone to share your feelings with. As we near the end of our session, what insights have you gained today about your thoughts and feelings?

User: I’ve realized that I need to be kinder to myself and that it’s okay to seek help. I just feel stuck sometimes.

Consultant: Recognizing that you need kindness and support is a fantastic step forward. It shows that you’re open to change, even if it feels hard right now. When facing those feelings of being stuck, remember the approaches we discussed today. How do you feel about taking some of these steps moving forward?

User: I think I can try. It feels daunting, but I want to break this cycle.

Consultant: That’s a strong commitment, Linwen! It’s okay to feel a bit overwhelmed; change takes time and effort. As we conclude our session, what strategies can you carry with you, especially for the challenges you might face soon?

User: I can focus on studying regularly and be aware of my self-talk. And if I feel bad, I can talk to my grandma.

Consultant: Those are good strategies to build upon. I’m proud of you for taking these steps! Remember, progress can be gradual, and you’ve got this. If you need additional support, don’t hesitate to reach out anytime. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Linwen. Take care, and I look forward to our next session together.

Consultant: Hello, Lin Wen! It's great to have you here today. How are you feeling about your studies and the recent challenges you've been facing?

User: Hi. I’m feeling really stressed about my homework. I got warned by my teacher because I haven't been completing it, and I'm worried that I might have to retake the class.

Consultant: It sounds overwhelming, and I can see how that would create a lot of pressure for you. What do you think about your ability to complete the homework and improve your situation?

User: I honestly feel like I can't change anything. No matter how hard I try, it seems like the same problems keep coming up. I just want to feel normal and get through it.

Consultant: It must be really frustrating to feel stuck. You mentioned wanting to feel "normal." What would that look like for you in terms of your academic life?

User: I guess I would want to do my homework on time and not feel anxious about it. I want to feel like I can participate in class without being scared of failing.

Consultant: That’s a great goal, Lin Wen. Let's explore what's making you anxious about the homework. Can you recall what thoughts go through your mind when you think about the assignments?

User: I think about how much I have to do and how I’ll probably mess it up again. It feels like just staring at the homework is too much for me.

Consultant: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry. When you think about those assignments, it seems those thoughts create a sense of hopelessness. Have you noticed how those thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: Yeah, I feel really upset and sometimes just want to give up. It makes me want to avoid doing anything at all, which makes the situation worse.

Consultant: It sounds like these thoughts and feelings trigger a cycle where it becomes easier to avoid the work. Let's consider those thoughts for a moment. Do you think they’re vastly true, or could there be other perspectives we can look at?

User: It feels true when I think about how I've struggled before, but maybe I could try a different way to look at it.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! What do you think another perspective might be? If you were advising a friend in your situation, what would you say to them?

User: I guess I would tell them that everyone struggles sometimes and that trying is what matters, not just succeeding every time.

Consultant: Exactly! Trying is a key part of the process. Let’s think about some small strategies you could use to help ease that anxiety when facing your homework. What do you think you could do to break things down into manageable steps?

User: Maybe I could set a timer and work on a small piece at a time, instead of looking at it all at once. That might help to not feel so overwhelmed.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea, Lin Wen! Setting a timer can create a sense of urgency and help you focus on one task at a time. How do you feel about implementing that the next time you have an assignment?

User: I think it could help. It feels better thinking that I can tackle it piece by piece rather than seeing it as a huge burden.

Consultant: That's an excellent mindset. By changing how you approach the homework, you can cultivate a more positive experience. In addition, could you record your daily progress as a way to reflect on these small successes?

User: Yeah, I like that idea! If I can see that I made progress, it might help boost my confidence.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing those small achievements can really help build your confidence over time. What do you think you could write down at the end of each study session?

User: I could note how much I completed and how I felt while doing it. That way, I can see that I’m actually making an effort.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan. As we wrap up today’s session, how do you feel about moving forward with these strategies? 

User: I feel a little more hopeful. I think with time, I can change how I handle my studies.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Lin Wen. Just remember to be kind to yourself as you implement these changes. If you face any challenges or need to talk, I'm here for you. 

User: Thank you! That means a lot. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.

Consultant: Hello, Lin Wen! I'm glad you could make it today. I want to start by checking in on how you've been feeling since our last session. Can you tell me what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been thinking about what happened with my classmates. I tried to participate in an extracurricular activity, but I didn’t perform very well. They laughed at me, and I felt really embarrassed. It makes me not want to socialize.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. Feeling embarrassed after being laughed at can be very disheartening. You mentioned wanting to learn how to cope with negative feedback. Can you share what you felt in that moment when they laughed?

User: I just wanted to disappear. I felt like everyone was judging me. It made me doubt myself even more. I really want to fit in but feel like I keep failing.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. Wanting to belong while feeling judged can create a lot of tension. Let’s explore this together. What thoughts crossed your mind about yourself during that experience?

User: I kept thinking, “I’m not good enough.” I thought my classmates would never accept me.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very heavy and negative. It’s important to recognize when these thoughts arise. How do they affect your feelings or actions afterward?

User: They make me want to isolate myself. I don’t want to get hurt again, so I just stay quiet and avoid them. I feel sad and lonely.

Consultant: Avoiding social interactions can indeed lead to feelings of loneliness, and it seems like you're caught in a cycle. What if we could find ways to challenge those "I’m not good enough" thoughts? Are there any examples that suggest you might be competent or accepted by others?

User: Sometimes, a few classmates tell me I did well on assignments. But then I think they are just being polite.

Consultant: It's positive that some classmates acknowledge your work. It might help to question, “Is it possible that they genuinely appreciate my effort?” Can we explore what might happen if you chose to believe their compliments instead of dismissing them?

User: I guess I could try. But it feels very strange to think that way. 

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel uneasy about shifting your perspective. How about we practice challenging those thoughts together? What would be the evidence for and against the thought “I’m not good enough”?

User: Well, I’ve done well in some subjects before. And teachers have praised my efforts too. 

Consultant: That’s excellent! It sounds like you have a foundation of success to build upon. What would you tell a friend who feels the same way about themselves?

User: I would probably say they are doing better than they think and should keep trying.

Consultant: Exactly! You have a supportive attitude toward others. Can you try applying that same kindness to yourself? What might you say to yourself if you were in their shoes?

User: Maybe I could say, “It’s okay to not be perfect, just keep trying.” 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic reframe! Let’s create a small plan together. How about setting a goal to engage positively with classmates in a low-pressure way? 

User: That sounds okay. But what if they still don’t accept me?

Consultant: It’s normal to worry about that. Remember, not every interaction has to go perfectly, but each step you take can build your confidence. What’s one small way you could interact with a classmate this week?

User: I could try to talk to someone about school projects. I know a few classmates are working on the same things.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful step! Engaging in shared interests is a great way to connect. Let’s check in on how that goes next time. 

User: Okay. I’ll try to remember to focus on my strengths when I feel down.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It might also help to keep a list of your accomplishments handy. Each time you feel low, you can remind yourself of your strengths. 

User: I like that idea. I will start writing things down.

Consultant: Excellent! We’re working towards building your self-esteem step by step. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to have ups and downs along the way. 

User: Thanks for your support. I appreciate it a lot. 

Consultant: Of course! You’re doing the hard work, and I’m here to help. We’ll continue to explore your thoughts and feelings, but for now, I want you to reflect on the changes you're making. 

User: I will. I feel a bit more hopeful. 

Consultant: That’s great to hear, Lin Wen! I’m glad our conversation today has brought you some hope. Remember, it’s all about progress—not perfection. 

User: I understand. I’ll take it one step at a time.

Consultant: Exactly! We’ll build on these steps. For our next session, think of any interactions you had or any reflections you want to share. I’m looking forward to hearing about it.

User: Thank you! I will prepare for that.

Consultant: You’re welcome! It was great talking with you today. Remember, I believe in your ability to navigate these challenges. 

User: Thanks! I feel more capable now. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. See you next time, Lin Wen, and take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Lin Wen, welcome back! I'm glad to see you again. Last time we spoke about how you felt frustrated and lonely regarding your family situation. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I still feel pretty much the same. I talked to my grandma again about my feelings, but it didn't seem to help. I still feel disappointed with my parents and their relationship.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re still struggling with feelings of disappointment and loneliness, especially regarding your parents. That can be really tough. What about your conversation with your grandma made you feel like it didn't help?

User: I thought maybe she would understand me better this time, but she just told me to focus on my studies and not think about my parents so much. It felt like she didn’t really get my feelings.

Consultant: I can see how that would be frustrating, especially when you’re hoping for understanding and support. Do you think part of your struggle is that you feel unheard or misunderstood by your family?

User: Yes, definitely! I really need someone to listen to me and not just push me to move on. I feel like I'm carrying all this weight alone.

Consultant: That feeling of carrying a heavy weight alone can be very isolating. It's important to have someone listen and validate your feelings. Can you share more about what you wish your family would do differently to support you?

User: I wish they would just acknowledge how I feel. It would help if they could talk to me, even just to say they care or that they understand how hard this is for me.

Consultant: I understand. Acknowledgment and support can make a big difference. It's like seeking connection, right? How do you feel when you think about expressing this need for acknowledgment to your family?

User: I feel kind of scared. What if they don’t understand? Or worse, what if they dismiss my feelings again like they always do?

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel scared about voicing your feelings, especially when previous attempts have been met with dismissal. Let's explore those fears a bit deeper. What evidence do you have that they might dismiss your feelings again?

User: I just think back to how they reacted last time. It makes me believe they won’t change, and that makes me feel hopeless.

Consultant: Holding onto past experiences can certainly shape our expectations for the future. What if we questioned that belief? Is there a possibility that they could respond differently this time?

User: Maybe? But I’m not very optimistic about it. I just feel like they’ve shown me who they are.

Consultant: I hear you. It’s tough to regain hope when past situations have been disappointing. However, reflecting on how people can grow and change could be a way to open the door just a little bit. What if we think about what small steps you could take, if you were to talk to them again?

User: I guess I could start by telling them how I feel, but I just don’t know how to say it without sounding dramatic.

Consultant: That’s a great starting point! Maybe we can work on framing your feelings in a way that feels comfortable for you. Would you be willing to share how you feel in a calm and straightforward way? 

User: I could try that. I just want them to understand that it’s not just about my grades. It’s about how I feel lost too.

Consultant: That sounds like a good idea. By voicing how you feel lost, you’re highlighting the deeper emotions behind the grades. What would it mean for you if they responded positively to that?

User: It would mean a lot. I think it would help me feel like there’s still a chance for connection, and maybe I wouldn’t feel so alone anymore.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight. The hope of connection is a strong motivator. Would you like to set an intention to express this feeling this week? 

User: I think so. If I could just find the right moment to share it, that would help me a lot.

Consultant: Finding the right moment is important. What strategies can we brainstorm together to make that conversation easier for you?

User: Maybe writing down what I want to say could help me organize my thoughts and feel less anxious about it.

Consultant: Writing can definitely help clarify your thoughts and feelings. It gives you a chance to articulate everything you want to say before the conversation. How does that sound?

User: Yeah, that sounds good! I think I’ll try doing that.

Consultant: Wonderful! It’s great to hear that you’re feeling a bit more empowered to take this step. How about we check in next time about how that conversation went and how it made you feel?

User: I would like that. I hope it goes well. 

Consultant: I believe in your ability to express yourself, Lin Wen. Remember, it’s a process, and taking this step is already showing progress. Looking forward to hearing about it in our next session. 

User: Thank you for your support. I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been wonderful to see you open up today. Keep nurturing that hope, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hi Lin Wen! It's great to see you today. I'm glad you've come in for this session. How have you been feeling since our last talk?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better because I started writing down my small achievements every day. It feels nice to see that I'm making some progress, even if it's just a little bit.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Acknowledging and celebrating your small achievements can make a big difference in your feelings about yourself. What specific achievements have you noted down recently?

User: I recorded when I completed my homework on time and when I helped my grandmother with chores. They seemed small, but they made me feel a bit proud.

Consultant: Those are meaningful accomplishments, Lin Wen! Helping others and managing your responsibilities are significant steps. How did it feel for you to write these down and reflect on them?

User: It felt good! It's like I realized I can do things and make a difference, even if they are small tasks. I just hope I can keep feeling this way.

Consultant: Absolutely! It's important to recognize that every little step counts. What do you think might help you continue to build on those achievements and maintain this positive feeling?

User: Maybe setting more small goals could help. I heard my teachers talk about that, but I wasn't sure how to start.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Setting small, achievable goals can help you maintain your motivation. Why don't we explore some specific goals you'd like to set for yourself? What areas in your life would you like to focus on?

User: I think I'd like to work on my studies more. I struggle with math, and I want to improve before the exams.

Consultant: Improving in math is a wonderful goal! How about we break that down into smaller steps? You might start by aiming to practice a certain number of math problems each day. Does that sound doable?

User: Yes, that sounds reasonable. Maybe I can try doing five math problems a day.

Consultant: That’s an excellent start, Lin Wen! Completing five problems daily can help build your confidence and understanding over time. How do you feel about keeping track of this goal as you go along?

User: I think keeping a record of my progress would be helpful. It might motivate me to stick with it.

Consultant: Great! Keeping a record will reinforce your sense of achievement. Also, remember to acknowledge your efforts, even if you don't get everything right. How might you celebrate or reward yourself when you reach this daily goal?

User: I could allow myself some time to play video games or watch an episode of my favorite show.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect reward! Balancing work and play is key. Let's also consider how you're feeling overall about these achievements and setting goals. Do you think discussing your progress with someone might help, too?

User: I haven’t thought about sharing it with others, but it might be good. I usually keep things to myself.

Consultant: Sharing your achievements with friends or family, like your grandmother, could help reinforce your sense of accomplishment. It’s nice to celebrate victories together. How do you think they'd react to hearing about your math goals?

User: They would probably be supportive and proud of me. My grandmother always encourages me.

Consultant: That support from your grandmother can be very uplifting. It's wonderful to have someone to share your progress with. What do you think about making plans to share your achievements with her after a week of working on your math goals?

User: I like that idea! I could tell her how it went and maybe ask her to help me with math sometimes, too.

Consultant: Involving her could be a great way for you to connect and learn together. It sounds like you’re building a positive support system. How does that make you feel about both your goals and your relationship with her?

User: It makes me feel happy and more confident. I think it’s nice to have someone to share with.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear, Lin Wen! Having supportive relationships can significantly boost your self-esteem and motivation. As we continue working together, what strategies do you think we'll need to keep this momentum going?

User: I think keeping track of my goals, sharing with my grandmother, and celebrating small victories will all help a lot.

Consultant: Absolutely! Celebrating small victories is a powerful tool. As we wrap up today, can we take a moment to reflect on your progress and what you hope to focus on moving forward?

User: Sure! I feel more positive now, and I'm looking forward to practicing math and sharing with my grandmother.

Consultant: That’s excellent! Your positivity and willingness to share your experiences are commendable steps. Moving forward, remember that every small achievement contributes to your growth. It’s been a pleasure to see your progress, Lin Wen. I believe in your ability to maintain this positive momentum!

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about the future.

Consultant: You’re welcome! Remember, I’m here to support you anytime you need guidance. Don’t hesitate to return if you’d like to discuss more. Keep up the excellent work, Lin Wen!

User: I will! Thanks for everything today!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Lin Wen! I'm glad to see you today. It seems like you've made some positive changes recently. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling regarding your new friendships and social interactions?

User: Hi! Yes, I'm actually really happy about making new friends. It’s nice to feel connected with others. I look forward to spending time with them and it makes me feel more confident about myself.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like these friendships are giving you a sense of belonging and boosting your self-esteem. Can you share an experience you had recently that made you feel particularly connected with your peers?

User: Just last week, we had a group project, and I felt included in the discussions. I was able to share my ideas, and they seemed to appreciate my input. It made me feel pretty good about myself.

Consultant: It sounds like that was a really positive experience for you, where you felt valued by your peers. How do you think this has impacted your overall mood and self-perception?

User: I think I'm feeling less down and more hopeful about my future. I even feel like I can actually contribute to conversations, which is something I struggled with before.

Consultant: It's great to see that you're feeling hopeful and more capable of contributing! Let's explore ways to maintain this positive trajectory. What are some things you can do to continue nurturing these friendships and your self-worth?

User: I guess I could try to initiate more conversations and suggest activities to do together. I don’t want to lose this connection, so I’d like to keep being proactive.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Taking the initiative can strengthen those bonds further. What specific activities did you have in mind to suggest to them?

User: Maybe we could go to a movie or play some games together. I think that would be fun and help us get closer.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Social activities can really help deepen your connections. Besides these friendships, are there other areas of your life where you feel you could grow or improve your self-esteem?

User: I’d like to feel more confident in my studies as well. Sometimes, I still feel overwhelmed, especially when I think about tests or schoolwork.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed, especially with the academic pressures. How can we work together to balance your social life with your academic goals? 

User: I think I need to set a study schedule that allows me time to hang out with friends too. Balancing both might help me feel less stressed.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach. A well-structured schedule can provide the clarity you need to manage your time effectively. What might that schedule look like for you?

User: I could set specific hours for studying and then reward myself with hanging out or relaxing afterward. Maybe study for an hour and then take a short break.

Consultant: Excellent strategy! Rewarding yourself can motivate you to stick to your schedule. How do you feel about implementing this plan for the next week?

User: I feel excited about it! Having a plan makes me feel more in control. I think it will help ease my anxiety about school.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! Control and organization can help reduce anxiety. Let’s also think about how you can reflect on your feelings regularly as you implement this plan. What might that look like for you?

User: I could keep a journal to note my successes and how I'm feeling each day. This could help me see my progress.

Consultant: Great idea! Journaling is a wonderful way to track your development and emotions. It allows you to reflect and recognize your progress. How does that resonate with you?

User: I think it will help me a lot. I can look back and see how far I’ve come, especially on the days I feel down.

Consultant: Absolutely! This reflection can help you maintain perspective during tough days. As we wrap up today’s session, what are the key takeaways you’d like to remember?

User: I want to focus on maintaining my friendships, implementing a study schedule, and keeping a journal of my feelings and progress.

Consultant: Those are insightful points to carry forward. You've been working hard on your growth, and I'm confident you can continue on this path. Remember, it’s okay to seek support whenever you feel overwhelmed. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel really good! It’s reassuring to talk about these things, and I’m motivated to take action.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Lin Wen! You've made great strides, and I'm proud of your progress. If you keep up this enthusiasm, I know you’ll reach your goals. Until next time!

User: Thank you so much! I’ll see you next time.
