Consultant: Hello, Bi. It's nice to see you again. I understand this has been a tough time for you. How are you feeling today?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’m still feeling really down. My grandma passing away hit me hard, and then I had that breakup with the girl I liked. I just don’t know how to move on from all this.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve been carrying a lot of emotional weight lately. Losing someone close can leave a deep impact, and a breakup can compound those feelings. Can you share more about how these experiences are affecting your daily life?

User: Well, I feel lost. My motivation for studying is gone, and I can't focus at all. I keep thinking about what went wrong in my relationship, and it just makes me feel worse. 

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, Bi. It’s natural to feel this way after such significant events. Let’s explore your thoughts about these experiences. What kind of thoughts come to your mind when you think about your breakup or your grandma’s passing?

User: I keep thinking maybe I wasn’t good enough for her, or that I should have done something different. With my grandma, I just feel like I let her down by not being able to make her proud.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy to bear. It seems like you’re being quite hard on yourself. Let’s try to unpack those feelings a bit more. Can you identify any specific negative thoughts you have about yourself stemming from these events?

User: I feel really worthless sometimes, like I'll never be good enough for anyone. I think that’s why I get so anxious about my future and my studies.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Bi. It’s understandable that these feelings would affect your self-esteem and academic performance. Let’s assess the evidence for those beliefs. What specific evidence do you have to support the idea that you’re not good enough?

User: I guess there isn't much concrete evidence, but I just feel like if I was better, things would have gone differently. 

Consultant: It's common for us to feel that way, especially when we’re going through tough times. Can we challenge that thought together? If a friend were in your situation, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably say that it’s not their fault, and that everyone makes mistakes. But it’s hard to believe that for myself.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective to have, Bi. Instead of holding yourself to an impossible standard, it’s important to recognize that everyone experiences struggles. Let’s try to find some alternative ways to view yourself. What are some of your strengths or qualities that you appreciate?

User: I guess I’m a good listener, and I try to be understanding of others' feelings. I’ve always been there for my friends.

Consultant: Those are wonderful qualities, Bi! It's important to acknowledge your strengths because they contribute to your worth as a person. Let’s explore ways to apply those strengths to help you cope with your current feelings. What actions can you take that reflect your qualities as a good friend or listener?

User: Maybe I could reach out to friends more and let them know how I’m feeling instead of just keeping everything bottled up.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step! Connecting with others can help alleviate feelings of isolation. How might you approach this in a way that feels comfortable for you?

User: I think I could start with texting a few friends. I haven’t talked about how I feel in a while, so it might be good to express that.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive plan, Bi. Expressing your feelings can be incredibly helpful. Alongside this, let’s think about setting smaller goals for your studies that feel manageable. What’s one small step you can take today to start building back your motivation?

User: I could try studying for just 30 minutes today. It’s not much, but it feels less overwhelming than the full workload.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Starting small can really help in regaining motivation. How will you feel after accomplishing that 30-minute study session?

User: I think it would give me a little boost, maybe make me feel like I’m still capable of handling things.

Consultant: Exactly! Celebrating those small wins is crucial. They can help shift your mindset over time. As we continue to work together, we’ll find ways to cultivate more of those positive experiences. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel a bit lighter, actually. Talking about my thoughts and starting to challenge them helps. I still have a long way to go, but it’s a start.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Bi. It’s absolutely okay to take things one step at a time. We’ll keep building on this progress together. In our next session, we can focus more on practical strategies for managing your emotions and relationship patterns. Does that sound good to you?

User: Yes, that sounds really helpful. Thank you for today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Bi! Remember, it’s a journey, and I’m here to support you. Let’s keep working on this together. Take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Bi! I'm glad you're here today. Before we dive in, could you share with me how you've been feeling lately and what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. To be honest, I've been really pessimistic about things. I'm still struggling to move on from my recent breakup, and my anxiety about my studies is only getting worse. I'm worried I won't do well in my final year.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of emotional turmoil and it’s affecting your studies. Can you tell me more about the feelings you've been having since the breakup?

User: Well, I feel really lost and unmotivated. I’ve tried reading and joining some clubs to distract myself, but my mind just keeps drifting back to how I feel. I feel like nothing really helps.

Consultant: It seems like you're trying to engage in activities to distract yourself, but it’s not relieving the underlying emotions. This feeling of being lost can be quite overwhelming. What emotions does this bring up for you when you think about your studies and the breakup?

User: I guess I feel a lot of sadness and frustration. It’s like I can’t control how I feel, and I keep questioning why things turned out this way.

Consultant: Those feelings of sadness and frustration are completely understandable, especially given the changes in your life. You mentioned feeling like you can't control your emotions. Can you identify any specific thoughts that accompany these emotions?

User: Sometimes, I catch myself thinking that I'll never be happy again or that I'm not good enough to succeed in my studies. 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite negative and heavy. It's important to recognize how they could be influencing your emotional state. How do these thoughts affect your mood and motivation to study?

User: They really bring me down. When I think I won't be happy again, it makes it hard to find the will to sit down and study. I just feel like giving up.

Consultant: I can hear how powerful those thoughts are for you. Let’s work together to challenge them. For instance, what evidence do you have that you won’t be happy again? 

User: I guess I don't really have any strong evidence. It's just a feeling that I can’t shake off.

Consultant: That acknowledgment is a crucial step. Feelings can often distort our reality. If a friend was in your position, what would you tell them about their future happiness?

User: I would probably tell them that it's tough now, but things can change, and they will find happiness again.

Consultant: Exactly! You already have a more hopeful perspective when thinking about someone else. Let’s apply this to your situation. What if you allowed yourself to believe that you could also find happiness in the future?

User: That does seem more optimistic. Maybe I just need to give it time.

Consultant: Time is important, and so is actively working towards finding joy. Let's discuss some small actions you can take to rediscover joy in your routine. What activities have you enjoyed in the past?

User: I used to love painting and hiking, but I haven’t done much of that lately.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful activities! How about we set a goal for you to incorporate one of them into your week? This could be a step towards improving your mood.

User: That sounds good. I think I could try to go hiking this weekend. 

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Getting outside and being active can be really helpful for your emotional state. What other strategies can we brainstorm together to help you manage your emotions during tough times?

User: Maybe I could try journaling to express what I feel without holding back.

Consultant: Journaling can be a powerful tool for processing emotions. It creates space for reflection. How do you feel about making it a regular practice after your hikes or study sessions?

User: I think I could try that. It might help to get my thoughts out instead of keeping them bottled up.

Consultant: Absolutely, and you can decide what you want to write about—there are no wrong feelings or thoughts. As we move forward, it’s also important to recognize the moments when you feel your emotions starting to spiral. What signs do you notice that indicate you might be feeling overwhelmed?

User: I usually become really quiet, and sometimes I feel my chest getting tight when I start to think about my studies.

Consultant: Noticing those signs is essential. What if we develop a kind of “action plan” for when you recognize those signs? You could implement techniques like deep breathing or taking a short walk to clear your mind. How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful. I could definitely try the breathing exercises, especially during my study sessions.

Consultant: Fantastic! Incorporating those strategies can empower you to manage your emotions more effectively. Let’s also think about your studies. What triggers your anxiety about them currently?

User: When I look at all the assignments left to complete, it feels overwhelming. I worry I won’t be able to keep up.

Consultant: That’s a common feeling among students, especially when faced with high demands. What if we break down those assignments into smaller, more manageable tasks to help alleviate that overwhelm?

User: I think breaking them down might make it less stressful. I’ll give that a try.

Consultant: Great! Remember, progress takes time, and each small step counts. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed and the action steps you want to take moving forward.

User: I’ll go hiking this weekend, start journaling, practice deep breathing, and break my assignments down into manageable parts. 

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! I’m proud of you for taking these steps. Remember, it’s okay to reach out for support whenever you need it. I believe you have the strength to navigate through this tough time. How do you feel about this session overall?

User: I feel more hopeful and a bit lighter. Thank you for guiding me through this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Bi! It was a pleasure to talk with you. I'm looking forward to seeing how these strategies help you in our next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Bi! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling pretty down. I had a situation with a friend recently where I really lost my temper, and then I just felt terrible about it. I’m worried about losing control of my emotions again.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience really affected you. You felt a strong emotional reaction and then some regret afterward. What do you think triggered that loss of control?

User: I think it was just a small disagreement, but it quickly escalated. I guess I just felt really frustrated and didn't know how to handle it. It’s embarrassing to lose my cool like that.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way, Bi. Emotional reactions can be overwhelming, especially during disagreements. Can you tell me more about the thoughts you had during that moment? What was going through your mind?

User: I remember thinking that my friend didn’t respect my opinion. I felt like I had to defend myself, and then I just snapped. Afterward, I thought maybe I really am not good at handling conflicts.

Consultant: It sounds like you felt disrespected and that led to a defensive reaction. Those thoughts about not being good at handling conflicts can be quite damaging. How did that make you feel about yourself afterwards?

User: It just made me feel more insecure. I thought it was proof that I’m not cut out for socializing or that I can't manage my emotions properly.

Consultant: I can see how that could shake your confidence, but it's important to recognize that everyone has moments like that. Let's work on identifying those automatic thoughts and seeing if they are truly accurate. When you think, "I'm not good at handling conflicts," what emotions do you experience?

User: I usually feel anxious and a sense of failure. It makes me want to avoid situations where I may have to confront something.

Consultant: Avoidance might seem like a solution in the short term, but can also reinforce those feelings of anxiety. If you were to face a similar situation again, what would you want to feel instead?

User: I would like to feel calm and able to express my point of view without getting upset. I want to communicate better.

Consultant: That's a great goal, Bi! Feeling calm and communicating effectively are both achievable. What do you think could help you achieve that state during a disagreement?

User: Maybe I could practice staying calm and taking deep breaths? I don't know if that would work, though.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a good strategy! It can help you manage your emotions in the moment. We could also explore some role-playing scenarios where you practice expressing your feelings calmly. Does that sound helpful?

User: Yes, that does sound helpful. It would be nice to have a plan in place.

Consultant: Fantastic! Let's start by envisioning a situation where you might feel challenged. How would you like to respond in a positive way instead of losing your cool?

User: I guess I would like to first listen to the other person and then share my thoughts, rather than just reacting.

Consultant: That’s a constructive approach! Listening can really diffuse tension. What kind of phrases could you use to express your thoughts when you feel calm?

User: I could say something like, "I understand your point, but here’s how I feel about it…" 

Consultant: Perfect! That shows respect and allows space for dialogue. Practicing that kind of communication can help you feel more in control. How do you feel about trying out some role-play on this?

User: I think practicing it would really help me. I’m kind of nervous, but I want to try.

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel nervous, but remember, this is a safe space for practice. We can take it step by step. Let’s imagine a disagreement where you use the listening approach and then express your feelings. Ready to give it a go?

User: Yes, I’ll try. 

Consultant: Great! Imagine I'm your friend and I just expressed my disagreement with you. How would you react?

User: Okay. I would say, "I understand where you’re coming from. I feel differently, but I’d like to explain my view…” 

Consultant: That was a fantastic start! You conveyed understanding while sharing your perspective. As you practice this, how do you think it would make you feel to approach conflicts this way?

User: I think it would make me feel more confident. Maybe I wouldn't feel like I’m losing control.

Consultant: Exactly! Confidence in expressing yourself can change how you feel in those moments. Let's work on maintaining that perspective. Also, remember to acknowledge your feelings during this process. How are you feeling about emotional management now compared to when you first came in?

User: I’m feeling a little better. There’s still a bit of doubt, but I can see the path forward. 

Consultant: That’s a significant improvement! Doubt is natural, but you seem committed to trying new approaches. What steps will you take this week to practice these skills in your daily interactions?

User: I’ll practice talking to myself about how to respond calmly before conversations and maybe role-play with someone I trust.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Practicing with someone you trust can really reinforce your new skills. As we wrap up today, remember this progress you’re making. Trust in yourself to carry this forward. 

User: Thank you. I feel like I have a better sense of direction now. 

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that, Bi! It’s all about taking those small steps. I look forward to hearing how your practice goes in our next session. You've got this! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I’m starting to enjoy my new social activities, but I still have some doubts about whether I can maintain this positive feeling.

Consultant: That's great to hear that you've had some emotional improvement! It's completely normal to have doubts when experiencing new things. Can you tell me more about what you've enjoyed in these social activities?

User: Well, I recently participated in a campus event and made some new friends. It was exciting to meet people, but I also worry about whether they will continue to want to hang out with me.

Consultant: It's wonderful that you've started to engage socially! Making new friends can definitely bring a mix of excitement and anxiety. What kinds of thoughts are running through your mind when you think about maintaining these friendships?

User: I often think that maybe they won't really like me or that I'm not interesting enough. It makes me feel insecure.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound challenging to deal with. It's not uncommon to question our worth in social situations. What feelings come up for you when you think those thoughts about being uninteresting?

User: I usually feel sad and kind of anxious. It’s like I’m afraid of being judged.

Consultant: I understand. Feeling judged can be really tough. Let's take a moment to explore those judgments. Can you identify if there are any specific situations where you felt particularly judged, or is it more of a general feeling?

User: It’s more of a general feeling. I'm not sure if it's based on anything concrete, but I just feel like I don’t quite fit in sometimes.

Consultant: That feeling of not fitting in can be very isolating, and it’s valid to feel that way. Sometimes our minds can exaggerate those feelings. What would you say to a friend who expressed these same worries about fitting in?

User: I would probably tell them that they are great just as they are and that their worth isn’t defined by other people's opinions.

Consultant: That's a kind and supportive response! It shows that you understand the concept of self-worth. Now, how might it feel to apply that same understanding to yourself?

User: I suppose I could remind myself that my value isn't dependent on others’ perceptions. That could help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing your own worth is crucial. Moving forward, could we explore ways for you to strengthen these positive feelings from your new social experiences?

User: Yes, I would like that! I want to make sure I can keep feeling good about these interactions.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan. One strategy could be to keep a journal of your positive social experiences. How does that sound to you?

User: I think that could be helpful. It might make me remember the good times and build my confidence.

Consultant: Definitely! Reflecting on positive experiences can enhance your mood and help you savor those moments. Could you try writing down at least one positive interaction each week?

User: Yes, I can do that! It'll be a good reminder of my progress.

Consultant: Great! As you do this, pay attention to any feelings or thoughts that come up. This will help you discover patterns in what makes you feel good in these social situations. How do you feel about that idea?

User: I feel more optimistic about it. I think it can really help me focus on the positives.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s a step towards reinforcing those positive emotions. Is there anything specific you’re looking forward to in your social life for the coming week?

User: I have plans to hang out with some friends I met at the campus event. I hope it goes well!

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Remember, it’s okay to feel a bit nervous, but focus on enjoying the moment with them. What’s one thing you would like to do during this hangout?

User: Maybe just have fun playing some games and chatting. I want to be myself and relax.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Engaging in activities you enjoy will help you feel more comfortable. Do you have any strategies for relaxing before the event?

User: I might listen to some music or do some deep breathing exercises to calm my nerves.

Consultant: Those are excellent techniques! Music can really uplift your mood, and deep breathing is a great way to ground yourself. Would you like to set a reminder for yourself to practice this before the hangout?

User: Yes, I think setting a reminder can help me stick to it!

Consultant: Perfect! Staying proactive about your relaxation can make a big difference. Before we wrap up today, what’s one takeaway you’d like to remember from our session?

User: I want to remember that I can acknowledge my worth and focus on enjoying my time with friends without worrying about what they think of me.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway! I believe you can maintain and even enhance those positive feelings. As we conclude today's session, how do you feel about your progress?

User: I feel more confident and ready to take on new social experiences!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it's all about taking one step at a time. I’m here to support you, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need help in the future. Enjoy every moment and keep celebrating your progress!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I'll keep working on this.
###################
Consultant: Hello there, it's great to see you today! I’m really looking forward to our conversation. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good actually. After participating in the club election at school, I felt a real sense of achievement. It was nice to be recognized, and it boosted my confidence a bit.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like that experience had a positive impact on your self-esteem. Can you share more about how this achievement affected your feelings and your daily life?

User: Well, I feel a bit more motivated to engage in other activities and meet new people. It's like I realized I can actually contribute to something. But sometimes, I still doubt myself, especially when I think about my academic performance.

Consultant: I can see how that sense of achievement in the club has allowed you to explore new opportunities, yet those lingering doubts about academics can still feel heavy. What do you think is causing those doubts about your academic abilities?

User: I guess I've always struggled with feeling good enough, especially compared to others. Sometimes, I think I might not be as capable as they are, and that leads to my procrastination.

Consultant: It's really insightful of you to recognize that link between self-doubt and procrastination. When those thoughts of not being good enough come up, how do they affect your emotions or motivation?

User: They often make me feel anxious and overwhelmed. I end up avoiding my studies because I worry I won't meet my own expectations.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel anxious in that situation. Those feelings sound quite intense. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. Can you recall a specific moment when you felt that way? What were you thinking at that time?

User: I remember last week, I had an assignment due. I kept thinking, "What if I fail?" It made me not even want to start working on it. 

Consultant: That’s a tough place to be in. You experienced fear of failure, which led to avoidance. If a friend were in your shoes, how might you advise them to handle that thought of “What if I fail?”

User: I would probably tell them to just try their best and that it’s okay to make mistakes. I’d encourage them to start small and take it step by step.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate approach! It seems you have a nurturing side that understands progress can come from small steps. How could you apply that same advice to yourself when faced with those overwhelming thoughts?

User: I think I need to remind myself to take smaller tasks and not expect perfection right away. Just starting might be enough.

Consultant: Exactly! Breaking tasks into smaller, manageable pieces can ease that sense of pressure. What would be a small step you could take towards your studies this week?

User: I could start by reviewing my notes for just 20 minutes a day instead of trying to study for hours at a time.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical plan! By dedicating just 20 minutes, you can gradually build momentum without feeling overwhelmed. How do you feel about setting that as your goal?

User: I feel good about it! It sounds manageable, and I like that it's not too much pressure.

Consultant: Fantastic! Remember, each small step counts towards your bigger goals. We can also look at what activities or support systems you can lean on to help keep this momentum going. What social or group activities do you think could enhance your sense of belonging?

User: I think staying active in the club would help. They have regular meetings and events, which could keep me connected and motivated.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect idea! Engaging with your peers can add to your support system and keep you motivated. As you continue to participate in those activities, how might you remind yourself of the strengths you exhibited during your recent election experience?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal or write down the positive feedback I received from others to remind myself of my capabilities.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Keeping track of those positive affirmations can reinforce your self-awareness and self-worth. How do you think reflecting on your strengths will impact your anxiety or self-doubt moving forward?

User: I think focusing on my strengths might help me feel more confident and less anxious. I could start trusting my abilities more.

Consultant: Absolutely! Building that awareness can help break the cycle of self-doubt and anxiety. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed. What strategies do you feel most encouraged to implement?

User: I really like the idea of setting smaller goals for studying and continuing my engagement in the club. Also, keeping track of positive feedback sounds helpful.

Consultant: Those sound like solid steps forward! Remember, the goal is to cultivate a mindset that embraces progress, not perfection. How will you ensure that you maintain this positive momentum as you approach your studies?

User: I think I’ll establish a routine that includes self-reflection and staying connected with others. I want to keep that supportive environment.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! Creating routine and connection will significantly enhance your journey. I want to commend you for the progress you’ve made today. If you ever feel the need for additional support or guidance, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate our discussion today. I feel more confident about moving forward.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember this feeling of confidence, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care and keep reflecting on your strengths!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, I think. My recent exam results were encouraging, and it's giving me a boost. But I still worry about my upcoming graduation project.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear your exam results have improved, and that sounds like a positive motivator! Can you share more about what specifically concerns you regarding the graduation project?

User: I guess I worry about not being able to meet the expectations or if I can finish it on time. I feel like there's so much to do, and I want it to be perfect.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that pressure, especially with such an important project. Remember, aiming for perfection can sometimes lead to more anxiety. What would it look like for you to feel satisfied with your work on the project?

User: I think if I could just finish it on time and feel proud of what I completed, that would be okay. 

Consultant: That sounds like a realistic goal. Let's break it down a bit. What steps can you take to ensure you’re making progress without feeling overwhelmed?

User: Maybe I could create a timeline or a checklist. If I can divide the work into smaller tasks, that might help.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Creating a timeline can give you a clearer picture and help manage your tasks. How do you feel about setting specific daily or weekly goals for yourself?

User: I think that could work. It would make things feel more manageable.  But sometimes I lose motivation.

Consultant: Losing motivation can be a challenge, especially when you’re working on a big project. Have you found any particular activities that help reignite your motivation when you're feeling down?

User: I usually enjoy going for walks or listening to music. It helps clear my mind, but I sometimes forget to take those breaks.

Consultant: Engaging in activities that you enjoy is essential for maintaining balance. How about scheduling some of those breaks into your timeline? That way, you can recharge as you work on your project.

User: That’s a good idea. I’ll try to include breaks for walks or music in my schedule. 

Consultant: I’m glad you’re open to trying that. As you work on your timeline, it might also be helpful to reflect on your past successes, like your exam results. How can those achievements motivate you moving forward?

User: Thinking about my exam success does help. If I could apply that same effort and focus to my project, I might do well too.

Consultant: Absolutely! You know you have the capability to succeed. What strategies can you use to remind yourself of that capability during moments of doubt?

User: I could keep a small journal of my achievements. It might help me see how much I've grown and what I've accomplished.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! A journal can provide a constant reminder of your progress and give you a boost when you're feeling low. How do you envision using it alongside your project work?

User: I could jot down little reflections after each working session. It'd be nice to look back at those entries to see my growth.

Consultant: That sounds like a powerful tool for self-reflection! Would you feel comfortable sharing your reflections with me in our future sessions to help track your progress?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful. It would keep me accountable.

Consultant: I’m glad you feel that way! Being accountable can really enhance your commitment. As we wrap up today, let's summarize what steps you're planning to take moving forward.

User: I plan to create a timeline for my project, include breaks, and keep a journal for reflections on my progress and successes.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, it’s okay to reach out for support whenever you need it. How do you feel about our conversation today?

User: I feel more motivated and a little less anxious. I appreciate having these strategies to use.

Consultant: I’m really happy to hear that! It's important to recognize how far you've come. Keep believing in yourself and your abilities. If challenges arise, remember our talk and the strategies we've discussed. 

User: Thank you! I will definitely keep that in mind. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care and good luck with your planning!
