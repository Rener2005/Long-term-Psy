Consultant: Hello, Xiao Cheng! I'm glad you came for today's session. I know we’ve been discussing your feelings about the recent changes in your family. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty down. With my little sister's arrival, it seems like everyone is focusing on her now. It's like I'm invisible at home.

Consultant: I hear you, Xiao Cheng. It sounds really tough to feel like you've lost attention and love from your family. Can you tell me more about how this has affected you at school or at home?

User: Well, I just don’t feel like doing much anymore. I don't want to do homework or hang out with friends. I feel left out, like no one cares about me.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult. It’s understandable to feel that way when there’s a big change in the family. Let’s explore those feelings a bit more. When you think about your sister, what thoughts come to your mind?

User: I keep thinking that everyone loves her more than me. I feel like I’m just forgotten, like I don’t matter anymore.

Consultant: It’s painful to feel forgotten, especially when you used to be the center of attention. What emotions come up for you when you have those thoughts about your sister?

User: I feel sad and angry. I don’t like that feeling. Sometimes I just want to scream because I don’t know how to deal with it.

Consultant: It makes sense that you’d feel that way. Those feelings of sadness and anger are valid. How do you usually express these feelings? 

User: I mostly just keep quiet. I don’t talk to anyone. I just feel this heaviness inside me.

Consultant: I understand. Keeping quiet can often make it feel heavier. Would you be open to exploring ways to express those feelings? Maybe we can work on a feelings diary together?

User: A feelings diary? How does that work?

Consultant: A feelings diary can help you track how you feel each day. We can jot down your emotions and what might have triggered them. It’s a way to express what you're going through. Do you think that might help?

User: I guess it could help. I could try writing things down.

Consultant: That's a great start, Xiao Cheng! What would you like to write about first? Maybe something that happened recently that made you feel particularly upset?

User: I was sad when I didn't get any attention on my birthday anymore. Everyone was busy with the baby, and it felt like it didn’t matter to them.

Consultant: That must have been really hard for you. Feeling ignored on your birthday can be very painful. How did you express that sadness when you experienced it?

User: I just tried to smile, but inside I was really hurt. I didn’t want to upset anyone.

Consultant: It’s noble to want to protect others’ feelings, but your feelings matter too. It might be helpful to voice those feelings, even if it’s just in your diary. Do you feel ready to try expressing that to someone in your family?

User: Maybe... I’m not sure how they’ll react. What if they just tell me to be happy for the baby?

Consultant: It's natural to worry about their reaction. But sharing your feelings can help them understand you better. You could start by saying you feel a little left out since your sister arrived. How does that sound to you?

User: I guess that could work. But I'm still scared.

Consultant: It's okay to feel scared. Sharing feelings can be daunting. Perhaps you can practice what you'd like to say in our next session. We can role-play it together if you’d like.

User: That would help! I could practice saying it to you first before telling my family.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Practicing can make it feel less overwhelming. Let’s also think about some activities that can bring you joy while adjusting to this change at home. What are some things you used to enjoy?

User: I liked playing soccer, but I have not felt like playing lately.

Consultant: Soccer can be a fun way to release your feelings and reconnect with what you enjoy. Can we brainstorm ways to help you get back into playing, even if it’s just a little at a time?

User: Yeah, maybe I can start by kicking the ball around with a friend. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful first step! It can help you feel better and maybe even spark some excitement again. Let's aim for that. How about you share with me how that goes in our next session?

User: Sure! I’ll try to do that and write in the feelings diary too.

Consultant: Perfect! I’m really proud of you for being willing to try. Remember, you’re not alone in this, and it’s okay to express your feelings. Let’s plan for our next meeting and continue building on these steps together. 

User: Thanks, I feel a bit better just talking about it.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Xiao Cheng. You've taken brave steps today. I look forward to seeing you again and hearing how your week goes. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, 小橙! I'm glad you're here today. I want to start by checking in with you: how have you been feeling about school and your studies lately?

User: Hi! I don’t know, it just feels really hard to focus. With my new baby sister around, I kind of feel like no one cares about my schoolwork anymore.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like the arrival of your baby sister has changed things at home, and that's made it tough for you to stay focused on your studies. Can you tell me more about how this makes you feel?

User: I guess I feel kind of forgotten. Sometimes, I just don’t feel like doing my homework, and I know my teacher is worried about me.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed and maybe even a little lost amidst all these changes. Can you share what thoughts come to your mind when you think about your homework or schoolwork? 

User: I think it’s just pointless sometimes. I’d rather play games instead of studying. 

Consultant: That makes sense; playing games can feel much more fun than studying. But let’s explore that idea a bit—what do you think studying gives you, if anything? 

User: I don’t know… Maybe it helps me do well in school, but sometimes it just feels boring.

Consultant: It sounds like you see some value in doing well in school, but the process of studying feels dull to you. What would make studying more interesting or enjoyable for you?

User: I wish I could just do it fast and get it over with! Or maybe if I could do it like a game, that would be cool!

Consultant: What a creative idea! Turning studying into a game might help make it feel less boring. How about we set some small goals that feel achievable? This way, you can experience a sense of accomplishment and make it more engaging. 

User: Yeah, I guess that could work. What kind of goals?

Consultant: How about you start with 10 minutes of focused study on a subject you like? Afterward, you could reward yourself with some game time. What do you think?

User: That sounds okay, but what if I can’t even get through 10 minutes?

Consultant: That’s a great point! If 10 minutes feels too long, we can start even smaller—maybe just 5 minutes? The key is to set a goal that feels easy so you can build confidence along the way.

User: Okay, I could try 5 minutes first. 

Consultant: Awesome! And once you've done that, maybe you can build up to 10 minutes. It’s all about finding what works for you. How do you think your family could help support you with this goal?

User: I don't know. Maybe if they encouraged me or asked how I was doing?

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Communication is really important. How do you feel about talking to them about this? You could tell them you’d like their support as you set these study goals.

User: I guess I could try, but I'm kind of shy about it.

Consultant: That’s totally understandable, 小橙! Sometimes it helps to write down what you want to say or even ask for just a few minutes of their time to talk. Would that be something you’d feel comfortable doing?

User: Maybe. I'll think about it—I don’t want them to get mad.

Consultant: It's good to consider how they might react. But remember, expressing your needs can help them understand you better. So, if you share they can support you in finding a balance, they might be more understanding than you think.

User: I’ll try to remember that. 

Consultant: I’m proud of you for being open to communicating with your family. Now, as for your studying, how do you feel about the idea of having some fun study rewards after achieving your small goals?

User: I really like that! I could play my favorite game after studying. 

Consultant: Perfect! Setting up a reward system is a great way to motivate yourself. Let’s recap: you’ll try studying for 5 minutes, then enjoy some game time. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds like a plan! I feel a bit better about it, actually.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, 小橙! Remember, you’re not alone in this. As you continue to express your needs and set these small goals, you will see some positive changes. Is there anything else on your mind today?

User: Not really. I just hope I can do this.

Consultant: I'm confident you can do this! Just take it one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to ask for support when you need it. You got this, 小橙! 

User: Thanks! I’ll try my best! 

Consultant: You’re welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Until then, take care, and remember to celebrate those small wins! 

User: Bye! I will!

Consultant: Hello, Little Orange! I'm glad you're here for this session today. I want to hear about how you've been feeling lately, especially with your family situation. What's been on your mind?

User: Hi. I feel like nobody pays attention to me anymore. My mom is always busy with my little sister, and I don't get to play like I used to. It’s really frustrating!

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable to feel neglected when things change at home, especially with a new sibling. Could you tell me more about how this shift has affected you emotionally?

User: Well, I get angry sometimes. I want to play with my friends, but I'm always told to be quiet or help out at home. It makes me want to rebel and just do my own thing.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a mix of frustration and a bit of rebellion. When you say you want to do your own thing, what kind of activities are you thinking about?

User: I just want to play video games or go outside with my friends, but I feel like I can't. I feel locked up in the house.

Consultant: That feeling of being locked up can be really overwhelming. It's important to have time for yourself and your activities. How do you think your family could help you express your need for that playtime? 

User: I don’t know. I have tried asking, but they don’t listen. They just say I need to be responsible and help out.

Consultant: It sounds like you've tried to communicate your feelings, but haven’t had the response you hope for. Let’s explore ways you could express your needs in a way that might catch their attention. Can you think of a time when you successfully got someone to listen to you?

User: Hmm... I remember when I asked my grandma for a new game; she really listened and got it for me. 

Consultant: That’s great! It seems like you were able to communicate well with your grandma. What do you think made that conversation effective?

User: I just told her how much I wanted it and how it would help me relax since school is tough.

Consultant: That's a wonderful approach! You clearly expressed your feelings and connected it to your experience. How might you apply that same strategy when talking to your mom and dad about wanting more playtime?

User: Maybe I should just tell them that playing helps me feel better and relax. 

Consultant: Yes, exactly! Let’s practice that together. Imagine you’re having this conversation with your mom. How would you start?

User: I could say, "Mom, I’m feeling kinda stressed with school and I really need some time to play. It helps me relax."

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start! It shows your feelings and connects them with your need for some fun time. How do you feel about saying something like that?

User: It feels good! But I’m still worried they won’t listen.

Consultant: It's totally normal to feel that way. Sometimes we don’t know how someone will react. If you were to be met with resistance, how would you handle it?

User: I guess I could remind them how important it is for me, or maybe give examples of how my friends play after school.

Consultant: That’s a smart idea! Using examples can make your point stronger. How does that make you feel, thinking about having this conversation?

User: I feel a little more confident. Maybe they’ll understand.

Consultant: That confidence is essential! Remember, it's okay not to get it right every time—what matters is that you're trying to communicate your needs. Let’s plan to work on this together. What will you do after our session today to take a step towards that conversation?

User: I’ll think about what I want to say and maybe write it down.

Consultant: Writing it down is a great way to organize your thoughts! It can help you feel more prepared. I'm proud of you for taking this step, Little Orange. How are you feeling about our session today?

User: I feel a bit better. I like talking about this stuff.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Talking about feelings can sometimes help release some of the pressure. As we wrap up today, what is one thing you will take away from our session that you can use at home?

User: I’ll remember to express my feelings clearly and use examples to help them understand.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a powerful skill you’re developing. I look forward to hearing how your conversations go next time. Remember, you can always return if you need more support. 

User: Thank you! I’ll try my best!

Consultant: You’re welcome, Little Orange! Take care, and I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Little Orange! I'm glad you’re here today. I’d love to hear about how you’ve been feeling since we last talked. How has school and home been for you lately?

User: Hi! It's been a bit strange, I guess. School is okay, but sometimes I feel left out. My little sister takes a lot of attention, and I’m not sure how to fit in.

Consultant: That sounds tough, Little Orange. It’s understandable to feel a bit overshadowed by your new sister—lots of things must be changing at home. Can you share a bit more about how that makes you feel at school?

User: I feel like everyone is all happy about the baby, and I try to be happy too, but sometimes I just want to be noticed, like I used to be. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those feelings. You want to be recognized and appreciated for who you are. Has this affected your interest in the activities at school or the new ones you’ve been exploring?

User: I think so. I started joining a soccer club, and I thought it would help, but sometimes it feels like too much pressure. I worry I won't be as good as the others.

Consultant: That makes sense. Trying something new, especially when you feel pressure, can be difficult. What do you think it is about playing soccer that you find exciting?

User: Well, I like running around and having fun with my friends, but I also feel nervous about being judged if I mess up. 

Consultant: It sounds like you enjoy the camaraderie but feel anxious about your performance. Let’s explore this further—what kind of thoughts go through your mind when you worry about making mistakes?

User: I often think that everyone will laugh at me or that I’ll ruin the game for my team.

Consultant: Those are pretty intense thoughts, Little Orange. It’s important to recognize that many kids probably feel similar fears. If a friend of yours was feeling this way, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably say that it's okay to make mistakes and that everyone messes up sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! It sounds like you have a kind heart. What if we tried to apply that same understanding to your own feelings? Would you consider it okay for yourself to make mistakes?

User: Maybe... yeah, it could be okay. I guess I just really want to be good at something.

Consultant: Wanting to excel is totally valid! How about we focus on enjoying the game and practicing together, rather than just on winning? What activities do you think you could enjoy that would help build your confidence?

User: I could practice more with my friends, and maybe also try to have fun without worrying so much about being perfect.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Improving your skills with friends can make practice more enjoyable. What about distractions outside of soccer? Are there any other hobbies or activities that excite you?

User: I’ve been thinking about joining a music club. I like listening to music, and sometimes I want to play the drums.

Consultant: Drumming sounds like a fantastic way to express yourself! How does thinking about joining the music club make you feel?

User: I feel a bit braver thinking about it. Maybe I can make new friends there too! 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! Music can be a powerful way to connect with others. What steps do you think you could take to explore this interest further?

User: I could ask my teacher about it and see if I can join next week. 

Consultant: That's a great idea! Taking that small step could really open up new opportunities for you. Remember, it’s about enjoying yourself and exploring what you love. What do you think that could do for your feelings at home?

User: Maybe it would help me feel more like myself and less overshadowed. It could make our family time feel better, too!

Consultant: Absolutely! Engaging in activities you enjoy can boost your confidence and might even help improve the home atmosphere. As we wrap this up, what are some tools or thoughts you can keep in mind to help you stay positive as you explore soccer and music?

User: I can remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that I’m allowed to have fun. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful mantra to carry with you, Little Orange! Remember, you are capable, and it's okay to be imperfect. You're doing great in navigating these changes. How do you feel about our conversation today?

User: I feel better! Talking about my feelings helps. Thanks for listening.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, I’m here to support you as you navigate these changes, and you can always come back if you need to talk. Keep embracing new experiences, and I look forward to hearing how it goes next time!

Consultant: Hello, little orange! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling about things lately, especially with your new sister in the family?

User: Hi! I feel a bit okay. I like having a little sister, but sometimes I think my parents pay more attention to her now, and I miss spending time with them. 

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. It’s normal to feel a bit different when new members join the family. How do you feel when you notice your parents spending more time with your sister?

User: I feel a bit jealous, I guess. I want them to play with me too. I don’t want to feel this way, but I can’t help it.

Consultant: It sounds like you really want to be involved and get their attention. Jealousy is a common feeling, especially when there’s a big change in the family. What do you think you could do to feel closer to them?

User: Maybe I could help take care of my sister? I want to be helpful, but I also want them to pay attention to me.

Consultant: Helping out with your sister is a great idea! It can also be a way to bond with your family. Maybe we can think of some fun activities you could do together. What do you think would be fun for both you and your parents?

User: I think we could all play games together! I love playing games. 

Consultant: Playing games sounds like a wonderful plan! It could help everyone spend time together and keep the family spirit alive. What kind of games do you enjoy the most?

User: I really like board games, especially ones where we have to work together. 

Consultant: Cooperative board games could be the perfect fit! They encourage teamwork and connection. Have you talked to your parents about setting aside some time for family game nights?

User: Not yet, but I think I will! I hope they like the idea.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Perhaps you can suggest it during dinner, so they can see how excited you are about it. Would you like to practice how you might bring it up to them?

User: Sure! I could say, "Can we have a family game night?" 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic start! You might also share how much you enjoy it and how it would help you feel closer to them. Would you like to try saying that?

User: Okay, "Can we have a family game night? I would love to spend time together!"

Consultant: Perfect! That sounds enthusiastic and inviting. I’m sure they will appreciate it. How do you feel about trying this approach?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited! I really want to do this.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous when trying something new. Just remember, it’s about sharing what you want and making a happy family time. Once you suggest it, how do you think you will feel?

User: I think I will feel happy if they say yes. If not, I hope they can at least play with me sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a positive outlook! Even if they can’t say yes right away, asking is a good first step. Your feelings of happiness are important! You’re doing great by thinking about including them. Would you like to talk about how to deal with the times when they’re focused on your sister?

User: Yes! Sometimes I don’t know what to do when they are all busy with her.

Consultant: When you feel left out, it might help to find a fun activity you can do by yourself or with a friend. What activities do you enjoy doing when you’re on your own?

User: I like drawing and playing video games.

Consultant: Those sound like great activities! They can help you stay engaged while your parents are busy. You could even draw a picture of your family or play a game and invite your friends over sometimes. How does that sound?

User: That sounds fun! I think I will draw a picture of my family. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Creating something for your family can also show them how much you care. You could share it with them when you have family time. What other positive feelings do you think drawing can bring you?

User: I think it makes me feel happy, and I can show them that I am excited to be a big brother!

Consultant: Absolutely! Being a big brother is a special role. Sharing your feelings through art is a lovely way to express yourself. How do you feel about using these ideas to support you when you sense a shift in family dynamics?

User: I feel good! I’ll definitely try to find my own fun, and also include my family more.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy approach! Remember, it’s okay to have these feelings and to communicate them. You’re developing great skills in connecting with your family. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you think is the biggest takeaway for you?

User: I think it’s important to talk to my parents and do things I enjoy too. I want to keep being happy!

Consultant: Exactly! You’re learning how to balance your feelings and maintain your happiness with your family. It’s been wonderful talking with you today, little orange! I look forward to hearing about your family game night next time!

User: Thank you! I'm excited to share it with you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Little Orange! I'm really glad to see you today. How are you feeling about your family interactions lately, especially after your sister was born?

User: Hi! I feel pretty good, actually. I’ve been talking more with my parents and trying to spend time with my dad. I want to do more fun things together as a family.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great that you’re initiating more conversations and wanting to connect with your dad. Can you share what activities you have in mind for spending time together?

User: I was thinking maybe we could go to the park or play some games at home. I just want to do something fun with him.

Consultant: Those sound like great ideas! Spending time in the park or playing games together can definitely strengthen your bond. How does it feel when you think about these activities?

User: I feel excited! But sometimes I worry that he might be too busy with work.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those worries, especially when your dad is very busy. What do you think would help you communicate these thoughts to him?

User: Maybe I can just ask him directly. I could tell him I really want to spend some time with him.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Being open about your feelings can help him understand how much you value your time together. How do you think he might react when you tell him?

User: I think he would be happy to know I want to spend time with him. He always says he loves being with me.

Consultant: That’s a reassuring thought! It’s clear that your dad cares a lot about your relationship. Are there specific days or times you’d like to plan these activities?

User: I think weekends would be best because he’s usually more free. Maybe we can plan something for this Saturday?

Consultant: Planning for the weekend sounds perfect! It gives you both something to look forward to. Have you thought about what specific activity you’d like to do this Saturday?

User: I really want to have a picnic at the park! I think it would be fun.

User: I think I’ll be really happy! Spending time outdoors with him will make me feel close to him again.

Consultant: That’s a lovely feeling! It sounds like this picnic could really strengthen your bond with your dad. Is there anything you’re nervous about regarding this plan?

User: I’m a little worried he might have to cancel if something comes up at work.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have that concern. How do you think you can cope if that happens? 

User: I guess I could suggest another day when he’s free. I just want to make sure we can have fun together.

Consultant: That's a mature approach! Being flexible about rescheduling can still lead to quality time together. How do you feel about that strategy?

User: I feel much better! It makes me feel like we can always find time, just in a different way.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Flexibility can really help maintain a positive outlook. After your picnic, how do you think you can keep this interaction going with your dad?

User: Maybe we can set up a regular ‘family day’ each month where we do something fun together.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant idea! Regular family days can create lasting memories. What would you want to do on those family days?

User: We could visit different places, like museums or amusement parks. I think it would be exciting!

Consultant: Those are excellent choices! Exciting places will definitely make those family days special. How does thinking about these future plans make you feel?

User: I feel really excited! I can’t wait to tell my dad about all of this.

Consultant: I’m excited for you as well! Your proactive approach is commendable. Is there any other support or guidance you feel you might need regarding these interactions?

User: I think I just need to keep being open with my dad about how much I want to spend time with him.
