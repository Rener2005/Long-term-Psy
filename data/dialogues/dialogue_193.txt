Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today's session. Before we begin, I’d like to talk about what you've been feeling lately. What has been on your mind?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really lost since starting university. After the military training, I thought things would get better, but I've been experiencing difficulties connecting with my roommates. I often feel anxious and even think about quitting my studies.

Consultant: I can see how overwhelming this must be for you. You're hoping to understand the source of your anxiety and find ways to improve both your classroom focus and your relationship with your roommates. Can you share more about what contributes to your anxiety?

User: Well, I think it's partly because I’m not used to being alone or having to interact with people. I’ve also spent a lot of time with my grandparents, and now it feels so different. It's hard to sit in class and pay attention when my mind is racing.

Consultant: That makes sense. A major change in your environment and relationships can certainly cause anxiety. Let's explore a bit more—what specific thoughts come to your mind when you feel anxious, especially during classes or when interacting with your roommates?

User: I often think that no one wants to be friends with me. When I try to talk, I just feel awkward and assume they think I’m weird. It makes me really nervous, and that adds to my anxiety.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing some negative thoughts about how others perceive you. These thoughts might be influencing how you feel and act in social situations. Can we identify any specific instances when you felt this way?

User: Yes, just last week, I tried to join a conversation with my roommates, but when they laughed, I thought they were laughing at me. I felt so embarrassed and just left the room.

Consultant: That's a challenging situation. You felt embarrassed and it led you to withdraw from the group. Let's take a moment to analyze that thought: what evidence do you have that they were laughing at you specifically? 

User: I don’t have any evidence, but it felt like they were. I guess I assume the worst when it comes to social interactions because I worry a lot.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when you're anxious. Our thoughts can sometimes lead us to jump to conclusions without solid evidence. If a friend were in a similar situation, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them not to worry and that it’s possible they were just joking around and not thinking about them.

Consultant: Exactly! You can see it from a more balanced perspective when you think about it that way. Let’s work on replacing those anxious thoughts with more neutral or positive ones. What might be a more constructive thought to have in social situations?

User: Maybe I could think that it’s normal to feel awkward and that it could get better over time as I get to know them.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Acknowledging your feelings while reminding yourself that social skills can improve with practice is key. How about we focus on stepping outside your comfort zone by engaging in some group activities? What do you think?

User: That sounds scary but could be helpful. I haven’t really tried to participate in anything yet because of my fears.

Consultant: I totally understand that fear, but taking small steps can be very effective. Can you think of one activity you could join that might be less intimidating?

User: Maybe I could join a study group or something. That way, I’d have a clear purpose for being there.

Consultant: Joining a study group sounds perfect! It provides a focus for interaction, which can relieve some of the pressure. How would you feel about reaching out to someone about that?

User: I’m nervous to reach out, but I think it could be worthwhile. I guess starting small with one person might help.

Consultant: Starting with one person is a great approach. It feels less overwhelming. You could even express your feelings about wanting to study together and ask if they’d be interested. How does that sound?

User: I think I could do that. It feels better thinking about it as just studying together rather than trying to make friends all at once.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Focusing on a mutual goal can make interactions feel more natural. Let’s plan for our next session to see how that goes. What do you feel you’d like to work on before we meet again?

User: I want to make that connection and try to join that study group. I’ll also try to remind myself that it’s okay to feel awkward.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember to be gentle with yourself during this process. It’s completely normal to feel uncertain. We’ll explore how that unfolds in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I feel a tiny bit better, having a plan to work on.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Progress takes time, and it’s wonderful that you’re taking steps forward. If you need anything or want to share your experiences before our next session, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: I will! Thank you for all your help today. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your progress. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Y! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been pretty anxious. I tried to join some class activities, but I felt really awkward. I’m worried I won’t fit in with my classmates or in my dorm.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like you’ve been feeling a sense of helplessness regarding social interactions, which is completely understandable. Can you tell me more about these feelings and what exactly has made you feel awkward?

User: Well, during the group activity, I didn’t know what to say or how to connect with others. I just stood there, feeling out of place and it made me anxious. I keep thinking I’m just not good at this.

Consultant: It's natural to feel that way when navigating new social situations. You mentioned feeling out of place and thinking you aren’t good at socializing. Can we explore what specific thoughts were going through your mind during that event?

User: I kept thinking that everyone else was so confident and friendly, and there I was, just standing there. I thought they would judge me for not fitting in.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts fueled your anxiety. Let's question them a little. What evidence do you have that others were judging you? Have you considered that they might have been focused on their own feelings too?

User: I guess I don’t really know for sure. It just felt like they were all talking easily, and I felt like an outsider. 

Consultant: That’s a common feeling, Y. Sometimes we project our fears onto others without knowing what they’re truly thinking. If a friend were to describe this situation to you, what would you tell them about their fears of being judged?

User: I would probably say that they shouldn't worry so much about what others think and just be themselves.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s often easier to offer support to others than to ourselves. Let's think about what steps you could take to start feeling more comfortable in social situations. What activities can you participate in that might help you ease into the group? 

User: Maybe I could ask a few classmates about their interests or hobbies. That might help break the ice.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Asking questions is a good way to engage. How do you feel about trying that in your next class or dorm meeting?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think it's worth trying. I just hope they respond positively!

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous. But remember, even if their response isn’t what you expect, you are taking a positive step towards connecting. What do you think would happen if they responded positively?

User: That would definitely boost my confidence! I'd feel more willing to participate in future activities.

Consultant: And that’s a wonderful outcome to work towards! Are there any specific techniques or affirmations you could remind yourself of to stay calm when approaching your classmates?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that it’s okay to be nervous, and that everyone has their own insecurities.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic affirmation! Embracing that every person has their own challenges can help you feel more connected. Let’s role-play a scenario where you approach someone and ask about their interests. Would you be comfortable trying that?

User: Sure, I can try that!

Consultant: Great! Imagine you’re in class. You see someone who seems approachable. What would you say to start a conversation?

User: I would say, “Hi! I noticed you have a great taste in music. What kind of music do you like?” 

Consultant: Nice opening line! That shows genuine interest. How would you feel delivering that line?

User: I think I’d feel nervous at first, but if they respond well, I might feel more relaxed.

Consultant: Absolutely! The key is to start small and build from there. If they respond positively, you can continue the conversation. Would you like to set a goal for how many conversations you’d like to initiate this week?

User: Maybe I could aim for two conversations during class or in the dorm this week.

Consultant: That sounds like a sensible goal. Remember to celebrate those small victories regardless of the outcome. What would you want to do as a reward for yourself when you accomplish that?

User: Maybe treat myself to a movie or some snacks after successfully doing it!

Consultant: That sounds like a fun reward! I'm proud of your willingness to challenge yourself. Let’s also reflect on any positive experiences you encounter this week. How will you document that?

User: I could keep a journal. I can write about my feelings and the conversations I have.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Reflecting on your experiences can really help you process your feelings. As we wrap up for today, how are you feeling about the steps we’ve discussed?

User: I feel hopeful! It seems more manageable now that we talked about it.

Consultant: I'm genuinely happy to hear that! Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. Keep practicing, and we’ll discuss how it went in our next session. You are doing great, and I believe in your ability to connect with others.

User: Thank you! I can't wait to share my progress! 

Consultant: I look forward to hearing all about it. Keep embracing those opportunities, and I'll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Y! I'm really glad to see you again. It sounds like you’ve had some positive experiences recently. How are you feeling about your social interactions since our last session?

User: Hi! I'm feeling pretty good. Last week, I spoke up in class, and my teacher and classmates responded positively. It made me feel really happy and more hopeful about fitting in.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like that experience boosted your confidence. Can you tell me more about how you felt during and after speaking in class?

User: During the moment, I was nervous, but once I started talking, I felt a rush of excitement. Afterward, I couldn’t believe how well it went. It felt great to get such positive feedback.

Consultant: It’s amazing how such interactions can uplift us! How do you think this success in class has influenced your desire to engage with your roommates or participate in extracurricular activities?

User: I feel more confident now. I actually invited my roommates to join me for a game night. I was really nervous about it, but I took the plunge.

Consultant: That’s a big step! It’s great to see you taking initiative. How did your roommates respond to your invitation?

User: They seemed interested and even excited about it! We ended up having a lot of fun together.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It seems like you’re building not just your confidence but also connections with those around you. How does this newfound confidence feel for you overall?

User: It feels really good. I’ve realized that I can talk to people and that they appreciate my company. I want to keep pushing myself to socialize more.

Consultant: It’s impressive to see how you’re embracing these opportunities! As we continue our session today, let's focus on recognizing and reinforcing these positive experiences. Can you think of any thoughts or beliefs that come to mind when you have successful interactions like these?

User: I guess I used to think I wasn't interesting enough to engage with others. Now I feel like I do have something to offer.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift in your thinking! Instead of doubting your value, you’re starting to see that you bring something meaningful to the table. How do you think this change in your belief will influence your future social interactions?

User: I think I’ll be more willing to join conversations and not hold back. It feels liberating.

Consultant: Absolutely! This liberation can really enhance your connection with others. Let’s explore some more specific situations where you might encounter social challenges. Are there any scenarios where you still feel some anxiety or hesitation?

User: Sometimes I worry about larger group gatherings. I feel like I might not fit in and could be awkward.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Many people feel that way in larger groups. Let’s analyze those feelings a bit more. What specific thoughts come to mind that lead to those feelings of awkwardness?

User: I often think everyone will judge me if I say something silly or if I don’t fit in.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that thought with me. Let’s challenge it! What evidence do you have that people will judge you harshly, or is there a possibility they might feel similar anxieties themselves?

User: I guess I don't have much evidence. Most people are focused on having fun, and I think they might be a bit nervous too.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s easy to forget that others may be struggling with the same feelings. What if you approached those gatherings with the mindset that everyone is just there to enjoy themselves, including you?

User: I think that might help a lot. I could focus on enjoying the moment rather than overanalyzing everything.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy approach! What strategies can we come up with to help you shift your focus to enjoying your time during these gatherings?

User: Maybe I could prepare some conversation starters or think of things I genuinely enjoy discussing.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Having conversation starters can alleviate some of the pressure. Would you like to brainstorm some topics that you feel comfortable sharing?

User: Sure! I could talk about my favorite movies or games, maybe even ask about their interests.

Consultant: Those are great topics! They’re not only engaging but can facilitate deeper connections as well. How about when you feel that anxiety creeping in—what can you remind yourself to maintain your confidence?

User: I could remind myself of the positive experiences I’ve had recently. I could also tell myself that it’s okay to not be perfect.

Consultant: That's a powerful reminder! Embracing imperfection is key in social interactions. Let's recap what you've learned today and how you can implement these strategies moving forward.

User: Okay! I’ll focus on highlighting my positive social experiences, use conversation starters, and remind myself that it's alright to be imperfect.

Consultant: Perfect! Reflecting on your progress and maintaining that mindset can significantly help reduce anxiety. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any concerns you want to address?

User: No, I feel good about what we talked about today. I'm excited to try these strategies!

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! It’s been a pleasure to see your growth, Y. You've worked hard, and I believe you can carry this confidence forward. Remember, if you ever feel overwhelmed or need support, I’m always here for you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome. I’ll look forward to hearing about your next successes. Take care until we talk again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Y! It's great to see you again. I’m really looking forward to our session today. Can you tell me what’s been on your mind since we last spoke? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling more relaxed about fitting in and my self-worth has improved. I even tried to join the student council to connect with others.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re taking really positive steps towards building connections. How do you feel about your experience with the student council so far?

User: It's been a bit nerve-wracking, but also exciting. I’m nervous about speaking up in meetings, though.

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel nervous in new situations, especially when it involves communicating with peers. Can you share more about what thoughts come up when you think about speaking in meetings?

User: I often think they might not take me seriously, or that I’ll mess up what I want to say.

Consultant: Those are valid concerns, and many people feel that way in group settings. Let's talk about how those thoughts make you feel. What emotions come up when you think about it?

User: I feel anxious and a bit embarrassed, like I'm going to be judged.

Consultant: That’s tough, Y. It’s understandable to feel anxious when you worry about judgment. Have you noticed any patterns in these thoughts when you’re in those situations?

User: Yes, I tend to overthink everything, imagining the worst outcomes.

Consultant: Overthinking can really amplify anxiety. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit more. What evidence do you have that suggests they won’t take you seriously or that you’ll mess up?

User: I don’t have any solid evidence, it’s just what I fear.

Consultant: Those fears might not reflect the reality of the situation. If a friend were in your position, what advice would you give them?

User: I’d probably tell them to just be themselves and that everyone makes mistakes.

Consultant: Exactly! You’d encourage them to embrace their individuality. Now let's shift that advice back to you. How might you approach speaking in meetings with that mindset?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that everyone is learning together.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! It sounds like you’re on the right track. Let's set some specific goals for your participation in the student council. What would be a realistic goal you could aim for in the next meeting?

User: Maybe I could aim to share at least one idea or ask one question during the next meeting.

Consultant: That sounds like a smart goal! What will you do to prepare for that? 

User: I could write down my thoughts beforehand, so I feel more confident.

Consultant: Great idea! Writing can really help clarify your thoughts and lessen anxiety. How do you plan to celebrate or acknowledge your effort after the meeting, regardless of the outcome?

User: I think I’ll treat myself to my favorite snack if I manage to speak up.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful way to reinforce positive behavior! You’re building a pattern of success. Let’s talk about how you can apply what you’re learning in these meetings to other areas of your college life.

User: I think I’ll try to engage more in my classes too, not just in the council.

Consultant: That’s an excellent expansion of your goals! Setting smaller, specific goals for class participation can help as well. What would a goal look like for your next class?

User: Maybe I could aim to answer at least one question during the class.

Consultant: That sounds achievable! Just like before, how can you prepare yourself to feel confident doing this?

User: I could review the material beforehand, so I feel prepared to contribute.

Consultant: Wonderful strategy! Being prepared can make a big difference. Now, let's reflect on the progress you've made so far. What are some accomplishments you’re proud of since we began our sessions?

User: I’m proud that I’m more confident and opened up about my feelings. Joining the student council was a big step for me!

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Recognizing and celebrating these steps is important. How do you see your confidence continuing to grow in the future?

User: I can hopefully become more involved and maybe even help organize events.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful vision! Helping organize events could give you a great sense of belonging. Let’s outline a few strategies to ensure you stay engaged and motivated.

User: Sounds good! I think connecting with more people in the council will help, maybe team up for projects.

Consultant: Collaborating with others is a great strategy! It not only helps build connections but also makes tasks less daunting. As you move forward, what might be a potential challenge you could face, and how can you prepare for it?

User: I might feel intimidated if someone challenges my ideas. I need to remember it’s okay to have different opinions.

Consultant: Absolutely! Different opinions can lead to constructive discussions. How can you remind yourself of that in the moment?

User: I could practice deep breathing and keep telling myself it's okay to differ.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Y. Deep breathing can help calm your nerves. As we wrap up, what are the key takeaways you’d like to remember from our session today?

User: I want to remember that it’s okay to make mistakes, to prepare ahead, and to celebrate my progress.

Consultant: Perfect! Those are essential reminders. I’m really proud of the steps you’re taking. Always remember that you have the tools to manage your feelings. Let’s keep building on this momentum in our next sessions. 

User: Thank you! I’m feeling more ready to tackle these challenges, and I'm looking forward to it.

Consultant: You’re doing great, Y! I look forward to our next meeting. Remember, it’s all about progress and enjoying the process. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello there! It's great to see you again today. I'm looking forward to our session. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good. I've been enjoying my classes and getting along well with my classmates and roommates. It's been nice to have some supportive friendships.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It seems like you're in a positive place with your relationships. Can you share what you think has contributed to these connections with others?

User: Well, I've been more open and willing to participate in group activities. I think being a part of the student council has helped me build relationships and gain confidence.

Consultant: It's impressive to hear how your involvement in the student council has positively impacted your social skills and confidence. What specific experiences from these activities have stood out to you?

User: I remember organizing an event with my peers. Initially, I was nervous, but it turned out to be successful, and everyone appreciated the effort. It felt great to contribute and work collaboratively.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant achievement! Collaborating and overcoming your nerves shows personal growth. How did that experience shape your view of teamwork and your role within a group?

User: It made me realize that I can bring value to a team and that my ideas are worth sharing. I felt proud to take the lead, and it motivated me to continue being involved.

Consultant: That's a meaningful insight! Recognizing your contributions is essential for your growth. As you're reflecting on these positive experiences, how do you plan to maintain these friendships and further your involvement in the future?

User: I want to stay active in planning future events and keep connecting with people. I think it’s important to balance my studies with social activities, so I’ll set time aside for both.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy approach! Balancing your academic responsibilities with social interactions is crucial. What specific strategies do you think you can use to ensure this balance?

User: I could create a weekly planner, dedicating time for study and social activities. Also, I might communicate with my friends and roommates about our schedules to coordinate.

Consultant: A weekly planner sounds like a great idea! It can keep you organized and help you prioritize. How do you feel about setting that kind of structure in your life?

User: I think it would relieve some pressure. Knowing I have time set aside for both studying and hanging out will keep me motivated and less stressed.

Consultant: That's a wonderful realization! Finding motivation can often help reduce stress and improve focus. Looking back on your recent successes, how do you feel about the progress you've made so far in your personal development?

User: I feel quite accomplished! I’ve grown in many ways since starting college, especially with making friends and getting involved. It’s reassuring to see my efforts paying off.

Consultant: It’s fantastic to hear you recognize your accomplishments! Each step is a building block towards your future. As we consider your ongoing development, what long-term goals do you have in mind?

User: I’d like to keep developing my leadership skills and maybe even take on a mentorship role in the future. I'm also aiming to maintain my friendships and stay engaged in my studies.

Consultant: Those are excellent aspirations! Focusing on leadership and mentorship can enrich your experiences and help others. How do you envision taking practical steps towards achieving these goals?

User: I could start by looking for volunteer opportunities or workshops that focus on leadership. Also, I can actively seek chances to support others, whether in group projects or just being there for my friends.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Being proactive about seeking opportunities will make a significant difference. What support do you think you might need as you pursue these goals?

User: I think it would help to have a network of supportive friends and mentors who can guide me along the way. I’d also like to be more aware of how I’m feeling and check in with myself regularly.

Consultant: Building a support network is wise. It can provide encouragement and guidance during your growth journey. Regular self-check-ins are also a great way to stay attuned to your emotions. How do you plan to implement these check-ins into your routine?

User: I could set aside a few minutes at the end of each day to reflect on my feelings and progress. Maybe keep a journal to track my thoughts and experiences as well.

Consultant: Journaling is a fantastic practice for reflection! It can help you process your thoughts and document your growth. As we wrap up, can you summarize what insights you've gained from our conversation today?

User: I’ve realized how much I’ve grown socially and how active I want to remain in my development. I’ve also figured out a plan for balancing my studies and social life while pursuing my longer-term goals.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful summary! You’ve gained significant insights today, and you have clear steps to advance your development. Remember, you have the tools to manage your emotions and continue your growth. If you ever need support in the future, feel free to reach out.
