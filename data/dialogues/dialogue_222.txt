Consultant: Hello, Shih. I’m glad to see you today. Before we start, I want to express that your feelings are valid. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi. To be honest, I've been feeling really overwhelmed. The pressure of finding a job after graduation is just so intense, and I keep thinking about my past mistake. It makes everything feel so hopeless.

Consultant: I can see that this is a very difficult time for you. The pressure about your future combined with your past experience can be quite heavy. Can you share more about how this anxiety affects your daily life?

User: Well, I have trouble sleeping because I keep replaying that incident in my head. I think about how it might affect employers when they look at my record. It’s like this cloud hanging over me every day.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts about the incident are quite intrusive and affect your ability to rest. Let's explore them together—what specific thoughts come to mind when you think of that past mistake? How does it make you feel?

User: I often think that I'm not good enough or that I'm a failure because of that. It just reinforces my fears about not getting a job, and it feels like I don’t deserve success after what I did.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very painful, Shih. It's understandable to feel this way, but let’s think about this together. What evidence do you have that a single mistake defines your entire future and worth?

User: I mean, I guess I don’t have solid proof. But I just can’t shake this feeling that employers will judge me harshly for it.

Consultant: It’s common to fear judgment, but it might be helpful to consider the possibility that employers are looking at your skills and potential as well. If a friend were in your place, what would you advise them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that they shouldn’t let one incident define their future. But it’s so hard to believe that for myself.

Consultant: That’s a really insightful perspective, and it’s important to recognize that self-compassion can often be harder than extending it to others. How about we work on reframing those thoughts? If you had to create a counterargument to your current beliefs, what might you say?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that I’ve worked hard since then. I’ve done well in my classes and have been involved in activities that show my growth.

Consultant: Exactly! Those accomplishments reflect your growth and resilience. Let's write down a list of your strengths and achievements. How does that make you feel when you focus on those positive aspects?

User: It does help a little. But I still feel this weight from my past and the future uncertainties.

Consultant: That weight is certainly significant. However, acknowledging your strengths is a step forward. Let’s talk about some strategies to manage that anxiety and help with your sleep. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before bed?

User: I have tried some breathing exercises, but I find it hard to keep my mind from racing afterward.

Consultant: It’s great that you’ve tried breathing exercises! We might also consider incorporating a consistent bedtime routine and perhaps mindfulness or visualization techniques. Would you be open to trying some new approaches?

User: Yes, I think that could help. I want to find ways to calm my mind and get better sleep.

Consultant: Fantastic! Together we can develop a personalized routine for you. We’ll start with some simple practices that you can gradually incorporate. Have you found any activities that help you relax during the day?

User: Sometimes going for a walk helps, but often I just feel too anxious to do even that.

Consultant: Walking is a wonderful way to release tension. Perhaps we can start with small goals, like a short 10-minute walk. Would you be willing to try that, even when you’re feeling anxious?

User: I guess I could try. Even just stepping outside briefly might be better than nothing.

Consultant: Absolutely! It's all about small steps. Remember, progress doesn’t have to be drastic; even little actions can lead to significant changes over time. How do you feel about discussing these small steps in our next session?

User: That sounds good. I’d like to see how it goes and share any changes I notice. 

Consultant: I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences. And as you practice these strategies, let’s also continue to work through those thoughts about your past. Remember, it’s okay to reach out for support as you navigate these feelings.

User: Thank you, that means a lot. I’ll do my best to focus on the positive and work on the new strategies.

Consultant: You’re doing great already by acknowledging your feelings and wanting to improve. It’s a journey, and you’re taking meaningful steps forward. Until next time, Shih, take care of yourself.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. See you next time.

Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. I remember from our last session that you've been feeling anxious about your future employment. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I think I've been a bit better, but the anxiety still lingers. I feel nervous when I think about job applications and the competition out there. It's overwhelming.

Consultant: I understand that the job market can feel quite daunting, especially with the pressures of competition. Can you tell me a bit more about what specifically makes you feel overwhelmed?

User: Well, I always worry about not being good enough. I think about how everyone else seems more qualified, and it makes me doubt my own abilities.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling like you're not measuring up to others. Can you share what specific thoughts come to mind when you feel this way? What do you find yourself telling yourself?

User: I often think, "I'll never get a job," or "I'm not as skilled as my peers." It just feels like I'm stuck in this negative loop.

Consultant: It seems like those thoughts are very powerful for you. Let's try to examine them more closely. What evidence do you have that supports those thoughts? Are there any instances where you felt you did well or achieved something?

User: I did perform well in some coursework, and I did get good grades. But I just feel like those accomplishments don’t matter compared to everyone else's experiences.

Consultant: That’s a good point—your achievements do matter! It's common to compare ourselves to others, but that can distort our view of our own strengths. If you were to speak to a friend who felt the same way, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on their strengths and not to worry so much about what others think.

Consultant: Exactly! It's easier to see the positives in others. Now, let’s apply that same advice to you. Can we identify some strengths or skills that you bring to the table?

User: I suppose I’m quite resilient. I had a rough start in university, but I've managed to keep going despite my past mistakes.

Consultant: Resilience is a fantastic trait—it's a key factor in navigating challenges. How can you remind yourself of this resilience when those negative thoughts creep in?

User: I could maybe write down my accomplishments or remind myself of my journey more often.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Writing down your successes can serve as a powerful reminder of what you've achieved. Let's consider some practical steps you can take to manage your anxiety. Have you tried any relaxation techniques in the past?

User: Not really. I usually just try to distract myself when I’m feeling anxious.

Consultant: Distracting yourself is a common coping mechanism, but exploring relaxation techniques could provide more comfort. How about we try a simple deep breathing exercise right now? It can help in grounding you.

User: Sure, I’d be open to that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in for four counts… hold for four counts… and breathe out for six counts. Repeat that a few times. How does that feel?

User: It feels nice to take a moment like this, to just breathe. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Using techniques like this whenever you start to feel overwhelmed can help calm your mind. How do you think you can incorporate these breathing exercises into your daily routine?

User: Maybe I could do it in the morning or before I go to bed? It sounds helpful.

Consultant: Definitely! Setting aside a few minutes each day for relaxation can make a big difference. Now, let's talk about the idea of job applications. What specific steps do you think you’d like to take to move forward?

User: I could start by updating my resume and maybe reaching out to some professors for help with job leads.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Taking small, manageable steps can ease the feeling of being overwhelmed. How would it make you feel to take these actions?

User: I think it might help reduce my anxiety, knowing I’m making progress even if it’s small.

Consultant: Absolutely! Progress is progress, no matter the size. As we wrap up today, what are some of the key takeaways you’d like to remember from our session?

User: I think I want to remember to focus on my strengths and utilize breathing techniques when I feel anxious. And to take small steps toward job applications.

Consultant: That’s a solid takeaway! Remember, it’s a journey, and it's okay to have ups and downs along the way. I believe in your ability to manage this. When we meet next, we can check in on how implementing these strategies is going. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. I feel a bit more hopeful now, even if I'm still uncertain.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It's completely valid to feel uncertain, but remember that with the right tools and support, you can navigate these challenges. Looking forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Shí. I'm glad you're here today. I understand you've been feeling uncertain about your future and are seeking to build your self-confidence. Can you tell me more about your feelings and the support you've recently received from your family?

User: Hi. Yes, I've noticed that my family is really concerned about me, which makes me feel both supported and stressed. I appreciate their care, but I still don't know what to do after graduation, and that uncertainty is really weighing on me.

Consultant: It's good to hear that you're feeling supported by your family, even though it's mixed with stress. The uncertainty about your career path can be overwhelming. What specifically do you think is causing you the most anxiety about your future?

User: I think it's just the pressure to find a job and not knowing what I really want to do. I've been feeling lost since I'm afraid I might not be good enough or that I might fail again.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Shí. The pressure to succeed can be daunting, especially given your past experience. Can you share what thoughts come to your mind when you think about failing again?

User: I often think that if I fail, it will prove that I'm not capable. I remember how I felt when I got in trouble during my freshman year. It's like that moment still haunts me.

Consultant: It makes sense that such a significant experience still lingers in your mind. Let’s explore that thought: how likely do you think it is that you'll face a similar failure again? What evidence do you have for that belief?

User: I guess I just feel like I'm not as good as others, and I can't shake off that feeling. Maybe I am still thinking too much about that incident instead of focusing on what I've achieved since then.

Consultant: Acknowledging that you're still holding onto those feelings is an important step, Shí. Let's try to challenge those negative thoughts. What are some accomplishments or positive experiences you've had since that incident that could help you build a different perspective?

User: Well, I've actually done quite well in my classes, and I got involved in some projects that I really enjoyed. I've also received positive feedback from my professors, which felt nice.

Consultant: Those are significant achievements! It's important to recognize and celebrate them. If a friend of yours faced a similar thought of not being good enough, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably say that they should focus on their strengths and not dwell on past mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes, and it's part of growing.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you have a compassionate perspective towards others. It’s important to practice that same kindness toward yourself. How could you start to apply that positive perspective to your own situation, especially when thoughts of inadequacy arise?

User: Maybe I could remind myself of my successes more often or even write them down. That way, I can look back at them when I start feeling doubtful.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful strategy! Keeping a record of your accomplishments can serve as a great reminder of your capabilities. Let's set a short-term goal for yourself. How about committing to write down one achievement every day for the next week? 

User: I think I can do that! It sounds like a helpful way to change my mindset.

Consultant: I'm glad you're open to trying that, Shí. Additionally, let’s think about some potential career paths that interest you. What fields or roles have you considered?

User: I’ve thought about marketing and public relations because I enjoy communicating with people, but I'm just not sure if I would excel in that area.

Consultant: Those fields can be very rewarding, especially since you enjoy communication! What skills do you think you offer that would be valuable in those areas?

User: I think I'm good at thinking creatively and coming up with ideas. I feel like I can connect with others, too.

Consultant: Those are definitely valuable skills in marketing and public relations! How does it feel to acknowledge your strengths in this way?

User: It feels good, actually. I guess I should focus more on what I'm capable of instead of comparing myself to others.

Consultant: Exactly! Emphasizing your strengths can help build your confidence. As you think about your future, what support do you think you might still need from your family and friends during this transition?

User: I think they can help by encouraging me and maybe guiding me through job applications or networking opportunities. Just knowing they believe in me makes a difference.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Having that support can definitely ease some of the pressure. Perhaps you could have an open conversation with them about your aspirations and how they can help?

User: Yes, I think that would be really beneficial. I should express to them that I appreciate their support and need their guidance.

Consultant: That’s a positive step forward! As we wrap up, let’s summarize what you’ve learned today. You’ve identified some of your strengths, set a goal to acknowledge your achievements, and thought about how to involve your family in your journey. How does this plan feel for you moving forward?

User: It feels optimistic! I think I can shift my focus towards the future with a little more confidence. I’m still a bit uncertain, but this gives me hope.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful outlook. It's completely normal to still feel some uncertainty, but you’ve taken significant steps today. As we conclude our session, remember that it's a process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. You’ve got this, Shí. And if you ever feel overwhelmed, you can always reach out again.

User: Thank you! I'm really grateful for your help today. It feels good to have a plan and more clarity.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Your willingness to work on yourself is commendable. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Shi! I'm glad you're here. Last time we talked about your feelings regarding job searching and your experiences with recruitment activities. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to engage more with the recruitment events and it’s been a mix of excitement and anxiety. I sometimes doubt my ability to shine in these situations.

Consultant: I can see how that mix of excitement and anxiety could be overwhelming. When you think about those recruitment events, what specific thoughts come to mind that contribute to those feelings?

User: I often think that I might not be good enough compared to other candidates. I felt that way since my cheating incident in college, and it lingers on. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Shi. It seems like that past experience still weighs heavily on your mind. Can you tell me more about how these thoughts impact your emotions when you prepare for job opportunities?

User: Whenever I think about preparing for interviews, I feel a wave of anxiety. I worry that I’ll make a mistake, and it makes me hesitate to put myself out there.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you're facing something as significant as job interviews. Have you recognized which specific thoughts or beliefs make you feel anxious in these situations?

User: Well, I keep recalling that I wasn’t honest during my exams and think, “What if they find out I’m not as bright as they think?” 

Consultant: That thought can be really damaging. Let's examine that together. What evidence do you have that suggests you aren't capable or that others might view you this way?

User: I guess I don't have concrete evidence, but it just feels like I’m an imposter. It's hard to shake off that feeling.

Consultant: The feeling of being an imposter is more common than you might think, and it can really distort our self-image. If a friend were in your position, how would you advise them to handle these thoughts?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on their strengths and the hard work they’ve put in, instead of dwelling on past mistakes.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective. It seems that you have recognized the value in your own efforts. How might you apply that same logic to yourself when preparing for job interviews?

User: Maybe I should remind myself of my accomplishments and the effort I've put into my studies, rather than only focusing on my past.

Consultant: Exactly! It's about shifting the focus from the past to your present capabilities. Can we brainstorm some positive affirmations or reminders you could tell yourself before an interview?

User: Sure! I could say, “I’ve worked hard and learned a lot.” Or, “I have valuable skills to offer.”

Consultant: Those are great affirmations! Repeating these positive statements could help counteract the negative thoughts. How do you feel about setting small goals for each recruitment event, so you can build confidence gradually?

User: Setting small goals sounds helpful! Maybe I can aim to make meaningful connections at each event, rather than stressing about the interview outcome. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic approach! By focusing on connections, you can reduce some pressure. What steps could you take to prepare yourself for making those connections?

User: I could research the companies beforehand and prepare some questions to ask. This way, I feel more engaged and less anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Engaging with research will not only prepare you but also give you confidence during conversations. How might you feel after successfully connecting with someone at these events?

User: I’d probably feel a lot more accomplished and maybe a bit less anxious about the whole experience.

Consultant: Exactly, that shift in focus can cultivate a sense of achievement! It’s important to celebrate those small victories. What strategies can you use to remind yourself of these accomplishments as you move forward?

User: I could keep a journal to track my interactions and my feelings about them. That way, I can look back and see my progress.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Journaling can be a powerful tool for reflection. How are you feeling about your job search and the strategies we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel more hopeful and less overwhelmed. I recognize that I can take small steps to improve my confidence and job preparation. 

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve made significant progress today! As we wrap up, what will be your next steps in this process?

User: I’ll start by researching companies and setting goals for my upcoming recruitment events. I’ll also try those affirmations to challenge my negative thoughts.

Consultant: That’s a great plan, Shi! I’m really proud of the progress you’ve made. Remember, it’s natural to have doubts, but you’ve already accomplished so much. If you ever feel overwhelmed, remember to reflect on your strengths. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session.

User: Thank you so much for your support! I feel more equipped to handle this now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, I’m here for you. See you next time and good luck with everything.

Consultant: Hello, Shi! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling mixed emotions. On one hand, I know I've made progress, especially after that mock interview where I received positive feedback. But on the other hand, I still find myself experiencing anxiety and self-doubt about my career path.

Consultant: It sounds like you're recognizing your achievements, which is a great step forward. But I can see that anxiety is still lingering. Can you describe what specifically makes you feel anxious about your career?

User: I think it's just the fear of not being good enough when it comes to the real interviews. The thought of failing or making a mistake just keeps creeping in.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Those feelings of doubt can be really challenging to deal with. Let’s explore this feeling of inadequacy a bit further. What is the thought that goes through your mind when you feel that way?

User: I often think, “What if I mess up like I did in the past?” It just spirals into worrying about everything that could go wrong.

Consultant: So your past experience is casting a shadow on your current thoughts. It must be difficult to shake off those memories. Can you recall a specific moment from that experience that still affects you today?

User: Yes, I remember being in a room full of people I looked up to, and I just panicked. I don't want to feel like that again.

Consultant: It’s tough to relive such moments in your mind, especially when it feels so pivotal to your growth. I wonder, what would your inner dialogue be like if you were more compassionate toward yourself regarding that situation?

User: Maybe I’d think, “Everyone makes mistakes; it doesn't define my entire future.” But it’s hard to convince myself of that when I feel pressure.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! If you could adopt that kinder internal dialogue, how do you think you’d approach your preparation for interviews differently?

User: I suppose I’d be more focused on learning and improving rather than just avoiding mistakes. I could view it more as a chance to grow.

Consultant: Exactly! Shifting the focus from fear to growth can significantly reduce anxiety. Let’s think about how you can channel that mindset into your current preparation. What steps can you take to ensure you’re learning from your experiences while also being kind to yourself?

User: I could keep a journal to reflect on my mock interviews and feedback. That way, I can see my progress rather than just my fears.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic approach! Keeping a journal not only helps you track your growth, but it can also serve as a reminder of your capabilities. How does that plan make you feel about moving forward?

User: It makes me feel a little more hopeful. I think it’ll help me see things more clearly instead of being stuck in my head.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Reflecting on your progress can be a powerful way to boost confidence. What other supportive strategies can you think of that might help you when you start to feel overwhelmed again?

User: Perhaps I could practice breathing techniques or reach out to friends for support. Knowing that I’m not alone could help.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Remember, reaching out and leaning on your support system can make a big difference. Let’s also consider setting some specific goals for your next stage in preparation. What’s one achievable goal you could work towards before your actual interviews?

User: I could aim to do at least two more mock interviews and ask for feedback after each one. That way, I can gain more experience and confidence.

Consultant: That’s a solid goal! Each mock interview can serve as a stepping stone, and the feedback will give you real insights into your improvement. As you work on this, how will you remind yourself to stay compassionate through this process?

User: I think having positive affirmations would help. I could write down some encouraging phrases and read them before my practice sessions.

Consultant: Affirmations can be a powerful tool for self-compassion. What’s an affirmation that resonates with you?

User: “I am capable, and I learn from every experience.” It helps to remind me of my growth.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful affirmation, Shi! Embracing your capabilities and recognizing the value of learning will definitely empower you. As we approach the end of our session, how do you feel about your journey moving forward?

User: I feel much better! I’m more optimistic about my chances and believe I can turn my past mistakes into valuable lessons.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, every step you take is building your resilience and confidence. As we wrap up, do you feel you have the tools you need to manage your anxiety and prepare effectively for your upcoming interviews?

User: Yes, I feel more equipped now. I have a plan, and I’m ready to put it into action.

Consultant: Excellent! I’m proud of you for all the progress you’ve made today. Just remember that it’s a journey. If you need assistance in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. Good luck with your mock interviews and keep nurturing that positive mindset!

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: Hello, Shi! I'm glad to see you for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better overall, especially after passing the initial interview for my internship. However, I still worry about my future and whether I’ll be able to handle the challenges at work.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling better and have made progress with your internship application. Your worries about the future are completely normal. Let’s dive deeper—what specific challenges are you concerned about when starting the internship?

User: I'm mainly worried about how I'll fit in with my colleagues and if I'll be able to perform well. I don't want to embarrass myself like I did in my first year.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling some apprehension about fitting in and performing well. You mentioned your past experience in your first year, and I can see how that could impact your current feelings. Can you tell me more about those worries and how they make you feel?

User: Yeah, I guess I fear judgment from others. Back then, getting caught cheating was really humiliating, and sometimes I still replay those moments in my mind. I'm scared that if I make a mistake at my internship, people will think I'm not capable.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Shi. It's understandable to feel anxious about being judged, especially given your past experience. Let's look at this more closely. What evidence do you have that your colleagues would judge you harshly if you make a mistake?

User: I don't have concrete evidence, to be honest. It's just this feeling I can't shake. I tend to assume the worst in those situations.

Consultant: It's quite common for us to assume the worst without solid evidence. Let's try to challenge that thought. If a colleague were in your position, how would you advise them to view their mistakes?

User: I would tell them that everyone makes mistakes and it’s a learning opportunity. They shouldn't be so hard on themselves.

Consultant: That's a great perspective! So why do you think it's harder for you to apply that same understanding to yourself? 

User: I suppose I hold myself to a higher standard. I want to prove that I've changed and am capable.

Consultant: Striving for high standards can be motivating, but it can also lead to increased pressure and anxiety. What if we worked on ways to remind yourself that being capable doesn't mean being perfect?

User: I think that would help. I need to learn to be more forgiving of myself.

Consultant: That’s an excellent realization, Shi. What are some strategies you could use to practice self-forgiveness when you encounter challenges in the internship?

User: I could keep a journal to reflect on my experiences, focusing on what I learned rather than just my mistakes. Maybe also remind myself about how far I've come since my first year.

Consultant: Journaling is a powerful tool for reflection! Focusing on your growth will help you appreciate your progress. How do you feel about setting some small goals for this internship to help you focus on learning rather than perfection?

User: That sounds like a good idea! I could set a goal to ask for feedback regularly and to approach challenges as opportunities to learn.

Consultant: That's a fantastic approach! Setting those goals will encourage a positive mindset. How about we discuss a plan for how you can achieve these goals during your internship?

User: Sure! I think I'll start by identifying specific tasks where feedback would be beneficial, like projects or presentations. I could also schedule weekly check-ins with my supervisor to ensure I'm on the right track.

Consultant: That sounds very proactive, Shi! Regular check-ins will not only help you gain valuable insights but also reduce anxiety as you’ll have support along the way. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel much more confident! Having a structure in place makes everything seem less overwhelming. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Establishing a structure can indeed help you feel more in control. How about we also think of how to handle moments when self-doubt creeps in?

User: Well, I could practice deep breathing or remind myself of the positive feedback I've received in the past. 

Consultant: Those are excellent techniques! Deep breathing can calm your mind, and reflecting on past successes can boost your confidence. Would you like to explore how you can reinforce these practices in your daily routine?

User: Yes, that would be helpful! Maybe I can set aside a few minutes each morning to breathe and affirm my capabilities.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan to start your day positively! How do you feel about incorporating these moments into your routine?

User: I feel excited! It gives me something to look forward to each day and a way to ground myself.

Consultant: That's fantastic! Daily affirmations and moments of mindfulness can really enhance your emotional well-being. As we prepare to wrap up, what key takeaways do you want to hold onto from our conversation today?

User: I want to remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that I can learn from them. Keeping a positive mindset and having a plan will definitely help with my internship.

Consultant: Those are great takeaways! Emphasizing learning and maintaining a positive mindset can truly support your growth. Remember, it's all part of the journey. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help today. I feel more prepared and optimistic about the future.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Shi! You've made significant progress today. If you find yourself needing support again, don’t hesitate to reach out. Good luck with your internship, and I believe you will do great! 

User: Thank you! This has been really encouraging. I will keep in touch!
