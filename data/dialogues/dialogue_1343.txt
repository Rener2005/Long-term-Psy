Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious, especially with all the lab work at school. I feel overwhelmed sharing equipment with others, and my obsession with cleanliness is just getting worse.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like the increased lab work is causing you to feel anxious, particularly due to your sensitivity to bacteria and cleanliness. Let's talk more about that. Can you describe what specifically happens in those situations?

User: Well, when I have to use shared equipment, I just can't stop thinking about how dirty it might be. I feel the urge to clean everything around me, and it makes it hard to focus on the experiment.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It seems like your fear of dirtiness is interfering with your ability to concentrate. What thoughts go through your mind when you think about using shared equipment?

User: I keep thinking that if I touch something unclean, I'll get sick or something bad will happen. It feels like I have to control the situation, or I'll be overwhelmed by it.

Consultant: Your concerns about cleanliness seem to be quite intense. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure to maintain control over your environment to feel safe. Have you noticed any specific feelings that arise when you have these thoughts?

User: I feel very anxious, and my heart races. Sometimes, I even feel like I need to leave the lab because I can't handle it. I wish I could just stop worrying so much.

Consultant: I can understand how distressing that must be for you. Let's explore these automatic thoughts together. Is there an example of a recent lab situation where you felt this way?

User: Yes, just last week, I had to share a microscope with a classmate, and I couldn't focus at all. I was just thinking about how many people had used it before me.

Consultant: That situation sounds challenging. What was the thought you had about the microscope specifically?

User: I thought that it must be covered in germs, and if I used it without cleaning it first, I might get sick.

Consultant: It's understandable to have these thoughts, especially when you're sensitive to cleanliness. But let's examine that belief; what evidence do you have that using the microscope without cleaning it will lead to getting sick?

User: I don't know... I guess I don't really have any solid proof, but my mind just goes there. It feels like a genuine risk.

Consultant: It’s common for our minds to jump to the worst-case scenario. Let's try to reframe that thought. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them to think?

User: I would probably tell them that most lab equipment is cleaned regularly and that getting sick from one use is very unlikely.

Consultant: That’s a helpful perspective! It shows that there’s another way to view the situation. Let's create a list of supportive thoughts to challenge your automatic ones. Would that be okay?

User: Yes, that could help, I think.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start by writing down the anxious thought you had about the microscope, and then we’ll work on identifying some balanced thoughts that can replace it.

User: Okay. The thought was, "If I use the microscope without cleaning it, I will get sick."

Consultant: Perfect. Now, let’s brainstorm some thoughts that could challenge that belief. For instance, "Using the microscope is unlikely to expose me to harmful germs," or "I can take reasonable precautions without overreacting." What do you think about these ideas?

User: Those sound reasonable, but I still worry about being contaminated.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. It might be useful to also add thoughts like “I can wash my hands afterward” or “The school ensures equipment is sanitized regularly.” These thoughts can help reduce the intensity of the fear. 

User: Yes, those do sound reassuring.

Consultant: Now, think about your feelings when you challenge those anxious thoughts. How does it feel to have some alternative perspectives?

User: I feel a bit lighter, maybe a little less overwhelmed thinking about it that way.

Consultant: That’s a positive sign! It shows that challenging those beliefs can help alleviate some of that anxiety. Would you be willing to try using these balanced thoughts in your next lab session?

User: Yes, I think I can give it a try.

Consultant: Excellent! And as you do that, keep track of the feelings and changes in your thoughts. This can give us good insights for our next meeting. 

User: I will definitely do that!

Consultant: Fantastic! Let’s now discuss some practical strategies that you can use to manage anxiety when sharing equipment. What do you normally do to cope when you start feeling anxious?

User: Honestly, I usually just try to avoid the situation altogether, which isn't helping.

Consultant: Avoidance can provide temporary relief, but it often strengthens anxiety in the long run. Let’s consider some step-by-step approaches to gradually face these situations, starting with low-risk exposure. 

User: That makes sense. What would that look like?

Consultant: For instance, you might first visit the lab when no one else is there, just to familiarize yourself with the environment again. Then, you could gradually work your way up to sharing equipment with a trusted lab partner. 

User: I like that idea. It feels more manageable.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, it’s all about taking small, positive steps. How do you think you could apply this approach to your next lab session?

User: I can plan a visit to the lab when it's quieter first, and then maybe practice sharing equipment with a classmate I trust. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Each step will help you build confidence. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what you’ve learned and how you feel about tackling your anxiety.

User: I feel quite hopeful. Understanding my thoughts better and having a plan makes me feel more in control.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You’re making significant progress in understanding and challenging your fears. Before we finish, what strategies do you think will be most useful for you moving forward?

User: I think practicing the alternative thoughts and gradually facing my fears will be really helpful.

Consultant: I believe those strategies are effective and will help you manage your anxiety better. Keep in mind that it’s a journey, and you’re not alone. 

User: Thank you. I appreciate your support and guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, it's okay to feel anxious; what matters is how you respond to it. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. 

User: Me too! Thanks again, I feel a lot better.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Take care until we meet again.

Consultant: Hello, I'm glad to see you today. It's great that you're open to discussing your feelings. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been okay, but I still feel anxious, especially after that group activity where I was around so many people. I thought I'd feel better, but now I'm worried about cleanliness even more.

Consultant: It sounds like the group activity may have triggered some emotions. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts or feelings you experienced during and after the event?

User: During the activity, I felt overwhelmed by the idea of germs and cleanliness. Afterward, I realized I kept checking my hands and clothes to ensure I was clean. It’s like I can’t shake off that feeling of anxiety.

Consultant: I understand that checking your hygiene provides a sense of control, but it seems like it might also be adding to your anxiety. Let's explore that a bit. What thoughts go through your mind when you're feeling the need to check your cleanliness?

User: I think things like "What if I touched something dirty?" or "What if I get sick?" It makes me feel panicked, and then I feel like I have to clean or wash everything obsessively.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite distressing. When you think that way, how do you feel emotionally—do you notice any specific feelings in your body?

User: I feel tense, and my heart races. It's like I can't focus on anything else because I'm so preoccupied with cleanliness.

Consultant: That’s a tough place to be in. It sounds like your fear of germs is really impacting your emotional state. What would it mean for you to reduce those thoughts and feelings around cleanliness?

User: I think it would mean I could feel more relaxed and enjoy time with friends without worrying constantly about germs.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive goal. Let's continue to challenge some of those beliefs together. Can you recall a moment recently when you felt an urge to clean or check for dirt and how it made you feel afterward?

User: Yes, there was a moment when a friend touched something on a table before I did, and I panicked. I cleaned my hands so much afterward, and I still felt anxious even though I knew I was clean.

Consultant: It appears that even after taking action to ensure cleanliness, the lingering anxiety suggests a deeper belief about the situation. What if we looked at that moment critically? What evidence do you have that your friend’s action posed a real threat?

User: I guess there isn’t much evidence; it’s just this overwhelming fear I have. Logically, I know it’s okay, but it still scares me.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a disconnect between your rational understanding and your feelings. Perhaps we can explore an alternative thought—what if you allowed yourself to think, "It's okay to be in close proximity to others"? How would that change your feelings in that moment?

User: Maybe I wouldn’t feel so scared all the time. But it’s hard for me to let go of those concerns.

Consultant: I understand that it's challenging to shift those ingrained fears. What if we practiced some gradual exposure? We could start with small steps that help you tolerate those situations while acknowledging your feelings. For example, could you think of a less intimidating social setting to try this approach?

User: I think I could try sitting with a friend who I trust in a café, but I’m unsure if I could handle it without feeling anxious.

Consultant: That's a good start! We can take it slow. Let's create a plan where you can practice being in that setting, and if you start feeling anxious, we can develop ways to manage that emotion together. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good, but I might find it difficult to begin even that small step.

Consultant: It is completely understandable to feel that way. How about we develop a comforting dialogue or self-talk for you to say when you start feeling anxious? Something like, "It's okay to feel a bit anxious. I’m in a safe space." Would you be open to trying that?

User: Yes, that could help. Having something to say might remind me that I'm okay.

Consultant: Great! Remember, it's all about taking small, manageable steps. If we break it down, each time you try, you’ll be less overwhelmed. Let’s also set aside time for you to evaluate how each experience feels afterward. Does that sound good?

User: Yes, I can do that. I think keeping track of how I feel will help.

Consultant: Perfect! Remember, it's a journey, and it’s okay to have some ups and downs. With each experienced moment, you're building resilience, and we'll tackle this together. Is there anything else you want to address today?

User: I think that’s it for now. I really appreciate your support in handling my fears.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. You’re doing an incredible job by facing these challenges. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Please be kind to yourself. 

User: Thank you! I will try to be more patient with myself.

Consultant: That's a great mindset! Remember, patience is key. Take care and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Yuxia! I'm glad you could make it today. Let's start by discussing what's been troubling you lately. How have you been feeling since the last session?

User: Hi. I'm still feeling really anxious, especially after the incident in my lab class. I spilled some reagents, and now I’m constantly worrying about hygiene. It feels overwhelming at times.

Consultant: That sounds quite distressing. It's understandable to feel anxious after such an incident, especially given your high standards for cleanliness. Could you share more about what thoughts and feelings came up for you during that situation?

User: When I spilled the reagent, I panicked and immediately started cleaning up. But afterward, I kept thinking about how dirty everything was, and it made me feel really anxious. I couldn't stop worrying that I might get sick or that it would happen again.

Consultant: It seems like that moment triggered a lot of anxious thoughts about cleanliness and your safety. Can you recall what specific thoughts crossed your mind at that time? How did those thoughts affect your emotions?

User: I kept thinking, "What if I touched something contaminated?" or "What if I get sick from this?" And every time I thought that, my anxiety would just spiral. It felt like I needed to clean everything multiple times to feel safe.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like those thoughts reinforce your anxiety and lead to a cycle of excessive cleaning. Let's take a closer look at those thoughts. Do you think they are a bit extreme or unrealistic at times? What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts those thoughts?

User: I guess they are pretty extreme. I mean, I cleaned the area right away, and my friends said it was fine. But I just can't shake off the worry. It's like even if there's a little doubt, I have to be extra cautious.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize the thoughts may be excessive. If a friend were in your situation, how would you advise them to view it? Would you suggest they feel the same level of anxiety, or would you have a different perspective for them?

User: I think I would tell them not to worry so much. Accidents happen, and they took care of it right away. I guess I’m harder on myself than I would be on others.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Yuxia! You tend to hold yourself to very strict standards. This brings us to the idea of how we can challenge and reframe some of these negative thoughts. What if we tried to consider a more balanced perspective together? 

User: I’d like to try that. But it's really hard to change my thinking, especially when I feel anxious.

Consultant: Understandably so. It takes practice, but you’ve already made some good progress in recognizing those patterns. Let’s try creating a reality check for your thoughts. For instance, when you think, "What if I get sick?", we can list factual evidence about your safety after cleaning. 

User: That sounds like it could help. Like thinking about how I handled it right away and was careful.

Consultant: Exactly! Let’s build on that. We can turn it into a small exercise. What if you wrote down three things that went well after the spill? This could help reinforce a sense of safety.

User: I can try that. I mean, I cleaned up the spill fast, my friends helped, and we moved on to the next part of the lab.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Recognizing those positives can really make a difference. Now, let’s think about some steps you can take when similar situations arise. What activities or approaches could help you manage the anxiety in a practical way without needing to resort to excessive cleaning?

User: Maybe I could take a few deep breaths first and remind myself that everything is clean. Or maybe talk to a friend nearby if I am feeling overwhelmed?

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Deep breathing can help calm your mind, and sharing your feelings with a friend can provide support. Let's set a small goal for the next time you face a similar situation. How about practicing one of these techniques?

User: I can do that. Setting a small goal feels less intimidating.

Consultant: That’s a good approach! Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. And as we work through this, we might want to monitor how effective your strategies are in reducing your anxiety. Afterward, we can discuss how you felt and what worked.

User: I like that plan. I hope I can remind myself to be kinder to myself during these moments.

Consultant: That's a positive intention, and it's crucial to be compassionate towards yourself. Let’s also think about how you can celebrate small successes, like when you use one of these techniques. How might you acknowledge your progress?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to something I enjoy, like a nice coffee or a little break time.

Consultant: I love that idea! Rewarding yourself reinforces the positive steps you’re taking. As we wrap up today, do you feel more equipped to handle unexpected situations? 

User: Yes, I do. I feel like I have more tools to approach these moments without spiraling into worry. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Yuxia! Remember, progress takes time and practice. Likely, you’ll encounter challenges, but you have strategies now to manage them. Keep focusing on those positive steps. 

User: I will, thank you!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to our next session and hearing how you’ve applied these ideas. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been thinking a lot since our last talk. Learning about obsessive-compulsive disorder in my psychology class has made me wonder if some of my behaviors are similar. It's a bit confusing.

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like this new information has prompted some self-reflection. What specific behaviors are you questioning, and how do they make you feel?

User: Well, I find myself excessively cleaning things around me, like my desk and my room. I feel this overwhelming need to have everything in order, and it stresses me out if it’s not.

Consultant: It sounds like maintaining order brings you a sense of relief, but it's also causing you stress. Is there a particular instance or situation where you've felt this stress the most recently?

User: Yes, just the other day, I couldn’t concentrate on my studies because I kept feeling like I needed to clean. It felt like it was taking over my ability to focus.

Consultant: That sounds very challenging. It appears that the urge to clean is interfering with your ability to concentrate on studying. How do you feel during and after these cleaning episodes?

User: During it, I feel a sense of control, but afterward, I realize I've wasted a lot of time. It makes me feel frustrated with myself.

Consultant: I see. You experience a temporary sense of control, but it's followed by frustration and regret. Would you be willing to explore what thoughts come to your mind in those moments when you feel the need to clean?

User: Well, I often think that if I don't clean right away, things will get out of control or that I'll fail if I don’t stay organized. 

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite powerful for you. They suggest a fear of chaos and failure. How realistic do you think those thoughts are? Is there any evidence to support them?

User: I guess it might be a bit extreme to think that. My friends’ places aren’t as tidy as mine, and they do fine in their studies. 

Consultant: That's an important observation! It seems that comparing yourself to others might help in recognizing that there's a range of acceptable cleanliness. What would it be like to adjust that thinking in a way that feels more balanced?

User: It could be liberating to think that way. Maybe I don’t have to be as strict with myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a valuable insight! What would be a small step you could take to start changing this habit and that pattern of thinking?

User: I could set specific times to clean and stick to them, rather than letting it take over my study time. That way, I can still keep my space tidy without losing focus.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! By setting boundaries on your cleaning time, you’d create more space to focus on your studies. How do you feel about implementing this change?

User: I feel hopeful. It seems achievable, but I’m a little nervous about breaking my routine.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about change, especially when it involves habits we’ve had for a long time. What support do you think you might need from others to help you during this process?

User: I could talk to my friends about it. They can help remind me not to get carried away with cleaning when I should be studying.

Consultant: Involving your friends is a great idea! Social support can really help reinforce your new strategies. How do you think your friends would respond if you shared this with them?

User: I think they’d be really understanding. They often joke about my cleaning habits, but I believe they would help me stay focused if I asked.

Consultant: It's wonderful that you have understanding friends. Their support can make a real difference as you work on these changes. As we move toward concluding this session, let's summarize what you've learned today. What would you say are your main takeaways?

User: I’ve realized that my need to clean might be a bit extreme and that I can change my thinking about it. Setting specific times to clean and getting my friends involved could really help.

Consultant: That’s exactly right! Identifying those thoughts and developing a plan are significant steps toward managing your feelings and behaviors. How do you feel about the progress you've made today?

User: I feel relieved and more empowered to make changes. It’s nice to see things in a new light.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've shown a lot of motivation and insight today. Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out for support.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help and understanding. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! It's been a pleasure working with you. Keep in mind the strategies we've discussed today, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yu! It's great to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially with the feedback from your classmates?

User: Hi! I've been feeling much lighter, actually. The support from my dormmates really helped. I realized I’m not alone in my habits, and it’s encouraging.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful to hear! It’s great that you've found support among your peers. In the context of your cleaning habits, how do you feel about the changes you’re trying to make?

User: I feel more motivated to change my cleaning habits. Knowing that my classmates understand me made it easier to reflect on what I'm doing.

Consultant: It’s valuable to have that understanding and encouragement. Can you share any specific moments or experiences from this past week that reinforced this motivation for you?

User: Sure! A few days ago, I shared my cleaning routine with them, and they were really supportive. They even shared their routines, which made me feel more normal about my concerns.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Sharing experiences can really help us feel validated. How did this conversation influence your thoughts about your cleaning habits?

User: It made me realize that maybe my cleaning habits weren’t as extreme as I thought. Listening to my friends made me recognize we all have our quirks.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re gaining perspective on this. What thoughts or feelings come to mind when you think about the potential need to simplify your cleaning routine, based on what you’ve learned from your friends?

User: I think I might be able to let go of some of my strict rules. It feels good to think that maybe I can be more flexible without feeling anxious.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight! Flexibility can be really beneficial. What kind of changes are you considering making in your cleaning routine, with that newfound perspective?

User: I’m thinking of setting a timer for cleaning, so I don’t spend too much time on it. I also want to focus on only cleaning when it's truly necessary, rather than all the time.

Consultant: Those sound like practical strategies! Setting a timer can limit overextending yourself. What emotions arise when you envision implementing these new strategies?

User: I feel relieved and a bit excited. It seems less overwhelming if I know I have a limit and can focus on the essentials.

Consultant: Excellent! Feeling relieved is a positive sign. Let’s discuss how you can gradually introduce these strategies. How about starting with a specific cleaning task? 

User: I’d like to start with my desk area, where I often end up cleaning for too long. Setting a 15-minute timer for it sounds manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect place to begin. During this process, how will you remind yourself that it's okay to keep it simple and not over-clean?

User: I can write a note on my desk saying, “Focus on what’s necessary today!” Just a little reminder to be kind to myself during cleaning.

Consultant: I love that idea! Having a visual reminder can be very helpful. As you start implementing these changes, how might you share your progress with your friends for additional support?

User: I could share updates in our group chat or even have a small cleaning buddy session. Knowing they're there might help me stick to my plan.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach! Connecting with your friends can reinforce positive changes. As we near the end of our session today, let’s recap your progress and plan going forward. What do you feel is your main takeaway?

User: My main takeaway is that I don’t need to do everything perfectly and that I have support from my friends. I can enjoy cleaning without feeling anxious.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! You’ve made significant progress today. How will you maintain this positive change and keep your cleaning habits healthy moving forward?

User: I plan to check in with my classmates regularly, keep using timers, and remember the importance of being flexible. It feels good to have a plan!

Consultant: That sounds like a strong plan, Yu! Remember, you are capable of managing this with the support you have. If challenges arise, don’t hesitate to reach out. I'm confident in your ability to maintain these habits. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate the encouragement and guidance. I feel much more in control now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You've worked hard to come this far, and I look forward to hearing about your continued success. Today’s session was our last one for now, but I’m always here if you need further assistance. Take care!

User: Thank you so much! I’ll definitely keep in touch and let you know how things go.

Consultant: Hello, Yú, welcome back! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? What progress have you noticed regarding your cleanliness anxiety?

User: Hi! I've been feeling much better, honestly. I've been able to control my cleaning behaviors more effectively. Though I still feel the urge at times, I can manage it better than before.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Yú! It sounds like you're gaining more control over those urges. Can you tell me about some specific situations where you felt you've made progress?

User: Sure! There was a time last week when I felt the need to clean my room obsessively because it was a bit messy. But instead of immediately giving in, I took a step back and told myself it was okay to leave it for a bit. I managed to do my assignments first.

Consultant: That’s a significant improvement! Recognizing the urge and choosing to prioritize other activities is a great step forward. How did that make you feel afterward?

User: I felt relieved and proud of myself for not giving in to the compulsion. It gave me a sense of confidence that I could handle my anxiety without resorting to cleaning.

Consultant: That sense of confidence is invaluable. What strategies do you think helped you make that decision to focus on your assignments instead?

User: I believe that reading about managing anxiety and discussing it with you in previous sessions has helped me a lot. I've tried to remind myself that my worth isn't measured by the cleanliness of my space.

Consultant: That’s an excellent realization, Yú. Acknowledging that your self-worth isn't tied to cleanliness is a powerful mindset shift. As we evaluate your overall progress today, what specific achievements are you most proud of?

User: I’m proud that I’ve been able to confront my fears and not let them rule my actions. I also find that sharing my experiences with friends helps a lot.

Consultant: Sharing certainly makes a difference. Connecting with others can provide support and different perspectives on your feelings. How do your friends respond when you talk to them about your challenges?

User: They’re supportive! They often remind me of the progress I've made when I start doubting myself. It feels great to have that encouragement.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to have such a supportive network! Now, as we look ahead, what are some strategies you think would help you maintain this progress long-term? 

User: I think setting small, manageable goals for myself could be helpful. Maybe things like establishing a cleaning schedule or practicing mindfulness when I feel anxious.

Consultant: Those are effective strategies! Setting small goals can be much more manageable and less overwhelming. And mindfulness can help you to stay present without spiraling into anxiety. How do you feel about incorporating those into your routine?

User: I feel quite positive about it. I think establishing a routine will provide some structure, and mindfulness will remind me to be kind to myself.

Consultant: That's a wonderful approach, Yú. Would you like to outline a basic plan for how you might implement these strategies into your daily life?

User: Yes! I could start by designating specific days for cleaning tasks and picking one mindfulness technique to practice daily. Maybe I could also track my feelings in a journal.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Journaling your feelings can also help you reflect on your emotional state and recognize any triggers. How does it feel to develop this structured plan for yourself?

User: It feels reassuring to have a plan. I think it will help me stay focused on my goals and remind me of my progress.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflecting on your progress regularly will reinforce your confidence and reinforce those positive behaviors. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize your key takeaways. What have you learned about yourself that you want to carry forward?

User: I’ve learned that I am capable of managing my anxiety better than I thought, and that I don’t have to be perfect. Also, it’s important to have a support system in place.

Consultant: Those are powerful insights, Yú. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. As you implement your plan, keep acknowledging your successes, big or small. Would you feel ready to handle any challenges that come up?

User: Yes, I feel equipped to face challenges now. I’ll keep referring back to our discussions and my journal.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! You’ve come a long way, and I truly believe you can maintain these positive changes. If challenges arise, remember your strategies and your support network. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance throughout this journey. It has made a huge difference for me.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Yú. It’s been a pleasure witnessing your progress. Remember, if you ever need to revisit any strategies or seek additional support, I'm here for you. Take care, and goodbye for now!

User: Bye! Thank you again!
