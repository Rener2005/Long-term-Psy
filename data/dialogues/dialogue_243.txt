Consultant: Hello, I'm glad you're here for our session today, Xiao Zhang. I know you've been experiencing some difficulties with anger since starting high school. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Lately, I've been getting really frustrated at school, especially with some of my classmates. I just can't stand their behavior, and I've lost my temper several times. I know I need to change this.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling quite overwhelmed by your classmates' actions, and it's leading to strong feelings of anger. Let’s explore a bit further—what specific situations make you feel the most angry or frustrated?

User: Mostly when they disrespect teachers or cheat during exams. I feel like they don’t care about anything, and it really bothers me. 

Consultant: That makes sense. It sounds like you have strong values about respect and integrity, and when you see those values being challenged, it triggers a deep emotional response in you. Can you share what thoughts go through your mind when these situations happen?

User: I often think they’re just ruining everything for everyone else, and sometimes I feel like I have to say something or stand up to them, but when I do, it just turns into an argument.

Consultant: It's understandable that you feel the need to speak up for what you believe is right. However, it seems that this approach often leads to more conflict. How does it feel afterward when you lose your temper?

User: I usually regret it later. I hate feeling angry, and then I worry what others think of me. It makes me feel even worse.

Consultant: Regret can be a heavy emotion. It shows that you care about how you come across to others, which is valuable. Let’s take a moment to identify what triggers this anger. Can you recall a recent incident that made you feel particularly upset?

User: Yes, just last week, a classmate mocked a teacher during a lesson. I couldn’t hold back and shouted at him, but it didn’t help anything and just made the situation worse.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. You reacted based on a strong impulse to defend your beliefs, which is a natural response. However, it seems the aftermath didn't lead to the resolution you hoped for. What were your thoughts right after you shouted?

User: I felt a mix of relief and regret. I wanted to stop the behavior, but it felt like I overreacted.

Consultant: It's important to recognize those feelings. Your reaction was driven by a strong desire for justice, but we can work together to find more effective ways to express your feelings without escalating the situation. Have you ever considered ways to pause before reacting in such moments?

User: I haven't really thought about that. I usually just act on impulse.

Consultant: That’s quite common, especially during emotional moments. Perhaps we can develop a strategy that allows you to take a breath and assess the situation before responding. What do you think could help you in those moments?

User: Maybe counting to ten before I react? It might give me time to think.

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! Counting to ten can create space for you to calm down and reconsider your response. Let’s practice together: if you find yourself getting angry, what steps would you take after counting to ten?

User: I would try to think about why I'm feeling this way and if it’s worth reacting. Maybe I could even try talking to the person later instead?

Consultant: Exactly! Reflecting on your feelings before responding can help you decide the best course of action. It might also give you a chance to communicate your feelings without escalating tensions. How does that sound to you?

User: Sounds good! I think I can try that. 

Consultant: I believe you can, too. As we continue our sessions, we can explore more techniques to manage your feelings and improve your interactions with others. Is there anything else you would like to address today?

User: I also want to work on my relationship with my family. I feel so sensitive around them lately, especially when we have arguments. 

Consultant: That’s an important area to focus on. It’s natural to feel more vulnerable around family. We can look into understanding your feelings in those situations and find ways to approach conflicts more calmly. How do you usually react during family arguments?

User: I often get angry and just shout. I know it’s not right, but I can’t seem to control it.

Consultant: It’s commendable that you recognize this pattern. Can we explore some techniques similar to what we discussed today that might help in those family situations?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I don’t want to keep getting into fights with them. 

Consultant: Great! One technique is to identify your feelings and the thoughts that accompany them before reacting. It might also help to express those feelings calmly. How might you try that during your next family discussion?

User: I could try to say, “I feel upset when we argue because I care about our relationship.” 

Consultant: That’s an excellent way to express your feelings! It emphasizes your care and can lead to a more constructive conversation. As you practice this, how do you think it will change your interactions with them?

User: I hope it will help us communicate better, and maybe we’ll argue less. 

Consultant: That’s a healthy goal. Over time, developing these skills will help you build stronger connections with your family. Let’s make it a focus for our future sessions. How are you feeling about everything we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel hopeful. I like having plans for managing my feelings. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Xiao Zhang! It's a positive step forward. Remember, change takes time, but with each small step, you'll be able to see improvements in how you manage your emotions and relationships. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance today.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I'm here to support you. Let’s continue this work together in our next session, and I look forward to hearing about your progress.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! I'm glad to see you today. I understand you've had some recent family conflicts. Can you share more about how you've been feeling?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been feeling really overwhelmed. I had this big fight with my mom because she decided to cook less spicy food. It felt like she was ignoring what I wanted, and it made me really frustrated.

Consultant: That sounds really intense, and it's understandable to feel frustrated in that situation. When you think about that conflict, what emotions come to the surface for you?

User: I felt ignored and angry. It just seems like no one in my family understands how I feel. I don’t like feeling this way, especially when we argue.

Consultant: Feeling ignored is tough, especially when it leads to arguments. It seems like these conflicts are really affecting you. Would you say this sensitivity to family dynamics has been a pattern for you?

User: Yeah, I think so. I always feel like I have to defend myself or that my feelings don’t matter. My home feels like a battlefield sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a lot of tension in your home environment. I’d love to explore how your emotions influence how you react during these disagreements. Can you recall specific thoughts that went through your mind during this recent argument with your mom?

User: I kept thinking that she doesn’t care about me at all. It just felt like she was dismissing my feelings about the food. 

Consultant: Those thoughts of being dismissed really seem to amplify your feelings of anger. How did those thoughts affect your response during the argument?

User: They made me lash out. I started shouting and saying things I didn't mean. But afterward, I felt bad for saying those things.

Consultant: It's really common to act out when we're feeling misunderstood. It seems like there's a cycle where your feelings and thoughts lead to reactions that you later regret. What do you think would help you respond differently in those heated moments?

User: I think I need to stay calm and not let my emotions take over, but it's so hard when I feel that way.

Consultant: Absolutely, staying calm in the heat of the moment can be a challenge. One approach we could try is to identify some grounding techniques that can help you manage your emotions better. Would you be interested in exploring some strategies together?

User: Yes, definitely. I want to learn how to handle these situations better.

Consultant: Great! One technique we could use is taking a moment to breathe deeply and gather your thoughts before responding. Would you be open to practicing that now? 

User: Sure, I can try that. 

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s practice it together. Imagine the next time a conflict arises, you take a deep breath before reacting. Can you picture that moment and how you might feel afterwards?

User: I think I’d feel more in control. It might help calm things down instead of making it worse.

Consultant: Exactly! Deep breathing can help create a pause, giving you space to think before you respond. Let’s also brainstorm some phrases you might use to express your feelings without escalating the situation.

User: That sounds good. Like saying “I feel hurt when…” instead of shouting?

Consultant: Yes, that’s a wonderful start! Using “I feel” statements can really help convey your emotions without blaming the other person. Can you think of a specific example of how you could use that in a future conversation with your mom?

User: Maybe I could say, “I feel sad when I see you changing what we eat because it makes me feel left out.”

Consultant: That’s a powerful statement, Xiaozhang! It expresses your feelings clearly without putting her on the defensive. How does saying it this way make you feel compared to how you normally express yourself?

User: I feel like it might help her understand me better, instead of causing another fight.

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s a step towards fostering better communication. Let’s also consider what triggers those heightened emotions for you during family interactions. Can you identify any patterns or specific situations that usually lead to conflict?

User: I think anytime my preferences are overlooked or if someone is too critical, I get upset really quickly.

Consultant: Recognizing those triggers is important. It might help to reflect on what you can do when you start feeling that way—perhaps taking a time-out or discussing it calmly when everyone is more relaxed. What do you think?

User: That could work. Sometimes I just need to step away to collect my thoughts before I say something I regret.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. By taking a step back, you’re allowing yourself to regain control over your emotions. As we move forward, practicing these new skills will be vital. Would you like to role-play a scenario to apply these skills in a real situation?

User: Yes, I would like that. It might help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Alright! Let’s create a situation where your mom changes something again, and you get to express your feelings using your “I feel” statement. I’ll play your mom, and you can respond however you’d like.

User: Okay, I’m ready. “Mom, I noticed you made the food less spicy again. I feel sad because I really enjoy it that way. Can we talk about it?”

Consultant: That was excellent, Xiaozhang! You communicated your feelings clearly and opened the door for discussion. How did it feel to say that?

User: It felt empowering, like I’m finally saying what’s on my mind in a calm way.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s a huge step towards reducing misunderstandings and improving your family relationships. As we conclude today’s session, what are your key takeaways, and how can you apply them moving forward?

User: I learned that expressing my feelings calmly might help avoid fights. I’ll try using deeper breaths and “I feel” statements next time.

Consultant: Those are excellent insights! I believe you have the tools to foster better communication with your family. Remember, it might take practice, but you’re on the right track. If challenges arise, I’m here for you.

User: Thank you. I really appreciate your guidance. 

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xiaozhang! I’m proud of your progress, and I look forward to our next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! I'm glad to have you here today. I know you've been feeling misunderstood lately, especially in your interactions at school. Can you tell me more about what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. Yes, it's been really tough. I tried to address cheating during a group project, but my classmates thought I was being too harsh. It led to a big argument, and now I feel stuck. I just want things to be better between us.

Consultant: It sounds like a challenging situation, and I appreciate you sharing it with me. You want to improve your relationships and find effective ways to communicate without causing misunderstandings. What would you like to see happen in your interactions with your classmates?

User: I hope we can have open conversations where everyone feels heard. I don't want to come off as strict. I just want to maintain integrity without causing upset.

Consultant: That’s a great goal. Let’s explore how you can communicate your thoughts while making others feel comfortable. Can you recall how you felt during that argument with your classmates? What thoughts went through your mind at that moment?

User: I felt frustrated and a bit helpless. I thought if I didn’t speak up, it would be unfair, but maybe I overreacted. I just wanted to set a good example.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to want to uphold integrity. It seems like there was a conflict between your values and how others perceived your actions. How did their reactions affect your feelings about yourself?

User: I started doubting whether I was being too rigid or if I’m just not good at handling social situations. It made me feel bad about myself.

Consultant: That sounds tough. It’s difficult when we want to stand by our beliefs but feel alienated in the process. It could help to think about what thoughts you might have that contribute to these feelings of doubt. Have you noticed any strong or negative thoughts about yourself during these moments?

User: I often think that I’m not likable or that I’m being judged for my views. It's like I can’t fit in.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really hard to deal with. Remember, many people experience similar feelings in social situations. What if we looked at those thoughts together? How much evidence do you see for the belief that you’re not likable?

User: I guess I don’t really have clear evidence, just a feeling. But in that moment, it felt so real.

Consultant: It makes sense that feelings can seem like facts, especially under stress. Let’s consider what you would tell a friend who felt this way. How would you guide them to view their situation differently?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone has different opinions, and it’s okay to speak up. They shouldn’t take things too personally.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective! Now let’s explore how you might apply that understanding to yourself. What if you tried reminding yourself that it's okay to express your thoughts, and not everyone will agree with you?

User: That could help. I need to focus on being authentic and not worry so much about others' opinions. 

Consultant: Exactly! Your authenticity is valuable. Let’s practice some scenarios where you can express your thoughts without feeling pressured. How do you feel about trying out some role-playing with different responses you might give in class discussions?

User: I think that would be useful. I want to practice expressing myself calmly.

Consultant: Great! I’ll play the role of a classmate who disagrees with your viewpoint. As you respond, focus on staying calm and using phrases that allow for open communication. Ready to give it a try?

User: Yes, let’s do it!

Consultant: Alright, here we go! I disagree with you about how we should handle cheating. I think everyone should be free to decide for themselves without judgment. 

User: I understand your point. I just feel that honesty is really important in our group work to make sure we all succeed together. What do you think about ways we can work well as a team?

Consultant: That was a thoughtful response! You acknowledged the other person's perspective while also expressing your feelings. How did it feel to respond that way?

User: It felt relieving, like I was heard but still said what I believed.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Maintaining that balance of expressing yourself while respecting others will help foster a more positive dynamic. How do you want to build on this experience moving forward?

User: I want to continue practicing these skills and try using them in real situations with my classmates.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! To recap our session, you’ve recognized how to communicate your values while being open to others' views. What do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our conversation today?

User: I’ve learned that it’s okay to voice my thoughts and that it’s important to remain open. I feel more confident about my social interactions now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful progress, Xiaozhang! Remember these strategies as you move forward. I'm proud of the steps you’ve taken today. If you feel overwhelmed again, we can always discuss it further. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I feel more positive about approaching my friends now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been great working with you, and I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! I'm glad you're here today. I see you've had some positive experiences recently with the volunteer activity. Can you share what those experiences were like for you?

User: Hi! Yes, being involved in the volunteer activity really made me feel good. I enjoyed helping others, and it gave me a sense of purpose. It's nice to feel valued.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Helping others often brings a sense of fulfillment. Can you tell me more about how this experience has impacted your feelings about yourself?

User: It made me realize that I can contribute to my community and help others. I felt proud of myself, something I don’t usually feel.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you felt proud! It seems like this experience helped you see your value more clearly. Have you noticed any changes in how you feel about your emotions after this activity?

User: I think so. I’ve been feeling happier and more optimistic. But sometimes I still struggle with my emotions, especially when something stressful happens.

Consultant: Acknowledging that shift in your feelings is important. It's normal to have ups and downs. Can you think of a particular stressful event that has affected you recently?

User: Well, there was a test last week that made me quite anxious. I felt overwhelmed and thought I wouldn’t do well.

Consultant: I understand that feeling anxious before a test is tough. When you were feeling overwhelmed, what kind of thoughts were running through your mind?

User: I kept thinking that if I didn’t ace the test, it would mean I’m not smart enough. It made me really anxious about studying for it.

Consultant: It sounds like you experienced a lot of pressure. That thought you mentioned—feeling not smart enough—can be pretty heavy. Have you noticed if this type of thinking happens in other situations as well?

User: Yes, I think it does. I often feel like I need to prove myself, especially compared to my sister who is doing really well.

Consultant: It's quite common to compare ourselves to others, especially family members. Let’s explore that thought: what evidence do you have that you are not smart enough? 

User: I guess I don't have solid evidence. It's just a feeling I get when I'm under pressure.

Consultant: That's a crucial insight! Recognizing that it’s a feeling rather than a fact is the first step in challenging that belief. What would you tell a friend who might feel the same way?

User: I’d probably say that everyone has their own pace and strengths.

Consultant: Exactly! Applying that kind of compassion to yourself can be very beneficial. How about we practice reframing that thought about your intelligence when you're feeling pressured? 

User: That sounds helpful. I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Instead of thinking “I’m not smart enough,” perhaps you can reframe it to “I am doing my best, and that’s what really matters.” How does that statement feel to you?

User: It feels a bit more reassuring. It’s not about being perfect, right?

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about your effort and growth. Let's take a moment to think about your volunteer experience again. How did that make you feel capable and valuable?

User: I felt like I was making a difference, which boosted my confidence. Maybe I can remind myself of that feeling when under pressure.

Consultant: Absolutely! Drawing from positive experiences can reinforce your self-worth. Would you be willing to keep a reflection journal where you write about such experiences and your feelings?

User: Yes, I think that would help me understand my emotions better.

Consultant: Fantastic! Journaling can be a powerful tool for self-discovery. After some time, we can review it together to see how your emotions relate to different situations. 

User: I’m looking forward to it! I'd love to see patterns in my emotions.

Consultant: That’s a great goal. Little by little, as you reflect, you might start noticing connections between your feelings and specific events. Is there anything else that feels important to discuss today?

User: No, I think I covered everything. I feel good about our conversation!

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! To summarize, you’re embracing the positive feelings from volunteering and exploring more about your emotions through journaling. You’re making great strides!

User: Yes, I feel more equipped to handle my emotions now.

Consultant: Excellent! Keep reminding yourself of your strengths and the progress you’re making. Whenever you're ready, I'm here to support you again. You're doing a wonderful job.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome. I believe in your ability to manage your emotions and continue your personal growth. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you today! I'm glad you've decided to explore your feelings further. Let's talk about your emotional journal and what you've noticed recently. How have your emotions been since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I've been trying to stay consistent with my emotional journal. I noticed that I feel more anxious when I have to socialize with my classmates. It seems to trigger a bit of panic in me.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant observation. Social situations seem to bring on feelings of anxiety for you. Can you share a specific instance when you felt this way? What was happening at that moment?

User: Last week, we had a group project, and I ended up working with some classmates I don’t know well. I felt really nervous and couldn't focus on the discussion. My heart was racing, and I just wanted it to end.

Consultant: It seems that working with unfamiliar classmates heightened your anxiety. Your physical reactions, like a racing heart, can be overwhelming. When you remember that situation, what thoughts or beliefs were going through your mind?

User: I kept thinking that they wouldn't like me or that I wouldn’t contribute much to the project. I worried they'd judge me negatively for not speaking up.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem deeply rooted in fear of judgment from others. It's understandable to feel that way in unfamiliar situations. Let's try to challenge that belief a bit. What evidence do you think supports the idea that your classmates would judge you harshly?

User: I guess there isn't much proof. They seem pretty friendly, but I just can't help feeling this way. It's like I automatically believe the worst will happen.

Consultant: That's a common pattern called 'catastrophizing'—assuming the worst-case scenario without sufficient evidence. If a friend were in your situation, what would you tell them about their fears of being judged?

User: I would probably say that they shouldn't worry so much and that everyone has their strengths. The group is there to help each other.

Consultant: Exactly! You have a good insight into how to support a friend. Now, let's try to apply that to your situation. What would happen if you approached your classes with that same understanding—that everyone has strengths and you bring value too?

User: I think I would feel less pressure. I might even try speaking up more, just to see how it goes.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive approach! How about we come up with a few small steps you could take in your next group project to practice speaking up? 

User: Maybe I could prepare some ideas beforehand so I feel more confident when sharing.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Preparation can give you a sense of control. Along with your emotional journal, could you also consider writing down what you want to share ahead of time? 

User: Yes, I could try that. It might help me feel more ready when it comes time to talk.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As you continue to document your feelings, pay attention to your responses in social situations. Recognizing your triggers is a crucial part of understanding your emotional patterns. 

User: I see that now. I do feel that some of my anxiety comes from just not knowing what to expect.

Consultant: That's insightful! Anticipating the unknown can certainly amplify feelings of anxiety. Let’s explore ways you can prepare yourself for these unknowns. Perhaps gathering information about your classmates or the project ahead of time could help?

User: That makes sense! Knowing a bit more could ease my mind.

Consultant: Exactly! And remember, it’s also okay to show vulnerability. Many people feel anxious about group interactions. Perhaps you could start by sharing your feelings with a trusted classmate. 

User: That's a good idea. Maybe I’ll tell someone I’m nervous about sharing, and they might feel the same way.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing can create connections and relieve some pressure. As you work on this, how will you handle moments when you might start to feel overwhelmed?

User: I think I’ll take a deep breath and remind myself that it’s okay to be nervous. Maybe even focus on what I can contribute instead of what others think.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach! Focusing on the positive can shift your mindset. Let’s review your goals for using your emotional journal alongside these strategies. How do you want to track your progress in managing your social anxiety?

User: I will note whenever I try one of these strategies and how I felt afterwards. It might help me see improvements.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Documenting your experiences can bring more clarity. As we wrap up today, what do you feel has been your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I feel more equipped to face social situations now. Understanding my thoughts and feelings helps me manage them better. 

Consultant: I'm really pleased to hear that, and remember that you have the tools to continue growing. What are some concrete steps you will take moving forward to maintain this progress?

User: I’ll keep journaling and practice reaching out to my classmates. I’ll also remember to prepare for discussions.

Consultant: Those are fantastic steps! You’re making significant progress, and I'm excited to see how these strategies will help you. Our next meeting will be a good time to check in on your experiences. 

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to it, and I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It's been a pleasure working with you. I believe you are on a path to understanding your emotions better and improving your relationships. Remember, you can always come back if you need support. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. My recent participation in the extracurricular activities helped me feel more connected with my classmates.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It's wonderful that you're experiencing more positive interactions. Can you share a bit about what you enjoyed most about the extracurricular activities?

User: Well, I really enjoyed working as a team with my classmates. It felt rewarding to collaborate on something together, and it made me feel like I was part of the group.

Consultant: That sense of belonging is very important. How did this experience impact your feelings towards socializing and connecting with others?

User: I think it made me less anxious about social situations. I feel more comfortable talking to my classmates now. Before, I used to worry a lot about how they'd perceive me.

Consultant: It's fantastic that you're feeling more at ease. Have you noticed any specific thoughts or worries that used to come up in those situations that are less frequent now?

User: Yes, I used to think a lot about not being interesting enough or saying something stupid. But now I feel like I can just be myself, and it’s okay.

Consultant: That's a significant shift in your thinking! Recognizing and challenging those negative beliefs can make a real difference. What strategies do you think helped you achieve this positive change?

User: Well, I tried to remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s perfectly normal. Plus, being with friends who are supportive also helped a lot.

Consultant: It sounds like you've developed some healthy coping mechanisms. As we continue today, let's focus on how you can maintain this positive momentum. Are there specific situations coming up where you feel uncertain about socializing?

User: Yes, I'm a bit nervous about the upcoming school event. I want to participate, but I'm afraid of getting overwhelmed again.

Consultant: It's natural to feel a bit anxious before events. Let's explore how you can manage that anxiety and still enjoy the experience. What do you think might help you feel more prepared going into this event?

User: Maybe I could practice some conversation starters in advance or think about what I want to say.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Preparing ahead of time can really boost your confidence. Would you like to role-play a few scenarios together, or discuss specific topics you might want to engage in during the event?

User: That sounds good! I think it might help me feel more relaxed knowing I have some things to talk about.

Consultant: Great! Let’s try a few scenarios then. Imagine you meet someone new at the event. What might you say to break the ice?

User: I could start with something like, "Hi! I’m Xiaozhang. What do you think about the event so far?"

Consultant: That's a perfect opener! It's friendly and invites a response. How would you follow up if they seem interested in what you have to say?

User: I could ask them about their interests or what clubs they're part of at school. I think that could lead to a good conversation.

Consultant: Excellent! You've already laid a great foundation for engaging dialogue. How does practicing these conversation starters make you feel about the event?

User: I feel a bit more optimistic! It feels good to have a plan instead of just worrying.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. Having a plan can really alleviate those feelings of uncertainty. Besides conversation starters, are there any other techniques you think might help you during the event?

User: I think taking a few deep breaths beforehand could help calm me down too.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a wonderful technique for managing anxiety. Maybe you could also set small goals for yourself at the event, like talking to two new people or participating in one activity. How does that sound?

User: That sounds manageable! I think I can do that.

Consultant: Perfect! These small steps can help build your confidence over time. As you prepare for this upcoming event, remember to acknowledge your progress and celebrate your efforts. How do you feel about that?

User: I feel good! It’s nice to focus on what I can do rather than what might go wrong.

Consultant: Absolutely! This positive outlook can significantly enhance your experience. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you want to discuss or any other concerns you have?

User: No, I think we covered everything important. I really appreciate your help in feeling more confident!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've made such great progress, and I'm confident you can handle the event ahead. Just remember to apply the strategies we've discussed. If you need further support, feel free to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I will definitely keep that in mind.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It's been a pleasure working with you, Xiaozhang. Remember to celebrate your achievements, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care!
