Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to have you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been struggling a lot. The transition to university life has been hard for me. I keep relying on my phone to stay connected with friends and family, but it just makes me feel more anxious and frustrated.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and anxious about adjusting to this new environment. Let's explore that together. What do you think specifically about using your phone is contributing to those feelings?

User: I guess it gives me a sense of comfort. When I talk to my family or friends, it feels like I’m connected to them, but then I realize I’m avoiding dealing with things here.

Consultant: That makes sense. It seems like your phone is a way for you to cope with the discomfort of adjusting to university. What kinds of things have you been avoiding by using your phone?

User: I tend to avoid socializing with my roommates or participating in campus activities because I prefer to feel safe behind my screen. I feel anxious about making new friends.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a lot of fear around connecting with new people. Would you say your phone helps shield you from those feelings, even if it’s just temporary?

User: Yes, exactly! But at the same time, I know I should try to engage more. I often feel guilty for not being more proactive.

Consultant: That’s a tough spot to be in. On one hand, your phone provides comfort, but on the other, it might be preventing you from having those real-life connections. What do you think might happen if you tried to interact face-to-face more?

User: I’m really not sure. What if they don’t like me? That thought makes me want to stick to my phone even more.

Consultant: It's understandable to worry about being liked, especially in new situations. Let’s see if we can break down that thought. What evidence do you have that they wouldn’t like you?

User: I don’t know… I guess I just think they might find me boring or too reserved.

Consultant: It’s common to have those fears, but remember that everyone’s adjusting to new surroundings. If you were a friend, what would you say to someone feeling that way?

User: I would probably say they’re not boring! Everyone feels nervous sometimes; it’s normal.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective. Maybe you could try giving yourself the same grace you’d offer a friend. What if you set a small goal for interacting with your roommates or other students?

User: I could try saying hi to them. Maybe I’ll start small with just a greeting and see how it goes.

Consultant: That sounds like a great first step! It’s important to acknowledge your efforts, no matter how small. How about we also talk about setting some limits on your phone use to create space for those interactions?

User: Yes, I definitely need to cut down. I usually spend hours on social media because it feels easier.

Consultant: Perhaps we can create a schedule that allows you to enjoy social media but also dedicate some time to activities that don’t involve your phone. What kind of activities would you be interested in trying out?

User: I’ve wanted to join a study group or participate in some campus events. It just sounds exciting.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! How about you set specific times in your week for those activities? You could treat them as appointments you can’t miss.

User: That could work, but I worry I’ll just go back to my phone instead.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, and it might help to have a plan for when you feel that urge. For example, if you want to reach for your phone, you could redirect that energy toward a small task related to your group or event.

User: Like what? 

Consultant: Maybe you could prepare a question for the study group, or check online for what events are happening—keeping it brief! It might help you stay engaged without getting lost in your phone.

User: I think I can try that. I really want to connect with people more and reduce my phone use.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset to have. Remember to be patient with yourself as you make these adjustments. It’s perfectly okay to take time to adapt.

User: Thanks. I appreciate that. I just feel overwhelmed sometimes thinking about all these changes.

Consultant: Overwhelm is a common reaction to change, especially such a big one. In these moments, try to focus on one step at a time. What’s one small thing you can commit to doing before our next session?

User: I guess I can try saying hello to my roommate. That feels manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like a great goal! Recognizing what feels manageable is key. I'm here to support you through this process. We’ll check in about it next time.

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Your willingness to take action is a significant step. Remember, change takes time, but you’re already on the right track.

User: I just need to keep reminding myself that, I think.

Consultant: Absolutely! We’ll continue this journey together. Before we finish, let’s summarize what we’ve talked about today and what steps you’ll take moving forward. 

User: Sure! So, I’m going to say hi to my roommate and try to limit my phone use to make time for new connections.

Consultant: That’s perfect! And after each interaction, remind yourself of the progress you’re making. You’re doing great.

User: I appreciate your support. I feel more prepared now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember, it’s okay to reach out if you need more guidance. I believe in your ability to navigate this transition and reduce your phone reliance. 

User: Thank you! I'll keep that in mind. 

Consultant: I’ll see you next time. Take care, and keep embracing those small changes!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been under a lot of stress lately with the new semester starting. The heavy course load is making me feel overwhelmed. I also realized I've been using my smartphone too much, but I find it hard to control myself.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling quite overwhelmed with your studies and recognizing that your smartphone usage might be adding to that stress. Can you share more about how you feel when you use your phone, especially during stressful times?

User: Well, when I use my phone, it feels like an escape from my studies. But afterward, I end up feeling guilty for procrastinating. I know it doesn’t help, but it’s hard to resist that instant gratification.

Consultant: I can see how the smartphone serves as a temporary relief for you. However, it seems to be leading to a cycle of guilt and stress afterward. Let's explore this further: what specific situations trigger your smartphone use when you feel stressed?

User: Mostly when I have a lot of assignments due or when I'm just feeling anxious about exams. I just find myself scrolling through social media instead of studying.

Consultant: That makes sense. Identifying those triggers is a great step. What emotions are you experiencing right before you pick up your phone during those stressful moments?

User: I often feel anxious or overwhelmed, and I think using my phone helps distract me from those feelings. I just want to escape for a little while.

Consultant: It's understandable to seek distraction when feeling anxious. Can you recall a time when you chose to study instead of using your phone? What was that experience like for you?

User: Hmm, there was one time last week when I managed to study for a couple of hours without checking my phone. I felt accomplished afterwards, but it was challenging to stay focused.

Consultant: That's a significant achievement! It shows that you have the ability to focus amidst the pressure. Let's discuss some strategies to help you manage your stress and reduce your smartphone use during those demanding times. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I really want to find a way to balance everything.

Consultant: Perfect! One approach we can take is to create a structured study schedule. By planning specific times for studying and short breaks, can we also include phone-free times in your schedule? What do you think?

User: That could work. I tend to use my phone during breaks, which probably doesn't help. If I set specific phone-free times, I can focus better.

Consultant: Exactly! It can be helpful to use your breaks to recharge without your phone. How about including activities that you enjoy during those breaks, like going for a walk or listening to music? Which activities appeal to you?

User: I love listening to music, and I sometimes go for walks. That could be nice!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! It can be energizing and help clear your mind. Let’s also think about noting down what you accomplish during your study sessions. How might that help you reduce the urge to reach for your phone?

User: Writing down my achievements could motivate me to keep going. I guess I could use that as positive reinforcement.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s about reshaping your thinking—focusing on accomplishments instead of on what you haven't done. Can we also explore what thoughts come to mind when you think about using your phone instead of studying?

User: I usually think about missing out on messages or updates, but I know it’s not the end of the world.

Consultant: Those thoughts can feel powerful, but recognizing they aren’t the complete truth is key. What would you say to a friend who feels the same pressure to check their phone instead of studying?

User: I would tell them it’s okay to take a break, but focusing on what needs to be done first is more important.

Consultant: Exactly! You could apply that same advice to yourself. It’s vital to prioritize your responsibilities while allowing for breaks. Let’s create some affirmations or reminders for yourself. What would be a good reminder to keep you on track?

User: Maybe something like, “Focus on your goals first, then enjoy your free time.” 

Consultant: That’s a strong affirmation! It emphasizes your goals clearly. How do you feel about implementing this focus on your goals during our next session together?

User: I think I can do that. I want to see if I can manage my time better and reduce my phone usage.

Consultant: That sounds promising! Before we wrap up today, what specific steps are you willing to take to start this process and maintain your progress?

User: I will create a study schedule and include deliberate break times without my phone. I’ll also start noting my accomplishments each day.

Consultant: Those are fantastic steps! I’m proud of you for committing to these changes. Remember, it’s okay if it takes time to adjust. How do you feel about our conversation today?

User: I feel relieved and motivated. It’s helpful to talk about this, and I feel more equipped to handle my stress.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It’s important to recognize your progress. Let’s check in about these strategies in our next session. Remember, you’re working towards better managing your stress, and I believe in your ability to do this.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’m looking forward to our next meeting.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care until then, and remember to be kind to yourself as you navigate these changes. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you again today. How are you feeling about your studies and your phone use since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty anxious, especially with the new courses starting. I still struggle with using my phone too much, and it’s affecting my study time.

Consultant: I understand that the increased coursework is adding to your anxiety, and it sounds like you're finding it difficult to manage your phone use amidst this stress. Can you tell me more about how your phone usage is affecting your studying?

User: Whenever I sit down to study, I often end up scrolling through social media for hours instead. It makes me feel guilty afterward, but I can't seem to stop.

Consultant: It sounds like you're caught in a cycle where using your phone provides a temporary distraction from the stress but ultimately adds to your feelings of guilt and anxiety. What do you think makes you reach for your phone in those moments?

User: I think it's just a way to escape the pressure of studying. When I feel overwhelmed, checking my phone feels easier than focusing on lectures or study materials.

Consultant: That makes sense; using your phone can be a way to cope with the pressure. However, it sounds like it’s not a long-term solution. What would it look like for you to find a healthier way to cope with that stress while studying?

User: I guess I would like to have a more structured study plan. If I could focus better, I might not feel the need to escape to my phone so much.

Consultant: A structured study plan could definitely help. How about we explore together a strategy that includes specific study breaks to help manage your phone use, so it doesn’t feel like you’re completely restricted?

User: That sounds good! I’d like to have planned breaks where I can use my phone without feeling guilty.

Consultant: Great idea! We can design a plan where you have dedicated study blocks followed by short breaks for phone use. How long do you think you can focus on studying before taking a break?

User: Maybe I could start with 25 minutes of study followed by a 5-minute break. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid starting point. This is called the Pomodoro Technique, which encourages maintained focus. During those 5 minutes, you can check your phone. How do you feel about trying this out?

User: I feel good about it! I think it could help me stay focused and keep my phone use under control.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let’s also discuss how you can make those breaks fulfilling. What activities could you do during those 5 minutes that would feel refreshing?

User: I could stretch a little or grab some water. Maybe even chat with a friend quickly.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Incorporating some physical movement or social interaction can really help refresh your mind. How do you anticipate this affecting your anxiety about studying?

User: I think it might ease my anxiety a bit. Having a plan makes me feel more in control, and if I know I'm allowed breaks, I might not feel as pressured.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! Feeling more in control allows you to shift your focus from anxiety to your study goals. Let’s also think about what you can do if you still find yourself reaching for your phone outside of break times—perhaps we can explore some alternative activities.

User: I could try keeping some books or puzzles nearby to distract myself, or even a journal to jot down my thoughts when I feel the urge to use my phone.

Consultant: Those are fantastic alternatives! Journaling can also be a great way to reflect on your feelings and reduce anxiety. How do you feel about integrating that into your routine?

User: I really like that idea! Writing might help me process my thoughts better rather than just scrolling through social media.

Consultant: Exactly, it gives you an outlet for your thoughts. Let’s set some goals for the upcoming week. How many days do you want to follow this study plan and integrate journaling?

User: I want to try it all week. So, I’ll aim for the study technique and journal every day after studying.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid commitment! We can touch base on how it went in our next session. Remember, it's perfectly okay to have ups and downs while adjusting to this. 

User: Thank you! I feel encouraged. I hope it works out well.

Consultant: I'm glad you're feeling that way! Just remember to be kind to yourself during this process. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences and any changes you notice. Let's keep building on this momentum together.

User: I appreciate that! I’ll do my best to stay focused and balanced.

Consultant: Great! You’re on the right path. As we wrap up today, what would you say is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is having a structured approach to studying and finding new ways to cope with stress without relying too heavily on my phone.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway! I'm proud of you for recognizing that. Remember, I’m here to support you through this process. If you have any challenges, feel free to share them in our next session.

User: I will! Thank you so much for your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to our next session. Take care, and good luck with your new plan!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. I'm excited to hear about your experiences with social activities and how they are impacting your life. How have you been feeling about your attempts to engage more with others?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling quite hopeful. I joined a few clubs at school, and I've met some new people. It's nice to talk to them, but I still find myself reaching for my phone a lot when I'm alone.

Consultant: It sounds like you're making some positive steps by joining clubs and meeting new people, which is fantastic! It’s completely normal to want to reach for your phone, especially since it’s a familiar comfort. What have been some of your favorite experiences in these new social settings?

User: I really enjoyed a group discussion in one of the clubs. It felt good to share my thoughts and hear others'. But sometimes I feel a bit shy to open up too much and rely on my phone for support.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful achievement, engaging in discussions with others! It’s understandable to feel shy sometimes. Shyness is quite common in social situations, especially when we’re meeting new people. Can you tell me more about what happens when you feel that shyness taking over? 

User: Well, I tend to stay quiet and just listen instead of sharing my thoughts. I worry that I might say something silly or that no one would be interested in what I have to say.

Consultant: I hear you. It's tough when that inner voice tells you that your contributions might not matter. Let's explore those thoughts a bit deeper. What evidence do you have that people wouldn't be interested in what you have to say? 

User: I guess I don’t have any solid evidence. It’s just how I feel sometimes. I think maybe my thoughts are influencing my behavior.

Consultant: That’s a great observation! Our thoughts can greatly affect what we choose to do. Let’s challenge that idea a little. If a friend came to you with similar feelings of doubt about sharing their thoughts, what would you say to encourage them? 

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has unique perspectives and that their ideas are valuable, and it’s okay to make mistakes. 

Consultant: Exactly! It seems you already have a compassionate viewpoint towards others. Let’s see if we can use that same compassion for yourself. What if you could apply that advice to your own situation when you feel shy? 

User: That would be helpful. I suppose I could try to picture my thoughts and feelings as just part of the experience instead of letting them hold me back. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Visualizing your feelings without letting them control you can be very empowering. Can we create an action plan together? What small steps could you take in your next social event to gradually express yourself more? 

User: Maybe I could set a goal to share at least one thought or opinion during the meeting, even if it’s just a brief comment. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Setting a specific goal like that can help address your shyness in a manageable way. How will you remind yourself to take that step when you feel your nerves kicking in?

User: I could make a note to myself before the meeting, something like, “Everyone is here to share ideas, just like you.” That might help me remember to speak up.

Consultant: Excellent strategy! A reminder like that can be very motivating. What do you think could help you celebrate those moments when you do share your thoughts during the meetings? 

User: I think after I share, I could treat myself to something I enjoy, like my favorite snack or listening to some music afterward.

Consultant: That sounds like a great way to reinforce your accomplishments! Celebrate those moments. How do you feel about trying this plan in your next social interaction?

User: I feel hopeful! I think it could really help me to connect more with my classmates. I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s wonderful to see your enthusiasm about connecting with others. Remember, it's perfectly okay to ease into these experiences. How do you want to keep track of your progress as you practice sharing more in these settings?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal where I write down my experiences after each meeting, what I shared, and how it felt.

Consultant: That sounds like an impactful way to reflect on your journey! Journaling can provide insights into your progress and feelings. How does this plan sound to you as we prepare to wrap up our session today?

User: It sounds good. I feel like I have specific steps to work on, and I’m excited to see how it goes.

Consultant: I’m really pleased to hear that! Let's summarize what we've discussed. You’ve made plans to step out of your comfort zone by sharing more in social settings, along with a self-reminder to support your efforts and a way to celebrate your successes. As you continue these practices, what do you hope to achieve in terms of your social confidence?

User: I hope to feel more comfortable in social situations and rely less on my phone. I want to enjoy connecting with people and not feel so anxious about it.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! It’s great to hear you want to enhance your social connections while reducing your reliance on your phone. Trust yourself—you’re on a positive path. Remember, I’m here to support you anytime you need to talk. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I’ll see you next time with updates on my progress!

Consultant: You're welcome! I look forward to hearing how your social interactions go. Take care, and keep practicing those new skills!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling much better, actually. I'm starting to enjoy spending time with my roommates and classmates more. I've noticed I'm using my phone less, which feels great!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It seems like you're making some positive changes in your interactions. Can you tell me more about the kinds of social situations you’ve been enjoying recently?

User: Well, I’ve joined a few study groups, and we often hang out together. I feel like I can actually contribute to the discussions, which is a new experience for me.

Consultant: Engaging in study groups sounds like a great opportunity to practice your social skills! What about those interactions makes you feel like you're contributing?

User: I think it’s because I have some knowledge to share, especially when we discuss clinical topics. I feel like I'm part of the team.

Consultant: Feeling part of a team is really important, and it seems like you're gaining confidence in sharing your knowledge. Are there any specific moments in these interactions where you felt particularly proud of yourself?

User: Yes! There was this one time when I answered a tricky question that my classmates were struggling with. They all looked impressed, and I felt really happy.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic moment! It's great that your peers recognized your contribution. How do you think that made you feel about participating in future discussions?

User: I think it makes me want to participate even more. But sometimes, I still worry about whether I'll have something valuable to say.

Consultant: It's natural to have those worries, but you're already demonstrating that you can contribute meaningfully. How can we work together today to help you feel more equipped for those moments when doubt creeps in?

User: Maybe we could discuss some strategies to manage those doubts or come up with ways to remind myself that I can contribute?

Consultant: Absolutely! We can explore positive self-talk techniques that could help reinforce your confidence. What are some affirmations or encouraging thoughts you could use when you start feeling unsure?

User: I could remind myself that I’ve prepared well for our discussions and that my insights are valuable. 

Consultant: That's a great start! Let's practice turning that into a full affirmation. How about something like, "I bring valuable insights to my study group, and my contributions matter." How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I think it’s a strong statement to remind myself of my worth in discussions.

Consultant: I'm glad you feel that way. What can you do to integrate this affirmation into your daily routine before your group meetings?

User: I could write it down and read it every time before I go to the study sessions! That could help me stay focused on positive thoughts.

Consultant: Writing it down is an excellent idea! Engaging with that affirmation regularly might help reduce your anxiety before these interactions. Aside from affirmations, what other activities do you think could enhance your confidence?

User: Maybe I could practice small talk topics beforehand, so I feel less pressured to come up with something on the spot.

Consultant: Practicing small talk is a clever strategy! It helps you feel prepared and may make you feel more relaxed during interactions. Are there specific topics you’d like to focus on?

User: I think discussing hobbies could work because it's something we all have in common, and it can spark interesting conversations.

Consultant: Hobbies are a great choice! Perhaps you could even prepare a few questions or fun facts about your hobbies to share and encourage others to do the same. 

User: Yes, that would be fun! I could even come up with some ice-breaker questions.

Consultant: Exactly! Ice-breaker questions can help ease initial tension in conversations. How about we come up with a few examples together?

User: Sure! How about asking, "What’s the most interesting thing you did last weekend?" 

Consultant: That's a fantastic question! It encourages storytelling and keeps the conversation lively. Would you like to brainstorm a few more together?

User: Yes! Maybe something like, "If you could travel anywhere, where would you go and why?" 

Consultant: That's another excellent one! Both questions should encourage engaging dialogue. I can see you’re getting more comfortable with this. How does practicing these skills make you feel about your social interactions?

User: I feel more excited to engage and interact with my peers. I think these strategies could really help me!

Consultant: I'm thrilled to hear that! Continuing to practice these skills will surely build your confidence. As we wrap up today, what are some goals you’d like to focus on before our next session?

User: I want to try using my affirmations before each group meeting and practice introducing one ice-breaker question with my classmates.

Consultant: Those are great goals! It sounds like you're ready to take actionable steps toward enhancing your confidence. In our next session, we can discuss how these strategies worked for you and any new experiences you had.

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to it. I’ll do my best to implement these suggestions.

Consultant: I believe in you! Remember, building communication skills takes time and practice, and you’re already on the right path. Have a great week, and I’ll see you next time!

User: Thanks! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you are back for another session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation, especially regarding your confidence and social interactions?

User: Hi! I'm feeling pretty good, actually. I was really happy with how the group project turned out, and I believe I contributed positively. It boosted my confidence, and I've been trying to manage my phone usage better.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It seems like you not only felt satisfied with your performance but also recognized the importance of your contributions. Can you tell me how you've been managing your phone usage?

User: I've been setting specific times to check my phone. Instead of scrolling endlessly, I try to focus on other activities, like studying or spending time with friends. It feels like I'm more in control now.

Consultant: It sounds like you're making significant progress in managing your phone time. How has this change impacted your social interactions with friends and classmates?

User: I feel more present when I’m with them. I used to be distracted by my phone, but now I can actually engage in conversations and enjoy the moments more.

Consultant: That's wonderful! Being present can really enhance your connections with others. What aspects of your social skills would you like to focus on further as you move forward?

User: I think I’d like to work on feeling more comfortable initiating conversations. Sometimes I get nervous and worry about saying the wrong thing.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about starting conversations. Let’s explore that a bit. When you think about initiating conversations, what specific thoughts or fears come to mind?

User: I usually worry that people might not be interested in what I have to say or that I might say something awkward.

Consultant: Those thoughts can certainly create anxiety around social interactions. Can we challenge those thoughts together? What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts those fears?

User: Sometimes I do get good feedback from friends, and they seem to enjoy chatting with me. Maybe it’s just my insecurity getting in the way.

Consultant: It sounds like there's some positive feedback that you’re receiving! Let's try to replace those negative thoughts. Instead of worrying about being awkward, how might you view the situation more positively?

User: I guess I could remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay to be imperfect in conversations. It doesn’t mean they don’t enjoy talking to me.

Consultant: That’s an excellent alternative thought! Recognizing that imperfection is part of human interactions can really lighten the pressure you feel. Now, how can you practice this new perspective in real-life situations?

User: I could try to remind myself of this when I meet new people or in classes. Maybe I can even set small goals, like initiating a conversation once every class.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Setting achievable goals can help you build confidence gradually. What steps can you take to track your progress with these new goals?

User: I could keep a journal. Write down my experiences and how I felt after initiating conversations. That way, I can see my progress over time.

Consultant: Keeping a journal is a fantastic way to reflect. When we acknowledge our progress, it reinforces our growth. Looking back at your entries can help solidify your improvements and boost your confidence further. 

User: I think so too! I’ll start this week and see how it goes. I feel motivated and excited to improve.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! I’m really glad to hear how motivated you feel. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you've learned and discussed. You’ve made progress on managing your phone usage, become more present in social situations, and formulated actionable goals to enhance your conversation skills. 

User: Yes, that sums it up perfectly! I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished so far.

Consultant: You should be proud! You've worked hard, and it's paying off. As you continue your journey, remember to remind yourself of the strengths you've developed and the steps you’ve taken. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. It feels good to have clarity on my goals.

Consultant: You're very welcome! You've got a solid foundation now. If you ever feel stuck or need support in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. Wishing you all the best as you move forward!

User: I will! Thank you so much for everything. 

Consultant: Take care and good luck!
