Consultant: Hello, Koko! I'm glad to see you today. I know we've talked about some challenging situations with your mother and your studies before. How are you feeling about it all now?

User: Hi. Honestly, I still feel a lot of pressure. I worry that I'm not living up to my mom's expectations. It makes me feel really anxious, and I find myself lying about my grades and study habits to avoid her disappointment.

Consultant: It sounds tough to feel that kind of pressure from your mom. You want to avoid her disappointment but also face the stress of not being truthful about your performance. Can you tell me more about how her expectations affect you?

User: Well, whenever I don't do well, it feels like she's judging me. She often says she believes in me but then points out my mistakes. It's confusing, and I just want her to be proud of me. 

Consultant: That sounds very difficult. You want to make her proud, but her way of expressing her beliefs seems to add more pressure instead of support. How does this pressure influence your feelings about your own capabilities?

User: I guess it makes me feel worthless sometimes. I often think that if I can't meet her expectations, maybe I'm just not good enough. That thought keeps me anxious and afraid to share my real grades with her.

Consultant: I see. It seems like there's a core belief that if you don’t meet her expectations, it somehow reflects negatively on your worth. Let’s take a closer look at these thoughts. When you have those feelings of worthlessness, what kind of thoughts run through your mind?

User: I think things like "I must be failing" or "I'm not smart enough.” It’s like I'm constantly punishing myself for not being perfect.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really harsh. If a good friend were in your position, what do you think you would tell them?

User: I would probably say that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay not to be perfect. But I can’t seem to apply that to myself.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It’s easier to show kindness to others than to ourselves. Let’s try to challenge those harsh thoughts. What evidence is there that you are not good enough? Can you think of moments when you succeeded or felt capable?

User: Well, I did do well in my music class, and I love reading. I have moments when I feel proud, but they feel overshadowed by my academic struggles.

Consultant: Those successes are important and show that you do have strengths! Acknowledging these accomplishments can help build a more balanced view of yourself. Can we work on reminding you of these strengths whenever those negative thoughts arise?

User: That sounds helpful. I want to remember my strengths, but it’s hard when I’m in a bad mood or stressed.

Consultant: It is challenging, especially in stressful moments. What if we create a list of your strengths and accomplishments that you can refer to whenever you start feeling down? 

User: I like that idea! I think it might help to see it written down.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s also explore how to approach your mom about your grades without fear. How do you think she would react if you were honest with her about your struggles?

User: I’m scared she would be disappointed or upset. But I also think maybe she would understand if I explained how I felt.

Consultant: That’s a brave thought, and it's great to consider. We can role-play that conversation if you like, to help you feel more prepared and confident about being honest with her. 

User: Yeah, I’d like to try that. It might help me feel less anxious about it.

Consultant: Excellent decision! Let’s practice. Imagine I’m your mom, and you’re telling me about your challenges and feelings. Start whenever you’re ready.

User: Okay… “Mom, I didn’t do well on my last test, and I’m really sorry. I felt a lot of pressure, and that’s why I was scared to tell you.”

Consultant: That’s a good start! How do you think your mom might respond to that?

User: I hope she could understand, but I’m really worried she won’t take it well.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel anxious about her response. What if you remind yourself that sharing the truth also opens the door to support? Being honest can help her understand you better. 

User: I guess that’s true. It’s just really hard to face her sometimes.

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s a big step. Remember, you won’t be alone in this. You can use other support systems, like friends or trusted teachers, to help ease some of that burden. Have you thought about asking your friends for support?

User: I haven’t really. I usually feel like I should handle everything myself.

Consultant: It’s okay to lean on others! Building connections with friends can provide emotional support and lessen the pressure. Would you be open to talking to your classmates about how you feel?

User: Maybe… I’ve never really talked about my worries with them before.

Consultant: That’s a good first step! You might find that many of them share similar feelings. How about we set small goals to start building those connections, such as initiating a casual chat about school?

User: That sounds doable. I can at least try to say hi more often.

Consultant: Great! Let’s summarize what we’ve worked on today. You’re learning to recognize your strengths, communicate openly with your mom, and connect with friends. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It’s nice to think I can actually improve things.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember that growth takes time, and it’s perfectly fine to make small steps. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Koko. You’ve made some important strides today, and I'm proud of you for tackling these challenges. Take care until we meet next time!

Consultant: Hello, Coco! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! Well, to be honest, I still feel pretty down about that mistake I made in class. I keep thinking everyone is judging me for it, including my mom. 

Consultant: I can see how that would be really tough for you. It sounds like that experience has been weighing heavily on your mind. Can you share what specific thoughts you've been having about that incident?

User: I just keep replaying it in my head and thinking that I shouldn’t have made that mistake. Sometimes, I feel like I need to pretend I did better than I actually did, especially with my mom.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, feeling like you have to put on a facade. It’s understandable to want to avoid disappointing others. What emotions come up for you when these thoughts arise?

User: I feel embarrassed and ashamed. It feels like everyone is watching me fail, and I don’t want to let my mom down. It makes me just want to hide away.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel embarrassed in that situation, especially with such high expectations. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit deeper. When you think about needing to "pretend," what does that say about how you view your academic abilities?

User: I guess I think I’m not good enough. I mean, if I were really good, I wouldn’t have made such an obvious mistake.

Consultant: That’s a really insightful reflection, Coco. It seems like you’re connecting your worth to your performance, which can create a lot of pressure. Can we look at that thought together? Is it true that one mistake defines your entire ability?

User: I know it's not, but it feels that way. It’s like my mom expects perfection, and I can’t help but feel let down when I don’t meet that.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of weight from both your own expectations and your mom's. Let’s try to separate your performance from your self-worth. If a friend made a similar mistake, how would you encourage them to view it?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to make mistakes and that it doesn’t mean they’re a failure or anything. 

Consultant: Exactly! So, if you would offer that kind of kindness to a friend, why not extend it to yourself? How might it change the way you see mistakes moving forward?

User: I suppose I could try to remind myself that it’s just a part of learning and that it doesn’t define who I am.

Consultant: That’s a great step forward! Let’s work on practicing that. Next time you catch yourself in a negative thought about a mistake, can you replace it with something kinder? 

User: Yes, I think I can. It’s just hard to remember in the moment.

Consultant: Totally understandable! How about we create a little phrase or mantra to remind you? Something like, “Mistakes are a part of learning, and I can grow from them.” How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I’ll try to remember that. 

Consultant: Awesome, Coco! Now, let’s shift gears a bit. How have your interactions with your classmates been? Have you had a chance to talk to anyone since our last meeting?

User: I haven't really talked to anyone much. I feel too shy or scared to reach out after what happened.

Consultant: That makes sense, feeling shy after that experience. However, it could be helpful to connect with them. Would you be open to a small goal, like saying “hi” to one classmate this week?

User: I could try. It’s just a little scary thinking about it.

Consultant: It’s definitely normal to feel nervous! Maybe we could role play what that interaction might look like, so you feel a bit more comfortable.

User: That might help! 

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you spot them in class. What might you say to start the conversation?

User: I could say “Hey” and maybe ask about their homework or something.

Consultant: Perfect! Asking about homework can be a great icebreaker. How about practicing that exchange a couple of times? 

User: Okay, let's do it. 

Consultant: Alright! I’ll be your classmate. “Hey, Coco! How have you been?”

User: “Hi! I’ve been okay. Just trying to get through the homework. How about you?”

Consultant: “Same here! It’s been a lot to handle.” How did that feel? 

User: It felt alright, I think I could manage a small chat like that.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Just remember, it’s completely normal to feel a bit anxious, but you’re making progress. How are you feeling about connecting with your classmates now?

User: I feel a little more motivated to try that. I just hope it goes well.

Consultant: It’s natural to have that hope, and remember that you can’t control everything. Just take it one step at a time. What about your mom’s expectations? How do you feel about discussing your feelings with her?

User: I think I’ve been avoiding that because I'm scared she’ll just get upset with me.

Consultant: It’s understandable to be apprehensive. How about starting with a small conversation about how you feel when she makes comments about your grades? You can express your desire to talk openly.

User: I could do that. I hope it helps her understand me better.

Consultant: That’s a great intention! Open communication can help. As we wrap up today, I want to acknowledge how far you’ve come in addressing these feelings. You’re learning to navigate these tough emotions and thoughts.

User: Thank you. I see a little bit of progress. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember, it’s all about the small steps. As we continue working together, we can build on this momentum. For next time, think about your interactions with classmates and what you might want to share with your mother.

User: I will, thanks!

Consultant: You’re welcome, Coco! It’s been great talking today. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care!

User: Bye!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Keke! I'm glad to see you today. It sounds like you've been navigating some new social experiences lately. How have you been feeling about your interactions with your classmates?

User: Hi! I actually feel pretty good about it. I've tried sharing my interests with some classmates, and a few of them were really receptive. It makes me excited about the possibility of friendship, but I still have some worries.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear that you've had positive responses! It's natural to feel a mix of excitement and concern. Can you tell me more about what worries you when it comes to building those friendships?

User: I worry that I might come off as too eager or that they won't really want to hang out with me. I don’t want to be rejected, especially after putting myself out there.

Consultant: Those feelings of worry about rejection are quite common, especially in new social situations. It shows that you care about your relationships. What do you think might happen if you do face some rejection? 

User: I guess I would feel sad and maybe think that I’m not good enough. My mom often pushes me to be perfect, and I sometimes carry that pressure into my friendships.

Consultant: I can understand how that pressure from your mom might affect how you view yourself in social situations. It’s important to remember that friendships can be messy, and imperfections are normal. How do you think you might handle a situation where someone isn't interested in becoming friends?

User: I suppose I could remind myself that it doesn’t define my worth. But it's hard to think that way in the moment.

Consultant: Recognizing that your worth isn't tied to others' opinions is a powerful insight. Maybe we can work on some strategies together to help you shift your thinking when those worries arise. Would you be open to trying some role-playing exercises to practice those responses?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful! I want to feel more confident talking to others.

Consultant: Great! Let's imagine that you approach a classmate to share your interests. What might you say to start that conversation?

User: I could say something like, "Hey, I just read this amazing book. Have you read it?" 

Consultant: That’s a nice opening! It shares something about yourself while inviting them to join the conversation. If the classmate seems interested, how would you feel?

User: I think I would feel excited if they were interested. I really love discussing what I read!

Consultant: That excitement is a wonderful energy! Now, what if the classmate didn’t respond positively? How might you respond to maintain your confidence?

User: Maybe I could say, "That's okay! Maybe you have something interesting to share instead." 

Consultant: Excellent! That shows flexibility and encourages openness. How would it feel for you to use that response in real life?

User: It would make me feel less anxious, knowing that I can divert the conversation and stay positive.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset to adopt! Keeping a positive outlook not only helps reduce anxiety but also keeps the flow of conversation going. How do you feel about practicing more of these interactions?

User: I’m feeling more motivated! I think practicing might make it easier for me.

Consultant: Absolutely! The more you practice, the more natural it will feel. For our next session, would you like to share your experiences with these conversations? 

User: Yes! I would love that. It would be great to discuss how it went.

Consultant: I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences. Remember, every interaction is a learning opportunity, regardless of the outcome. How do you feel about your journey towards building friendships now?

User: I feel more hopeful and excited! I've realized that it’s okay to take risks and that I can always learn from each experience.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful realization, Keke! You're gradually shifting your perspective, and I’m here to support you. Would you like to set a small goal for the upcoming week regarding your social interactions?

User: I want to try talking to at least two different classmates about something I enjoy, like music. 

Consultant: That’s a great goal! Engaging with your classmates about shared interests can create connections. What will you do if you feel anxious before these interactions?

User: I’ll remind myself to breathe deeply and remember that it’s about sharing, not about being perfect. 

Consultant: Perfect strategy! Breathing can help calm your nerves, and focusing on sharing rather than performance can take the pressure off. I’m really proud of the progress you're making!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I feel like I can handle this better now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! You're doing wonderfully. Remember, you can always come back and talk with me. I'm here to help you grow more confident in your social skills. 

User: I will! I’m looking forward to our next session and sharing my experiences. 

Consultant: Me too, Keke! I believe in you and all the progress you're making. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Koko! I'm really happy to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a lot more positive since my mom recognized my participation in school activities. It makes me believe that my hard work is finally being noticed!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like your mom’s recognition has had a significant impact on your mood and motivation. Can you tell me more about how her acknowledgment has influenced your thoughts and feelings?

User: Well, I feel like I can actually achieve something, and it gives me confidence. I still want to prove to her that I'm capable, not just for grades, but also in other areas like socializing and participating in activities.

Consultant: It's great that you’re feeling more confident! Building on that recognition from your mom, what specific goals do you think you could set to further improve your relationship with her and enhance your engagement in activities or studying?

User: Maybe I can create a study schedule and share it with her. Also, I was thinking of joining a music club at school to balance my studies and social life.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent ideas, Koko! Sharing your study schedule with your mom could help her understand your progress and priorities better. How about we set up some smaller, manageable tasks for you to achieve these goals?

User: Yes, that would help! I could start by drafting the schedule and planning when to talk to her about it.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s focus on that. What would you want to include in your study schedule, and when do you think would be a good time to discuss it with your mom?

User: I think including time for reading, music practice, and a few shorter study sessions would be good. Maybe I could talk to her about it this weekend?

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Creating a balance between your studies and interests is really important. What feelings come up when you think about presenting this schedule to your mom?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. I hope she sees that I'm trying hard.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous, especially when sharing your goals. But remember, this is a positive step towards better communication and understanding with her. If you focus on how you’ve structured your schedule to include things you enjoy, it could create a supportive conversation. How do you think you would feel after you discuss it with her?

User: I think I’d feel more relieved and maybe even more supported if she reacts positively. 

Consultant: That’s a great outlook! Let’s visualize that positive reaction. How do you think discussing your goals and schedule might change your interactions with her in the future?

User: I hope it could make her see that I'm not just about grades, but trying to be a well-rounded person. Maybe she would appreciate my efforts more.

Consultant: Absolutely! Showing her your commitment to both academics and personal interests can definitely enhance her appreciation. Let’s focus on what steps you can take to prepare for that conversation. What could help you feel more confident when discussing your plans with her?

User: I could practice what I want to say and maybe write down some points I want to make, so I don’t forget anything.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant strategy! Writing down your thoughts can help clarify your message. How about also envisioning how you feel when she acknowledges your efforts during the discussion?

User: I think that would help me feel more confident. It’s like having a positive outcome in mind that I can aim for.

Consultant: Exactly! Positive visualization can really boost your confidence. As you prepare, let’s also think about how you can track your progress and how you might share updates with your mom. 

User: I could keep a journal to note what I accomplish each week and share it with her. 

Consultant: A journal is an excellent idea! It allows you to reflect on your progress and achievements regularly. How do you hope this journal will help your relationship with your mom?

User: I think it will give her insight into what I'm doing, and maybe we can celebrate my small wins together.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach! Celebrating small wins can strengthen your bond and make your mom feel more involved. As we wrap up today’s session, what key steps do you plan to take before we meet again?

User: I’ll draft the study schedule, practice talking to my mom, and start the journal.

Consultant: That sounds like an actionable plan, Koko! I believe that by taking these steps, you’ll not only improve your relationship with your mom but also increase your self-confidence. Remember that I’m here to support you every step of the way. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’m feeling more confident and excited to take these steps.

Consultant: Hello, Coco! I'm glad to see you again. It sounds like you've been enjoying your new social relationships and academic progress. How are you feeling about everything lately?

User: Hi! I'm feeling really good, actually. It seems like I'm finally fitting in more with my classmates. I enjoy participating in activities, and I'm also doing better in my studies. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're experiencing positive changes both socially and academically. Can you tell me a bit more about what specific activities or interactions have made you feel more confident?

User: Well, I recently took part in a group project, and I felt like my ideas were valued. I even made a couple of new friends during that time, which was really nice.

Consultant: It's great that you felt respected and appreciated in the group project! Making friends can be such a rewarding experience. How did it feel to share your ideas and to connect with others in that situation?

User: It felt amazing! I was nervous at first, but when I spoke up and saw my classmates responding positively, it boosted my confidence a lot. 

Consultant: That’s an important realization! It sounds like speaking up helped reinforce your self-esteem. What do you think you can do to maintain and build on that confidence in future group settings or class activities?

User: I need to remember that my contributions are valuable. I think I can practice speaking up more, maybe even prepare a few points in advance to share during discussions.

Consultant: Preparing points in advance is a solid strategy! It can help make you feel more ready and less anxious. What about your studies? How do you feel about your academic progress and any challenges you might face?

User: I’ve been managing my study time better. Although I still worry about disappointing my mom if my grades aren’t perfect. 

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially with high expectations from loved ones. Can you identify how those worries impact your studying and emotional state?

User: They make me anxious, which sometimes leads to procrastination. I worry that if I don't do well, I’ll let her down, which just makes me more stressed.

Consultant: Acknowledging that connection between your worries and procrastination is a crucial step. What if we explore some techniques to manage those feelings of anxiety while studying?

User: I would like that. I definitely want to overcome the stress.

Consultant: Fantastic! One approach we could consider is setting smaller, achievable study goals. This way, instead of feeling overwhelmed by the overall pressure, you can focus on incremental progress. What do you think about that idea?

User: That sounds feasible! It might help me feel less anxious and more accomplished as I check off those smaller goals.

Consultant: I'm glad you see the potential in that! We can also incorporate some positive affirmations to support your self-confidence. How do you currently talk to yourself when things feel challenging?

User: Honestly, I sometimes catch myself being quite harsh. I say things like, “You should be doing better,” or “What if you fail?”

Consultant: Those self-critical thoughts can be quite discouraging. Let's work on creating some positive affirmations to counter those negative beliefs. What are some phrases that resonate with you when you think about your strengths and achievements?

User: Maybe something like, “I’m doing my best, and that’s enough," or "I have valuable ideas and contributions.”

Consultant: Those are excellent affirmations! They promote self-acceptance and remind you of your worth. How do you feel about using those like daily reminders to build a more positive mindset?

User: I think that would really help! It sounds like a good way to keep my confidence up.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing those affirmations can significantly shift your mindset over time. As we prepare to wrap up, let’s reflect on the progress you've made. What key takeaways do you feel you’ve achieved in our sessions so far?

User: I’ve realized how much my confidence has grown and how important it is to believe in myself. Plus, I have some tools to manage stress better now.

Consultant: Those are fantastic insights, Coco! Remember, your self-image and coping strategies are integral to your ongoing journey. What are some ways you can ensure you continue using these tools and affirmations moving forward?

User: I could set reminders on my phone to practice affirmations daily and keep a journal to track my progress. Also, I could talk to my friends about our studies to keep the support going.

Consultant: Those sound like effective strategies! By implementing these practices, you’re not only reinforcing your confidence but also building a supportive environment around you. As we conclude our sessions today, I want to recognize how far you've come. Always remember, you're capable of handling challenges and you’ve developed valuable skills.

User: Thank you! I’ve really appreciated these sessions. They helped me a lot!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Coco! It’s been a pleasure to witness your growth. If you ever need support in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care and keep believing in yourself!
###################
Consultant: Hello Koko! It's great to see you for our session today. I'm looking forward to hearing how you've been doing lately. How are you feeling about your recent experiences with learning and social activities?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty good, actually. Trying out new activities has been exciting! I’m still getting used to the changes, but I like that I'm putting myself out there more.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Stepping out of your comfort zone can be really empowering. Can you share more about the specific activities you've participated in and how they made you feel?

User: Sure! I recently joined a club at school, and we’ve been working on a group project. It was nerve-wracking at first, but I ended up enjoying collaborating with others. I felt a sense of accomplishment when we completed our first milestone together.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant achievement, Koko! Collaborating with others can often enhance our skills and self-esteem. How did that experience impact your view of yourself in academic settings?

User: I think it made me realize that I can handle working with a team. Before, I would often doubt my contributions, but now I feel more confident about sharing my ideas.

Consultant: It's fantastic to hear that you're noticing growth in your confidence! Building on your contributions in a group can reinforce your sense of self-worth. Have you been able to translate this newfound confidence into your studies as well?

User: Yes! I’ve been studying more effectively, and I feel less anxious about my grades. I still have moments where I worry, but they’re not as overwhelming as before.

Consultant: That’s a positive change! It's encouraging that you feel less overwhelmed by anxiety in your studies. What strategies have you found helpful in managing those anxious moments?

User: I try to take deeper breaths and remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes while learning. I also set smaller goals for myself, which helps a lot.

Consultant: Deep breathing and setting achievable goals are great strategies! It’s impressive how you’ve adopted them. How about your social interactions? Have you noticed any changes there as well?

User: Yes! I’ve been chatting more with my classmates. Sometimes it feels awkward, but it’s also nice to connect and feel part of the group. I’m seeing that it’s okay to be myself.

Consultant: Connecting with your classmates is an important step towards strengthening those social skills. It’s normal to feel a bit awkward at times, but being authentic can greatly enhance your relationships. How do you think you can continue nurturing these connections in the future?

User: I could invite some classmates to study together or hang out more often. I’m thinking about planning a little get-together soon.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Inviting classmates to study or socialize can help solidify those bonds. As you move forward, what other activities or approaches do you think could help support your ongoing growth both academically and socially?

User: I guess I could also participate in more clubs or events. I really enjoy being involved, and it helps me feel linked to others.

Consultant: Taking part in clubs and events can definitely reinforce that sense of belonging. As you continue to engage, remember to celebrate your progress and the connections you're building. What would you say has been your biggest achievement this past month?

User: I think it’s being able to work in a team without feeling scared. That’s a big step for me since I used to avoid group work.

Consultant: That’s an incredible achievement, Koko! Recognizing your growth in teamwork is an important milestone. Can you think of any challenges that may come up as you strive for further improvement? How do you plan to tackle them?

User: I guess I might face some anxiety if things don’t go as planned in the future, like if I encounter difficult classmates. I just have to remember not to take things personally.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! Acknowledging that challenges may arise, while also reminding yourself not to take things personally, can help you navigate those situations better. Moving forward, how can you prepare yourself to handle any potential difficulties you anticipate?

User: I can practice my communication skills and maybe role-play scenarios with friends or family. That way, I’ll be more confident when I face similar situations in real life.

Consultant: Practicing communication through role-play is an effective way to build confidence! It allows you to rehearse responses and become more comfortable in varying social situations. As we conclude our session, what do you feel you want to focus on next in your journey of self-improvement?

User: I want to keep working on being social and feeling confident in my classes. I also want to make sure I maintain my balance between work and relaxation.

Consultant: Those are excellent focuses! Balancing social connections, academic efforts, and personal downtime is key to overall well-being. Let’s make sure you have strategies to maintain that balance moving forward. We can discuss additional resources or community activities that may support your interests.

User: That would be great! I appreciate it.

Consultant: Of course, Koko! I’m glad to have been part of your journey today. You’ve made significant strides, and I encourage you to keep moving forward. If you ever feel the need for extra support or want to share your progress, don't hesitate to reach out. You've got this!

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about everything now.

Consultant: I'm so pleased to hear that, Koko. Remember, you're on a path of growth and you can always return to share your experiences. Take care, and I look forward to hearing from you next time!
