Consultant: Hello, Xu Feng! I'm glad you're here for our session today. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling pretty low, honestly. After that fight with my classmate, I’ve been really regretting my actions. It just makes me feel so alone, and I can't seem to sleep well. Sometimes, I even think about leaving school altogether.

Consultant: I can hear that you're feeling quite burdened by what happened. Regret can be a heavy weight to carry. Let's talk more about your feelings and how they're impacting you. What specifically about the fight do you regret the most?

User: I regret that I let myself get so angry. It just happened in the heat of the moment, and now I feel like I don't fit in at school. I feel so isolated.

Consultant: Feeling angry and then isolated can be really tough to handle. It sounds like you're struggling to find your place in this new environment. How do you feel when you think about interacting with your classmates now?

User: I feel nervous. I want to talk to them, but I worry that they might judge me or think I'm not good enough because of what happened.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel nervous about that. It can be hard to put yourself out there, especially after an incident like the one you described. What thoughts go through your mind when you think about trying to connect with them again?

User: I keep thinking that they'll remember what I did and won't want to be friends with me. It makes me just want to avoid them completely.

Consultant: That sounds really painful, Xu Feng. Avoiding them might seem like a way to protect yourself, but it can also prevent you from building connections. What do you think would happen if you did try to talk to one of your classmates?

User: I don’t know. Maybe they would surprise me and not bring it up. But I'm also scared they might bring it up and make it awkward.

Consultant: It’s a possibility, yes. But it’s also possible they might just be ready to move on. Let’s explore this a bit. How likely do you think those classmates are to actually bring up the fight in a conversation, based on what you know about them?

User: I think most of them would want to forget it, but I can’t stop thinking about it. I keep worrying about it.

Consultant: Worrying about what others think is a common concern, but it can sometimes distort how we perceive their actions. What evidence do you have that they actually think negatively about you?

User: I don't have any concrete evidence, I just feel like they might think I’m a troublemaker now.

Consultant: That feeling makes sense given the situation. However, instead of focusing solely on that thought, let’s consider other possibilities. If a friend faced a similar situation, what advice would you give them about moving forward?

User: I would tell them to try to focus on making friends and not dwell on what happened.

Consultant: That’s great advice! You seem to understand how important it is to focus on the positive aspects of building friendships rather than dwelling on the past. How can you apply that same advice to your situation now?

User: Maybe I could try to talk to someone during lunch or something. Just a simple conversation.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Starting with simple conversations can help ease your anxiety. What topics do you think you could bring up to spark a conversation?

User: I could ask them about schoolwork or something we have in common. Maybe talk about what’s happening in class.

Consultant: Those are excellent starting points! Sometimes common interests can lead to deeper connections. Remember, everyone makes mistakes, and it’s part of being human. What could help you feel more confident when initiating this conversation?

User: I guess I could remind myself that I’m not alone in feeling awkward about things. Everyone has their own struggles too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remembering that everyone has their own challenges can really help soften those feelings of anxiety. Is there anything else you think might be helpful for you as you work on this?

User: Maybe I could practice what to say in front of the mirror or with my mom. That might help clarify my thoughts.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Practicing can really build your confidence. As you start implementing these strategies, how do you want to track your progress in feeling more comfortable connecting with your classmates?

User: I could keep a journal of my feelings and interactions to see how I’m improving over time. 

Consultant: Keeping a journal is a great way to reflect on your thoughts and feelings while also observing your progress. It can help you identify patterns and celebrate your successes. Let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today. What key points stand out to you?

User: I need to focus on simple conversations with classmates, remind myself that everyone makes mistakes, and practice what to say. Keeping a journal will help me track my progress.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Xu Feng. You’ve taken some great steps today toward feeling better and building connections. I believe you have the strength to make these changes. Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous as you move forward. If things get tough, you can always come back and share your experiences. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful about trying to connect with my classmates now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, every small step counts. Until our next session, take care of yourself, and I'm here to support you whenever you need. 

User: Thank you! I will do my best.

Consultant: Hello Xu Feng! I'm glad to see you today. Let's talk about how you've been feeling recently. I understand you're trying to connect better with your classmates. How's that been going for you?

User: Hi. Honestly, it’s been tough. I feel really anxious when talking to them. Sometimes, I try to join conversations, but I just freeze up or say the wrong thing. It makes me feel even more isolated.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, Xu Feng. It's understandable to feel anxious in social situations, especially when you're trying to fit in. Can you tell me more about what goes through your mind in those moments when you feel anxious?

User: Well, I keep thinking that they might judge me or think I'm weird. I worry about saying something embarrassing, so I often just stay quiet and hope it will be over quickly.

Consultant: It makes sense that you'd feel that way. It sounds like those thoughts are quite overwhelming. When you think about being judged or saying something embarrassing, how does that make you feel inside?

User: I feel nervous and sometimes even a bit hopeless. I just want to be accepted, but I can’t shake off the fear of rejection.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. Feeling nervous and hopeless can be really tough to deal with. I'm curious, do you think those thoughts about being judged are based on any experiences you've had, or are they more like assumptions about what others might think?

User: I think it’s more assumptions. I haven’t had any major negative experiences with them, but I just imagine they won't like me if I mess up.

Consultant: That's an important insight, Xu Feng. It sounds like you're recognizing that some of your worries might not be as grounded in reality as they feel. What if we explored these assumptions together? How might we check their accuracy?

User: I guess I could try speaking to them more and see how they respond. But I'm still scared of what they might think.

Consultant: That's a brave idea! It's normal to feel scared, but testing our assumptions can be really helpful. If a friend was in a similar position, what would you tell them about facing their fears?

User: I’d probably tell them to just be themselves and not worry too much about others' opinions.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you already have some good advice. Let's work on implementing that advice for yourself. What small step do you think you could take to start being yourself around your classmates?

User: Maybe I could try to join a small group during lunch and contribute a bit to the conversation, even if it's just a little.

Consultant: That's a fantastic step, Xu Feng! Starting small can make a big difference. What would be a realistic goal for you—how many times this week do you think you could try that?

User: I think I could aim for at least two times this week. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, it’s okay to feel a bit anxious. Each interaction will help you build confidence. Now, how do you feel about this plan? 

User: I feel a bit relieved and also nervous. But I think it could help me. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel both relieved and nervous. Change takes time, and it's good to recognize those feelings. Let's also think about how you might cope with any negative feelings that arise after these interactions. What strategies do you think could help?

User: I could remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay. Maybe even talk to my mom about how it went afterward.

Consultant: That's a wonderful strategy—self-compassion is key! And talking to your mom could provide support and help you process your feelings. Would you like to discuss anything else that’s been bothering you lately?

User: I think that’s about it for now. I’m just really hoping it gets easier.

Consultant: I believe it will get easier with practice. Remember, every small step counts. You’re doing a great job by being open about your experiences and seeking help. Before we wrap up, is there anything specific you’d like to focus on for next time?

User: I’d like to talk about how it went after I try to interact with my classmates.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can review your experiences and any feelings that come up. Thank you for sharing today, Xu Feng. You've made some great insights. I’m looking forward to our next session!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time.

Consultant: Hello, Xu Feng! I'm glad to see you here today. I know you've been trying to adjust to your new environment. Could you share with me how you're feeling about that recently?

User: Hi! I feel like I'm doing okay overall, but I still worry a lot about what others think of me. I had some setbacks while trying to collaborate with a new group during our extracurricular activities, and that really bothered me.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re navigating through some ups and downs with your new experiences. You mentioned feeling better about some aspects but still being concerned about others' opinions. Can you tell me more about the setbacks you faced in your group?

User: Well, during our project, I felt like I wasn't contributing enough, and some of my ideas didn't go over well. It made me doubt my abilities, and I started feeling anxious about participating in future activities.

Consultant: That sounds quite challenging, and it's understandable to feel anxious after experiencing a setback. In such situations, what specific thoughts went through your mind that contributed to those feelings of doubt?

User: I thought maybe I'm not as good as everyone else, or that they must think I'm not capable of handling things. It made me feel really discouraged.

Consultant: I can see how those thoughts would make you feel discouraged. Let's take a moment to examine those beliefs. Can you identify any evidence that supports or contradicts the idea that you're not good enough?

User: I guess when I think about my past achievements, I did well in school, but when it comes to teamwork, it feels different. I worry that I won't meet others' expectations.

Consultant: It's great that you recognize your strengths academically! In teamwork, it’s common to feel pressure to meet expectations. What do you think would happen if you challenged the thought that you're not capable of contributing positively?

User: Maybe I would feel less anxious and more open to sharing my ideas. But sometimes, it's hard to shake that feeling of inadequacy.

Consultant: Absolutely, that feeling can be tough to shake. Let’s try a small exercise. When you feel that inadequacy creeping in, replace that thought with a more constructive one. For example, remind yourself of your past successes or think about what you’ve learned from the group experience. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good. It might help me to focus on learning instead of just on the outcomes.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on growth and learning can free you from the pressure of perfection. How can you remind yourself to apply this new perspective next time you're working in a group?

User: Maybe I could write down some positive affirmations about my strengths and what I can contribute? That way, I’ll have something to refer to when I’m feeling uncertain.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea, Xu Feng! Having those affirmations can serve as a helpful reminder of your capabilities. How about setting a few specific goals for group activities to help you engage more confidently?

User: I could aim to suggest at least one idea in each group discussion and ask for feedback. That way, I can also gauge how my input is perceived constructively.

Consultant: That's a strong approach! Suggesting ideas and seeking feedback can significantly boost your confidence. As you practice this, how do you think it will change the way you participate in group activities?

User: I think I will feel more involved and less anxious. Plus, maybe I can encourage others to share their thoughts too.

Consultant: That’s an excellent attitude! Encouraging others can also strengthen your sense of belonging within the group. As you apply these strategies, what might be some challenges you foresee?

User: I worry I might still feel nervous before sharing my ideas, especially if I'm not sure how they'll be received.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, but remember it’s okay to feel nervous—many people do. When those nerves arise, you can practice deep breathing or remind yourself of past successes to help ground yourself. Would you like to try a quick breathing exercise together right now?

User: Sure, that could be helpful.

Consultant: Great! Let’s simply take a deep breath in through your nose for four counts, hold it for four counts, and then exhale through your mouth for six counts. Ready? Inhale… hold… and exhale. How do you feel after that?

User: I feel a bit more relaxed. It’s nice to focus on my breathing instead of my worries.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Taking moments to breathe can be very grounding in those anxious moments. As we start wrapping up our session today, what do you feel your biggest takeaway has been?

User: I think it’s the idea of focusing on my strengths and using affirmations. It helps me see that setbacks are part of the process.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing that setbacks are part of growth is a huge step. How do you plan to keep reinforcing your self-recognition moving forward?

User: I’ll create my affirmations tonight and write down what I want to achieve in group work to keep myself motivated.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, even small steps can lead to big changes over time. This was a productive session, Xu Feng. If you face challenges in the future, we can revisit and build on these strategies together.

User: Thank you! I feel more confident about approaching group work now. I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of the progress you're making. Just remember, it's okay to feel a bit anxious sometimes, and you have the tools to manage it. If you need more support, don't hesitate to return. Take care, and good luck with your group activities!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xu Feng! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I’ve gotten more involved in group activities at school, and it feels good to get positive feedback from my teachers and classmates.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re making great progress. Can you tell me more about how participating in those activities has impacted your feelings and confidence?

User: Well, I feel more confident when I contribute to the group. But sometimes, I still feel a bit anxious when I'm speaking in front of others.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious in those situations. Can you share what thoughts go through your mind when you start to feel that anxiety?

User: I guess I worry that I might say something wrong or that others will judge me. It makes it hard to focus on what I want to say.

Consultant: I see, so it sounds like you're concerned about being judged. Let's explore that a bit. How often do you actually receive negative feedback when you speak in those situations?

User: Not often, actually. Most of the time, everything goes well, and people seem supportive.

Consultant: That's a crucial insight! It seems like your worries might not match reality. If you were to give advice to a friend feeling the same anxiety, what would you tell them?

User: I'd probably tell them to just focus on what they want to say and not worry too much about what others think since most people are nicer than we think.

Consultant: That’s great advice! Now, how can we use that perspective to help manage your feelings when you’re speaking? What could you remind yourself in those moments of anxiety?

User: I could think about how supportive my classmates are and that it's okay to make mistakes. Everyone makes them.

Consultant: Absolutely! Shifting your focus to the support around you could really help. Are there any specific situations coming up where you might want to apply this new perspective?

User: Yes, we have a group presentation soon, and I’m a bit nervous about my part.

Consultant: That’s a perfect opportunity to practice. How about we come up with a plan for how you can prepare and remind yourself of your strengths before the presentation?

User: I think I should practice what I'm going to say more and maybe even run through it with some friends. It would help to get their feedback.

Consultant: Practicing with friends sounds like a fantastic idea! It can also reinforce the support you feel from them. How do you feel about doing that?

User: I feel more confident just thinking about it. It seems like a good way to get comfortable.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! As you prepare, remember to acknowledge your successes in these activities. What would you like to set as a small goal for yourself leading up to the presentation?

User: I’d like to aim to practice at least a couple of times with my friends before the actual presentation.

Consultant: That sounds like a very manageable and positive goal! How do you think you’ll celebrate your efforts, even just practicing?

User: Maybe after each practice, I could treat myself to something I enjoy, like a nice snack or some time playing games.

Consultant: Great way to reinforce positive behavior! Making the process enjoyable will help you stay motivated. As we wrap up today, what are the key takeaways you’d like to hold onto from this conversation?

User: I’ll remember to focus on the support from my classmates, practice my presentation with friends, and celebrate my small wins along the way.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies, Xu Feng! I'm proud of the progress you’re making. The next time we meet, we can discuss how everything went and any new experiences you encountered. 

User: Thank you! I feel more prepared already. I look forward to our next session!

Consultant: You're very welcome! Keep up the great work, and remember, you’re not alone in this. See you next time, Xu Feng!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xu Feng! I'm glad you could join me today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good actually. Helping others has made me feel more connected to my classmates, and they seem to appreciate what I do.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve found a way to strengthen your bond with your classmates, which is really important. Can you share a bit more about how this recognition makes you feel?

User: It feels really fulfilling. I feel valued and like I belong, especially since moving to school. It’s nice to be part of a group.

Consultant: That's a significant realization! Feeling valued and part of a group can greatly enhance your self-esteem. What do you think contributed to this sense of belonging?

User: I guess by helping my classmates, I’ve been able to connect with them better. They know they can count on me. 

Consultant: Absolutely, your willingness to help others demonstrates your strength and creates a positive atmosphere. Have you noticed any changes in how you feel about yourself as a result of these interactions?

User: Yes, I feel more confident. I used to doubt myself a lot, but now I see that I can contribute positively.

Consultant: That’s great! Building confidence is a crucial part of personal growth. What are some specific instances where you've felt particularly confident after helping someone?

User: Last week, I helped a classmate who was struggling with math. Seeing how relieved and grateful they were made me feel really proud.

Consultant: Helping your classmate was a fantastic experience! It’s clear that your actions not only supported them but also boosted your confidence. How can we build on this positivity in the future?

User: I want to continue helping others, but I also want to make sure it doesn’t take away from my own studies. 

Consultant: That’s a wise approach! Balancing helping others and focusing on your own goals is important. How might you set boundaries to ensure you have time for your own studies while still being there for your classmates?

User: Maybe I could set specific times to help them, so I also have time for my homework and personal projects.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Establishing clear times can help you be effective in both areas. Let’s think about how else you can maintain this balance. Are there any activities or areas you want to explore more to enhance your confidence?

User: I’m interested in improving my communication skills. If I can express myself better, I feel like I can help even more.

Consultant: Developing communication skills is a fantastic goal! It can enhance your relationships and effectiveness in helping others. What steps do you think you could take to improve your communication skills?

User: Maybe I could practice by participating more in class discussions or joining a speaking club.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Engaging in discussions will not only improve your communication but also deepen your understanding of various subjects. How do you think participating in these activities will impact your confidence and feelings of belonging?

User: I think it would build my confidence even more. Knowing I’m actively involved could make me feel even more connected to my classmates.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight! As you engage more, your sense of belonging should strengthen too. Reflecting on everything we’ve discussed, what long-term goals could you set for yourself regarding helping others and your own development?

User: I’d like to be someone my classmates can always depend on for support, while also maintaining good grades. I think I can manage both.

Consultant: That’s an admirable goal, and it shows your commitment to both your personal growth and your relationships. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you've achieved and how you can continue to grow. 

User: I’ve learned to balance helping others and my own needs. I feel more confident and connected than before.

Consultant: You’ve made significant progress, Xu Feng! Remember, it’s okay to ask for help and take time for yourself as you support others. How would you like to celebrate these achievements and maintain your focus moving forward?

User: I think I’ll create a schedule to keep myself organized, and maybe treat myself to something fun once in a while for my efforts.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Organizing your time will definitely help you maintain balance. Just remember, your efforts are valuable. If you ever feel overwhelmed or need guidance, don’t hesitate to reach out again. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help and advice. 

Consultant: It’s been a pleasure working with you, Xu Feng. I'm excited to see how you continue to grow. Good luck with everything, and I hope to hear about your successes next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xu Feng! I'm glad you could join me today. It sounds like you've been thinking a lot about your future and your development. What specific thoughts or feelings do you want to share today regarding your long-term plans?

User: Hi! Yes, I have some ideas about what I want to do in the future. I'm really excited about it, but sometimes I feel uncertain about whether I can actually achieve my goals. I want to explore more about how to plan for my future.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear you're feeling optimistic about your future! Feeling uncertain at times is completely normal. Let's explore that uncertainty—what specific goals do you have in mind, and what makes you feel unsure about achieving them?

User: I want to do well in my studies and maybe go to a good university one day. But sometimes, I think about whether I can handle the pressure and if I'll be good enough. I worry if I can keep up with other students.

Consultant: It's understandable to worry about competition and pressure, especially in a new environment like high school. Let's break this down a bit. Can you tell me more about what situations make you feel this pressure? Are there specific subjects or areas where you feel your confidence wavering?

User: I feel pressured mostly in math and science classes. I see other students doing well, and I start doubting my abilities. I often think that maybe I just won't be able to grasp the material as easily as they do.

Consultant: It sounds like you're comparing yourself to your peers, which can be quite overwhelming. That automatic thought—doubting your abilities—can really weigh you down. Let’s probe into that. What evidence do you have that you can’t grasp the material? Have you had experiences where you succeeded in understanding something challenging?

User: I actually did well in some of my previous tests, but I easily forget those moments when I see others excel. Instead, I focus on the times I struggled, especially in math. I guess I feel stuck in that negative loop sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a key realization! It’s common to latch onto negative experiences, forgetting about the successes. Let’s try to challenge that thought. Imagine a friend comes to you with similar feelings about their math skills—what would you tell them to encourage and support them?

User: I would probably tell them that they shouldn’t focus too much on the grades of others and that everyone learns at their own pace. I’d remind them of their achievements and encourage them to keep trying.

Consultant: Exactly! You have the insight to support a friend, which means you can apply that same advice to yourself. Let’s consider how we can reinforce those positive memories of your achievements. What strategies do you think could help you remember your successes and build confidence?

User: Maybe I could write down my good grades or times I understood something difficult. Keeping a journal or a list could remind me of my progress.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea, Xu Feng! Keeping a journal can be a powerful way to track your growth and remind yourself of your capabilities during tough times. Would you like to set a goal for how often you will write in this journal?

User: I think I can try to write in it once a week. That way, I can review my week and see what I did well.

Consultant: That's a solid plan! Reflecting once a week will help you stay focused on your progress. Now, let’s think about your study habits. What are some things you can do to enhance your study sessions and combat that pressure you feel during your math and science classes?

User: I guess I could set smaller, specific goals for my study sessions, like focusing on one topic at a time instead of getting overwhelmed by everything at once.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Setting smaller, manageable goals will make studying feel less overwhelming and give you a sense of achievement as you complete each goal. How do you feel about implementing this strategy for your next study session?

User: I feel optimistic about it! I think it might make things easier for me. Also, if I get stuck on something, I can ask for help from my teachers or friends without feeling embarrassed.

Consultant: That's a great perspective, Xu Feng. Reaching out for help is a strength, not a weakness. Building connections with classmates and teachers can really enhance your learning experience and reduce that pressure. How do you feel about increasing those connections during your classes?

User: I think it would help me a lot! I usually keep to myself, but if I try to engage more, I might find others are feeling the same way.

Consultant: Absolutely! Engaging with others can create a supportive network, and you might find common ground with peers who share your feelings. Shall we set a goal for you to speak up or ask a question in your next class?

User: Yes! I will try to ask at least one question in my next math class. That feels challenging but doable.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! It’s all about gradually pushing your boundaries. Remember, each small step counts. Now, as we talk about your progress and goals, what do you think is the most important takeaway from our session today?

User: I think my main takeaway is that I shouldn’t be too hard on myself. I have strengths, and I can improve with practice and support. Keeping a journal and setting smaller goals can really help.

Consultant: Exactly! Acknowledge your strengths and be kind to yourself through this process. You've made great insights during our conversation today. Before we finish, what do you think might help you maintain this positive mindset in the future?

User: I think keeping up with my journal and reminding myself of my small successes will help. I can also reach out to others when I'm feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Xu Feng! You’re equipped with strategies you can actively use. As we wrap up today, it’s clear that you’re building a foundation for your personal development. If you ever need support as you navigate your path, remember that I’m here for you. Do you feel ready to apply what we discussed?

User: Yes, I feel ready! Thank you so much for your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Together, we’ll continue to ensure your development stays on track. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your successes next time!
