Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. I know this has been a challenging time. Could you share with me how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi. To be honest, I'm feeling really low. The diagnosis came as such a shock. I never expected to be diagnosed with breast cancer, and now I feel overwhelmed and scared about the future. 

Consultant: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when facing such significant life changes. What specific thoughts have been occupying your mind these days?

User: I keep thinking about how my life has turned upside down. I broke off my engagement because of the diagnosis, and now I'm not sure what to do. I feel like I'm lost and sad a lot of the time.

Consultant: It’s understandable that you’re feeling lost, especially after such a major life change. Breaking off the engagement must have also added to your emotional weight. How are you coping with these feelings of sadness?

User: I often find myself just crying in secret. I can't seem to talk about it with anyone, even my parents. They have their worries too, and I don't want to burden them more.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to want to protect your loved ones from additional worry, but your feelings are important too. Have you been able to express any of these emotions to anyone, or is it mostly held inside?

User: No, I really haven’t. I just try to keep it to myself and... it sometimes feels like I'm just stuck. I don’t know how to share my feelings or what to say.

Consultant: I hear you. It can be challenging to find the words, especially when emotions are running high. One method might be to start small, perhaps by just sharing one thing that’s been bothering you. Would you be open to that?

User: I think I could try. Maybe talking about it might help. I guess I’m just scared that my feelings will come out too intense.

Consultant: It’s completely okay to feel intense emotions, and it's important to allow yourself to express them. You mentioned feeling scared—what exactly are you afraid of when you think about expressing these feelings?

User: I guess I’m afraid that if I start crying or talking about it, I won’t be able to stop. And I don't want to make anyone else uncomfortable.

Consultant: That fear is quite common. When emotions surface, they can sometimes feel overwhelming. It's important to remember that expressing tears or sadness is a natural response, and it’s okay to show your vulnerability. Can we explore what possible support you might find comforting during these moments?

User: I think maybe talking to a friend or someone who understands would help, but I'm not sure how to start that conversation.

Consultant: It makes sense that reaching out could be difficult, but it could provide you with some relief. You might consider mentioning your feelings in a simple way, like saying, “I’ve been going through a tough time and would love to talk.” How does that sound to you?

User: That feels a bit daunting, but I see how that could open the door for support. I could try it...but what if they don’t respond well?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. However, true friends often want to support you during tough times. If they don’t respond in the way you hope, it doesn't reflect on you or your worth. It just might mean they’re unsure how to react. Would it help to consider how you might feel after attempting to express this to someone?

User: I think I might feel relieved, but I'm also worried about feeling rejected. It’s all just such a mixed bag of emotions.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel that emotional mix; life is rarely just one way. What could help you manage those feelings of worry or potential rejection if they arise after sharing your feelings?

User: I guess I could remind myself that my feelings are valid, regardless of their response. That alone could make me feel better, I think.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight—validating your feelings is an essential part of coping. You deserve to recognize and honor what you’re experiencing. If you do share your feelings, it might also be helpful to plan a self-care activity for afterward. What activity feels nurturing to you?

User: I enjoy listening to music and sometimes drawing. Maybe after a conversation, I could spend some time doing that.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Engaging in activities that bring you joy can indeed help ground you afterward. How do you feel about trying some of these strategies when you’re ready?

User: I feel a little bit more hopeful about it actually. It’s nice to think I have options now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about taking gradual steps at your own pace. As we continue our sessions, we can explore more strategies that might empower you further. What would you like to discuss next time we meet?

User: I’d like to talk more about coping methods and maybe dive a bit into my fears regarding treatment. I think I really need to understand that better.

Consultant: Absolutely, we can definitely do that. Understanding your fears and how to cope with them can help you feel more empowered. We’ll work through this together. Thank you for sharing today; you did great.

User: Thank you for being here and listening. It really makes a difference for me.

Consultant: You're very welcome. Remember, this is a safe space, and I’m here to support you. Looking forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you've come in today. I understand that you might be feeling a bit tense, especially considering what you've been going through. Let’s start by discussing how you're feeling right now and any thoughts that have been on your mind.

User: Hi. Yes, I am feeling quite anxious. The treatment has been tough, and I keep worrying about my health and what the future holds. It's hard to shake off this feeling of uncertainty.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It’s completely understandable to feel that way when facing such significant health issues. Can you share more about what aspects of your treatment or future are causing you the most concern?

User: I think it's mostly about not knowing if I'll get better. I feel like I'm just going through the motions, and I wish I could feel more in control of my situation.

Consultant: Feeling a lack of control over your health can be very distressing. It’s important for us to explore these feelings. What do you believe might help you feel more in control during this time?

User: I suppose being more involved in my treatment decisions could help, but I often feel like I don’t know enough to make those choices.

Consultant: It's great that you recognize the importance of being involved. Many people share that feeling of uncertainty when it comes to making health decisions. What specific decisions do you feel uncertain about?

User: Well, like understanding the treatment options. I sometimes feel overwhelmed with the medical jargon, and I often just agree with what the doctors say without fully grasping it.

Consultant: It sounds like the information overload is making it hard for you to engage in discussions about your treatment. Let’s talk about some strategies you can use to clarify and simplify the information. Would that be helpful?

User: Yes, definitely. I want to know how to ask the right questions without sounding silly or uninformed.

Consultant: That's a valid concern. Remember, there's no such thing as a silly question in healthcare. We can think of some questions together that might help you feel more at ease during your consultations. What type of questions would you want to start with?

User: Maybe I should ask about the side effects of the treatments and what to expect in terms of recovery.

Consultant: Those are excellent starting points! Knowing about side effects can help you prepare mentally and physically. How do you feel about bringing up these questions with your healthcare provider?

User: I'm nervous but also a bit relieved to think about being more proactive. I feel like I need to take some ownership of my health.

Consultant: That's a positive mindset shift! Taking ownership can be empowering. As you approach your next appointment, it might help to write down your questions beforehand. Would you feel comfortable doing that?

User: Yes, that sounds like a good idea. I think I would feel more prepared if I have them written down.

Consultant: Great! Writing down your questions can help you stay focused and ensure you don’t forget anything important. Let’s also consider what you can do to manage your anxiety leading up to your appointment. What usually helps you calm down when you're feeling anxious? 

User: Listening to music usually helps me relax, but lately, I find it hard to enjoy it. 

Consultant: It can be tough to find joy in things when you're feeling overwhelmed. What type of music do you usually listen to, and could we think of ways to integrate that into your routine more?

User: I like calming music. I think creating a little routine that includes listening to it daily might help.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! A routine can provide a sense of stability. How would you envision incorporating this calming music routine into your day?

User: I could set aside some time in the morning or evening for it, like while I'm unwinding or getting ready for the day.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! By integrating music into your routine, you’ll create a small sanctuary for yourself amidst everything else. Would you like to set a specific time for this routine right now?

User: Maybe in the evening when I’m home from work. That feels manageable.

Consultant: Excellent choice! Evenings can be a nice time to reflect on the day. As we wrap up today, let’s talk a bit about the progress you’ve made during our sessions. How do you feel about the insights you’ve gained?

User: I feel like I’m starting to see how I can be more involved in my treatment, which makes me feel a bit more empowered.

Consultant: That's a significant realization! Empowerment is key when navigating your health journey. What are some of the strategies you feel you can continue using to maintain this sense of control moving forward?

User: I can remember to ask questions, write them down, and integrate some calming practices into my routine.

Consultant: Absolutely! Those strategies will serve you well. As we conclude today’s session, remember, your journey is unique, and it's okay to seek help whenever you need it. I believe in your ability to manage your health actively. Whenever you're ready to explore more, I’m here for you.

User: Thank you. I appreciate your support. I’ll try to incorporate everything we talked about.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could support you today. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time.

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. Before we dive in, can we reflect on how you've been feeling since our last session? Have there been any moments where you felt you could express yourself more in interactions with your healthcare team?

User: Hi! I've been thinking about it a lot. I still feel anxious about my condition, but I’ve also been wondering how I could share my thoughts during appointments. I wish I could be more involved in making decisions.

Consultant: It’s great that you’ve been reflecting on your participation in medical decisions. Can you tell me what specifically holds you back from expressing your needs or opinions during those discussions?

User: I guess I worry that my thoughts might not be valid or that the doctors know better than I do. I sometimes feel overwhelmed by medical terms and just end up nodding along instead of speaking up.

Consultant: That sounds understandable. Many people feel intimidated in such situations. Let’s explore your thoughts a bit more—what would make you feel your opinions are just as valid as the doctors'?

User: I think if I understood more about my condition, I would feel more confident. Right now, it’s just a lot of information to process, and I feel like I can’t keep up.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way! Gaining understanding can indeed empower you. Let's try to clarify some of the medical terms or concepts that you find confusing. Which terms or concepts would you like to start with?

User: I often hear things like "treatment options" and "side effects" but don’t fully grasp what they entail. I think learning about them could help me feel more secure.

Consultant: That’s a good place to start. Knowing about treatment options allows you to make informed decisions. Let’s look at your treatment options—what specific questions do you have regarding them?

User: I’m curious about all the potential treatments, but I also fear the side effects. How do I cope with that fear when discussing options with my doctor?

Consultant: Identifying your fears is a crucial step. When you feel those fears rising, it can help to remember that it’s okay to voice them. Perhaps you can prepare a list of concerns before your appointment. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds helpful! If I have a list, I might be more likely to speak up. But what if I still feel overwhelmed during the discussion?

Consultant: If you start feeling overwhelmed, you could request a moment to gather your thoughts or ask the doctor to clarify anything that seems confusing. How do you think you’d feel about using that approach?

User: That could work! Being able to take a moment really sounds comforting. I wish I had done this sooner.

Consultant: It’s never too late to try a new approach. By practicing this way, it might help you build confidence over time. How about we try a role-play exercise where you express your concerns as if you were in your doctor's office?

User: Sure! That would be a good practice to get me started. I'm a bit nervous but also excited to try.

Consultant: Perfect! I’ll play the doctor. Whenever you feel ready, start with expressing your concerns about your treatment options. Remember, this is a safe space to practice.

User: Okay... um, I would say, "Doctor, I’m feeling a bit anxious about the treatment options available to me. Can we discuss what they involve and their potential side effects?"

Consultant: That’s a great start! You’ve clearly expressed your feelings and asked an important question. How did it feel to say that?

User: It felt good! I think just saying it out loud makes it less daunting. I wish I could keep that confidence when I’m actually with my doctor.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization. Building confidence will take practice, but you've made an excellent step today. What would you like to focus on next to further support this growth?

User: Maybe we could discuss some strategies for managing my anxiety on the day of the appointment. I don’t want my nerves to get the best of me.

Consultant: Absolutely, let's focus on that. One helpful technique is deep breathing exercises. Would you like to try a simple breathing exercise with me now? 

User: Yes, I’d like that! I often forget to take a moment to breathe during those appointments.

Consultant: Let’s do this together. Take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a moment, and then exhale slowly through your mouth... Let's repeat this for a few cycles. 

User: That felt relaxing! I can see how this could help ground me before my appointment.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You can also visualize yourself being calm and confident during your discussions. Combining breathing and visualization can enhance your experience. How do you feel about trying that in the future?

User: I feel positive about that! Having these tools in my toolkit makes me feel more prepared. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful! You’re building a strong foundation for expressing your needs. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. What do you think your next steps will be?

User: I’ll practice my breathing, prepare questions, and try to visualize myself speaking up confidently. I hope to feel more empowered during my next appointment!

Consultant: Those are excellent steps! I believe in your ability to implement these strategies. How about we summarize what you’ve learned today before we conclude?

User: Sure! I learned the importance of preparation, tried role-playing my concerns, and practiced breathing techniques. I feel more empowered to express myself.

Consultant: You’ve made amazing progress! Remember, it’s fantastic that you’re taking these steps. I’m proud of your commitment. If you feel anxious in the future, just remind yourself you have these strategies to help you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. This session has really helped me. 

Consultant: I’m happy to hear that! Remember, it’s okay to reach out whenever you need. You've got this! Looking forward to our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're back for this session. It's great to hear that you've been feeling a bit more balanced lately. What would you like to discuss today?

User: Hi. I think I've been more aware of how important encouragement from my team and parents is for me. However, I still feel quite nervous about expressing my health needs, especially during medical appointments.

Consultant: I appreciate your willingness to explore this. It's interesting that you've recognized the importance of encouragement. How do you feel when you think about expressing your health needs with your healthcare team?

User: I feel a bit anxious, to be honest. I worry about being misunderstood or not taken seriously.

Consultant: That sounds challenging. It's common to feel anxious about communication, especially in medical settings. What specific aspects do you think contribute to those feelings of anxiety?

User: I guess I’m afraid of not knowing enough to advocate for myself. Sometimes, I feel like I don't understand medical terms or the treatment options well enough.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way, especially given the complexities of health discussions. How do you usually prepare for your appointments to help alleviate some of that anxiety?

User: I tend to write down questions beforehand, but when I get there, I still feel overwhelmed and forget to ask them.

Consultant: Writing down your questions is a great step! It seems that the environment makes it difficult for you to recall those questions. What if we work on some strategies to help you feel more confident during your appointments?

User: That sounds helpful. What do you suggest?

Consultant: One approach could be role-playing. We could simulate a medical appointment where you practice expressing your needs and asking questions. How does that sound to you?

User: Yes, I think that could be really useful. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s say I'm your doctor. You can start by explaining your current health concerns. 

User: Okay. Well, Doctor, I’ve been feeling anxious about my treatment options and I would like to know more about the side effects.

Consultant: That's a great start! Now, let’s dig deeper—what specific questions do you have about side effects? 

User: I want to know how they might affect my daily life. 

Consultant: Excellent question! You might say, “Can you tell me how the side effects I might experience will impact my daily activities?” This not only shows your concern but also prompts the doctor to provide better insights. 

User: Yeah, it feels better to approach it that way. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! How are you feeling now about discussing your health needs after practicing that?

User: I feel a bit more empowered. It seems less daunting now that I've practiced.

Consultant: That's wonderful! Remember, preparation can truly increase your confidence. Besides practice, do you think there are other ways to boost your comfort level during appointments?

User: Perhaps I could bring someone with me for support. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Having a supportive companion can make a big difference. How do you think that would change your experience?

User: It might help me feel less anxious and more at ease if I have someone there to remind me of what I want to ask.

Consultant: Yes, it can create a safety net for you. Is there anyone in particular you have in mind to accompany you to these appointments?

User: I think my mom would be a good choice. She’s supportive and can help me remember things.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Engaging your mom in this way could enhance your experience. What about after the appointment—how would you feel about reflecting on how it went?

User: I think that would be beneficial. It might help me understand what worked and what didn’t.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflecting on your experiences can reinforce your self-management skills. You might write down what went well and areas for improvement afterward. How does that resonate with you?

User: It makes sense. I can see how analyzing could help me improve for future appointments.

Consultant: Exactly! As we wrap up today, do you feel you’ve gained tools that could help you express your health needs more confidently?

User: Yes, I definitely feel more prepared and optimistic.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Remember, your health needs are important, and you have every right to advocate for them. I'm proud of the progress you've made today!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're welcome! I believe in your ability to manage your health journey. If you ever feel overwhelmed or uncertain, feel free to come back anytime. Take care!

User: I will! Thank you again.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling since our last talk?

User: Hi. I've been trying to make more decisions on my own and focus on my health. It's been a bit overwhelming, but I do feel like I'm starting to value my input more.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like you're beginning to recognize the importance of your decisions and how they impact your well-being. Can you share some specific decisions you've made recently that made you feel empowered?

User: Well, I started planning my meals for the week and even set some fitness goals. I've also tried speaking up more at home about what I want instead of just going along with what my parents suggest.

Consultant: Those are significant steps! Planning your meals and setting fitness goals shows that you're taking charge of your health. How did it feel to express your opinions more at home?

User: It was a bit scary at first because I'm not used to it. But once I did it, I felt relieved, like a weight had been lifted. I think they were supportive, too.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Feeling relieved after expressing yourself shows how important it is to communicate your needs. It can also strengthen your relationships. What did you learn about yourself through this experience?

User: I realized that I actually have opinions and preferences worth sharing. I often felt like my voice didn't matter, but now I see that I can contribute to decisions.

Consultant: Recognizing the value of your voice is a crucial insight. It sounds like you're growing more confident. How do you plan to continue this journey of self-advocacy?

User: I want to keep making choices about my health and also try to be more involved in discussions that affect my life. Maybe I could even talk about my feelings more openly.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Being involved in discussions and expressing your feelings are essential parts of self-management. How do you feel about tackling specific topics with your parents or friends that you may have avoided in the past?

User: I feel a bit anxious about it, but I think it's necessary. I want them to understand what I’m going through and be part of my healing process.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious about those conversations. Having open communication can definitely help them support you better. Would you like to practice how you might approach those discussions?

User: Yes, that could be helpful. I'm not sure how to start the conversation without feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: A good approach might be to share how you're feeling first. You could say something like, "I have something important I want to discuss about my health and how it's affecting me." Does that feel manageable to you?

User: Yes, that sounds better. I think starting with my feelings could help set the tone.

Consultant: Exactly! It opens up the conversation and shows vulnerability. How do you think your parents might respond to this openness?

User: I hope they would be understanding and want to help me. They’ve always cared, but sometimes I feel they don’t really know what I need.

Consultant: That's understandable. By expressing yourself, you give them a chance to understand and support you in the ways you need. How might this help your overall emotional well-being?

User: I think it would make me feel less alone, knowing they understand what I'm going through. It could ease some of my anxiety.

Consultant: Certainly! Sharing your feelings can foster closeness and lessen feelings of isolation. How do you plan to remind yourself to engage in these conversations going forward?

User: Maybe I could set reminders for myself or even write down my thoughts before talking to them. That way, I wouldn’t forget what I want to say.

Consultant: Great idea! Writing down your thoughts can provide clarity and confidence. Would you like to set a specific goal for how often you want to have these conversations?

User: I think starting once a week would be good. It feels doable and not too overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical plan. As you start these conversations, how can you celebrate your progress, no matter how small?

User: I could treat myself to something nice after each conversation, maybe a favorite snack or a relaxing evening.

Consultant: Rewarding yourself is a fantastic way to reinforce positive behavior! It can motivate you to keep engaging in these empowering conversations. As we continue, how do you feel about your journey towards better self-management right now?

User: I feel a lot more optimistic. I know it won’t be easy, but I feel equipped to handle it.

Consultant: That's a positive mindset to have! Remember, it's a process. In our next session, we can review how these conversations have gone for you and discuss any adjustments needed. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Before we wrap up, let's reflect on what we've discussed today. You've made measurable progress in your self-management, and your journey toward open communication is vital. What is your biggest takeaway from this session?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is just knowing that my voice matters and that I can influence decisions in my life. 

Consultant: Absolutely! That awareness is a powerful tool. I'm proud of the steps you've taken towards nurturing your health and well-being. Let’s continue to build on that in future sessions. If you need anything before we meet again, feel free to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I will definitely keep that in mind. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and I'll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. I’m really glad to hear that you’ve been feeling more positive lately. What would you like to focus on in our session today?

User: Hi! Thank you. I feel like I have made some progress, but I still want to discuss my growth and strategies to maintain my current positive state. It’s been quite an emotional journey.

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s important to reflect on your journey and the changes you’ve experienced. Can you share some specific moments or strategies that you believe contributed to your progress so far?

User: Sure! I’ve become more comfortable communicating with my doctors and managing my daily life. I also felt a sense of relief when I started prioritizing my own feelings and needs over what my parents wanted.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant step forward! It must have felt freeing to prioritize your own feelings. How did that change your emotional state when you began expressing yourself more?

User: It felt empowering, but also a bit scary at times. I realized that I had been holding back for so long. Now, I find myself still occasionally reverting to my old habits of avoiding confrontation, though.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way, especially after making such changes. Recognizing those old patterns is the first step to overcoming them. What do you think triggers those feelings of wanting to avoid confrontation?

User: I think it’s rooted in my desire to keep the peace, especially with my parents. I’ve always been the one to comply and not rock the boat.

Consultant: That makes sense. A lot of people share that desire to maintain harmony in their relationships. How do you feel when you find yourself slipping back into that pattern of compliance?

User: I feel frustrated with myself, like I’m not being true to who I want to be. It also makes me anxious, wondering if my parents will be disappointed in me.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a real conflict between wanting to assert yourself and the fear of disappointing your parents. Let’s explore this further—what do you think would happen if you chose to express your own needs or opinions in those situations?

User: I worry they might react negatively or feel hurt. I guess I fear the confrontation and their possible disappointment in me.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Sometimes, it helps to consider how you might react if your friend were in a similar situation. What advice would you give them about expressing their feelings, regardless of the outcome?

User: I think I’d tell them it’s important to be honest about their needs. It’s okay to voice their thoughts and feelings, even if it makes someone else uncomfortable temporarily.

Consultant: Exactly! That perspective is really valuable. Allowing yourself to express your needs doesn’t diminish your care for your parents; it actually shows them that you're growing as an individual. Considering this, what small step could you take to start expressing yourself more assertively?

User: Perhaps I can start sharing my thoughts in small conversations and build my confidence that way. I think I could try that.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Starting small can make the process feel less overwhelming. How about we discuss some situations where you might be able to practice this assertiveness?

User: I think I can start with less intense topics, maybe like discussing what I want for dinner instead of something bigger. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Using everyday scenarios is an effective way to practice. How do you feel about approaching those conversations with that mindset?

User: I feel more at ease thinking about approaching it that way. It feels like a manageable risk.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s all about taking those manageable steps. Once you start implementing these strategies, we can review how it went and adjust if needed. 

User: That sounds good! I’m looking forward to it. It gives me some direction in moving forward.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let's keep this momentum going. As we wrap up, what would you say has been your biggest takeaway from today's session regarding your self-assertion?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is that it’s okay to express my needs and that doing so doesn’t mean I care any less about my parents. 

Consultant: Absolutely! That realization is vital for your growth. How can you remind yourself of this in the future when you feel that anxiety creeping in?

User: I can write it down or even say it aloud when I feel anxious, reminding myself that my voice matters too.

Consultant: That’s a great technique! Keeping those affirmations in your mind can really help sustain your confidence. As we conclude our session today, what other support do you think would help you maintain this positive trajectory?

User: I might need a reminder to check in with myself regularly and how my communication is developing.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Regular check-ins can help you stay connected to your progress. Remember, I’m here for support at any time. You’ve come a long way, and I believe you can keep this positive momentum going!

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your guidance. I’m feeling much more hopeful about the future now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the strides you’ve made. Keep believing in yourself, and I look forward to our next session. Take care!

User: Thanks! I’ll see you next time.
