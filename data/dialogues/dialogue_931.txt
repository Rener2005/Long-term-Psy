Consultant: Hello, Xuanxuan! I'm glad you're here today. I understand you've been feeling a bit lost and anxious recently. Can you share more about what’s been on your mind and how it's affecting you?

User: Hi. Yeah, I've just been feeling really out of it lately. My grades have dropped, and I feel so lonely after my friendship with Xiao Qi ended. I don't know how to deal with it all.

Consultant: It sounds like that friendship meant a lot to you, and losing it has really impacted your well-being. Can you tell me more about how you feel when you think about that situation?

User: I feel confused and sad. Sometimes, I just sit at my desk and stare at my books, but nothing really gets through to me. It feels like everything is pointless.

Consultant: I can see why this would leave you feeling unmotivated and stuck. When you say things feel pointless, what specific thoughts cross your mind?

User: I often think that I'm not good enough, and that maybe my friends didn't really care about me. It hurts a lot.

Consultant: That sounds really painful, Xuanxuan. It’s not uncommon to feel that way after a friendship changes. Let’s explore those thoughts together. When you think your friends don't care, what evidence do you have for that? Have there been times when they showed they cared?

User: I guess there were some fun times we had before. But now, I just can't shake the feeling that they must be glad I’m gone. 

Consultant: Acknowledging the good times you shared is important. In moments like this, it’s easy to jump to conclusions. What if we challenge that thought? Is it possible they are also feeling the loss of the friendship?

User: Maybe, but I just don’t know. I wish I could fix things, but it seems so difficult.

Consultant: It's completely normal to want to mend things, yet it can feel overwhelming. How would it feel to think about reaching out again? What’s holding you back from trying?

User: I’m scared that they won’t want to talk to me. What if they just ignore me?

Consultant: Your feelings of fear are valid. What if we consider a more positive outcome? If you did reach out and they responded well, how would that change your feelings?

User: I guess it would make me feel hopeful, but it still feels risky.

Consultant: Taking risks can be challenging. Let’s practice reframing that fear into a possibility. What if you view it as a chance to reconnect rather than a risk of rejection? 

User: I could try seeing it that way. I just worry it’s too late to fix things.

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry about timing, but reaching out can be an opportunity to express how you feel. What's something small you could do to reconnect with them in a low-pressure way?

User: Maybe I could send a casual message or ask about schoolwork? That doesn’t seem too intimidating.

Consultant: That sounds like a great starting point! It allows you to reopen communication without putting too much pressure on yourself. How does that plan make you feel?

User: It makes me feel a bit more confident. I also think about how I can improve my studies, although it still seems tough.

Consultant: It's great that you're thinking about both friendships and studies. Let's brainstorm together—how could you set realistic goals for yourself that also make studying feel more manageable?

User: Maybe I could break my studying into smaller chunks and take breaks in between. That might help!

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy, Xuanxuan! Small, achievable goals can make a big difference. How about we set a specific goal for your study time this week? 

User: I think I could aim to study for 30 minutes each day and gradually increase it.

Consultant: That sounds very achievable! Remember to celebrate those small wins. Now, in regard to the emotional aspect of your situation, how do you plan to manage your feelings of anxiety when they arise?

User: I think I should try taking deep breaths or maybe even talking to my mom when I feel overwhelmed. 

Consultant: Talking about your feelings is a wonderful strategy. Remember, it’s okay to share what’s on your mind. Now, as we wrap up today’s session, what are the main takeaways you can hold onto moving forward?

User: I’ll try to reconnect with my friend and set a goal for studying, alongside managing my feelings through breathing and talking to my mom.

Consultant: Those are fantastic steps, Xuanxuan! I'm here to support you, and don't forget to be gentle with yourself. Whenever you feel ready, we can continue this journey together. Remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time.

User: Thank you. This session has really helped me think things through. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’ve made some great progress today. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xuanxuan! It's great to see you again. I want to hear about how you've been feeling since our last session. How did your attempts at engaging with your classmates go?

User: Hi! Well, I tried to talk to some of my classmates during breaks, but it felt really awkward. I wanted to connect with them, but I still felt hesitation and unease.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. It’s completely normal to feel awkward when trying to connect with others. Can you describe a specific moment when you tried to talk to a classmate? What thoughts crossed your mind at that time?

User: I remember I approached a guy from my math class. I wanted to ask him about homework, but I thought he might think I was weird or bother him, so I hesitated a lot before actually saying anything.

Consultant: It seems like you had a desire to connect, but those worries held you back. What emotions did you experience while you were hesitating to approach him?

User: I felt nervous and a bit embarrassed. I really wanted to talk to him, but it just felt like I was going to mess it up.

Consultant: That nervousness is understandable, especially when we care about how we appear to others. Can you identify any specific thoughts or beliefs that made you feel embarrassed or nervous in that moment?

User: I kept thinking that he would judge me or think I was trying too hard to be friends. It felt like everyone was watching me.

Consultant: It sounds like you were caught up in a lot of anticipation about negative judgment. How realistic do you think those thoughts were? Could there be other interpretations of their reactions?

User: I guess I thought too much about what others might think. It’s just so hard to shake off that feeling, though.

Consultant: Yes, those thoughts can be quite persistent. Let’s challenge them a bit—if a friend were in a similar situation, what advice would you give them about approaching someone?

User: I’d probably tell them it’s okay, that people are usually friendly and they shouldn’t worry too much about what others think.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective! Now, let’s think about how you can apply that same kindness to yourself. What if you allowed yourself to believe that most people are open to conversations, just like your advice to a friend?

User: That would make things a lot easier! Maybe I can try to be a bit kinder to myself when I feel nervous.

Consultant: Exactly! Being kinder to yourself can really help reduce that pressure. How about we set a small goal for your next school day, something manageable that you could try to make interacting with your classmates feel easier?

User: Maybe I could aim to say “hi” to at least two classmates during breaks? It doesn’t sound too hard.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect goal! It’s a small step, and it’s great that you’re focusing on just saying “hi” first. How would you feel about that step?

User: I feel a bit less anxious thinking about it like that. It’s just saying “hi”, right?

Consultant: Exactly! And with each small interaction, you’re building your confidence. Do you have any strategies that could help you remember this goal when you're at school?

User: Maybe I could write it down in my notebook. Seeing it might remind me to do it.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Writing it down will serve as a helpful reminder. How do you think you might feel after you accomplish this goal of saying “hi” to two classmates?

User: I think I’d feel proud of myself. It might even make me want to talk to them more!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! Celebrating small victories can really boost your confidence. Now, looking ahead, how are you feeling about your studies? Do you think your social interactions might impact your academic confidence?

User: Honestly, my grades are still not where I want them to be, and I feel kind of lost about what to do next. I think I might need help with that too.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel lost at times, especially with all the changes going on. Having positive interactions can indeed create a better environment for your studies. What do you think could help reignite your interest in learning?

User: Maybe if I could study with a friend, it would be less boring and more fun.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Collaborating with friends can make studying much more engaging. Do you have anyone in mind who you might reach out to for study sessions?

User: There's a classmate I used to work well with. I could ask him if he wants to study together.

Consultant: That sounds promising! Asking for a study partner might also ease your feelings of isolation. How do you plan to approach that conversation?

User: I’ll just ask him if he’d like to study together for our upcoming test and see what he says.

Consultant: Perfect approach! Keeping it simple and direct is often the best way. Remember, this can also be an opportunity to practice those social skills we talked about. How do you feel about combining these two goals: saying “hi” and asking your classmate to study?

User: It feels a lot more manageable when I think of it like that. I think I'm ready to try!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Stepping forward with both goals is a strong move. As we wrap up today, let’s quickly summarize your goals: You aim to say “hi” to two classmates and ask one to study together. How does that sound?

User: Yeah, that sounds good. I’m hopeful about it.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset to have! I believe in your ability to achieve these goals. Remember to be kind to yourself through this process. I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session. Take care, Xuanxuan!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xuanxuan! I'm glad you're here for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. I've been okay, I guess. I had a couple of talks with my classmates, which felt a bit better, but I still struggle with my studies and feel lost about what I should do next.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've had some positive interactions with your classmates! It sounds like you're working on your social connections, which is a step in the right direction. When you think about your studies, what specific challenges or feelings do you experience?

User: I just feel like I'm not good enough. Sometimes, I sit down to study, but my mind just goes blank. I used to enjoy learning, but now it feels overwhelming.

Consultant: I understand. It can be difficult when we lose enjoyment in something that once made us happy. What do you think has changed for you in your studies that contributes to those feelings?

User: Maybe it's because I feel pressure to do well, especially with the exams coming up. I also worry about disappointing my mom because she works so hard.

Consultant: That pressure can be quite heavy, especially when it comes from wanting to please someone else. Let's think about some small goals you could set for your studies. What do you think you can realistically achieve in the upcoming week?

User: I suppose I can try studying for just 30 minutes each day. It feels manageable, I think. 

Consultant: That sounds like a very reasonable goal, Xuanxuan! Starting with 30 minutes a day can help you ease back into studying without feeling overwhelmed. How would you feel about keeping a record of your study sessions to reflect on your progress?

User: I like that idea. It would help me see that I'm doing something, even if it's small.

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping track of your efforts, no matter how small, can boost your motivation and self-belief. After a week, we can review what you accomplished. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good. I think I'd like to see where I stand after a week.

Consultant: Perfect! Also, if you manage to stick to your goal, think about ways to reward yourself. What’s something you enjoy that you could treat yourself to after a successful week?

User: Maybe I could play some video games. I really enjoy that.

Consultant: That sounds like a great incentive! Playing video games can be a fun way to reward yourself. Now, besides your studies, how are you feeling about your interactions with your classmates? 

User: The talks were okay, but I still feel nervous around them, especially with how things went with Xiao Qi.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel nervous, especially if a past interaction didn’t go well. What are some small steps you think you could take to feel more comfortable in those situations?

User: Maybe I could start by asking them about school-related stuff, like group work or projects.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Asking about schoolwork can help build a foundation for conversation and may ease some of that nervousness. Remember to be kind to yourself and take it step by step. 

User: Yeah, I’ll try that. I just want to feel connected again.

Consultant: Connection can be very important, and making small efforts can lead to significant changes over time. How about we summarize our plan moving forward?

User: Sure. I'm going to study for 30 minutes each day and track my progress, and I'll also talk to my classmates more about school stuff.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Xuanxuan! It sounds like you're taking charge of your journey in a positive way. I believe that as you take these steps, you’ll start to notice progress in both your studies and your relationships.

User: Thanks, that makes me feel more hopeful. I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It's been great to see you engage with these ideas, and I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember, small changes can lead to big results. 

User: I will keep that in mind. I feel a bit more encouraged now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear. As we wrap up our session today, what’s one key takeaway you'd like to remember as you move forward?

User: I think it’s that I can take small steps and that it’s okay to feel nervous. I just need to keep trying.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway, Xuanxuan! You are capable of making progress, and feeling nervous is perfectly normal. I believe in your ability to move forward. If you need to chat again or have more questions, don’t hesitate to come back.

User: Thank you! I'll definitely keep that in mind.

Consultant: You’re doing great, Xuanxuan. Remember to be patient with yourself, and I look forward to hearing about all your achievements in our next session. Take care!

User: Thank you, I will!
###################
Consultant: Hi Xuanxuan! It’s great to see you today. I’m happy to hear that you've made some progress with your recent study goals. Can you share how you’ve been feeling about that achievement?

User: Hi! Yes, I’m actually feeling pretty good about it. It’s nice to see my grades improving, and it gives me a bit of confidence.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It’s important to recognize those moments of success. How do you think this improved confidence is impacting other areas of your life, like your relationships with classmates or friends?

User: Well, I’ve been a bit more open to talking to others lately. I used to feel quite lonely, but now I think I can reach out more.

Consultant: It sounds like you're beginning to feel more connected to your peers, which is fantastic. What are some specific interactions or moments you've experienced recently that made you feel this way?

User: I had a group study session last week, and it felt nice to work together. We helped each other out, and I actually made some jokes, which felt good.

Consultant: That’s really great! Sharing jokes and helping one another can build strong friendships. How did that overall interaction affect your mood during and after the session?

User: I felt really happy during the session, and even after it ended, I found myself smiling. It’s nice to feel like I belong.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It seems like being around your classmates is helping you feel more positive. Now, let’s think about your future interactions. What small steps can you take to continue building these connections with others?

User: Maybe I could invite a few classmates to study together more often or join a club. I’ve been meaning to try that.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent ideas! Joining a club could expand your social circle and strengthen your relationships. What interests you in clubs or groups at school?

User: I’m really into science, so maybe a science club would be fun. I feel like I could meet others who like the same things.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect match for you! Engaging in activities that you enjoy can help you bond with others. What do you think is holding you back from taking that step?

User: I guess I’m a bit nervous to just walk in and introduce myself. What if they don’t like me?

Consultant: It's natural to feel nervous about meeting new people. Remember, it's common for everyone to have those feelings. Let’s challenge that thought—what evidence do you have that they wouldn’t like you?

User: Well, I don’t really have any. Most people seem nice, and I did have fun with my classmates when I was studying.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve already had positive experiences with others. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them to do?

User: I’d probably tell them to just go for it and see how it goes. It’s worth a try!

Consultant: That's a great perspective! Now, what if you applied that same advice to yourself? What would be the first step you could take to join the club?

User: I think I could just go to the first meeting and see how it feels. I could also prepare a little introduction about myself.

Consultant: That's a solid plan! Preparing an introduction can help you feel more confident. What feelings arise when you think about taking that first step?

User: I feel a bit anxious, but also excited. I really want to connect with others.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel a mix of excitement and anxiety when trying something new. Let's think about how you can manage that anxiety. What strategies could help you stay calm when you walk into the meeting?

User: Maybe I could practice some deep breathing or remind myself that it’s okay to just be myself.

Consultant: Those are excellent techniques! Deep breathing can really help calm your nerves. And remember, being yourself is the best way to connect with others. How do you feel about using those strategies when you take that step?

User: I think that would help me a lot. I want to try that as I go into the meeting.

Consultant: I believe you’ll do great! Let’s recap your progress today. You've recognized your achievements, discussed plans to connect with peers, and developed strategies to manage anxiety. How are you feeling about these steps you can take?

User: I’m feeling really encouraged! I can’t wait to get started and meet new people.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Xuanxuan! Your enthusiasm and positivity really shine through. As we wrap up today’s session, what will you do first to maintain this motivation?

User: I’ll make a plan to attend the science club meeting next week and practice my introduction.

Consultant: Excellent plan! You’re taking proactive steps, and I’m excited for you. Remember, each small step builds toward greater connections. Keep believing in yourself, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xuanxuan! I'm glad to see you today. It sounds like you've had some positive experiences lately. Can you tell me how you've been feeling?

User: Hi! Yeah, I've been feeling a bit better. I recently participated in a class activity, and it was fun. I made some new friends, and my classmates were really encouraging. 

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear that you're experiencing fun and making new connections. How has this experience affected your overall mood and perspective on friendships?

User: Honestly, it made me feel more hopeful about making friends. I used to feel pretty lonely, but now I see that it’s possible to connect with others. 

Consultant: That's a significant shift in your perspective, Xuanxuan. It's fascinating how positive social interactions can influence our feelings. What do you think helped you feel more comfortable in that recent activity?

User: I think it was just being involved and not overthinking things. I jumped in when everyone was being active, and that made me feel included.

Consultant: Engaging without overthinking is a fantastic step! It seems like you were able to enjoy the moment. How do you feel about trying to create more opportunities like that for yourself?

User: I definitely want to. I want to be more involved in activities and not just hold back. 

Consultant: That's a great goal! What kind of activities are you thinking about participating in, and how do you think you can prepare yourself to jump in just like last time?

User: Maybe some after-school clubs or sports. I should remind myself that it’s okay to join in, even if I feel a bit nervous. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Xuanxuan! Recognizing that nerves are normal can help reduce that pressure. What strategies could you use to remind yourself not to hold back when opportunities arise?

User: I could tell myself it’s just for fun and everyone's there to enjoy themselves too. Maybe I could even set a small goal for myself before I go to an event. 

Consultant: Setting small, enjoyable goals sounds fantastic! Focusing on the fun aspect can help alleviate some anxiety. What types of goals would you like to set for yourself when attending these events?

User: I might aim to talk to at least one new person or just join in a conversation. 

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! Talking to a new person or joining a conversation can really expand your social network. When you think about the next event, how do you feel about approaching it with these goals in mind?

User: I feel excited but also a little nervous. I'm worried what if they don’t respond well or if I mess up.

Consultant: It's normal to feel nervous about potential outcomes. Let’s focus on the excitement. What evidence do you have that suggests others would respond positively to you?

User: Well, during the last activity, I felt welcomed by my classmates, and they seemed to enjoy talking to me. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! You already have proof that connections can be made. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about overcoming those nerves?

User: I’d probably say just to go for it and not worry too much. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. 

Consultant: Wise words! By treating yourself as you would a friend, you can ease your pressure. How might that shift in perspective help you when you're preparing for social situations?

User: I think it could help me feel more relaxed. I’d be more willing to take that step instead of holding back. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Being kinder to yourself can lead to greater confidence. As we look ahead, what will be your first step towards putting this into practice?

User: I want to sign up for a club this week. There's a sports club I’m interested in, so I’ll give that a try.

Consultant: Wonderful! Signing up for that club is a fantastic step forward. How can you remind yourself of your goals when you attend the first meeting?

User: I’ll write down my goals and maybe even practice what I want to say beforehand. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy, Xuanxuan! Practicing can help build your confidence even more. How do you feel reflecting on these positive approaches now?

User: I feel really good about it! I’m excited to start and see what happens.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up our session today, what would you say your biggest takeaway is from our discussion?

User: I guess it’s that I can create opportunities for myself and that making connections can be enjoyable. 

Consultant: That's a powerful takeaway! Remember, you've already made progress, and every small step counts. As you look ahead, what strategies will you use to maintain this positive feeling about social interactions?

User: I think I’ll keep reminding myself of the fun I had and focus on the enjoyment rather than worrying too much. 

Consultant: That's an excellent approach! I'm proud of the progress you've made today, Xuanxuan. Keep nurturing those connections and practicing kindness toward yourself. If you ever need support, know that I'm here for you. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I believe in your ability to create these positive experiences. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xuanxuan! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more positive, actually. My relationship with Xiao Qi is starting to improve, and I feel more open to talking about things. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Improving your relationship with Xiao Qi is a great achievement. What specific moments or types of conversations have contributed to this positivity?

User: I just decided to be honest and open with him. We talked about some misunderstandings, and it felt good to share my thoughts.

Consultant: It sounds like having that honest conversation was really beneficial for both of you. How did you feel during and after that discussion?

User: I felt nervous at first, but once we started talking, it was relieving. Afterward, I felt happy and more connected to him.

Consultant: Those feelings of relief and happiness are really important. It's great to see you starting to build that connection. Have you noticed any changes in how you view yourself since these interactions?

User: Yes, I think I'm beginning to see myself as someone who can communicate better and be more open. I can actually have meaningful conversations.

Consultant: That's a significant mindset shift! Recognizing your ability to communicate effectively can boost your self-esteem. What other aspects of your life do you think this new perspective might impact?

User: Maybe my other friendships and even at school. I feel like I can participate more and not just sit back.

Consultant: That's an excellent realization! Engaging more actively in friendships and school can further enhance your confidence. Have you thought about how you might take steps to be more involved?

User: I want to join a club or something, where I can meet new people. It seems like a good way to practice being social.

Consultant: Joining a club sounds like a fantastic idea! Meeting new people in a shared interest can make it easier to connect. What kind of clubs or activities are you considering?

User: I’m thinking about the art club. I like drawing, and it could be fun to share that with others.

Consultant: Art club sounds like a great fit! It's a creative outlet and a chance to meet others with similar interests. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I’m excited but a bit nervous about meeting new people. What if I don't fit in?

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about new social situations. Remember, everyone is there with a common interest, and many of them might be feeling the same way. What strategies can you use to ease that nervousness?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone is there to make friends too. I could also prepare some things to say ahead of time.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Reminding yourself of shared interests and having conversation starters can definitely help. How do you feel about preparing for that?

User: I feel more confident knowing I have a plan. 

Consultant: That's a strong approach! Confidence often builds from preparation. Reflecting back on your progress, what would you say has been the most helpful insight from our sessions together?

User: I think understanding that it's okay to be open about my feelings has helped a lot. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway, Xuanxuan. Being open about your feelings and embracing vulnerability can lead to deeper connections. As we come to our last session, what would you like to focus on to maintain this growth moving forward?

User: I want to set goals for myself on how to keep improving my relationships and continue feeling good about myself.

Consultant: Setting goals is a fantastic way to continue your growth. What specific goals do you have in mind for your relationships and self-esteem?

User: I want to reach out to at least one person in class and try to get to know them better, and for myself, I want to spend more time drawing to boost my confidence.

Consultant: Those are both wonderful goals! Reaching out to others shows courage, and dedicating time to your passion is a great way to nurture your self-esteem. How can you hold yourself accountable for these goals?

User: I could keep a journal to track my interactions and my drawing progress. 

Consultant: That's an effective strategy! A journal can help you reflect and celebrate your achievements. As we wrap up today, is there anything specific you feel you've gained from our sessions that you want to carry forward?

User: I’ve learned that I can express myself better and connect with others. This gives me hope for my relationships.

Consultant: That's an empowering realization! Remember, you've made significant progress, and it's just the beginning. As you move forward, trust in your ability to handle challenges and nurture your relationships. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xuanxuan. You've done remarkable work throughout this process, and I believe in your continued growth. If you ever need to revisit our sessions, know that I'm always here for you. Take care!
