Consultant: Hello, Li! Thank you for coming in today. I want to check in and hear about what’s been on your mind lately. How have you been feeling?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’ve been feeling really down. The pressure of graduating is really weighing on me. I can’t help but feel inferior compared to my classmates. It’s like I can’t keep up.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed, especially with the impending graduation. Can you share more about what specific feelings or thoughts come up for you during this time?

User: I guess I just feel like I’m not good enough. I see my classmates doing so well, and I feel like I’m just trying to survive. My financial situation makes it worse because I’ve had to borrow money to keep up, and that just adds to my stress.

Consultant: It’s really hard to feel that way, especially when you compare yourself to others. It seems like your financial situation is heavily influencing how you view yourself. Can we explore the thoughts you have about your self-worth in relation to what others are doing?

User: Sure. I often think that if I can’t afford the same things or have the same experiences as my peers, then I’m less deserving of respect or friendship.

Consultant: That’s an important insight. It sounds like you’re linking your worth to your financial status or the experiences you can provide for yourself. Have you noticed how this thought affects your feelings about yourself?

User: Yes, it makes me feel really low. I feel like I don’t belong. I start to avoid social situations because I’m worried about how people perceive me.

Consultant: Avoiding social situations can be a common response when feeling this way. It seems like you might be reinforcing the belief that you don’t belong. What do you think would happen if you challenged that belief?

User: I don’t know... It’s hard to imagine people seeing me differently. I fear they’ll see me as someone who just doesn’t fit in.

Consultant: It makes sense that fear would come up. But let’s think about it: if a friend of yours was in a similar situation, what would you tell them about fitting in and their worth?

User: I would probably tell them that their worth isn’t defined by money or possessions. That it’s about who they are as a person.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you have compassion for others. What if you applied that same perspective to yourself? How might that change your feelings?

User: I guess if I can view myself more compassionately, I might not feel as bad about borrowing money or not having everything figured out.

Consultant: That’s a great reflection, Li. It's a step towards reframing your self-view. Let’s explore some alternative thoughts you could hold onto, especially when you feel that self-doubt creeping in.

User: Okay. Maybe I can remind myself that I am doing my best given my circumstances. Not everyone knows how hard it is to manage my situation.

Consultant: That’s a powerful thought to keep in mind. Remembering that your efforts matter and recognizing your circumstances can help you build self-acceptance. What strategies do you think could help reinforce this belief in yourself?

User: I could keep a journal, reminding myself of the progress I’m making and things I’m proud of, like my studies or my determination to improve my situation.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Journaling can help you recognize your strengths and reflect on your growth. How do you think this could impact your feelings about your future?

User: I hope it would help me feel less anxious about what comes next. I need to believe that I can handle whatever challenges come my way.

Consultant: Absolutely. Believing in your ability to navigate challenges can empower you. As we approach graduation, how can you prepare yourself to face the uncertainties ahead?

User: I think I need to focus on applying for part-time work and networking, even if I feel nervous about it. It’s about taking small steps, right?

Consultant: Yes, taking small steps is vital. What kind of part-time work are you considering, and how might that help with your current feelings towards your financial situation?

User: I’ve been looking at tutoring or maybe some administrative jobs. Having a bit of income could ease my worries about loans, even if it’s not a lot.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical plan, and gaining experience can help build your confidence too. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize how you felt at the beginning of our session versus how you feel now.

User: Initially, I felt really lost and self-critical. Now, I see that I can work on my self-image and take steps towards a better financial situation, even if it’s small.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift, Li! Remember, it’s about gradual progress and being kind to yourself during this time. If you continue to focus on your personal growth and manage your thoughts, it can lead to a more positive outlook.

User: Thank you. I feel a bit lighter now. I appreciate your help and insights.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s okay to seek support as you navigate these challenges. You’re making positive steps forward, and I’m here for you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need to talk again.

Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you again. I remember we discussed your feelings around your financial situation and the challenges you're facing in finding a part-time job. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite overwhelmed, to be honest. The more I think about my finances and job hunting, the bigger my anxiety seems to grow. I’m still struggling to find a suitable part-time job, and it’s really frustrating.

Consultant: I can hear that you’re feeling increasingly anxious about your situation, which is understandable. Can you tell me what specific thoughts go through your mind when you think about your finances and job hunting?

User: I often feel like I'll never find a good job that can ease my financial troubles. I compare myself to my classmates, and it makes me feel even worse. I just can't shake off this feeling of inadequacy.

Consultant: It's tough to feel that way, especially when you're comparing yourself to others. Let's explore those feelings a bit more. What do you think are the reasons behind feeling inadequate in this situation?

User: I think my background plays a big role. Coming from a poor family, I feel I have to prove myself, yet I can't seem to do it. It just feels like I'm lagging behind and don’t measure up.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly challenging, Li. It seems like your background adds significant pressure to your current situation. I wonder, how do you think this pressure influences your ability to search for jobs or approach opportunities?

User: I guess I might be too focused on getting a job that pays well right away, instead of trying to gain any experience first. But it’s hard not to think about the money because I need it so badly.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s common to feel the urgency of financial needs while searching for employment. Let's try to reframe this thought. What if we approached your job search with a focus on gaining experience first, even if the pay might not meet your ideal expectations right away? 

User: I see your point, but it still feels hard to commit to something that doesn't provide enough financial support. I’m just scared of falling further behind.

Consultant: Fear of falling behind is completely valid. However, gaining experience might open up more opportunities for you in the long run. Can we think of some roles that might not pay much but would provide valuable experience?

User: Perhaps internships or volunteer positions? Though I’m worried that they’ll take up my time without any financial return.

Consultant: That's a logical concern. However, could these positions also serve to build your network or skill set, which might lead to better job offers later? Let’s explore how we can balance your need for immediate income with opportunities for growth.

User: I hadn’t thought about it that way! If I could just get my foot in the door somehow, it might help in the future. 

Consultant: Exactly! Getting that initial experience could certainly lead to better options down the line. Now, thinking about your situation, what small steps do you feel comfortable taking to explore such opportunities?

User: Maybe I could start looking into local internships or projects related to my field. I could also try reaching out to my professors for recommendations. 

Consultant: Those sound like excellent first steps! Connecting with professors can really help you tap into resources that you might not have considered. How does that make you feel, thinking about these actionable steps?

User: I feel a bit relieved. It feels more manageable now that I have some specific steps to consider.

Consultant: That’s great to hear, Li! It seems like breaking it down into smaller tasks has helped reduce some of your anxiety. Let’s also talk about how you can maintain a positive mindset through this process. How do you typically handle setbacks?

User: I tend to get really discouraged and want to give up when things don’t go my way. 

Consultant: That’s understandable, but perhaps we can work on some strategies to address those feelings when they arise. What might be a helpful way for you to cope when you experience disappointment?

User: I think talking about my feelings with friends or even journaling might help. I just need to remind myself that setbacks are part of the process.

Consultant: Absolutely! Having that support system and reflecting on your experiences can be very powerful. Can we brainstorm some positive affirmations or reminders you could tell yourself during tough moments to help you stay focused on your goals?

User: Maybe something like "Every experience is a step forward" or "It's okay to take my time." 

Consultant: Those are fantastic reminders, Li. They serve as a great way to counter those negative self-thoughts. Moving forward, how do you feel about integrating these affirmations into your daily routine?

User: It feels good to have something to rely on during challenging times. I can try repeating them to myself when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Consistently practicing these affirmations can really help reinforce a more positive mindset. Before we finish today, let’s recap the steps you’ve decided to take going forward.

User: I’ll explore internships and projects, reach out to my professors, and use affirmations to help manage my feelings.

Consultant: Those are excellent steps, Li. It seems like you are taking proactive actions that can empower you moving forward. Remember, setbacks happen to everyone, but what matters is how we respond to them. 

User: Thank you! This has helped me feel less trapped and more hopeful about the future.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Li! It's always a pleasure to see you progress. Remember, it’s okay to seek help when navigating these challenges. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need further support. 

User: I will. Thank you for your guidance today!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, Li. Looking forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you're here today. I understand you've been trying to explore career guidance recently. How have you been feeling about that?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really uncertain and anxious about my future lately. I reached out for some career guidance, but I haven't seen any significant improvement. It's tough to shake off these feelings of self-doubt.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel uncertain, especially when looking at your future. Can you tell me more about your experience with the career guidance you've sought? What specific aspects have been challenging for you?

User: Well, I spoke to a couple of advisors, but their advice felt vague. They mentioned different career options, but I still don't know what suits me best. I can’t help but feel overwhelmed by it all.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like the guidance wasn't as clear as you hoped it would be. What do you envision as a clear direction for your career? What would help you feel more confident in your choice?

User: I think I just want to know what jobs might actually be a good fit for my skills and interests. I want to avoid making the wrong choice, but it’s hard to map out a plan when I'm still unsure.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. It can be really daunting to think about making such an important decision without clarity. How do you feel when you think about potentially pursuing a career? Is there any particular field you're interested in?

User: I guess I’ve always been interested in helping others, maybe something in social work or education. But then I worry I won’t be good enough, or that I won’t be able to support myself financially.

Consultant: It's understandable to have concerns about your abilities and financial stability, especially with your background. Let’s explore those interests further. What strengths or skills do you think you have that could relate to those fields?

User: I think I'm a good listener and empathetic, which could help in social work. But I still feel insecure about whether that's enough to succeed.

Consultant: Those are valuable strengths to have in social work! It's important to recognize them. Can you recall a time when you helped someone or demonstrated those qualities, and how it made you feel?

User: I once helped a friend who was going through a tough time. I listened to him, and it felt good to be there for him. But I still feel like that’s not enough for a career.

Consultant: That sounds like a meaningful experience, and it's wonderful that you could be there for your friend. Let's challenge the belief that it's not enough. What evidence do you have that listening and empathy aren’t valuable skills in a profession?

User: I don’t know. I guess I just think of all the qualifications I lack compared to others who might have more experience.

Consultant: It's easy to focus on what we feel we lack. However, every journey begins somewhere. Others may also feel overwhelmed or insecure at times. If you were advising someone else in your position, what would you tell them about their skills and worthiness?

User: I’d probably say that everyone starts somewhere and that they shouldn’t underestimate their abilities. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to practice that same compassion toward yourself. Let’s think about some actionable steps you can take to build your confidence and explore your interests further. What small action could you take to engage with your interest in social work or education?

User: Maybe I could volunteer somewhere related to social work? That could help me gain some experience and see if it feels like a good fit.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Volunteering can provide valuable insight and experience. How do you feel about reaching out to local organizations to explore those opportunities?

User: I think I could do that. It seems less daunting when I think of it as just trying it out rather than committing to a career right away.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! It’s about exploring and gaining experience, not making a lifelong commitment right away. How might you stay motivated and keep yourself accountable while exploring these opportunities?

User: I could set some small goals for myself, like reaching out to at least two organizations each week and keeping track of my experiences.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan, Li. Setting specific goals can help keep you focused. As we wrap up today, do you feel more clarity about your next steps toward exploring your career interests?

User: Yes, I do. I feel relieved to have a plan and not just be stuck in indecision. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember to lean into those strengths you have, and don’t hesitate to share your experiences with me in our next session. I believe in your potential, and I look forward to hearing how your exploration goes!
###################
Consultant: Hello Li! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've actually been feeling quite good. Joining those club activities has helped me build some confidence. I even managed to introduce myself to a few new people!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're noticing some positive changes in your social interactions. What do you think contributed to that increase in confidence?

User: I think being part of those activities made me feel more included, and it was reassuring to see that others were welcoming. It felt nice to finally connect with people.

Consultant: That's an excellent observation! Connection often helps alleviate feelings of isolation. Can you tell me more about a specific moment during these activities where you felt particularly confident?

User: Sure! There was this one meeting where I had to introduce myself to the group. I was nervous, but once I started speaking, I felt a rush of confidence. It was empowering!

Consultant: Fantastic! That sounds like a significant achievement. How did you feel leading up to that introduction? What thoughts were going through your mind?

User: I was definitely anxious before speaking, worrying that I might stumble or that people would judge me. But once I began, it was like those thoughts faded away.

Consultant: That's a valuable insight. It seems like the anxiety was present but didn’t hold you back. Let’s reflect on that moment. When those anxious thoughts appeared, how did you manage to push through?

User: I just remembered that everyone else was also there to learn and connect. I thought that they probably weren’t focused on me as much as I feared.

Consultant: Great strategy! Recognizing that everyone shares similar feelings can really shift your perspective. Have you had any other experiences in these activities where you felt your confidence was tested?

User: Yes, after that introduction, I joined a group discussion. At first, I hesitated to speak up, but then I reminded myself of the positive feedback I got from my introduction.

Consultant: It sounds like you applied the same positive thinking! How did it feel to speak up in that discussion after overcoming your initial hesitation?

User: It felt amazing! I was able to contribute some ideas, and people seemed to appreciate my input. It boosted my confidence even more.

Consultant: That's incredible to hear! You’re building a positive feedback loop for yourself. Let's think about your next steps. Would you be open to setting a small goal for your next interaction in these social settings?

User: Yes, I think setting a goal would help. Maybe I could aim to speak up at least twice in the next meeting.

Consultant: That's a fantastic goal! Speaking up twice will help you reinforce that sense of confidence. How do you plan to remind yourself to do this?

User: I can write a note to myself before the meeting, reminding me of the positive experiences I've had and the support from others.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Having a tangible reminder can really help. As we approach the end of our session, how do you feel about your journey so far?

User: I'm feeling much more optimistic. I didn’t expect to gain this much confidence in such a short time.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! We’ve seen some impressive progress. As we wrap up today, what strategies do you think you’ll use to maintain and build on this confidence moving forward?

User: I'll focus on practicing self-affirmations and continue putting myself in social situations. I think it's really helping.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, each step you take reinforces that growth. I’m excited to see how you progress in your next session. If you ever feel overwhelmed, remember to reach out for support.

User: Thank you for all your help! I really appreciate it.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li! It's been a pleasure to work with you, and I’m looking forward to our next session. Keep believing in yourself!
###################
Consultant: Hello Li! I'm really glad to see you today. It sounds like you’re feeling more confident with the internships you've secured. How has your week been since we last spoke?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel much better. The internships have given me a boost, and I've started sharing my experiences with my family. It's nice to feel like I'm progressing.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like sharing your experiences is helping strengthen your confidence. What kind of feedback have you received from your family about your internships?

User: They seemed surprised and a bit proud, which felt good. But I still sense some hesitation when I talk about my plans for the future.

Consultant: It’s natural for families to have mixed feelings when it comes to changes. How did their reactions make you feel? 

User: I felt happy they were proud, but I also felt a little frustrated because I want them to fully support my plans. I worry they might think I'm getting ahead of myself.

Consultant: I can see how that would be frustrating. Balancing your progress with your family’s expectations can be challenging. What do you think is holding them back from fully supporting you? 

User: I think it's mostly because of our family's financial situation. They probably feel anxious about my future and if I can sustain myself.

Consultant: That makes sense. Financial concerns can evoke a lot of anxiety. Have you had a chance to discuss your thoughts about managing your career independence with them?

User: I’ve tried, but I didn’t get very far. I think they still see me as someone who needs their support rather than someone who can handle things on my own.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Li. It sounds like you're eager to show them your independence, but their perceptions might be holding you back a bit. How would it feel to establish a clearer picture of your future plans to share with them?

User: I think it would help a lot. If I can show them I’ve thought about things and have a plan, maybe they’d feel more at ease.

Consultant: Planning that out sounds like a solid approach. What are some key elements of this plan that you think would reassure them?

User: I could outline my career goals, explain the steps I’m taking with these internships, and even mention my financial planning.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Having concrete details can help alleviate their worries. Would it be helpful to rehearse how you might present this to them?

User: Yes, I think that would be really beneficial. I want to make sure I communicate it well.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s think through what you want to say. Maybe we can start with expressing gratitude for their support, then share your achievements and your thoughtful plan for the future?

User: That sounds good. I like the idea of starting with appreciation.

Consultant: Great! What’s something specific you could say to show them you value their support?

User: I could say something like, “I wouldn’t be where I am today without your encouragement, and I want to share my plans so that you feel involved.”

Consultant: That’s a lovely sentiment, Li. It shows respect for their role while also opening up a dialogue about your progress. How do you think they would respond to that?

User: I hope they would feel happier and more involved, which could ease some of their worries.

Consultant: Definitely! By including them in your journey, it might help them feel more secure about your independence. How are you feeling about this conversation so far?

User: I feel more motivated to approach them. Having a plan really helps.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! As you prepare for this talk, remember to keep reflecting on their feelings as well as your own. Is there anything else you feel you need to focus on as we work through this together?

User: I think I need to work on boosting my confidence even more. Sometimes, doubts creep in when I think about my future.

Consultant: Building confidence can be a gradual process. What are some ways you've reinforced your self-belief in the past?

User: Helping others, participating in group activities, or just reminding myself that I've come this far helps a lot.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Engaging socially and recalling your achievements can reinforce your confidence. Would you like to incorporate these into your plan for this week?

User: Yes, I think that would help. I want to keep that positive mindset.

Consultant: That’s a great commitment, Li! Let’s set a goal for you to connect with friends or peers who uplift you, along with preparing for your family conversation. 

User: Sounds like a plan! I’ll also jot down my achievements to remind myself of my progress.

Consultant: Perfect! Remember that you’re not alone in this journey. It’s a testament to your growth that you’re ready to take these steps.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’m feeling more equipped to handle these conversations.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li! I’m proud of your progress, and I’m confident you’ll have a constructive discussion with your family. Remember, we can always revisit this topic next time. 

User: I’ll definitely keep that in mind. I’m looking forward to sharing how it went!

Consultant: Absolutely! I’m looking forward to hearing about it. Let’s keep on reinforcing that growth mindset, and I wish you a successful week ahead!

User: Thank you! I’ll do my best. See you next time!

Consultant: See you next time, Li! Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you back for today's session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite stable actually. Completing my internship helped me understand my career direction better, and my family has been supportive, which is nice.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like you've made some solid progress in clarifying your career path. What specific aspects of your career planning would you like to focus on today?

User: I want to make sure I'm on the right track. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the options out there, and I just want to confirm my choices.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel overwhelmed with choices, especially when there are so many paths to consider. Can you tell me about the options you’re considering and what appeals to you about them?

User: Well, I'm thinking about pursuing a career in marketing or maybe project management. I like the idea of working with teams to create something impactful.

Consultant: Those sound like promising options! What did you enjoy the most during your internship that might relate to these fields?

User: I really enjoyed collaborating with others on projects and seeing our ideas come to life. It felt rewarding to contribute to something larger.

Consultant: That's a valuable experience! It seems teamwork and project execution resonate with you. How does that align with your vision for your career?

User: I think I want to leverage my creativity and leadership skills. I feel like I can bring people together and drive projects effectively.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! How can you harness those skills in your career planning? What steps do you think you could take next to pursue your goals?

User: I suppose I could look for more internships specifically in those areas, or maybe seek out mentorship from professionals in marketing or project management.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Gaining more experience will definitely help solidify your career direction. How do you feel about reaching out to potential mentors or applying for internships?

User: I’m a bit nervous about reaching out to professionals. What if they don’t respond or if I don’t make a good impression?

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about that. Remember, reaching out is a learning opportunity in itself. How might you reframe that thought to feel more empowered in this process?

User: I guess I could think of it as seeking advice rather than trying to impress someone. It’s more about learning than being perfect.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic reframe! Focusing on the learning aspect can make the process feel less daunting. Would you like to set a timeline for reaching out to mentors or applying for internships?

User: Yes, that sounds good. Maybe I could aim to reach out to at least two mentors by the end of next week? 

Consultant: That sounds like a reasonable goal! Setting a deadline can help you stay accountable. What steps will you take to prepare before reaching out to them?

User: I should probably create a resume and a brief introduction about myself. I could also think of some questions to ask them.

Consultant: Great! Preparing a resume and questions can make you feel more confident. Do you feel well-equipped to create those materials, or would you like to discuss them further?

User: I believe I can manage that, but I'd appreciate any tips on writing a good introduction.

Consultant: Absolutely! A good introduction should be concise yet engaging. You might want to include what you're studying, your interests in the field, and what you're hoping to learn from them. Does that seem helpful?

User: Yes, I think I can do that! Keeping it simple sounds best.

Consultant: Exactly! Simple and honest often resonates well. As you work on this, how do you feel about the progress you're making toward your career goals?

User: I feel more motivated, actually. It feels good to have a plan and take concrete steps.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, taking action, even in small steps, strengthens your confidence. Is there anything else you'd like to explore regarding your career planning today?

User: I think I’ve covered most of it. Just feeling a bit more reassured about my choices now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It sounds like you’ve made significant progress in your confidence and goals. Let’s recap what you’ll focus on moving forward. 

User: Sure! I’ll reach out to mentors, apply for internships, and prepare my resume and introduction.

Consultant: Exactly! Keep in mind that it’s a journey, and it’s okay to adjust your steps along the way. You’re doing great work, Li. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m glad to have supported you. Before we finish, is there anything you’d like to add or any questions you have about our sessions or your journey?

User: No, I think I’m all set. Looking forward to our next session!

Consultant: Me too! I believe in your ability to navigate this path. Take care, and I’ll see you next time!
