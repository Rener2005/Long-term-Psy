Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you could make it today. I’d like to start our session by discussing how you’ve been feeling recently. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling pretty low and anxious. With graduation approaching and all the assessments piling up, I can't shake the feeling of uncertainty about my future. I often find myself reflecting on my past failures in exams, and it’s really weighing me down.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like the pressure of upcoming assessments and memories of past setbacks are contributing to your feelings of anxiety and depression. Can you tell me more about how these thoughts specifically affect your daily life?

User: I often feel overwhelmed and find it hard to focus on anything, including my studies. It’s like this cloud of negativity hangs over me, and I can’t see a way out.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It seems like these thoughts are not only affecting your motivation but also your ability to concentrate. What do you think those thoughts say about you or your situation?

User: They make me feel like I’m not good enough, like I’ll never succeed. I compare myself to my peers and feel that I don’t measure up.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but let’s pause for a moment. You mentioned comparing yourself to others—what specific thoughts go through your mind when you do that?

User: I often think, "Why can’t I achieve what they do?" or "They’re all so capable, and I’m just lost." It makes me feel more alone and defeated.

Consultant: I can see how those comparisons can intensify your feelings of isolation and defeat. In these moments, are there any thoughts you notice that might be distorted or overly negative?

User: Yes, I guess I tend to believe that if I don't do well, it means I'm a failure. It’s like I can’t see any other outcome.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization. It sounds like you’re experiencing a cognitive distortion called "all-or-nothing thinking." How might your perspective change if you considered that achieving success can take various forms?

User: I suppose I could view it as a journey. But it’s hard to shift that mindset, especially when I feel so low.

Consultant: It is a tough shift, but recognizing that journey can be an important step. Let’s explore how you can gradually change this all-or-nothing perspective. What might be one small success you could aim for in the coming days that wouldn't feel overwhelming?

User: Maybe I could set a goal to study for just an hour each day instead of trying to cover everything at once.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic, manageable goal! Focusing on just one hour can help build your confidence. How would you feel after achieving that?

User: I think it would feel good, like I accomplished something, even if it’s just a small step.

Consultant: Exactly! Celebrating those small victories is crucial. Remember, progress doesn’t need to be massive; it just needs to be consistent. How about we discuss some strategies to help you stay focused during that hour and combat those feelings of anxiety?

User: Sure, I’d like that. I want to do whatever I can to feel less overwhelmed.

Consultant: One technique could be to create a dedicated study environment free from distractions. Do you have a specific space where you feel you can concentrate better?

User: I have a small desk in my room, but it often turns messy and cluttered.

Consultant: Organizing your study space could significantly improve your focus. How about reserving a short time each day to tidy it up before studying? A clear environment can promote a clearer mind.

User: That makes sense. I’ll try to keep my desk tidy; it might help me feel more in control.

Consultant: Great! Another approach to consider is planning short breaks while studying. When you study for that hour, allowing yourself small breaks can help refresh your mind. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds helpful. I often sit there too long and then feel burnt out.

Consultant: Taking breaks can help prevent burnout and make your study time more productive. When you're on a break, maybe you could do something relaxing, like reading poetry or taking a short walk. Do you think that would help?

User: Yes, definitely! I love poetry, and it helps me escape for a while.

Consultant: Exactly! Engaging in activities you enjoy can replenish your energy. So, as we wrap up today, let’s reflect on these strategies. What steps do you feel ready to take this week?

User: I’ll work on keeping my desk tidy, setting a daily study hour, and taking breaks to read poetry.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Remember, it’s all about making small changes and being kind to yourself during this process. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel a bit lighter, actually. It’s nice to talk about these things and feel supported.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You're taking steps in the right direction. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time we meet. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need support before then!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're here today. Before we begin, I’d like to understand how you’ve been feeling lately. What’s on your mind?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling quite down. I recently met some old classmates, and it made me realize how far behind I feel compared to them. It just reinforces my insecurities, and I don't even want to talk to anyone.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like seeing your classmates brought up a lot of self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy. Can you tell me more about those feelings? What thoughts crossed your mind during that meeting?

User: I kept thinking about how they all have jobs and are doing well. I felt like I failed in comparison. It's like I don’t measure up at all.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable to feel that way when comparing yourself to others. It seems like these thoughts are bringing you down. What emotions did those thoughts provoke in you?

User: I felt sad and frustrated, mainly because I don’t know what to do next in my life. It’s exhausting.

Consultant: It sounds exhausting indeed. Your feelings of sadness and frustration are valid. Let’s explore how these comparisons to your classmates affect your self-worth. Do you find that these thoughts happen frequently?

User: Yes, they do. Whenever I see someone from my past, I can't help but think about how they are ahead of me. It's like a cycle I can't break out of.

Consultant: Recognizing that cycle is an important first step. Let’s think about the specific thoughts that drive those feelings. What thoughts do you catch yourself thinking when you feel this way?

User: I often think, “I should be where they are,” or “I’ve failed to achieve anything worthwhile.” 

Consultant: Those thoughts really sound heavy. Let's challenge those a bit. What evidence do you have that supports those thoughts? Are there any counterexamples in your life that suggest otherwise?

User: Well, I’ve always loved writing and have been writing poetry and stories. But I can’t seem to get anywhere with it.

Consultant: That’s a valuable and creative pursuit! It seems there’s more to you than just your job status. Could you shift your focus to your passion for writing? How does that make you feel about yourself?

User: I feel better when I think about my writing. It’s just that sometimes I wonder if it’s worth anything if I’m not getting published or recognized.

Consultant: Your passion for writing is indeed worth something, even if it’s not recognized in the traditional sense. Many writers face difficulties before they find success. What if you viewed your writing as a personal accomplishment, regardless of external validation?

User: That sounds nice, but it’s hard to let go of the feeling of needing approval. It’s been ingrained in me for so long.

Consultant: I understand that letting go of ingrained beliefs can be challenging. It might help to think of your writing as a form of self-expression. If a close friend were to face the same doubt about their passion, what would you say to them?

User: I would probably tell them to keep writing for themselves and not worry about what others think. 

Consultant: That’s a compassionate mindset! Applying that same advice to yourself could foster a healthier relationship with your art. Let’s also consider other ways you can nurture your self-worth outside of comparisons. Have you thought about setting personal goals for your writing?

User: I haven't really set any goals. I usually just write when I feel like it.

Consultant: Setting small, achievable goals can provide you with a sense of accomplishment and help you focus on your progress. What if you set a goal to write for a certain amount of time each week, regardless of the outcome?

User: That could work. It feels less pressured that way. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Smaller goals can make things feel much more manageable. Additionally, exploring new social interactions—perhaps joining a writing group—could also help build your confidence. How does that idea resonate with you?

User: I think joining a group could be good, but I’m worried about meeting new people.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious about new social situations. Starting small, like attending an online group, might ease you into it. Remember, each step you take is progress. What do you think about trying that?

User: I might be willing to try an online group. It does feel less intimidating.

Consultant: That’s a great step forward! Also, think about how you'll acknowledge your feelings about setbacks when they come up. How will you reassure yourself when those feelings of inadequacy return?

User: I could remind myself of my writing passion and that everyone has their journey. Maybe reflect on the progress I’ve made too.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Building that self-reassurance will be key as you navigate through social comparisons. As we wrap up today, what key takeaway do you have from our discussion?

User: I think I need to focus more on my own journey and less on comparing myself to others. And I need to give myself permission to enjoy writing without pressure.

Consultant: That's an excellent takeaway! I believe embracing your journey and creativity will help you foster a healthier self-esteem. We can explore more strategies for managing comparisons and enhancing your self-worth in our next session if you’d like. 

User: That would be really helpful. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, each small step counts, and I'm here to support you on this journey. I look forward to our next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been struggling a lot lately. I tried applying for some part-time jobs, but I keep getting rejected, and it's really affecting my mood. I feel so helpless and frustrated.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds really tough to face those rejections, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed. Can you share more about how these experiences have affected your self-esteem or motivation?

User: Well, every rejection feels like a blow to my confidence. I start to doubt my abilities and wonder if I’ll ever find something suitable. I feel like I’m not good enough.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way after facing setbacks. You’re looking for validation and success, and those failures can feel like they undermine your worth. Let’s take a moment to see if we can identify some of the thoughts that come to your mind during these moments of rejection. What do you usually tell yourself?

User: I keep thinking that maybe I'm not skilled enough or that I’m not meant to succeed. It’s like these thoughts just loop in my mind.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy to bear. It sounds like you might be caught in a cycle of negative thinking. Have you noticed how these thoughts make you feel emotionally? 

User: Yes, they definitely make me feel more anxious and defeated. It’s like I lose hope and start to feel exhausted just thinking about it.

Consultant: It sounds really draining. Let’s explore this a bit further—can you think of any evidence that supports those thoughts, and also, any evidence that contradicts them? 

User: I guess I do have some skills, but when I get rejected, it overshadows those achievements. 

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight. It’s easy for our minds to focus on the negative, especially after setbacks. If you had a friend in your situation, how would you advise them to view their skills and experiences?

User: I would probably tell them to remember their strengths and to keep trying, but I find it hard to do that for myself.

Consultant: That’s a common struggle! It’s easier to see the positive in others. Let’s work on flipping that perspective for yourself. What are some specific strengths or achievements you can remind yourself of that could help build your confidence?

User: I’ve always had a good command of language, and I love writing. I’ve received positive feedback on my poetry and stories from others before.

Consultant: Those are wonderful strengths! Writing can be a powerful outlet, and it’s fantastic that you've received positive feedback. Could we explore how you can use your writing to regain some sense of control and purpose during this time?

User: I suppose I could write more, maybe even share it to get more feedback. It could help me focus on something I love.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful idea! Engaging with something that brings you joy can be quite therapeutic. We could also think about setting small, achievable goals related to your writing. What do you think about starting with that?

User: Yes, setting small goals seems manageable. I think I'll try to write a piece a week and maybe post it somewhere.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! It will not only give you something to work towards but also help to build your confidence as you express yourself. How do you feel about using this writing project as a way to measure small successes, regardless of job applications?

User: I think that could really help. It would be something positive to focus on instead of just the rejections.

Consultant: Exactly! By placing emphasis on your writing, you can buffer some of that emotional weight. Plus, this could also offer a new avenue for networking or even job opportunities if you share your work. 

User: I hadn’t thought about that! That sounds encouraging.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! As you engage more with your writing, let’s also talk about how to deal with feelings of anxiety or discouragement when they arise. What strategies have worked for you in the past?

User: I usually go for a walk or read something uplifting. It helps me clear my mind a bit.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies! Physical activity and uplifting readings can be excellent ways to shift your mood. We can incorporate them into our sessions as well. Would you be open to scheduling some time for those activities while we continue to work on your goals?

User: Yes, I’d love that. It’s nice to have a plan and something to look forward to.

Consultant: That sounds great! As we wrap up today’s session, let’s recap the small goals: you will write a piece each week and use walking or uplifting reading as tools to manage any anxiety. How does that sound to you? 

User: I feel more optimistic about it now. I think I can manage those goals.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. We can check in on how those strategies worked next time. You’re doing important work by focusing on your strengths. 

User: Thank you, that means a lot to me.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress. Remember, you have the tools to work through this, and I believe in your journey. Take care and see you next time! 

User: I will! Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It’s great to see you again. I’m glad to hear you received positive feedback on your writing project. How are you feeling about that experience?

User: Hello! Yes, I felt really good about the positive feedback, but at the same time, I’m still worried about my future. I feel anxious sometimes when I think about where I’m headed in life.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel anxious about the future, especially after a positive experience like yours. Let’s explore that anxiety a bit more. What specific aspects of the future do you find most concerning?

User: I guess I worry about my career path and whether I’ll be able to build a stable life for myself. Sometimes I feel like I’m falling behind compared to my peers.

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like you’re feeling a lot of pressure to catch up with others. Let's discuss this. When you think about your peers and their progress, what thoughts come to mind?

User: I often think that they are all doing much better than me. I sometimes feel like I’m not good enough or that I’ll never find my place in the world.

Consultant: That must be really tough to deal with. It seems like those thoughts are affecting how you view yourself and your potential. What emotions do these thoughts bring up for you?

User: They make me feel really sad and discouraged. I sometimes just want to give up on everything because it feels overwhelming.

Consultant: It’s definitely challenging when those feelings arise. Let’s try to identify some specific thoughts you have that contribute to this sense of being overwhelmed. Can you recall an automatic thought that crosses your mind when you’re feeling this way?

User: I often think, "I’ll never find a job I love" or "I’m just not capable enough." Those thoughts make me feel really helpless.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy. It’s understandable that they create feelings of helplessness. Let’s consider if there’s any evidence that supports or challenges these thoughts. Can you think of any experiences that contradict those negative beliefs?

User: Well, my recent success with writing shows that I can do something well. But I just feel like that’s not enough.

Consultant: It’s great that you’ve recognized your success in writing! That’s a significant achievement. Let’s ask ourselves, what would you say to a friend who had similar thoughts about not being enough despite their achievements?

User: I would probably tell them that they should celebrate their successes and that everyone has their own path. 

Consultant: That’s a loving perspective to offer! Now, how could you apply that same kindness to yourself? What might be a more balanced way to view your achievements and your journey?

User: I could remind myself that writing is a step forward and that it’s okay not to have everything figured out right now.

Consultant: Exactly! Allowing yourself to acknowledge your achievements while giving yourself grace in uncertainty is crucial. Let’s work on setting some small, short-term goals to build your confidence further. What’s one achievable goal related to your writing or career that you could focus on in the coming weeks?

User: Maybe I could challenge myself to write a short story and submit it to a small online magazine. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful goal! It’s specific and actionable. What steps do you think you’ll need to take to achieve this goal?

User: I guess I’ll need to brainstorm some ideas, carve out time to write, and research magazines that accept submissions.

Consultant: Those are great steps to take! Making a plan can really help alleviate some of that anxiety. How do you feel about having a timeline for this goal? 

User: I think having a timeline would help keep me motivated and accountable. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Setting a timeline can reinforce your commitment to your goal. How about we establish a timeline together? When would you like to submit your story?

User: I could aim to submit it in about a month. That gives me some time to think and write.

Consultant: Perfect! So, aiming for a month gives you time to create and reflect. Let’s talk about how you can manage any anxiety that arises while you pursue this goal. What strategies have you found helpful in the past for managing anxious thoughts?

User: Sometimes I like to take a walk or read to clear my head. 

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Managing anxiety through physical movement and engaging with literature can be very grounding. Could you plan to incorporate one or both of these strategies regularly as you work towards your goal?

User: Yes, I can definitely add those into my schedule! 

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Making time for activities you enjoy can be very beneficial. As we wrap up for today, let's reflect on how you can maintain this positive momentum. What action can you take this week to stay connected to your goal of submitting your story?

User: I will set aside some time each day to brainstorm and write, along with planning a walk afterwards to refresh my mind.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I’m really proud of what you’re working towards. As we conclude our session today, how do you feel about the progress you’re making in recognizing your strengths and pursuing your writing goals?

User: I feel more hopeful than before. I’ve got a plan now, and I think I can really do this!

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about taking those small steps and recognizing your achievements along the way. If you ever feel overwhelmed, just recall the positive experiences you’ve had. I’m here to support you, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support and understanding. I’m excited to share my journey with you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you could join me today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better, actually. After that deep conversation with my old friend, I felt a bit more understood and supported. But I’m still struggling with my confidence in social situations.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you felt some support from your friend. That can be really helpful. Can you tell me more about those social situations where you feel less confident?

User: Well, when I'm around new people or even some acquaintances, I often feel anxious and worry that I won't know what to say. I hate that feeling.

Consultant: I completely understand. It's natural to feel anxious in those situations, especially when you’re concerned about making a good impression. What specifically do you think makes you worry about what to say?

User: I guess I fear that I might say something awkward or that people won’t be interested in talking to me. It makes me want to avoid socializing altogether.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. Avoiding those situations can seem easier, but it might also be holding you back from making connections. What do you think would help you feel more comfortable in those interactions?

User: I think I need to practice talking to people more, but I’m not sure how to start. Sometimes, just initiating a conversation feels overwhelming.

Consultant: That’s a good insight. Practicing can definitely help build your confidence. How about we create some small steps that you can take to start conversations in a more manageable way?

User: That could work. I think if I had a few simple ideas, it would be less intimidating.

Consultant: Great! One approach is to focus on asking open-ended questions. For example, if you're at a gathering, you could ask someone what they do for fun. What do you think about that?

User: That sounds doable! I usually just stick to small talk like the weather.

Consultant: Small talk is a good starting point, but open-ended questions can lead to deeper conversations. How might you feel if you were able to create a more engaging dialogue?

User: I think it would feel better and more enjoyable. But I worry I might run out of things to say after the first question.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to worry about that. One technique is to listen actively and respond to what the other person says. This can help keep the conversation flowing. Does that sound like something you can try?

User: Yes, I think if I focus on listening, I might feel less pressure to come up with new topics. 

Consultant: Exactly! Listening can help ease that pressure. What’s one situation you might be facing soon where you could apply this practice?

User: I have a family gathering coming up. I could try it out there.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic opportunity! What specific open-ended question do you think you would ask at the gathering?

User: Maybe I could ask my cousin about her recent trip. She loves to travel, and I think it could lead to a nice conversation.

Consultant: Perfect choice! That sounds like a great way to connect. How do you feel about this approach moving forward?

User: I feel optimistic. It seems more achievable than I thought before.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! How about we also think of ways to celebrate your successes after the gathering, no matter how small they are?

User: I could treat myself to a nice dessert or something after if I feel like I made some progress.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely idea! It’s great to reward yourself for trying. Would it help to set a small goal for how many conversations you’d like to have at the gathering?

User: Yes, I think starting with just one meaningful conversation feels right. 

Consultant: That’s a very manageable goal. Remember to be kind to yourself, no matter the outcome. How are you feeling about your ability to meet this goal?

User: I feel more confident knowing I have a plan. It doesn’t seem so daunting anymore.

Consultant: I'm happy to hear that you feel more confident! Reflecting on our discussion today, what do you think is your biggest takeaway?

User: I think it’s knowing that small steps can lead to bigger changes in my social skills, and that it’s okay to take those small steps.

Consultant: Absolutely, every step counts. You've shown a willingness to improve, and that’s commendable. As we wrap up today, how can you keep this positive momentum going?

User: I plan to make notes of what we talked about and remind myself to stay open. I want to keep practicing.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. I'm excited to hear about your experiences next time. Remember, you have the tools to continue this growth. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and feel ready to tackle this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been wonderful to see your progress. I look forward to our next session together. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. How are you feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more positive lately. The volunteer work helped me realize how meaningful life can be, but I still sometimes struggle with self-doubt.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant step forward for you! It’s wonderful to hear that you've found some peace and meaning. Can you tell me more about how you feel when you engage in volunteer work?

User: When I'm helping others, I feel a sense of purpose. It’s like I forget my worries for a moment. But once I’m back home, those feelings of self-doubt creep back in.

Consultant: It’s great that you experience such fulfillment during those moments. It’s totally normal for old feelings to resurface afterwards. Let’s explore this self-doubt a bit more. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you feel that way at home?

User: I often think that I'm not good enough, especially compared to others who seem to have their lives figured out. I feel like I’m just drifting.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable to feel that way sometimes. Let’s try to challenge those thoughts together. Can you identify any evidence that shows you are good enough or have made progress?

User: I guess I’ve been volunteering and trying to connect with people. That has to count for something, right?

Consultant: Absolutely! Those actions show initiative and strength. It’s essential to recognize and acknowledge your achievements. How does considering your volunteering make you feel?

User: It makes me feel proud, actually! I just wish that pride could overshadow my self-doubt all the time.

Consultant: That’s a positive insight! We can work on finding ways to amplify those feelings of pride. Would you be open to setting some small goals related to your volunteering or personal interests?

User: Yes, I think setting goals would help me feel more focused and less lost.

Consultant: That sounds like a terrific idea! Let's brainstorm some specific, achievable goals together. What are some activities or interests you would like to incorporate more regularly into your life?

User: I love reading poetry and novels, and I’ve always wanted to write some of my own. Maybe I could set a goal to write a poem each week?

Consultant: Writing a poem each week sounds like a wonderful goal! It aligns beautifully with your interests. How do you feel about sharing your poems with others, perhaps in a group or online?

User: Sharing them sounds a bit scary, but it could also be exciting. That might help me connect with people, right?

Consultant: Exactly! It can be a way to build connections and receive feedback, enhancing your sense of community. Remember, taking little steps can help build your confidence. Would you like to explore how to gradually share your work?

User: Yes, I think starting small might be the way to go. Maybe just sharing with a close friend first?

Consultant: That’s a perfect first step! Sharing with a friend can be a safe way to gain confidence. What would you need to feel prepared to share your first poem with them?

User: I guess I just need to complete one poem that I feel good about. A friend’s encouragement would also help.

Consultant: Great plan! How about we check in on your poem progress in our next session? In the meantime, perhaps you could reflect on your feelings as you write and share those with me next time.

User: That sounds really good. I’ll work on that. I hope it helps me feel more accomplished.

Consultant: I believe it will! It’s all about recognizing your growth and abilities. Remember, you’re capable of amazing things. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today before we wrap up?

User: I think we've covered a lot. I feel more motivated now. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’re making. Just keep nurturing those positive feelings and remember to celebrate each step forward. Looking forward to hearing about your poems next time!

User: Me too! Thank you again for your support. See you next time!

Consultant: Take care! See you at our next session!
