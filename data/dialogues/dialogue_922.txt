Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm glad you decided to come for this session. I’d love to hear more about what you’re currently feeling and experiencing.

User: Hi. I just feel so overwhelmed and hopeless lately. I am really struggling with the pressure of my upcoming exams. I don't even know if I can study or handle it. I’m worried I’ll disappoint my parents.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders, especially with the fear of disappointing your parents. Can you tell me more about what specifically feels overwhelming for you when it comes to studying for these exams?

User: Well, I just can’t seem to concentrate. Every time I sit down to study, my mind goes blank, and I feel this heavy feeling of dread. I just keep thinking that no matter how much I study, it won’t be good enough.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Chen. It's understandable to feel anxious when it seems the pressure is mounting. I'm curious, what kind of thoughts come to your mind that lead to those feelings of dread when you think about studying?

User: I keep thinking that I’ll never pass my exams and that my parents will be disappointed in me. Sometimes I wonder if they’d be better off without me, which makes me feel even worse.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me. It seems like those thoughts about not passing and how your parents might view your situation are really contributing to how you're feeling. Let's take a closer look at those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you won't pass your exams?

User: Well, I haven’t done well in my classes this semester, and I feel like I’ve failed already. It’s hard to think I could turn it around now.

Consultant: I see how that negative experience can make it feel almost impossible to see a way forward. But what about other times you faced challenges? Did you have previous experiences where you were able to overcome similar feelings of failure?

User: I did have a tough semester before, but I managed to bring my grades up with a lot of hard work. It felt good to see improvement, even though it was tough at the time.

Consultant: That's a really positive example, Chen! It sounds like you have the ability to turn things around when you put in effort. How might you apply that same mindset to your current situation with exams?

User: I guess I could try to remind myself that I’ve succeeded before. I should focus on what I can do each day rather than the outcome.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Focusing on daily efforts rather than worrying about the big picture can help reduce some of that pressure. Are there specific study strategies that have helped you in the past, which we can incorporate into your routine now?

User: I’ve found that breaking my study time into smaller chunks and taking breaks helps. But sometimes I just can’t find the motivation to start.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. To help with motivation, we could create a study schedule with manageable tasks and breaks. Would you like to try setting some specific goals for this week’s studying that can keep you on track?

User: Yes, that might help. If I have a plan, I feel like I won’t be so lost.

Consultant: Perfect! We can outline a simple schedule together. How about we start with one subject at a time and include short breaks? What subject do you want to tackle first?

User: I have a math exam coming up, so maybe we can start with that.

Consultant: Great choice! We could plan to study math for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds doable, actually. I think I could manage that without feeling too overwhelmed.

Consultant: Fantastic! Also, remember when you take those breaks, try doing something enjoyable or relaxing. This helps recharge your mind. What could you do during those breaks?

User: I could listen to music or take a short walk. That helps me clear my head.

Consultant: Those are excellent options! Incorporating enjoyable activities during your breaks can help keep your energy up. Now, as you start this new schedule, how do you think you will manage any negative thoughts that might come up about your studying or exams?

User: I’ll try to remind myself that I’ve succeeded before and that worrying doesn’t help. Maybe I could write down my worries and then challenge them?

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Writing it down can help you see those thoughts more objectively. You can then ask yourself if those thoughts hold any truth or if there might be a different perspective to consider. 

User: I like that idea. I’ll try to do that when I feel stressed.

Consultant: That’s a great step forward! Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you've accomplished in this session?

User: I feel like I have a plan to tackle my exams and some tools to manage my anxiety. It feels a bit lighter not having to carry it all alone.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You’ve taken important steps towards understanding and managing your thoughts and feelings. Moving forward, whenever those self-doubts arise, try to recall the strategies we discussed. If you ever need support, I’m here for you.

User: Thank you. I really appreciate your help. It gives me some hope.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Chen! You’ve shown great strength in reaching out for help, and I believe in your ability to navigate this. Until next time, take care of yourself!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm really glad you've decided to reach out today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I'm still feeling pretty lost and overwhelmed. My recent exam didn’t go well, and it just added to my feelings of disappointment. I think I’m really struggling with self-doubt and this pressure to meet my parents' expectations.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly tough, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed with those expectations and the recent exam result weighing on you. Can you tell me more about what exactly was going through your mind when you received your exam results?

User: When I saw the grade, I felt like a failure. It was like all my hard work didn’t matter. I kept thinking that I wouldn’t be able to make my parents proud, and that I’m just not capable enough.

Consultant: It sounds like you experienced a lot of negative thoughts surrounding your exam performance. These thoughts can really impact your feelings of self-worth and abilities. Let's try to explore those thoughts a bit more. What specific thoughts came to your mind when you thought about how your parents would react?

User: I imagined them being disappointed and thinking that I’m wasting their money. I feel so much pressure to do well and make them happy, but I just keep failing.

Consultant: It’s understandable that you feel this way, given the pressure you’re under. Let’s take a moment to evaluate these thoughts. On a scale from 1 to 10, how much evidence do you think supports the idea that your parents would be disappointed based solely on this exam?

User: I’d say it’s around a 7. They always talk about how important grades are, so I feel like it’s a valid concern.

Consultant: That’s a fair point, but let’s also consider other possible perspectives. Have there been times when your parents expressed pride in you despite any setbacks? 

User: Yes, there have been moments. They’ve told me they are proud of my efforts in other areas, like my participation in clubs. But in terms of academics, I think they just focus more on the grades.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that they recognize your efforts elsewhere. This indicates that their expectations might not be as rigid as you perceive. Perhaps we can challenge that negative thought. What would you say to yourself if a friend was in your position and shared similar feelings of self-doubt?

User: I would probably tell them that one bad grade doesn’t define their abilities and that they need to keep trying. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! It highlights that failures can just be a part of the learning process. How might it feel to apply that same kindness to yourself in this situation?

User: It’s hard to imagine, honestly. I’m just so used to being hard on myself.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. It can be difficult to change that inner voice. Let's focus on establishing some small, realistic goals for yourself moving forward. Perhaps something you can accomplish that doesn’t relate directly to exams? 

User: I guess I could aim to set aside some time for a hobby I enjoy, like drawing. That always makes me feel a bit better.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Engaging in activities you enjoy can help relieve some of that pressure. How about we set a goal for you to draw a little each week? This could serve as a nice way to boost your confidence outside of academics.

User: That seems doable. I could try to draw something for a few hours this weekend.

Consultant: Perfect! Small steps can make a big difference. Let’s check in about this next time we talk. In the meantime, how do you feel about practicing some positive self-affirmations related to your worth outside of grades?

User: I’m hesitant, but I see how it could help. 

Consultant: It’s okay to feel hesitant! It often feels strange at first. Perhaps try affirmations like "I am capable in many areas" or "My worth isn’t defined by one test." You might find that it gradually feels easier.

User: I’ll give it a try. I definitely want to work on this self-doubt. 

Consultant: That’s great to hear, Chen! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Would you like to discuss any other particular areas where you feel the pressure, like family expectations?

User: Yeah, I sometimes feel like I’m disappointing them, especially with my major. They wanted me to pursue something else. 

Consultant: Such feelings can create a lot of internal conflict. It’s important to assess what truly aligns with your own interests and values. What would you say is most important for you in choosing your path?

User: I think I want to pursue what makes me happy, even if it’s not what they envisioned.

Consultant: That’s an empowering realization! Taking time to reflect on your happiness and interests can help you build confidence in your choices, regardless of external expectations. 

User: Yeah, that makes sense. I’ve been so focused on what they want that I’ve lost sight of my own desires.

Consultant: It’s easy to do that, especially under pressure. Balancing their expectations with your own feelings might help ease that burden. Would you feel comfortable communicating your own aspirations to them?

User: I think it would be tough, but I know it’s something I need to do eventually. 

Consultant: Taking that step can be daunting, but it could also lead to a deeper understanding for both you and your parents. Encouraging open dialogue may help reduce some of that pressure you’re feeling.

User: I hope so. I just don’t want to let them down.

Consultant: It’s natural to worry about their feelings. However, remember that being true to yourself is just as important. Is there a specific situation or way to approach this conversation that you think might work best for you?

User: Maybe I could start by sharing my recent interests and how they’re making me feel. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Sharing your passion can help them see your perspective. How are you feeling about everything we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel a bit lighter, like I have a plan to work with. 

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! It’s a positive step towards managing those feelings of pressure. Remember, we can always build on this progress in our future sessions. You’re doing great, Chen!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. 

Consultant: Of course! I’m here for you. Let’s meet again next week, and we can see how the drawing and conversations with your parents went. Take care until then!

User: I will! See you next week.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm really glad you're here today. I want to help you navigate your feelings about the recent challenges you’ve been facing. Can you tell me more about what's been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. I’ve just been feeling overwhelmed with my mom’s health issues. I keep worrying about how it's going to affect our family. I feel like I should be doing something, but I don’t know what.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling a lot of pressure related to your family situation. That sense of responsibility can be really heavy. Let’s explore this further—what specific worries do you have regarding your mother’s health?

User: I’m scared that something bad is going to happen to her, like she might not recover. If that happens, I don’t know how I’ll handle it. I feel so helpless.

Consultant: Feeling helpless in the face of uncertain situations can be incredibly difficult. It's understandable to have those fears. Can you identify any specific thoughts that come to your mind when you worry about your mother’s health?

User: I keep thinking that if I don’t do enough, our family will fall apart. I also feel like I can't talk to anyone about this because they won’t understand.

Consultant: It seems like you're carrying a heavy burden of responsibility, and that can lead to feelings of isolation. You mentioned that fear of the family falling apart. Let’s take a moment to examine that thought: what evidence do you have that things will definitely go wrong if you don't take action?

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence; it’s more of a feeling. I just think if I don’t support my mom, who will?

Consultant: It's common to have those kinds of feelings, especially during tough times. But let's challenge that thought a bit: if a friend were in a similar situation, what would you tell them about their fears and feelings of responsibility?

User: I would probably tell them that they're doing their best and it’s not all on them to handle everything. That they should also take care of themselves.

Consultant: That's a very compassionate perspective! It sounds like you recognize the importance of self-care, both for yourself and for those around you. What do you think it would look like for you to take care of yourself right now while dealing with these worries?

User: I think I need to give myself permission to feel these feelings but also engage in activities that make me feel better, like hanging out with friends or going for a walk.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Engaging in activities that uplift you can create a healthier emotional balance. Could we brainstorm some specific activities you might want to try in the coming week to support both your mental health and your family situation?

User: Sure! I’d love to go for a walk in the park and maybe plan a small get-together with friends to just relax and talk.

Consultant: Those both sound like wonderful plans! It’s important to keep a balance. As you work on this, let’s also consider how you can express your feelings to your family. How comfortable do you feel talking to them about your mom’s health and your concerns?

User: I’m really nervous about it. I don’t want to add to their worries, but I also feel a bit alone in this.

Consultant: Sharing your feelings can be a huge relief, even if it feels daunting. It’s natural to want to protect them, but remember, they may not even realize how much you're struggling. What if you started with a small conversation, just expressing your thoughts and feelings gently?

User: That might work. I’ve never really tried talking about it openly before. I usually just keep it to myself.

Consultant: It can be scary to open up, but it can also bring you closer to your family. Let's create a plan: When do you think you could have that conversation with them, and what might be an opening line for you?

User: Maybe I could try talking to my sister this weekend. I might say something like, "I've been feeling a bit anxious about Mom’s health and it's been tough for me."

Consultant: That sounds like a solid approach! Just opening up with honesty can foster understanding and connection. How do you feel about this plan now that we've discussed it?

User: I feel a bit more confident about it. It helps to have a specific approach in mind.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, and you're not alone in this. As we wrap up our session, let’s take a moment to reflect on what you've learned today. What’s one key takeaway that stands out to you?

User: I think it's the importance of sharing my feelings and not carrying all this weight alone. It’s okay to seek support from others.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reaching out and sharing does not only lighten your burden but also strengthens your connections with loved ones. As we move forward, how do you plan to maintain this openness with yourself and others?

User: I’ll make it a point to check in with myself and my feelings regularly, and to remind myself that it’s okay to talk about them.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Acknowledging your feelings is a powerful step towards healing. As we conclude today's session, I want you to remember that you have the tools to face these challenges. If you ever need support, don’t hesitate to reach out. You're making great strides, Chen.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate the support. I feel more hopeful now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm here to support you, and I'm looking forward to hearing how things progress next time. Take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you again. It sounds like you’ve been working on some positive changes. Can you share how you’ve been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling slightly better, but I still struggle with social situations. I try to approach people, but I often feel awkward and worried about what to say.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re feeling a bit better. Social situations can be tough, and it’s normal to feel awkward sometimes. Could you describe a recent interaction that made you feel this way?

User: Last week, I tried talking to a classmate, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I ended up just smiling and nodding, which made me feel even more awkward.

Consultant: That sounds challenging, and it’s understandable to feel anxious in such situations. When you smile and nod without much conversation, how does that affect your feelings about yourself afterwards?

User: I feel embarrassed afterwards. I think it makes me look unfriendly or uninterested, which I don't want.

Consultant: It’s tough to feel that way, especially when you have the intention to connect. Let’s explore this a bit more—what thoughts go through your mind when you start a conversation?

User: I often think that I'll embarrass myself or that the other person won't want to talk to me. It creates a lot of anxiety.

Consultant: Those thoughts can definitely make starting a conversation feel intimidating. What if we tried to identify these negative thoughts together? Can you recall a specific moment when you felt anxious before talking to someone?

User: Yes, before I approached my classmate, I thought, “What if she doesn’t want to talk to me?” That thought made my heart race.

Consultant: That’s a powerful thought. You might be interpreting the situation very negatively. What evidence do you have that she wouldn’t want to talk to you?

User: Well, she seemed busy, but I guess I don’t really know. It was mostly my fear talking.

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s quite common for our fears to lead us to conclusions without sufficient evidence. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about their fears?

User: I’d probably tell them to just try talking anyway, because they might be surprised by how it goes.

Consultant: That’s a kind and supportive perspective. What do you think would happen if you approached a conversation with that mindset, focusing on the potential for a positive interaction?

User: I think I’d feel a little less anxious. It might even make me more willing to say something.

Consultant: Exactly! Shifting to that mindset can really help ease your anxiety. Looking ahead, what small steps can we take in our sessions to help you practice starting conversations?

User: Maybe we could role play some scenarios? That might help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Role-playing is a wonderful idea! It allows us to practice in a safe space. Let’s try a simple scenario where you start a conversation with someone. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I think I’d like to practice talking about a shared class interest.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s imagine you’re approaching a classmate to discuss the last lecture. What would be your opening line?

User: I’d probably say, “Hey, did you understand the part about the assignment in class?”

Consultant: That’s a great start! It’s open-ended and invites them to share their thoughts. How would you feel saying that in real life?

User: I think I’d still feel a bit nervous, but it seems manageable.

Consultant: That’s completely normal! Remember, the goal is to take small steps. How about we set a goal for next week where you try starting a conversation like that?

User: Okay, I can try talking to someone in the next class.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! After your attempt, we can discuss how it went and any thoughts or feelings that came up. How does that sound?

User: Sounds good! I’m feeling a bit excited and scared, but mostly focused on trying.

Consultant: That’s a healthy balance of emotions! It shows you’re ready to step outside your comfort zone. Before we wrap up today, can we reflect on what you’ve learned about your social interactions these past weeks?

User: I’ve learned that I tend to be really hard on myself and that my fears aren’t always true.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! Acknowledging that helps you gain a more realistic view of your interactions. Moving forward, how can you remind yourself of this insight when you feel anxious?

User: I could write it down somewhere to remind me before I interact with someone.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Keeping a reminder can help you remember your strengths. As we conclude today, how are you feeling overall about your progress?

User: I feel hopeful! I think I can work on my conversations and social confidence.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Remember, each step you take is a part of your journey. I’m looking forward to hearing about your experience next time. You’re doing wonderful work!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’ll see you next week!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Chen! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling much better. Working with the volunteer organization has really helped me see my value and feel more positive. I'm now trying to hold onto that feeling.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like helping others has made a significant impact on your self-perception. What are some specific moments or achievements from your volunteering that made you feel particularly good?

User: There was this one day when we organized a fundraiser for a local charity. Seeing people come together and knowing I played a part in that felt amazing. It made me feel like I'm contributing something meaningful.

Consultant: That's a fantastic example! It seems like being involved in the fundraiser has reinforced your sense of purpose. How did that experience affect your overall mood in the following days?

User: After the event, I felt really uplifted. It was the first time in a long time that I felt like I had made a difference. I noticed I was smiling more and even felt less anxious.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that! Positive experiences like that can have such a powerful effect. Have you been able to keep that positive momentum going since then?

User: I’ve tried! I’ve been volunteering more often, and I’m making an effort to connect with my classmates. But sometimes I still feel this lingering anxiety when I think about schoolwork.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s common to feel mixed emotions, especially about academic responsibilities. What specifically triggers that anxiety regarding your schoolwork?

User: I think it’s the fear of not meeting expectations, either my own or what I think others have of me. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed by the amount of work I have.

Consultant: That’s understandable, Chen. It seems like there's a tension between your desire to succeed and the pressure you feel. Can we take a moment to identify some of those thoughts that contribute to that anxiety? What goes through your mind when you think about your workload?

User: I often think things like, “I can't handle this,” or “I'm going to fail.” Those thoughts make it hard to start working.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing those thoughts. It seems like they can be quite limiting. If you take a step back, how do you think those thoughts influence your motivation and ability to start your work?

User: They definitely make me hesitant. Instead of starting, I end up procrastinating. I know I can do the work, but those thoughts just freeze me.

Consultant: It’s important that we recognize the weight those thoughts carry. Could we work together on reframing them? For example, instead of “I can't handle this,” what might a more balanced thought look like?

User: Maybe something like, “I can take it one step at a time,” or “I have managed a lot before.” 

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a much more constructive perspective. By focusing on manageable steps, you may find it easier to start. What are some small steps you could take this week to ease back into your schoolwork?

User: I could set aside just 30 minutes to start on a paper. That feels doable.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Setting that smaller goal can help build your confidence. How about outside of school, are there other positive activities you can engage in to maintain your mood?

User: I’ve been enjoying going for walks and listening to music. I think I might also try sharing my thoughts with a friend more often.

Consultant: Those are excellent choices! Incorporating these activities can really support your overall well-being. How about fostering those connections with friends? Are there specific friends you feel comfortable sharing your feelings with?

User: Yes, there's this friend in my volunteer group. I've been thinking about reaching out to her more often.

Consultant: That sounds perfect, Chen. Sharing your experiences with someone who understands your journey can be incredibly beneficial. How do you plan to initiate that conversation this week?

User: I might just send her a message and suggest we grab a coffee after our next volunteer session. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! A casual setting will make it easier to open up. As we continue our work together, how can we ensure that you're also revisiting those positive moments and achievements regularly?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal of my volunteer experiences and how they make me feel? 

Consultant: A journal is a fantastic tool! It’ll allow you to reflect on your experiences and recognize your ongoing growth. Let’s schedule in some time for that reflection in your week ahead. 

User: Yes, I will plan for that! I already feel more motivated just thinking about it.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Reflecting on your achievements will help reinforce your self-worth. As we wrap up today's session, let's take a moment to summarize what you’ve gained. What do you think your biggest takeaway is?

User: I feel like I’ve got a clearer view on challenging my negative thoughts and reinforcing the positive experiences I have. 

Consultant: That's a significant insight! You’re becoming more equipped to manage your feelings and maintain a positive outlook. As you continue this journey, remember that you have the strength to face challenges. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful now.

Consultant: It's been a pleasure working with you, Chen. You're making remarkable progress. As you go forward, keep using those strategies to manage your feelings and build on your positive experiences. If you ever need support again, know you're welcome to return. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I’m really happy to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better actually. I've been trying to communicate more with my family, and it seems to have helped. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re making progress in your relationships, which is really important. How did these conversations with your family go for you? 

User: They went surprisingly well! I felt more comfortable sharing what I was going through, and they were really supportive. It made me feel less alone. 

Consultant: That’s really encouraging! It’s great that you could be open with them. How did their support affect your emotions or thoughts during that time? 

User: It made me feel a little more hopeful, but I still have moments where I feel overwhelmed. It’s like I’m afraid of falling back into a bad place.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to still have those feelings, especially after what you’ve been through. What strategies have you been using to cope during those overwhelming moments? 

User: I've been trying to journal my thoughts and feelings. Writing things down helps sometimes, but there are days when it feels like too much effort. 

Consultant: Journaling can be really beneficial, but I understand that it might feel like a heavy task on tougher days. What if we explored other simple coping strategies together? 

User: That could be helpful! I’m open to it. 

Consultant: Great! Let's start by considering some small activities that could lift your mood, like going for a walk or doing a favorite hobby. Have you engaged in any activities lately that bring you joy? 

User: I actually went for a walk in the park last week, and it was refreshing. I’ve also started painting again, which I used to enjoy a lot. 

Consultant: That’s excellent! Both walking and painting can be wonderful ways to release stress and express yourself. Would you be open to making those activities a regular part of your routine? 

User: Yes, I’d like that. It feels good to have something to look forward to. 

Consultant: Perfect! Creating a routine around these enjoyable activities can help maintain your positive emotions. How about setting aside specific days for walking and painting? 

User: I think I can manage that. Maybe I can walk on weekends and paint during the week. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Establishing that consistency can really support your emotional well-being. How do you feel about this new plan moving forward? 

User: I feel encouraged! Having a schedule makes it seem less daunting. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s also reflect a bit on the support you received from your family. How do you plan to continue leveraging that support? 

User: I think I want to keep being honest with them. Maybe I can share my new plans with them too, so they can help hold me accountable. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Sharing your goals can strengthen your support system. It sounds like you’re on the right track. Do you feel you have other support systems in place besides your family? 

User: I have a few good friends I trust. I should reach out to them more often, especially when I feel low. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Connecting with friends can provide you with additional encouragement. What might be a good way for you to reach out to them? 

User: I could send them a message to catch up. Maybe invite them to join me for a walk this weekend! 

Consultant: I love that idea! Not only will it help you maintain your connections, but it could also add a social element to your walks. How does that make you feel? 

User: It makes me feel excited! I think it’ll be nice to share this with friends. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear. You're really taking initiative to better your situation. As we look back on our time together, what do you feel has been your biggest achievement since our sessions began? 

User: I think it's the fact that I’m actively working on my relationships and reaching out for support. I didn’t think I could, but it feels good. 

Consultant: That’s a truly significant step! Being proactive about your support and emotions indicates that you’re growing stronger. What are your thoughts on maintaining the progress we’ve made? 

User: I’ll try to keep up with these activities and check in with my family and friends. Also, I'll continue journaling as part of my self-reflection. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Regular self-reflection is an excellent tool to keep track of your feelings and progress. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about your future? 

User: I feel more hopeful. I’m learning to manage my emotions, and I believe I can keep this up.
