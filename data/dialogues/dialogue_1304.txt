Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for today's session, Liu. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. I’ve been quite anxious, especially after that group activity at the university. I felt really uncomfortable and noticed that I was comparing myself to others, which just made my self-esteem crash further.

Consultant: I can see that comparing yourself to others during social situations has intensified your feelings of anxiety and self-doubt. Let's explore this a bit more. What specifically were you feeling during that group activity?

User: I felt so out of place. I was constantly worried about what others thought of me, especially regarding my appearance. I just felt less attractive compared to those around me, and it made me want to withdraw.

Consultant: It sounds like you felt overwhelmed by your perceptions of how you fit in with others, which led you to withdraw from the situation. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that crossed your mind during that event?

User: I kept thinking that nobody would want to talk to me because I’m not tall enough or because I’m just not good enough overall.

Consultant: That’s really tough, Liu. Those negative thoughts can really amplify anxiety. Let’s consider those thoughts for a moment. How much evidence do you think supports those beliefs about yourself?

User: I don’t know. It just feels true when I look at others. They seem so confident, while I feel like I’m invisible.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but let’s challenge this a bit. If a friend were feeling the same way you are, what would you say to them to help them see things differently?

User: I guess I would tell them that everyone has their own insecurities and that they shouldn’t compare themselves to others.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s a reminder that everyone has their own struggles, even if it’s not visible. What if we tried applying that same perspective to your situation? 

User: That makes sense. It's just hard to remember in the moment. 

Consultant: It definitely can be challenging! One strategy might be to practice self-affirmations or to remind yourself of your strengths in those moments. What do you think about trying that?

User: I think it could help, but I’m not really sure how to do it without feeling silly.

Consultant: You might start by writing down a few positive attributes or memories that feel genuine to you. It doesn’t have to be anything grand—just what makes you, you. When you feel anxious, you can read those affirmations to yourself.

User: I can try that. It might make me feel slightly better before social events. 

Consultant: That’s a great start! It’s about building up those positive thoughts over time. Let’s also talk about gradually facing those social situations instead of avoiding them. How does that sound?

User: That sounds scary but also necessary. I realize if I keep avoiding, I won’t improve. 

Consultant: Exactly, facing those situations can feel daunting, but we can take small steps together. What’s a manageable social situation you feel you could approach this week?

User: Maybe I could try joining a study group, but I’m not sure how to start a conversation.

Consultant: Joining a study group sounds like a wonderful idea! You could ask a question about the material—that can be a great way to break the ice. Would it help to prepare a few conversation starters beforehand?

User: Yes, I think that would ease my mind a bit. 

Consultant: Excellent! Preparing can make you feel more confident. Let’s brainstorm a couple of questions or topics you might use to start a conversation at your next group activity.

User: How about asking how they find the class or what they think about the professor? 

Consultant: Those are perfect! They’re open-ended questions that can lead to further discussion. How does it feel to think about using those in your next social encounter?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful about it. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Liu. Remember, it’s natural to feel anxious, but practicing these skills can gradually build your confidence. As we continue, we’ll focus on understanding why you tend to retreat in social situations. 

User: That makes sense. I think reflecting on my reasons will help me understand more about my feelings.

Consultant: Absolutely! Understanding your triggers can be a significant step in working through this. Is there a particular situation where you noticed yourself withdrawing recently that we could reflect on together?

User: I think during that group project when the teacher asked us to pair up. I just froze instead of finding a partner.

Consultant: It sounds like that was a moment of sudden anxiety. Can you share what thoughts crossed your mind in that moment?

User: I was just thinking, “No one will want to work with me.” 

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization. Let’s challenge that thought just like we did earlier. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts that idea?

User: I guess I don’t really know if that’s true. I should give people a chance to respond before assuming they'll reject me.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about giving yourself the opportunity to connect, rather than assuming the worst. Let’s practice that mindset in your next social encounter, and reflect on how it felt afterward.

User: I will remember that! 

Consultant: Wonderful! We’ll make this gradual journey together. Next time, we can discuss your experiences and any progress you’ve noticed. 

User: Thank you for your support. I feel a little better already.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Liu. Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. 

User: Thank you! I’ll see you soon.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today, Liu. I understand you've had some reflections on your recent experiences with social interactions. Can you share how you've been feeling about them?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been feeling quite anxious lately about social situations. At the recent class gathering, I tried to speak up but ultimately didn't. I felt disappointed in myself for staying silent.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially after putting yourself in a challenging situation. What emotions did you experience at the gathering before and after you chose to remain quiet?

User: I felt nervous and pressured to say something, but once I didn’t, I felt regret and frustration afterward. It's like I freeze up and forget what I wanted to say.

Consultant: Freezing up can be really tough in those moments. Let's explore your thoughts during those gatherings. When you decided to remain silent, what thoughts went through your mind at that moment?

User: I kept thinking, "What if I say something wrong?" or "People will judge me." Those kinds of thoughts kept popping up, and I figured it was safer to just stay quiet.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite intense. It's common for fears of judgment to lead us to hold back. How did those thoughts affect your emotions in that moment?

User: They made me feel even more anxious, which just made it harder to speak. I felt like I was trapped in my own head.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a cycle at play here—your thoughts lead to anxiety, which in turn reinforces your decision to stay silent. Have you noticed this happening in other social situations as well?

User: Yes, it happens a lot. I find it really hard to start conversations, especially with girls. I often end up just listening instead of engaging.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a strong desire to engage but feel restricted by your anxiety. What do you think might happen if you decided to challenge those thoughts and try to speak up next time?

User: I guess I worry it might go poorly, and I’ll feel embarrassed. But at the same time, I want to try because staying silent isn’t helping me.

Consultant: That’s a brave realization. What if we try to reframe those negative thoughts? You might consider what a friend would say if they were in your shoes. How might they encourage you?

User: They'd probably tell me it's just a conversation and that it's okay to make mistakes. Maybe it doesn’t have to be perfect.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about connection, not perfection. What would be a small step you could take in your next social situation that would allow you to test this out?

User: Maybe I could just make a comment about something going on, like the music or what people are talking about, instead of trying to come up with something profound.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan, and it’s a manageable step! What do you think might happen if you made that comment?

User: I guess I could feel a little more relaxed. If it goes well, it might give me the confidence to join in more.

Consultant: That's a wonderful perspective! Focusing on these small interactions can gradually build your confidence. How can we prepare you for that moment when it arises?

User: I think just practicing what I might say could help so I don't freeze up again. 

Consultant: Practicing sounds like an excellent idea. Would you like to role-play a scenario where you make a comment? This could help you feel more comfortable.

User: Sure, I’d like to try that. It feels less scary when it's just practice.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine a situation where you’re with a group and there's a song playing. You might say, “I love this song!” How would that feel?

User: It feels manageable, but I still worry about how others will react.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Remember, it’s about trying. If someone reacts negatively, how might you cope with that?

User: I guess I could remind myself that everyone has their own tastes, and it's okay not everyone agrees. It's part of having a conversation.

Consultant: Absolutely! Conversations are diverse, and differences can make them interesting. What other situations can we brainstorm where you might try out this approach?

User: Maybe in my study group, I could ask a question or offer a suggestion instead of just nodding along.

Consultant: That's a perfect idea! Asking questions can foster interaction and take some pressure off you. How would you feel trying that in your next study session?

User: I think it would feel good to get involved, and it might help me remember I'm just contributing to a discussion.

Consultant: Exactly! Engaging has its own rhythm. What's one key takeaway you'll hold onto after our session today regarding self-critique?

User: I think I need to be kinder to myself and remind myself that I'm learning, and it's okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: That's an essential perspective, Liu. Fostering kindness toward yourself as you learn is crucial. How do you plan to practice that self-kindness moving forward?

User: I could write down positive affirmations to remind myself that it’s okay to be imperfect and to appreciate my efforts.

Consultant: That sounds like a valuable practice! It reinforces the good while acknowledging that learning often includes trial and error. Are you feeling more equipped to approach social situations now?

User: Yes, I definitely feel more motivated to practice and engage. Thank you for guiding me through this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, change takes time, so be patient with yourself. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello Liu! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling anxious again, especially after being called on in class the other day. I just froze up and couldn't say anything. I've been critiquing myself a lot since then.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like that experience brought back a lot of those anxious feelings for you. Can you tell me more about what was going through your mind at that moment?

User: I just kept thinking that I should have done better and that everyone was judging me. I felt so embarrassed and small.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It's understandable to feel that way when you're put on the spot. What specific thoughts were you telling yourself that added to your embarrassment?

User: I thought, "I'm not good enough" and "Everyone thinks I’m stupid for not knowing the answer." It really made me doubt myself.

Consultant: Those are powerful thoughts, Liu. Let's take a moment to unpack them. How true do you think those thoughts are? Are there other ways to look at that situation?

User: I guess it's possible that people weren't judging me as harshly as I thought. But in that moment, I really believed it.

Consultant: It's common to feel that way, especially under pressure. But challenging those thoughts can help reduce their impact. What might you say to a friend if they were feeling this way?

User: I would probably tell them that nobody is perfect and that it's okay to not know everything.

Consultant: Exactly. You seem to have a compassionate perspective when you think about others. How might you apply that same kindness to yourself?

User: I could try to remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that I don’t need to be perfect.

Consultant: That's a great insight! Let’s think about how you can practice this. Perhaps we can set a small goal for your next class. What do you think you could do to challenge those anxious feelings?

User: Maybe I could prepare one question ahead of time and remind myself that it’s okay if I don’t have all the answers.

Consultant: That's a wonderful plan, Liu! Preparing in advance can help you feel more confident. How do you think you will feel if you manage to do that in your next class?

User: I think I might feel a bit more relaxed, knowing I have something to contribute, even if it’s just one thing.

Consultant: That’s a promising thought. Remember, taking small steps is key. After your next class, I’d love to hear how it went. Would you be willing to share that experience with me next time?

User: Sure, I can do that. I want to see if this helps me feel better.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! In the meantime, how about we identify some moments where you felt more comfortable socially, however small they might be? 

User: Well, there were a couple of times when I talked to classmates during breaks, and it felt okay.

Consultant: That's a great start! Those moments show you can connect with others. What were you feeling during those interactions?

User: I felt a little nervous, but it also felt good to talk and not overthink it too much.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! You’ve experienced positive social interactions before. How can you remind yourself of those successful moments when you start feeling anxious again?

User: I could keep a journal or something, just to record those little victories.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Keeping track of those moments can reinforce a positive mindset. Remember, every small step counts towards building your confidence. 

User: Yes, I see that now. I just need to keep reminding myself of those positive experiences.

Consultant: Absolutely! As we wrap up today, think about what you’ve learned. How do you plan to carry these insights into your daily life?

User: I will try to challenge my negative thoughts more often and take things one step at a time.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! You're making great progress, Liu. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember, you’re capable of more than you think.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I feel like I can actually try to change things now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm here for you, and I believe in your ability to grow. Until next time, take care and keep practicing those small steps!

User: Thanks! I will. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I’m glad you’re here for today’s session. It sounds like you've recently experienced some positive feedback from your roommates regarding social activities. Can you tell me more about how that made you feel?

User: Hi! Yes, it was a bit surprising, actually. I've always felt nervous around people, especially with girls. But when I chatted with my roommates about the events we went to, they seemed to enjoy my company! That feedback gave me a little boost, but I still feel anxious.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you received positive feedback! It’s a significant step forward. It sounds like you’re beginning to understand the potential benefits of socializing. What kind of emotions did you experience during that conversation with your roommates?

User: I felt excited and hopeful, but also a bit scared. I worry that I might not always be able to meet their expectations or that I’ll embarrass myself.

Consultant: Those feelings are entirely valid. Excitement and nervousness often go hand in hand, especially when you’re starting to explore social interactions. What do you think could help you manage that fear of not meeting expectations?

User: Maybe if I practice more, I could become better at chatting with them? It’s just that I often feel shy and don’t know what to say.

Consultant: Practicing sounds like a good idea! Let's think about some strategies to help you feel more comfortable during conversations. Are there specific situations where you feel more at ease socializing?

User: I think I'm more comfortable when I’m with people I know well, like my roommates. But when I’m trying to talk to someone new, I get really anxious.

Consultant: That makes sense. Familiarity can often ease anxiety. How about we focus on breaking down those interactions into smaller steps? For example, you could first try greeting someone new or making small talk in a relaxed environment. How does that sound?

User: That sounds doable! I think starting small could help me gradually get used to talking to new people.

Consultant: Excellent! Taking small steps can build your confidence. Can you recall a specific instance when you approached someone new? What went well?

User: I remember once I complemented a classmate on their presentation. They seemed happy to hear it, and we ended up chatting a little about our classes.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful example! You initiated a positive interaction, which led to a pleasant conversation. How did that make you feel afterward?

User: I felt good! It was nice to connect with someone, even if just for a moment. I didn’t feel as anxious as I thought I would.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! You’ve experienced a successful social interaction, which suggests that you can handle similar situations in the future. How can you remind yourself of this experience when facing new social challenges?

User: I could keep reminding myself that it’s possible to have good conversations and that it's okay to be a little nervous.

Consultant: Yes! Reframing your thoughts like that can be very powerful. What other situations do you think you could apply this mindset to in the coming weeks?

User: Maybe I could try talking to someone in my study group or participating in more extracurricular activities.

Consultant: Those are excellent options! Engaging in group activities can provide a natural context for conversation. How about setting a specific goal for yourself regarding these interactions?

User: I think I could aim to speak to at least one new person every week, whether in class or in activities.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! How do you feel about setting this goal as a way to practice your social skills?

User: I'm excited about it! It feels challenging but good. I think it’ll help me gradually get more used to social situations.

Consultant: Great! It’s wonderful to see your enthusiasm. Let’s also think about how you can reflect on these experiences afterward. Would journaling your thoughts and feelings after each interaction be helpful?

User: Yes, I think writing it down could help me process how it went and what I can improve.

Consultant: That’s a solid approach! Reflecting on your experiences can lead to valuable insights. As you continue to practice these interactions, remember to celebrate your successes, no matter how small. 

User: I will! I really appreciate your support. It’s nice to have this space to explore my feelings.

Consultant: I’m glad to be here for you, Liu. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you think your biggest takeaway is regarding positive social interactions?

User: I feel more hopeful and motivated to engage with others. I realize that my fear doesn’t have to control me, and I can take small steps to improve.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve made great progress today. Remember to apply these strategies, and I believe you’ll continue to grow in your social skills. If you find obstacles along the way, we can address them together in future sessions. 

User: Thank you! I feel more confident that I can manage this now. I look forward to sharing my progress next time.

Consultant: I’m excited to hear about your experiences! Remember to take it one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to reach out when you need support. I’m looking forward to our next session!

User: Me too, thank you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm really pleased to see you again. How have things been since our last session, especially regarding your recent social activities?

User: Hi! I actually feel pretty excited. I managed to introduce myself during a social event earlier this week and even exchanged contacts with a few classmates. It felt like a big step for me!

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Introducing yourself and connecting with classmates is a great achievement. How did you feel during and after the introduction?

User: During the introduction, I was really nervous—my heart was racing, and I could feel my hands shaking. But after, I felt a rush of excitement. It was nice to interact and feel more connected, even if it was just a small step.

Consultant: It sounds like a mix of anxiety and thrill during the moment, but ultimately, a sense of accomplishment afterward. That’s an important recognition of your effort. What do you think it means for you moving forward?

User: I think it shows I can take these steps, even when I'm scared. I really want to keep improving and not let my anxiety hold me back.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing your ability to take those steps is vital. Can you identify what specific feelings or thoughts you had that pushed you to make that introduction despite your anxiety?

User: I told myself that I needed to try, even if it frightened me. I also thought that maybe people would be friendly, which helped me feel a bit less anxious.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy—reminding yourself of the potential for positive responses. What do you think would help you maintain this social momentum and continue building those connections with your classmates?

User: Maybe I can set small goals, like initiating a conversation with someone new each week or suggesting group activities based on common interests.

Consultant: Setting small, achievable goals sounds like an excellent plan! It allows you to gradually extend your comfort zone without overwhelming yourself. What specific goals do you think you’d like to pursue first?

User: I think I’d like to start by reaching out to one classmate I exchanged contact with. Maybe ask them to study together or join me for coffee after class.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! It’s approachable and gives you an opportunity to deepen your connection in a relaxed setting. How do you envision yourself feeling if that goes well?

User: I imagine I’d feel even more confident. Being able to connect over something like studies could really help me feel at ease.

Consultant: Definitely! Positive experiences, like studying together, can reinforce your confidence and help ease the anxiety you feel in social situations. What steps can you take to prepare for reaching out to them?

User: I guess I could think of a few conversation starters or topics we might discuss. I want to make sure I’m relaxed when I ask.

Consultant: Preparing some conversation starters is an excellent idea! It can help alleviate some of that anxious anticipation. What topics do you think might resonate with them based on your conversations so far?

User: We talked about our major, so maybe I could ask for their thoughts on an upcoming project or share my experience in a related class.

Consultant: Those are perfect starting points! They’re relevant and allow for a natural flow in conversation. If you do encounter feelings of anxiety while reaching out, what calming techniques could you use to manage those feelings?

User: I might take deep breaths or remind myself that it’s normal to feel anxious and that the other person is likely feeling something similar.

Consultant: Those are effective techniques! Deep breathing can help ground you, and normalizing anxiety can reduce its impact. How do you feel about this preparation and planning process we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel much more empowered. Having a plan and goals makes it seem less daunting, and I know I just need to take it one step at a time.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Liu! Empowerment through planning is key. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what you’ve achieved and how you’ll maintain this positive momentum in your social endeavors.

User: I feel like I’ve made real progress. I’m more aware of my fears and how to approach them. Also, I have clear goals to work toward.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve done a great job identifying fears and transforming them into actionable goals. Keep reminding yourself of the positives as you move forward. Remember, it’s okay to take your time. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’m feeling excited about my next steps.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Liu! Keep that excitement close. Remember, I’m here if you need any help in the future. Enjoy your next social interaction, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to have you back for another session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good, actually. I successfully presented during my finals recently and received some great feedback. It's made me feel more confident about my ability to speak in public.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! It's a big achievement, and it sounds like it really boosted your confidence. What specific feelings or changes have you noticed in yourself since the presentation?

User: I feel much happier and more satisfied. I realized that facing challenges can actually lead to growth, which is something I'm excited about.

Consultant: It's wonderful that you've recognized the value of facing challenges! Building on that, what do you perceive as your strengths now, especially in social situations?

User: I think I'm better at expressing my ideas and feelings. I’m also more comfortable engaging with my classmates, which is a huge step for me.

Consultant: That’s a significant progress! It's great to hear that you're feeling more comfortable with your classmates. Are there any specific situations where you've noticed this improvement?

User: Yes, during group discussions in class. I used to be really quiet, but now I feel more willing to share my thoughts and participate.

Consultant: That's a big step forward! Participation often builds more connections with others. How do you think this improved engagement impacts your relationships with your peers?

User: I feel like I'm getting to know them better, and they respond positively to my contributions. It's nice to feel like a part of the group.

Consultant: Feeling connected is so important! Now that you've made strides in your communication with peers, are there any new social situations or challenges that you're considering?

User: I haven't thought about specific challenges yet, but I'd like to try and be more comfortable in larger groups or perhaps meet new people outside of class.

Consultant: That sounds like a great goal! Expanding your social boundaries can lead to even more opportunities for growth. Would you like to explore ways to approach larger groups or new social settings?

User: Yes, I think that would help. I often feel anxious when I'm around too many people, especially those I don't know.

Consultant: That anxiety is understandable, especially in new social environments. We can work on strategies to gradually ease into those situations. What would be a manageable size of a group for you to start with?

User: Maybe starting with a small gathering, like a friend's get-together. It feels less intimidating than a big party.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect place to start! You could also think about specific ways to engage at that gathering. What activities or interactions do you think you could comfortably participate in?

User: I could initiate conversations about shared interests or ask about subjects related to class. That might help me feel more engaged.

Consultant: Initiating conversations about shared interests is a great approach! It can help to create a natural flow in the conversation. How do you think you could prepare for that?

User: I could think of a few topics in advance and maybe even practice what I want to say a little. 

Consultant: Practicing can definitely help ease your nervousness. Since you've had success in your presentations, you might draw on that experience for confidence. How do you feel about using some of those skills in this new context?

User: That sounds like a good idea! I can try to treat it like a smaller presentation, which might reduce my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a smart strategy! Treating it like a smaller presentation can indeed bridge your comfort zone. Is there anything specific you need to remember to keep your confidence up in these interactions?

User: Maybe to focus on listening as much as speaking. If I listen well, I think it’ll be easier to engage.

Consultant: Absolutely! Active listening can make conversations flow more naturally. It also takes a bit of pressure off you. As you keep practicing, how do you plan to reflect on your experiences afterward?

User: I could journal about how the interaction went, what felt good, and what I want to improve next time.

Consultant: Journaling is a fantastic tool! It will help you recognize your progress and areas for growth. As we start to wrap up our session, what do you feel are the most important takeaways from our discussion today?

User: I feel that I've made significant progress in my social skills and that I have a plan for stepping out of my comfort zone. I just need to approach things gradually.

Consultant: You’ve clearly identified actionable steps! It's exciting to see how you're building on your success and looking forward to new challenges. Remember, it's about taking small steps. If you need support along the way, don't hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you! That really helps. I’m looking forward to trying these strategies in real situations.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Liu! Remember, you're capable of managing these changes. I’m proud of the progress you’ve made, and I’m here if you need to check in again. Best of luck with your upcoming social interactions!
