Consultant: Hello, Chen! I’m glad you're here today. I know this has been a challenging time for you. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been thinking about what we discussed last time. I still feel a lot of nerves about social situations, especially after what happened at my boyfriend's father’s birthday party. I just couldn't cope, and it was really embarrassing.

Consultant: I can see why that experience would be overwhelming for you. It sounds like that event really heightened your anxiety about social interactions. Can you share more about what went through your mind during the party?

User: I keep thinking everyone must have noticed how anxious I was, and that they were judging me. I felt like I was going to faint or something, and I just wanted to escape.

Consultant: It sounds like you were feeling a lot of pressure and fear of judgment, which can be incredibly distressing. When those thoughts about judgment came up, how did that impact your feelings in the moment?

User: I guess it made me feel even more anxious and shaky. I was focused on how I was being perceived rather than enjoying the moment or even just being present.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way when social situations can feel so intense. Do you remember any specific thoughts that crossed your mind when you started feeling anxious during the party?

User: I remember thinking that I'd embarrass myself and my boyfriend would be disappointed in me. That made me freeze up even more.

Consultant: Those thoughts are quite powerful, and it’s no wonder they contributed to your anxiety. Let’s explore this a bit more. If you were to challenge the idea that your boyfriend would be disappointed, what evidence do you have that supports or contradicts that thought?

User: I mean, he always says he cares about me and he’s understanding, but in that moment, I just couldn't believe it. I only felt shame.

Consultant: It sounds like there's a conflict between what you know to be true and how you feel in the moment. Would it help to consider how you would respond if a close friend felt that way in a similar situation?

User: I would probably tell them it's okay and that everyone has tough moments. But it's hard to see it for myself.

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate perspective. Reminding yourself that it’s okay to struggle and that everyone experiences tough times can be incredibly validating. How would you feel about practicing seeing yourself through that same gentle lens?

User: I think that could help a bit. If I could be nicer to myself, maybe it wouldn't feel so heavy.

Consultant: Exactly. Self-compassion can often lighten that burden. Let’s also think about small steps you could take moving forward in social situations. What if we discussed activities that might help you gradually face social gatherings?

User: I like that idea. Maybe I could start with smaller gatherings or even just hanging out with one or two friends at a time.

Consultant: That sounds like a great place to start. By gradually exposing yourself to social interactions, you can build your confidence over time. What do you think you could do this week to start with those smaller interactions?

User: I could invite a friend for coffee. That feels manageable. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful step! Inviting a friend over will give you a chance to practice those social skills in a more comfortable environment. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel a bit anxious, but also hopeful that it might go well. If I can make it happen, it would be good for me.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious about it, but hope is a positive sign that you’re moving forward. Remember to remind yourself of the supportive thoughts you’ve identified today if anxiety rises. How else can I support you in taking this step?

User: Maybe if I could think of some coping strategies for when I start feeling overwhelmed again, that would help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Some strategies might include deep breathing exercises, focusing on what's happening in the moment rather than worrying about judgments, or even having a phrase you can say to yourself to calm those thoughts. Would any of these resonate with you?

User: I like the idea of deep breathing. I’ve heard it can help, but I’ve never really tried it.

Consultant: Deep breathing is an excellent technique! It can help calm your nervous system and bring your focus back. Would you like to practice a simple breathing technique right now?

User: Sure, that sounds good!

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four, hold for four, and then slowly breathe out through your mouth for a count of four. Ready? (Instructions and practice follow.)

User: That actually felt calming. I think I can remember to do that during stressful moments.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Practicing it regularly can really help develop that calmness as a habit. As we wrap up today, let’s recap the progress you've made and the steps we discussed. How do you feel about what we’ve accomplished?

User: I feel better about understanding my anxiety, and I appreciate the strategies we talked about. I definitely want to try that coffee date.

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress, Chen! You’ve identified some effective self-care strategies and a small actionable step. Remember to be gentle with yourself as you navigate these feelings. We’ll check in on your experience next time. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel more equipped to handle social situations now. Thank you for your support!

Consultant: You're very welcome. Thank you for sharing so openly today. I look forward to hearing how your coffee date goes. Take care, and I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm glad to see you again. I understand you've been reflecting on your social fears recently. How are you feeling about the possibility of social interactions now?

User: Hi. I’ve been thinking a lot about it, and I still feel anxious at the thought of social situations. I even missed a team-building event at work recently because I couldn't face it. It makes me feel really down.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a significant amount of anxiety regarding social interactions, which is completely understandable. You've been avoiding these situations, and it’s leading to some negative feelings. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you anxious in these social settings?

User: I often worry that others will judge me or think I'm strange if I don’t know what to say. I feel so nervous that I might just freeze or say something awkward.

Consultant: It seems like you're really concerned about how others perceive you during interactions. This fear of judgment is very common in social anxiety. Let’s explore this thought a bit deeper: when you imagine being in those situations, what specific thoughts run through your mind?

User: I immediately think that everyone will be watching me and waiting for me to mess up. I expect the worst, which makes me want to avoid them altogether.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're anticipating negative outcomes. This kind of thinking can create a cycle of anxiety that’s hard to break. How do you feel when you have these thoughts about being judged?

User: It just makes me feel even more inadequate and scared. I wish I could feel more confident, but it’s hard to shake off that feeling of being watched.

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel that way given the avoidance you've experienced. But let’s challenge that thought. Can you think of any instances when you were in a social situation and it didn't turn out as badly as you expected?

User: Actually, there have been times when I’ve talked to my friends or even my boyfriend, and it went fine. But I easily forget those moments when I start to feel anxious again.

Consultant: It’s great that you’ve had some positive experiences! Let’s work on how to remind yourself of those moments. If a friend were in your situation, what might you tell them to help them think more positively about the interactions?

User: I’d probably tell them that no one is perfect, and that everyone has their awkward moments. They shouldn’t worry so much about what others think.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! You’re absolutely right—everyone has their own insecurities. Perhaps we can use that kind of thinking for yourself. What if you allowed yourself to be "imperfect" during social situations? How might that change your experience?

User: I guess it would take off some pressure. If I could just accept that I might not always say the right thing, maybe I could relax a bit more.

Consultant: Exactly! By reducing the pressure you place on yourself, you might find it easier to engage. Let’s think of some small, manageable social activities you could try that feel less intimidating. What could that look like for you?

User: Maybe I could start by having lunch with just one colleague instead of a big group. That seems more doable.

Consultant: That sounds like a great starting point! Having lunch with one colleague could be a less overwhelming way to ease into social interactions. How do you feel about setting that as your first goal for the week?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think I could handle it. If I remind myself to be okay with being imperfect, it might help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember, it’s completely normal to feel nervous. The key is to approach this with kindness toward yourself. After you have lunch, we can discuss how it went and what you felt. 

User: That sounds good. I like that idea of reflecting on it together afterward. 

Consultant: Perfect! Alongside this, let’s create a mantra or positive affirmation you can use when those anxious thoughts arise. What do you think would empower you in those moments?

User: Maybe something like, “It’s okay to make mistakes, I’m still learning.” 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic affirmation! Repeating that can help remind you to be gentle with yourself. As you prepare for your lunch, I encourage you to practice this affirmation and visualize a positive outcome. 

User: I’ll definitely try that. It makes me feel more hopeful thinking about it.

Consultant: Hope is a powerful tool! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’re taking away from our session. What do you feel is your main focus moving forward?

User: I want to challenge my fear of judgment and try to engage in smaller social interactions while reminding myself that it’s okay not to be perfect.

Consultant: That sounds really strong! You’re taking important steps toward building your confidence. Remember, this is a process, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. 

User: Thank you, I feel more at ease about this now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of you for sharing your feelings today. Remember, you can always reach out if you need more support. Good luck with your lunch, and I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm really glad to see you again. Last time we spoke, you mentioned feeling anxious about social situations, especially during a project when you had to introduce yourself. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit anxious, especially thinking about similar situations in the future. I still can't shake off the disappointment from the last time. It just seems so difficult to communicate in front of others.

Consultant: I understand that feeling disappointed can definitely contribute to your anxiety. It's completely normal to feel nervous about social interactions, especially if you've had difficult experiences. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel anxious when you think about speaking in front of people?

User: I think it's mostly the fear of being judged or not speaking well. When I have to talk, my mind just goes blank, and I worry that others will see me as awkward or not smart enough.

Consultant: Those thoughts are really common in social situations, and they can certainly create a lot of pressure. Let’s work on identifying some of those automatic thoughts. Can you recall what thoughts were going through your mind during that self-introduction? How did they make you feel?

User: I remember thinking things like “What if I mess up?” or “They’ll all think I’m strange.” Those thoughts just made me feel really embarrassed and tense.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like those thoughts really heightened your anxiety. It's important to recognize the connection between what we're thinking and how we're feeling. Would you say that your thinking is sometimes a bit extreme, perhaps seeing situations in black and white?

User: Definitely, it feels like I'm either perfect or a total failure. There's no in-between.

Consultant: That's a key insight! Those all-or-nothing thoughts can make situations feel much more overwhelming. Let’s try to challenge those beliefs a bit. How much evidence do you have to support the idea that if you make a mistake, everyone will think negatively of you?

User: I don't know… I guess it’s just my fear talking. Maybe people are more understanding than I think.

Consultant: Exactly! It's important to question those fears. If a friend were in your position, how would you support them? What would you tell them about their worries?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it's okay to not be perfect.

Consultant: That's a loving perspective! Let's try to apply that to your own situation. What if you allowed yourself to make mistakes, or even to feel a bit awkward? How might that change your experience?

User: I suppose it would take off some pressure. I could focus more on just being myself instead of worrying about others’ opinions.

Consultant: Exactly! Embracing your authenticity can help you feel more relaxed. Now, let’s talk about some strategies you can use before and during these social situations. Have you ever tried deep breathing exercises or any mindfulness techniques?

User: I’ve heard about them but haven’t tried anything actively.

Consultant: Let’s practice them together! Deep breathing can be a great tool to help you calm your nerves. Would you be willing to try a simple breathing exercise with me now?

User: Sure, I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in for a count of four... hold it for four... and breathe out for a count of four. Let’s do that a few times. How does that feel?

User: It actually feels kind of nice. I already feel a bit calmer.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Remember, you can use this technique before social events to help ground yourself. In addition to breathing, let’s create a preparation plan for future interactions. What would you find helpful to include in your plan?

User: Maybe writing down what I want to say in advance, and practicing it a bit?

Consultant: Absolutely! Preparing can really help boost your confidence. You can also remind yourself of supporting thoughts like “It’s okay to be imperfect.” Would you like to set a small goal for your next social interaction?

User: Yes! I think I could aim to say at least one thing during our next group meeting.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect goal! Saying one thing can make a significant difference. How do you feel about practicing these strategies over the next week?

User: I feel hopeful. It seems more manageable when I break it down like this.

Consultant: That's a great perspective! It's all about progress, not perfection. At our next session, we can review how the week went. Remember, it’s completely okay to experience discomfort—this is part of the process. How are you feeling about our conversation today?

User: I feel good. I appreciate the strategies we talked about, and I’m more aware of my thoughts now. Thank you for being so supportive!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Chen! I’m proud of you for being willing to open up and engage in these strategies. It’s a significant step. I look forward to hearing about your experiences. Until next time, take care and practice those techniques!

User: Thank you! I will do my best. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Chen! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially after the online social skills course you participated in?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. The course really opened my eyes to my misconceptions about social anxiety. I’m still nervous, but I want to try out some of the breathing techniques I learned.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that the course had a positive impact. It’s a good step forward! Can you share more about what specific misconceptions you realized during the course?

User: I used to think that everyone was judging me all the time. But now I see that it might be more about my perception. It feels like I’m the only one focused on my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight, Chen! Recognizing that others might not be as focused on you as you think can be liberating. How do you feel when you remind yourself of this new perspective?

User: It eases the tension a little, but I still find it hard to face people. I want to try the breathing techniques to help manage that.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Let’s work together on those techniques. Can you describe your experience with deep breathing so far? How comfortable do you feel doing it before or during social interactions?

User: I haven’t really practiced it in a social situation yet. I feel a bit silly trying it out around others, but I think it could help calm my nerves.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way at first. Practicing deep breathing can actually become a private tool for you, something you can do even before interacting with others. Would you be open to trying a short breathing exercise together right now?

User: Sure, I’d like to try that!

Consultant: Great! Let’s do it. Find a comfortable sitting position, and let’s take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four... and now exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Repeat this a few times. How does this make you feel?

User: It feels nice, actually. I feel a little more relaxed already.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! This is a skill you can use before social situations to help manage your anxiety. How do you think you could incorporate this breathing technique into your routine before entering social settings?

User: I think if I take a couple of minutes to breathe deeply before I enter a social situation, it might help. Maybe I can practice it at home too.

Consultant: Absolutely, practicing at home is a great idea! The more comfortable you become with it, the more effective it will be in real-life situations. Have you identified any upcoming social events where you can try this out?

User: I have a small gathering with some friends this weekend. I’m a bit nervous but excited too.

Consultant: That’s a perfect opportunity! You can use the breathing techniques beforehand, and perhaps even while you’re there if you start to feel anxious. What’s one positive thing you could remind yourself during the gathering?

User: I could remind myself that my friends are there to enjoy each other’s company, not to judge me.

Consultant: Yes, exactly! Focusing on the enjoyment rather than the judgment can help shift your mindset. What else could you do to make yourself feel more at ease during the gathering?

User: Maybe I could set small goals for myself, like starting a conversation with one person and just being present in the moment.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Setting small, achievable goals can make the experience less overwhelming. How do you feel about the idea of focusing on one conversation at a time?

User: It sounds manageable. I think I can do that. 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Once you start practicing these techniques, how do you think it will change your social experiences?

User: I hope I can enjoy myself more and not get so caught up in my anxiety. I really want to connect with my friends.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal, Chen. Being able to connect with others freely is an important part of social interactions. After the gathering, we can discuss how it went and any feelings that came up. Does that sound good?

User: Yes! I’d love to share my experience with you.

Consultant: I’m looking forward to hearing about it. Remember, practice the breathing techniques and try to focus on your connection with others. You’re making significant progress, and I’m proud of you.

User: Thank you! I feel more confident about trying things out now.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Chen! Confidence grows with practice. And as we wrap up today, let’s reflect on the progress you’ve made. How has your understanding of social confidence changed since we began our sessions?

User: I’ve realized that it’s something I can develop over time with practice, not something I either have or don’t have.

Consultant: Exactly! Building social confidence is indeed a journey. You’re on the right path, and I believe you can continue to enhance your social skills. If you face any challenges along the way, remember I'm here to help.

User: I appreciate your support. I’ll definitely try the techniques and share how it goes next time!

Consultant: That sounds like a plan! I’m excited to hear about your experiences. Have a wonderful time, and know that you’re capable of making these connections. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling a lot better. I tried out the mindfulness breathing techniques at a social gathering, and surprisingly, it helped me feel calm. I could talk more freely to others.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like the mindfulness technique really made a difference for you. Can you share more about how it felt during the interactions?

User: Well, at first, I was really nervous. But after taking a few deep breaths, I started to relax and found it easier to engage in conversations. I felt more present.

Consultant: It sounds like you discovered a helpful way to anchor yourself in the moment. How did the people around you respond to your more relaxed demeanor?

User: They seemed more open to talking with me. I even had a few laughs, which I haven’t experienced in a while. It felt good to connect with others.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant step forward. You’re really tapping into the positive effects of the techniques! What do you think made the biggest difference for you during the gathering?

User: I think it was the breathing. It helped clear my mind of anxious thoughts, allowing me to focus on the conversations instead.

Consultant: That’s great insight! Focusing on your breathing can create a sense of calmness that opens you up to interaction. Are there any situations coming up where you think you could apply these techniques again?

User: Yes, there’s a small get-together with some friends this weekend. I’m a bit nervous, but I’m excited to try out what I learned.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous, but it’s great to have that excitement too. How do you plan to incorporate the breathing techniques into your time with friends?

User: I think I will take a few minutes before I arrive to center myself, and maybe use it during any moments I start feeling anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, taking those moments for yourself can make a big difference. How do you feel about facing this gathering compared to how you felt in previous ones?

User: I feel more confident now. I think I have tools to help manage my anxiety instead of just feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s an empowering shift! Realizing you have tools to manage anxiety is a big step. How do you envision your interactions being different this time?

User: I hope to be more myself, enjoying the conversations instead of worrying about what others think.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! Being present and true to yourself can enhance your connections. What would you like to keep in mind during the gathering that helps you stay grounded?

User: I want to remind myself that it’s okay to feel a little nervous, and that I can always take a breath to calm down.

Consultant: Exactly! Acknowledging those feelings is important. It’s all part of the process. How confident do you feel about implementing that strategy?

User: I feel pretty confident, actually! Practicing at the last gathering gave me a boost.

Consultant: That's excellent to hear! You're already building on your previous experiences. If things don’t go as planned, how will you handle it?

User: I think I’ll try to be compassionate with myself. Remind myself that it’s okay to have ups and downs.

Consultant: That's a very compassionate approach! Being kind to yourself creates a safe space for growth. Would you like to set any specific goals for the gathering?

User: I want to aim for at least a few meaningful conversations, and just enjoy the atmosphere.

Consultant: Those are great goals! Enjoying the atmosphere is just as important as the conversations. After the gathering, how would you like to reflect on your experience?

User: I’d like to think about what went well and how I felt during the interactions, rather than just focusing on any mistakes.

Consultant: That’s a healthy reflection strategy! Focusing on the positives can help reinforce your progress. As we near the end of our session, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from today?

User: I think I’ve realized that I can take control of my anxiety with the right tools. That feels empowering.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization, Chen! Remember that you have the ability to manage your feelings effectively. How will you continue to practice this moving forward?

User: I’ll keep using the breathing techniques and try to approach social situations with more confidence. I’m feeling optimistic.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that you're feeling optimistic! You've made tremendous progress. As we wrap up our session, what's one thing you’d like to remember about your journey so far?

User: That I’m capable of improving my social skills and handling anxiety. I just need to practice.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset! Remember that practice is key. You've come a long way, and I'm confident you can keep building on this. If you ever need support, know that you can always reach out. Take care, and good luck at the gathering!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I'll keep practicing and look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a lot better, actually. Joining the book club has helped me interact with others more naturally. I still can't believe how much I've improved!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're really starting to feel more comfortable in social settings. Can you share a specific moment in the book club where you felt particularly positive about your interactions?

User: Yes! There was this discussion about a book we read, and I was able to share my thoughts without feeling too anxious. I even made a joke, and everyone laughed!

Consultant: That's fantastic! Making a joke shows a lot of confidence, and it must have felt great to connect with others like that. How did you feel after the discussion ended?

User: I felt really proud of myself. For the first time, I didn't want to leave immediately after the meeting. I actually stayed and chatted with a couple of people.

Consultant: Staying to chat shows significant progress. This ability to engage more is a great step forward. What do you think has changed in your mindset that allowed you to feel this way?

User: I think I’ve started to believe that I have something valuable to contribute. The support from the group has also made a huge difference. I don't feel as judged or out of place anymore.

Consultant: That belief in your contributions is very empowering! It's important to recognize your worth in conversations. Have there been any challenges or uncomfortable moments since joining the club?

User: A few times, I felt the old anxiety creeping back, especially when talking to someone I didn't know well. I still worry about whether they’ll judge me or find me boring.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to experience those feelings occasionally, especially when stepping outside your comfort zone. When that anxiety arises, what strategies have you used to manage it?

User: I try to remind myself that everyone feels nervous sometimes. I focus on listening to others and asking questions, which seems to distract me from my worries.

Consultant: That’s a great technique! Focusing on listening can really help shift your attention away from self-doubt. Would you like to explore some additional strategies for those moments when the anxiety feels overwhelming?

User: Yes, that would be helpful. Sometimes I feel stuck in my thoughts and unsure of how to move past the anxiety.

Consultant: One approach we can consider is practicing some grounding techniques. These can help bring your focus back to the present moment rather than getting lost in anxious thoughts. Would you be open to trying some of these techniques together?

User: Sure, I’m willing to give it a shot!

Consultant: Great! One simple technique is to take a deep breath and observe your surroundings. For instance, notice three things you can see, two things you can feel, and one thing you can smell. This helps ground you in the moment. How does that sound?

User: That sounds doable! I’ll try that next time I start feeling anxious.

Consultant: I believe that will be beneficial. It’s all about finding what works best for you. Moving forward, how can I best support you in maintaining your progress?

User: Just checking in regularly would be good. I want to make sure I don’t slip back into old habits. Following up on my feelings and experiences would be helpful.

Consultant: Absolutely, regular check-ins are essential for sustaining progress. It sounds like you’re committed to continuing your growth. Are there specific goals you’d like to achieve in our future sessions?

User: I want to get even better at handling one-on-one conversations, especially with new people. It’s still a bit daunting for me.

Consultant: That’s a valuable goal! We can certainly focus on those one-on-one interactions. Let’s explore some role-playing exercises in our next session to build that confidence further. Would that work for you?

User: Yes, I think that would be very useful. I’ll feel more prepared for those situations.

Consultant: Excellent! We can tailor these exercises to areas you find challenging. Remember, progress takes time, and you’re already doing so well. Together, we’ll work on those skills.

User: Thank you! I feel encouraged just talking about it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s essential to acknowledge every step you take. Let's recap your progress: you've engaged more effectively in the book club, embraced your contributions, and developed strategies to manage anxiety. That’s a lot of growth!

User: I never thought I could get here. I feel hopeful about my future interactions.

Consultant: Your progress is admirable, and it shows your hard work and determination. As we wrap up today’s session, what are your thoughts on how to maintain these strategies once you leave our sessions?

User: I think practicing grounding techniques and staying active in the book club will help. Plus, I'll remind myself of what I've learned.

Consultant: Those are excellent plans! Keeping those techniques in mind will help reinforce your confidence. Remember, you can always reach out if you need assistance in applying these strategies.

User: I will! Thank you for all your help. It really means a lot.

Consultant: You're very welcome! You’ve put in the effort to overcome challenges, and I believe you can continue on this positive path. This will be our final session for now, but don’t hesitate to return if you need further support. 

User: I appreciate that. I feel empowered to continue this journey. 

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You've worked hard, and I'm confident you have the tools to manage your social interactions moving forward. Take care, and I wish you all the best in your journey ahead!
