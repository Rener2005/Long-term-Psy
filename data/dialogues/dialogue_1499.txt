Consultant: Hello, Xiao Lu! I'm glad you're here today. I want to understand how you’ve been feeling about your experiences in class lately. Can you tell me a bit about what's been happening?

User: Hi. I don't know. The teachers keep saying I’m not behaving well, but I just want to have some fun with my friends. I don’t think it’s that big of a deal. 

Consultant: I see, you feel that having fun with your friends is important, but it sounds like this has caused some problems in your class. How do you feel when the teachers talk to you about your behavior?

User: I feel angry! Like they don't understand that I'm just trying to enjoy school. Sometimes I feel like they are just being really strict for no reason.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Feeling angry when you feel misunderstood is a natural reaction. It’s good to express how you feel. Can you share what specifically makes you want to talk or joke around with your friends during class?

User: I guess it’s just boring when we are supposed to listen all the time. I just want to have some fun and not feel so tired from listening to the teacher.

Consultant: Boredom can certainly make it hard to stay focused. It seems like you're looking for a way to make your time in class more enjoyable. Have you thought about how your jokes and talking might affect your classmates or the teacher when you do this?

User: Not really. I just keep doing it. I don’t think it bothers them that much... they laugh sometimes!

Consultant: It's interesting that they laugh sometimes; it suggests they enjoy some of the fun you bring. However, it might not always feel positive for everyone. What do you think happens to the teacher or other students when you interrupt the class?

User: I don’t know... maybe they get mad? But I just think they should relax a bit!

Consultant: It sounds like you recognize that your actions might upset some people, but you also believe that the atmosphere should be lighter. Can you think of a time when you noticed someone in class getting upset because of a joke or interruption you made?

User: Yeah... one time the teacher looked really annoyed, but I thought it was just a little joke. I didn't mean to be rude or anything.

Consultant: It sounds like you didn’t intend to hurt anyone’s feelings. Recognizing that is an important step! What do you think you could do differently to still have fun without making the teacher upset?

User: I guess I could wait until it’s time for a break or maybe keep the jokes for lunch instead of during class.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Finding the right time to share humor can help keep the class engaged and maintain a positive relationship with the teacher. How does that make you feel about your ability to make that change?

User: I think I could try that. But what if I want to joke around during class again?

Consultant: It’s completely normal to want to be playful during class. It might help to remind yourself of the positive aspects of waiting for the right moment. How might you feel if your classmates are happier with you not interrupting the class?

User: I guess they’d probably be more focused, which could be cool. I don’t want everyone to be mad at me. 

Consultant: Exactly—having everyone feeling happy and focused can create a better environment for you too. What do you think would help you remember to wait for the right time next class?

User: Maybe I can tell myself that it's better to keep the fun for later. I can also think about how it makes the teacher feel.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Xiao Lu! Keeping those thoughts in mind could help you control the urge to interrupt. How are you feeling about these ideas we’ve discussed?

User: I feel a bit more okay about it. I think I just need to pay attention to what’s happening in class.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! Paying attention can help you recognize the right moments to engage with your classmates. Is there anything else you’d like to reflect on regarding your classroom behavior?

User: Not really. I think I understand better now. I guess I just need to find a balance.

Consultant: Finding that balance is essential, and you’ve made great progress today. Remember, it’s okay to have fun as long as it respects the situation. We can revisit how things go next time. How do you feel about coming back to talk again?

User: I think I can come back and share how I did with that! I feel a bit hopeful now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiao Lu! It sounds like you’re ready to try some new approaches. Take notes on how things go and we can discuss them next time. See you then!

User: Thank you! I'm looking forward to it!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Lv! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit uneasy. I still can’t shake off that feeling of confusion about my behavior in class last week. 

Consultant: I understand that you're feeling uneasy about what happened in class. Can you tell me more about what led you to act out during the lesson?

User: Well, I was really bored, and I just wanted to have a little fun. But then I started messing around, and it escalated into a fight with another student.

Consultant: It sounds like boredom was a big trigger for you. When you started to feel bored, what thoughts were running through your mind?

User: I just thought it was a waste of time, and I felt like I didn’t want to be there anymore. But then things got out of hand, and I didn’t mean to fight.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel frustrated when you're not engaged. Let’s explore that feeling. When you thought it was a waste of time, how did that make you feel emotionally?

User: I felt really restless and like I needed to do something else. That’s when I decided to act out, but it didn’t feel good after.

Consultant: It sounds like the restlessness and needing to do something led to those actions that you now regret. How do you think you could handle feeling bored in class differently next time?

User: I guess I could try to think of something else to focus on, instead of just making noise. But I’m not sure what to do.

Consultant: That's a good start! We can work on some alternative behaviors you can try when you feel bored. Can you think of any activities or strategies that might help you stay engaged?

User: Maybe I could draw something quietly or ask the teacher if I can help with something. 

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Drawing or helping the teacher are productive ways to channel that energy when you feel bored. How do you think practicing these strategies will help you in the long run?

User: If I can focus on those things instead, maybe I won't get distracted or cause trouble. I really want to stop feeling like this.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive goal to work towards! Focusing on healthy alternatives can really help you feel more in control. Let's also think about identifying when you start to feel bored or restless. What do you think could signal that it’s time for you to try one of these strategies?

User: Maybe if I start feeling fidgety or daydreaming too much, that’s when I should do something.

Consultant: That's a great insight! Recognizing those signals is a key step in changing your behavior. How confident do you feel about using these strategies in class?

User: I feel a little nervous, but also kind of hopeful. I want to try it.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about trying something new. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to take small steps. What will you do if you find it hard to use these strategies?

User: I think if I get stuck, I could remind myself why I wanted to change and try again. 

Consultant: That's a strong plan! Keeping your goals in mind can help you refocus. As we move forward, how about we check in on your progress together? This way, you can see how far you’ve come.

User: That sounds good! I hope to see some improvement.

Consultant: I believe you can make progress, Xiao Lv. Now, what are some encouraging words you could say to yourself to keep you motivated during this process?

User: Maybe something like, “It’s okay to try again,” or “I can do this if I just keep at it.”

Consultant: Those are excellent affirmations! Repeating positive messages to yourself can boost your confidence. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you have learned or discovered about yourself?

User: I learned that I need to pay attention to how I feel and have a plan for what to do next instead of just acting out.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization! You’ve shown great insight today. Before our next session, think about your triggers and how you're using your new strategies. 

User: I will! Thanks for helping me understand.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiao Lv! I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaolv! I'm really happy you're here today. How have you been feeling about your classes lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit frustrated because sometimes I don't get the lessons, and I just want to give up when things get hard.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed when you struggle to understand the lessons. Can you tell me more about what happens during those moments when you feel frustrated?

User: Well, when I don't understand something, I just lose interest and stop trying. I feel like everyone else is getting it, but I can’t keep up.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, especially when it feels like you're falling behind. It’s important to recognize that it's okay to struggle with understanding things. What would you like to achieve from our time together today?

User: I want to figure out how to keep trying even when I don't understand something. I want to feel more confident in class.

Consultant: Building that confidence in class is a great goal! Let’s start by discussing what you think might work well for you when you feel stuck. What are some strategies you’ve tried in the past when you didn’t understand a lesson?

User: Sometimes, I might ask the teacher a question, but I'm scared they’ll think I'm silly. Other times, I just don’t ask anything and wait to see if it gets better.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel hesitant to ask questions. Many people worry about what others might think. Remember, asking questions is one of the best ways to learn! How do you feel when you think about asking the teacher for help?

User: I feel nervous, like everyone is watching me, and I don't want to seem stupid.

Consultant: That’s a common feeling, Xiaolv. But remember that every student learns at their own pace, and teachers are there to help you. What if we brainstorm some small, specific questions you could ask next time to help you ease into it?

User: I think that could help! Maybe if I just ask one small thing, it won't feel so scary.

Consultant: Absolutely! Starting with one small question can make it easier and take some pressure off. Could you think of a specific lesson or topic where you could try this next time?

User: Yes, we are learning about fractions, and I don't really get it. I could ask about something simple, like how to add fractions.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Asking about adding fractions is specific and manageable. How would you feel about setting that as a goal for your next class?

User: I would feel good about that! It seems easier if I just think about that one question.

Consultant: Wonderful! Setting that goal can help you shift your focus and make the situation feel less overwhelming. Let’s also talk about celebrating your progress, no matter how small. How might you reward yourself after you ask your question in class?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to my favorite snack afterward. That would be nice!

Consultant: That sounds like a fun idea! Associating your effort with something enjoyable can help motivate you even more. How does it feel to think about asking that question and rewarding yourself afterward?

User: It makes me feel a bit excited! I think I can do it.

Consultant: That's a fantastic mindset! Feeling excited is an excellent sign. Alongside this approach, let's think about your long-term goals for learning. What are some subjects or skills you’d like to improve on in the future?

User: I want to get better at math so I can understand all the lessons. I also want to read better because I struggle with that too.

Consultant: Those are great goals, Xiaolv! Improving in math and reading will help you feel more confident in class. Would you like to break these goals down into smaller steps that we can work on together?

User: Yes, I’d like that! It sounds less scary if I can take small steps. 

Consultant: Exactly! Small, achievable steps can make progress feel more manageable. Let's create a simple plan together with specific goals for math and reading over the next few weeks. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I think having a plan will help me not feel lost.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Creating a plan will be a great way to guide your progress. For your math goal, we can focus on fractions first. What about reading? Is there a specific area in reading where you want to improve?

User: I think I need help with understanding what I read, like the main ideas and details.

Consultant: Understanding the main ideas can be very helpful! We can practice summarizing what you read together and find some easy texts to start with. What do you think about that approach?

User: I like that idea! It’ll help me to really get what I read.

Consultant: Great! So, we have a plan. You're going to ask about adding fractions in class and start practicing summarizing what you read. Remember to reward yourself for your efforts. How do you feel about everything we've discussed today?

User: I feel a lot better! I’m excited to try these ideas and see how it goes.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! You're already making wonderful steps toward your goals. As we wrap up today, remember that you can always come back if you need more support or want to share your progress. You’re doing incredibly well, Xiaolv!

User: Thank you! I feel more confident now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing about your successes next time. Keep up the great work, and I believe in you!

Consultant: Hi there, Xiao Lv! It’s wonderful to see you today. I understand you’ve had some recent successes in your learning improvement plan. How are you feeling about that?

User: Hi! Yes, I felt really happy when I got some small successes in my studies. It makes me want to keep trying more, but I still don't really know what my long-term goals should be.

Consultant: That’s great to hear you’re feeling excited about your successes! It’s okay not to have everything figured out yet. Let’s explore what those long-term goals might look like together. What kind of achievements or outcomes would you hope to see in your studies over time?

User: I guess I want to be able to participate more in class, maybe get better grades and also feel more confident when talking to others.

Consultant: Those are fantastic aspirations, Xiao Lv. Participating more in class and feeling confident when interacting with others can really enhance your overall learning experience. How do you feel when you think about participating in class? 

User: Sometimes I feel scared to raise my hand, but when I do and get it right, it feels really good!

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a mix of emotions there—fear and then joy when you succeed. That’s very normal. Let’s think about ways to build on that joy. What small steps could you take to participate more often in class? 

User: Maybe I could practice answering questions at home before school. That might help me feel less scared.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Practicing at home can boost your confidence and make you feel more prepared. How often do you think you could set aside time for this practice?

User: I could maybe do it a couple of times a week. That sounds doable.

Consultant: Perfect! Setting realistic goals is key. Let’s also think about how you can celebrate those small successes when you practice and participate in class. What kind of reward or acknowledgment would make you feel good?

User: I’d like to share it with my family. If they know about my little successes, they will be proud, and I’ll feel happy!

Consultant: Sharing your successes with your family is a wonderful way to stay motivated. Their support can really reinforce your progress. How would you feel about setting a goal of sharing your accomplishments with them each week? 

User: I think that would be nice! It would feel like I’m not alone in this.

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s important to feel supported. Let’s also talk about your experiences in team activities. How do you feel you contribute during those times? 

User: I like working with my classmates in groups, and sometimes I help others with their work. That makes me feel good about myself.

Consultant: That’s a great strength to have, Xiao Lv! Recognizing your contributions in group activities shows you have valuable skills. How could you use that same teamwork approach in your class participation? 

User: Maybe I could ask someone to team up with me for answering questions! That way I wouldn't feel so nervous.

Consultant: What a clever strategy! Pairing up can make a big difference in easing anxiety. Have you thought about who you might want to team up with? 

User: There’s a friend in my class who seems nice. I think he would want to help.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Collaborating with a friend could make it more enjoyable. Let’s set a goal where you can try this out in your next class. How does that sound? 

User: I want to try that! I feel excited.

Consultant: I’m glad to see you’re feeling excited! It’s great that you have a positive outlook. Let’s also consider any other aspects of class that you find challenging. Are there other situations you want to work on?

User: Sometimes I feel scared about group discussions. I’m not sure what to say.

Consultant: Group discussions can be intimidating, but remember that your voice matters too! What if we brainstorm some ideas you could use to practice what you might say during those discussions? Would that help? 

User: Yes, that could help! I could write down some points before class.

Consultant: Excellent! Preparing some points in advance can give you more confidence and make it easier to contribute. How about we set a goal to write down a few ideas for the next group discussion?

User: I can do that! I feel like I’m improving.

Consultant: You definitely are, Xiao Lv! It’s wonderful to see your growth. To keep this momentum going, let’s talk about how you can check in with yourself after these experiences. What reflective questions could you ask yourself to note your feelings and improvements? 

User: Maybe I could ask myself what went well and what I learned after each class.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Reflecting on your experiences will help you recognize your progress and areas to work on. How frequently would you like to do this reflection? 

User: Maybe I can write it down in a notebook after school every day.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! Keeping a notebook will allow you to track your thoughts and accomplishments. Let’s make that a part of your weekly goals. How are you feeling about everything we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel really motivated! I think I have a better idea of how to reach my goals now.

Consultant: I’m so happy to hear that! Your motivation is inspiring, and it’s clear you have a solid plan to move forward. As we wrap up today’s session, remember that these small steps you’re planning are significant. You have the skills and support to make your goals a reality. 

User: Thank you! I can’t wait to try out all these ideas.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep believing in yourself, and don’t hesitate to share your successes with me next time. Have a great week, and I look forward to hearing all about it!

User: Bye! I will!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Lu! I'm glad to see you for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last time together? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good actually. I realized that I can be helpful and work well with others during our team activities, which makes me feel valuable.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've gained some confidence in your social skills, especially in a team setting. Can you tell me more about how you felt during those activities?

User: I felt happy when my classmates listened to my ideas. It was nice to contribute and see our project come together. I want to do well in class too, not just in groups.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Xiao Lu. It sounds like you want to translate that group success into your classroom work. What specifically do you think has helped you feel this way in the team, and how can we bring that into your class participation?

User: I think it was just knowing everyone was working together. I liked feeling like part of a team. But in class, it feels harder to speak up. 

Consultant: I completely understand. Sometimes, the atmosphere in class can be different from group activities. What are some thoughts or feelings that come up for you when you think about speaking up in class?

User: I get nervous that no one will listen or that I might say something wrong. It makes me not want to talk at all.

Consultant: Those feelings of nervousness are certainly common. Let's explore those thoughts together. When you think, "No one will listen," what evidence do you have for that thought? Can you recall times when your contributions were valued in class?

User: Well, there were times when I answered questions, and the teacher said good job. I guess some classmates paid attention then.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! It seems you do have some evidence that your contributions are appreciated at times. How might you remind yourself of this when you're feeling nervous about speaking up in class?

User: Maybe I can think about the times I did well when I want to talk. 

Consultant: That's an excellent strategy, Xiao Lu! Building on those positive experiences can help you feel more confident. What other ways can we practice this confidence during our session today?

User: I’d like to practice talking about things I might say in class. 

Consultant: Sure! Let's role-play a situation where you would share your thoughts in class. I can take on the role of a teacher asking for input. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I can practice answering questions.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine I'm asking you, “What do you think about our current project topic?” How would you respond?

User: I might say... “I think we should focus on teamwork because it helps us all learn from each other.” 

Consultant: That was a fantastic response! You clearly articulated a valuable point about teamwork. How did it feel to say that out loud?

User: It feels good. I think I did okay. 

Consultant: You absolutely did! This demonstrates that you have important insights to share. Let's try another scenario. If I asked, "Why is this project important?" how would you respond?

User: I think it’s important because we can learn to work together and also get better at our subject. 

Consultant: Excellent job again! You’re communicating your thoughts effectively. With practice, speaking up in class will become easier. Are there any other concerns about participating in class you’d like to address?

User: I worry about interruptions or if someone disagrees with me. 

Consultant: That's understandable. It's common to fear interruptions. One way to deal with disagreements is to remember that everyone has their own perspective. How do you think you might handle it if someone disagrees with you?

User: I guess I could listen to their point and maybe understand their view too. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Listening is a great skill, and it shows respect for others' ideas. We can frame disagreements as opportunities for discussion rather than threats. Would you like to practice that as well?

User: Yes, that would be helpful! 

Consultant: Okay. Let’s simulate a situation. Imagine I disagree with your idea about teamwork. I’ll say, “I don’t think teamwork is that important; I prefer to work alone.” How might you respond to that?

User: I might say, “But when we work as a team, we can learn from each other and finish faster. Have you tried teamwork before?” 

Consultant: That was a thoughtful response! You respectfully communicated your viewpoint while inviting further dialogue. How do you feel about using this approach in class?

User: It feels more comfortable now that I practice. I’ll try to use it. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! As you practice in class, remember to acknowledge your feelings but don't let them hold you back. Is there anything else you'd like to explore before we wrap up today?

User: I think I just need to believe more in myself. 

Consultant: Believing in yourself is key. Let's create a little mantra that you can tell yourself when you feel uncertain. How about something like, “I have valuable ideas to share, and it’s okay for me to speak up”?

User: I like that! I’ll use it. 

Consultant: Wonderful! I'm really proud of the progress you've made today, Xiao Lu. Remember, it's a process, and with each class, you're building your confidence. Before we end, do you feel you'll be able to apply what we've talked about in your next class?

User: Yes, I think I will! 

Consultant: I'm excited to hear that. You've done a great job today, and I look forward to our next session. If you run into challenges, remember we can work through them together. 

User: Thank you! I can’t wait till next time. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Lu! Take care and see you soon.

User: Hello! I've been feeling really good about my improvements. I’ve been more engaged in my classes and have been thinking a lot about how to behave better.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're feeling more motivated and aware of your actions. Can you tell me more about what specific changes you've noticed in your behavior or in your attitude towards studying?

User: Well, I’ve been paying more attention in class and actually trying to participate. I used to just sit silently, but now I raise my hand when I have questions or ideas.

Consultant: It's great that you're raising your hand and getting involved! That shows a lot of confidence. What do you think has helped you feel more willing to participate in class?

User: I think it's because I realized that my teachers want to help me, and they seem happier when I engage. I also just feel more confident in what I can say.

Consultant: It sounds like building a positive relationship with your teachers has been a big boost for you. Feeling supported can really make a difference. How has this newfound confidence affected your feelings towards studying at home?

User: I’ve started to set small goals for myself while studying. Like, I’ll decide to finish a chapter and then take a short break. It makes everything feel more manageable.

Consultant: Setting small goals is an effective strategy! It sounds like you've learned how to make studying less overwhelming for yourself. How do you feel after completing those goals?

User: I feel accomplished! It’s nice to see progress, even if it’s just a little bit at a time.

Consultant: Accomplishment can really motivate us to keep moving forward. What do you think you can do to maintain this positive feeling as you continue studying?

User: I guess I just need to keep reminding myself why I’m studying and how I can improve. Maybe celebrate my completing goals more!

Consultant: Celebrating your achievements, no matter how small, is a great idea! It reinforces your progress and keeps you motivated. What kind of celebrations do you think would work for you?

User: Maybe I can treat myself to a favorite snack after finishing my homework or enjoy some game time. That would make it fun!

Consultant: That sounds like a fun way to reward yourself! Combining study and enjoyment can help you maintain a positive attitude. Are there any challenges you feel you might face as you continue on this path?

User: Sometimes I get distracted easily, especially with my phone. I worry that I might fall back into old habits.

Consultant: It's good that you're aware of potential distractions. What plan can you come up with to limit those distractions while studying?

User: I could leave my phone in another room or set specific times for breaks when I can use it.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Creating boundaries around your phone use can definitely help you stay focused during study time. How does that plan make you feel?

User: It makes me feel more in control of my studying. I like having a clear plan.

Consultant: Feeling in control is empowering! As we wrap up today, let’s take a moment to reflect on your journey so far. What do you feel is your greatest achievement in this process?

User: I think my greatest achievement is being able to speak up in class and take responsibility for my own learning.

Consultant: That's a huge accomplishment, Xiao Lv! You're showing remarkable growth in your confidence and engagement. How do you plan to celebrate this achievement?

User: I might tell my family about my progress and see if we can have a little celebration meal together!

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely way to share your success with your family. Remember, maintaining communication with them about your progress can further support you. As we conclude today, what advice would you give yourself to stay on this positive track?

User: I would tell myself to keep believing in my abilities and not be afraid to ask for help when I need it.

Consultant: That's valuable advice! It’s important to trust in yourself and seek support when needed. You've done such incredible work, and remember, I'm here if you need more guidance. I look forward to seeing you again soon!

User: Thank you! I’m happy with how things are going and will try to keep it up!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Xiao Lv. Keep celebrating your progress, and I believe you’ll continue to thrive. See you next time!
