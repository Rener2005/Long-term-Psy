Consultant: Hello Li Ming, it's good to see you again. Today, I want to hear more about your experiences since our last session. How have things been for you, especially with the recent challenges you’ve been facing?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’ve been feeling even more overwhelmed. The project at work is demanding a lot of my time and energy, and with my wife needing extra care, I feel like I’m constantly juggling responsibilities without any relief.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Li Ming. Balancing those responsibilities can create a lot of pressure. Can you share more about how you're coping with these feelings of being overwhelmed?

User: I try to keep going, but I often find myself getting anxious about deadlines. I sometimes feel like I'm not doing enough at work or at home, which just adds to my stress.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way given everything on your plate. When those anxious thoughts arise, what specific thoughts do you notice crossing your mind?

User: I often think that if I don't meet my work deadlines, I’ll disappoint my team. At home, I worry that I’m not being a good enough father or husband.

Consultant: Those thoughts are very powerful, and it's completely normal to feel that pressure. How do those thoughts make you feel emotionally and physically?

User: They make me feel really anxious and sometimes even a bit hopeless. I feel tightness in my chest and struggle to concentrate. It’s hard to focus on anything.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Li Ming. It seems these thoughts are contributing to your anxiety and impacting your ability to concentrate. Have you noticed if these thoughts have a particular pattern or if they seem to disrupt your day more at certain times?

User: Yes, they definitely seem to get worse in the evenings, when I think about the next day’s tasks. It’s like I can’t shut my mind off.

Consultant: That’s a common experience. It might help to explore those thoughts further. Can you think of a specific situation recently when you felt those thoughts escalating? What was happening at that moment?

User: Last week, I had a presentation for my project. I was still working on it late the night before, worrying that it wouldn’t be good enough.

Consultant: Presentations can be particularly stressful. What were some of the thoughts you had during that time about your presentation? 

User: I thought, “What if my colleagues think I’m not prepared?” and “What if my project fails?” I was really fixated on those fears.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite overwhelming. Let’s take a moment to consider how much evidence there is to support those fears. Do you have any past experiences where you felt similarly anxious but things turned out okay?

User: I remember a time when I thought a lesson would go poorly, but it ended up being well received. I suppose I do have some positive experiences, but in that moment, I tend to forget them.

Consultant: That’s a great insight. It’s common for our minds to focus on the negative; that’s something we can work on together. What would it look like for you to challenge those fears? What might you say to yourself instead when those thoughts arise?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that I’ve done well in the past, and that everyone has their off days.

Consultant: Absolutely, that’s a positive reframing. Let’s think about how you can apply this in real situations. For instance, during your next presentation, how could you remind yourself of those past successes?

User: I could write them down and read them before the presentation. That might help me feel more confident.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical approach, Li Ming. Engaging in self-affirmations can be beneficial. Now, shifting gears a bit, are there activities or strategies you’ve found that help you manage stress outside of work?

User: I used to enjoy going for walks or spending time with my son, but recently, I haven’t made time for those.

Consultant: It's significant that you enjoyed those activities. Nurturing those interests can be a helpful way to relieve stress. How might you fit some of those activities into your schedule?

User: I guess I could take short walks during my breaks or play with my son in the evenings for a bit of a distraction.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Taking those small breaks can recharge your energy and improve your mood. There might be days when finding that time feels difficult, but even a few minutes can make a difference. How do you feel about implementing that idea?

User: I think it could help. I definitely need moments to step away from the stress.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Moving forward, let’s focus on identifying those challenging thoughts and practicing your positive reframing strategy. How do you feel about our discussion today? 

User: It feels good to understand that I have some control over how I perceive these stressful situations. 

Consultant: That’s a meaningful realization, Li Ming. Remember, it’s a process, and with each step, you are building resilience. For our next session, let’s continue exploring these strategies and see how they affect your experiences. 

User: Sounds good! Thank you for your help today!

Consultant: You’re welcome! I look forward to our next conversation. Take care, Li Ming!

Consultant: Hello Li Ming, I'm glad to see you again! How have things been for you since our last session? 

User: Hi! I’ve had a lot on my plate. Work has been relentless, and I feel like I'm constantly missing out on time with my family. The pressure is just building up.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really feeling the strain of juggling work and family responsibilities. Can you share more about how that pressure has been affecting you lately?

User: I find myself getting easily frustrated and anxious. Sometimes I snap at my family without meaning to, and I feel guilty afterward, which just adds to my stress.

Consultant: That’s understandable, Li Ming. It’s tough feeling overwhelmed, and then noticing it impacting your relationships. What specific thoughts cross your mind when you're feeling this way?

User: I often think I’m failing both as a teacher and as a dad. It feels like I can never do enough, and I’m constantly letting everyone down.

Consultant: Those feelings seem quite heavy to carry. How do those thoughts make you feel emotionally and physically?

User: They make me feel trapped and anxious, like I can't breathe. I get a tightness in my chest, and it’s hard to focus on anything else.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that openness, Li Ming. It seems your thoughts are leading to some intense feelings. Have you considered what specific situations trigger these thoughts, especially during your busy periods?

User: Definitely. The worst times are usually in the evenings when I’m trying to finish work and I see my son wanting to play, but I feel I must stay focused on my tasks.

Consultant: I see, that’s a challenging situation to be in. Can you think back to a recent evening when you felt this conflict of time and responsibility? What were you feeling and thinking?

User: Just last week, I was working on some important paperwork while my son kept asking me to read him a story. I felt guilty for not engaging with him, but I was also anxious about that deadline.

Consultant: It sounds like a tough balance. What were some of the thoughts that went through your mind while your son was asking for your attention?

User: I just kept thinking that if I stopped working, I wouldn't finish in time, and that would make everything worse. But then I felt awful for ignoring him.

Consultant: Those conflicting thoughts can create a lot of internal tension. What evidence do you think supports those fears about not meeting the deadline? Are there instances from the past where you’ve managed to balance work and family?

User: Actually, I recall times where I took a short break to connect with my family, and then I felt more productive afterward. I guess I don’t always remember that in the moment.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! It highlights the potential benefit of stepping away for moments of connection. How might you remind yourself of those past experiences when you feel the pressure building again?

User: I could try to think back to those times and tell myself that taking a moment for my family isn't a setback—it might actually help me in the long run.

Consultant: Exactly, that’s a powerful reframe. Let’s discuss how you can practically integrate that kind of thinking into your daily routines. How could you set aside some intentional time with your son, even amidst your busy schedule?

User: I could schedule short play times or story breaks so that I can still get some work done but also have moments with him throughout the day.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful strategy! Creating those small, dedicated moments can reduce feelings of guilt and help reinforce your bond with your son. How do you feel about practical steps like this moving forward?

User: I feel optimistic about trying it. I need to prioritize those moments, and it might just help balance things out better.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember that these changes may take time, and that’s completely normal. It’s a process of finding what works best for you and your family. Do you have a specific goal in mind for our next session?

User: I’d like to discuss how I feel after trying these strategies and see if I can recognize any shifts in my thoughts or feelings in those moments.

Consultant: That sounds great! We can explore your experiences and evaluate how those moments of connection impact your stress levels. Thank you for sharing so openly today, Li Ming. 

User: Thank you for your support! I’m looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I believe in your ability to navigate this challenge. Take care until we meet again, Li Ming!

Consultant: Hello Li Ming, it's great to see you again! How have things been for you since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to balance everything, but it still feels overwhelming. I haven't implemented the scheduled breaks with my son yet, and I can feel the stress building up again.

Consultant: I understand. It can be difficult to make time for breaks when you're feeling the pressure. What has been stopping you from integrating those moments with your son into your schedule?

User: I think I keep underestimating how much I need those breaks. I feel guilty taking time away from my work, even if I know it's important for me and for my family.

Consultant: That guilt can be a powerful barrier. It’s normal to feel that way, but it sounds like prioritizing those connections could help alleviate some of your stress. What thoughts cross your mind when you consider taking a break?

User: I worry that if I take a break, I'll fall behind on my work, and then I won't meet my deadlines. It feels like a conflict.

Consultant: That’s a tough situation to navigate. However, you've mentioned that past experiences have shown you taking breaks actually improves your productivity. How might you remind yourself of that evidence in those moments of guilt?

User: I guess I could have a note or something nearby that says, "Taking a break helps you recharge." Just to reaffirm that it's okay to step away for a bit.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Visual reminders can be very effective. Now, thinking about your upcoming week, can you identify specific times when you could incorporate those short breaks with your son?

User: Maybe I could set aside 15 minutes in the afternoon for a quick game or read him a story before I resume my work.

Consultant: That sounds like a realistic and manageable plan, Li Ming. Engaging in those quick activities can help break the cycle of pressure and provide you both with joy. How does that prospect feel to you?

User: It feels good! I think it could work, and it's nice to have something to look forward to.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on small, consistent moments can make a significant difference. As you implement this, remember to check in with your emotions. How do you expect you might feel after those brief moments with your son?

User: I believe I’d feel lighter and maybe even more focused afterward, less overwhelmed by everything.

Consultant: That’s a positive outlook! Let’s also discuss your thoughts when you do feel overwhelmed. Are there specific strategies you can use in those moments to help manage that anxiety?

User: I think I could take a few deep breaths and remind myself of the positive feelings from those planned breaks.

Consultant: That’s a solid strategy! Deep breathing can help calm your mind. We can practice that together. Would you like to try a short breathing exercise now?

User: Sure, that sounds helpful!

Consultant: Alright, let’s take a moment. Breathe in deeply through your nose for a count of four... hold for a count of four... and now breathe out slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Let’s repeat that a couple of times. How does that feel?

User: It feels nice and calming. I can see how this would help me in stressful moments.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Incorporating brief moments of mindfulness can be very beneficial during stressful times. Moving forward, how do you plan to remind yourself to use this technique alongside your scheduled breaks?

User: I could try to link the deep breathing with my scheduled break time. Maybe take a moment before I engage with my son to clear my mind.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan, Li Ming. This way, you can approach your breaks with a clear and open mindset. As we conclude today, how are you feeling about the strategies we've discussed?

User: I feel more optimistic now. Knowing that I have some tools to help manage my stress makes a difference.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Remember, you’re taking steps in the right direction. Let’s keep working on these strategies in our next session and see how they impact your overall experience.

User: Thank you! I appreciate the guidance.

Consultant: You're welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences. Take care until we meet again, Li Ming!

Consultant: Hello Li Ming, it’s wonderful to see you again! How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been trying to implement the breaks with my son, but I still struggle with feeling overwhelmed. I sometimes still hesitate to step away from my work.

Consultant: It’s great to hear you’re trying to implement those breaks. However, it sounds like it’s still challenging for you to balance work and family. Can you share more about what makes stepping away difficult for you?

User: I often feel that if I take a break, I'll miss critical deadlines. It’s hard to shake off the guilt of not being productive when I know there’s so much to be done.

Consultant: That guilt can truly weigh heavily, especially when you feel pulled in different directions. When you think about taking those breaks, what specific thoughts tend to arise?

User: I worry that I'm letting my team down and that I won’t be able to catch up if I take any time off. It makes me second-guess my need for breaks.

Consultant: Those thoughts can create an internal conflict. It’s understandable to feel that way when responsibilities pile up. Reflecting on last week, did you have instances where you allowed yourself a break? How did those moments feel?

User: Yes, I did manage to play a game with my son for a few minutes last week. It felt good, but I struggled with the thought that I should be working instead.

Consultant: It’s fantastic that you took that time, even if it was short. Those small moments can make a difference. What if you were to remind yourself of the positive feelings that came from that break? How might that impact your decision to take similar breaks in the future?

User: I guess I could use that experience to reassure myself that taking a break isn’t wasting time—it can actually recharge me for work.

Consultant: Absolutely! Connecting positive experiences to your breaks could help ease that guilt. As you think about the upcoming week, how can you intentionally create opportunities for those short breaks with your son?

User: I could set reminders on my phone to take breaks when I finish certain tasks. That way, I know it’s okay to step away for a moment.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical strategy! How do you feel about setting those reminders and making that commitment to yourself?

User: I feel hopeful. Just having that structure might help me remember to pause rather than push through everything.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! It’s all about creating that space for yourself and your family. Now, while implementing this, are there any specific feelings or thoughts you want to focus on addressing when you notice the overwhelm starting to build?

User: I think I need to remind myself that it’s normal to need breaks—that rest can actually help me be more productive.

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation. It’s important to acknowledge your needs. Would you also like to explore some techniques to help you manage anxiety during particularly stressful moments?

User: Yes, that could be really useful. I often feel anxiety creeping in, especially when I have looming deadlines.

Consultant: Let’s try a deep breathing technique together. This can help soothe anxiety. Would you like to practice that now with me?

User: Sure, I’d love to try!

Consultant: Alright, let’s begin. Take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four... hold it for a count of four... now slowly exhale through your mouth for a count of six. Let’s do this a couple of times. How does that feel for you?
