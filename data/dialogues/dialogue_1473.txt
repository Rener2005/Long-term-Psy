Consultant: Hello, Xiao Hao! I'm glad you're here for today's session. Before we dive in, can you share how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really down and confused. There are times I just want to cry for no reason. My head often feels dizzy, and I hear ringing in my ears. I’m not really sure what's going on.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s important to understand these feelings you’re experiencing. Could you tell me more about when these emotions and physical symptoms started happening?

User: I think it started a few months ago. I just feel lost sometimes, especially since my parents work away and I’m living with my grandma. Sometimes I just wish they were around more.

Consultant: I can see how you might feel lonely and unsettled without your parents nearby. Living with your grandma must be a big adjustment. How do you think your relationship with your parents affects how you're feeling now?

User: I feel kind of abandoned, I guess. They are busy with work, so I don’t feel like they really understand what I’m going through. It’s like they don’t even know me anymore.

Consultant: That’s really understandable. When parents are not physically present, it can create a sense of emotional distance. It sounds like you long for their connection and support. What do you think you would want them to know about what you’re feeling?

User: I want them to know that I’m hurting and it’s hard to deal with everything alone. I wish they could see me more than just a student. I need them to understand I'm struggling.

Consultant: It’s important for parents to see the emotional side of their children, not just their academic life. Would it help if we explored ways for you to express these feelings to them?

User: Maybe. But I just don’t know how to tell them without making them feel guilty for not being here.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. You want to express your feelings without putting blame on them. We could work together on wording that might help convey your feelings more gently. How does that sound?

User: That might be okay, but what if they just don’t get it? I fear they’ll just brush it off as normal teenage stuff.

Consultant: That fear is real, and it can be disheartening. Let’s think about how we can validate your experiences. Sometimes highlighting specific feelings you have can help them understand better. Can we try identifying a particular moment when you felt especially overwhelmed?

User: There was a moment last week when I was trying to study for my tests. I felt completely blank and didn't know where to start. It made me feel like a failure.

Consultant: Feeling blocked when trying to study is frustrating, and it's understandable to feel down about it. It sounds like that moment triggered a lot of self-doubt. What thoughts went through your mind when that happened?

User: I kept thinking that I’m not smart enough to handle this and that everyone else is doing better than me.

Consultant: That’s a common thought pattern, and it can be very hard to combat. Let’s challenge those beliefs a bit. How much evidence do you really have that you are not smart enough, or that everyone is doing better?

User: I guess I don’t know for sure. I just feel like that’s the truth, you know? It’s hard to see things differently.

Consultant: I understand how challenging it can be to shift those beliefs. Sometimes, gathering realistic evidence can help put things in perspective. What if we tried to list some of your strengths or successes, even small ones? 

User: Well, I did pass my last math test, and my teacher said I have potential in science.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Those are real achievements that show you do have the capability to succeed. It’s easy to overlook those when you’re feeling down. How do you feel reflecting on those accomplishments?

User: I feel a little better. But the feeling of sadness and pressure still lingers.

Consultant: That’s completely normal. Emotions can be complex, and it might take time to unravel them. Let's talk about some activities or strategies that could help lift your spirits a bit. Have you done anything enjoyable recently?

User: Not really. I’ve mostly been too overwhelmed to enjoy anything.

Consultant: That’s understandable. When we feel overwhelmed, it can be hard to engage in things that bring joy. Can we brainstorm some small activities that might interest you? 

User: I used to enjoy drawing. Maybe I could try that again.

Consultant: Drawing sounds like a wonderful idea! It can be a great outlet for emotions and a way to relax. How about setting aside a few minutes each day to draw something, even if it’s just for yourself?

User: I might try that. It feels nice to think about doing something creative.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s important to give yourself those moments to express and unwind. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed—how can you incorporate these thoughts and activities into your daily life?

User: I’ll try to draw and maybe talk to my parents about my feelings. It’s a start, right?

Consultant: Absolutely, that’s a great start! Remember, expressing those feelings and engaging in creative activities can help you feel more connected and balanced. I’m proud of you for taking these steps.

User: Thanks. I appreciate that. This has been helpful.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Hao. Remember, it's a journey, and taking these steps at your own pace is perfectly okay. If you ever need to revisit these feelings or anything else, I’m here to help.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaohao! I'm glad you're here for our session today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite lonely. Since my parents have been away for work, I just feel so distanced from them. It's like I don't know how to communicate my feelings.

Consultant: I understand that you're feeling this loneliness, especially with your parents being away. It can be really tough when family connections seem distant. Can you tell me more about what you’re experiencing?

User: It just feels like they don't understand me at all. I mean, they are working hard, but it's almost like I’ve become invisible to them. I don’t even know how to bring up my feelings.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling both disconnected and misunderstood by your parents. That's a tough place to be in. What kind of feelings come up for you when you think about this situation?

User: I feel frustrated and a bit angry. I want them to understand that I'm struggling, but I also feel scared to show them my true emotions.

Consultant: Frustration and fear are completely valid feelings, especially in your situation. It seems like there's this conflict between wanting to express yourself and the fear of how they might react. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that go through your mind when you feel this way?

User: I often think that if I tell them how I feel, they'll either dismiss it or blame me for not being able to handle things better. So, I try to keep it inside.

Consultant: That sounds really heavy to carry alone. It sounds like you’re worried about their potential reactions and feel trapped in your own feelings. Let’s take a moment to explore that thought of them possibly dismissing your feelings. What evidence do you have that they would react that way?

User: Well, in the past, whenever I've tried to talk to them about issues at school or my feelings, they seemed preoccupied or changed the subject. It makes me think they're not interested.

Consultant: It makes sense that those past experiences would shape your thoughts about how they might react now. Have you considered that their busyness could also influence their ability to engage in those conversations?

User: I guess that could be true. But it just feels like they’ve been too busy for me for a long time.

Consultant: I hear you, that must be really difficult to feel ignored. It’s important to acknowledge that while they might be busy, it doesn’t diminish your need for connection. What would it look like for you to express your feelings to them, despite these past experiences?

User: I suppose I could write them a letter. That way, I could say everything I need to without worrying about an immediate reaction.

Consultant: Writing a letter could be a wonderful way to express yourself! It allows you to gather your thoughts and convey your feelings at your own pace. How do you think you would feel after writing that letter?

User: I think it might actually feel relieving to get everything off my chest. But I’m still scared about how they’ll react after reading it.

Consultant: Those feelings of relief mixed with fear are quite common in these situations. Would it help to visualize what an ideal response from them might look like? How would you hope they would react?

User: I’d hope they would take it seriously and want to talk more, maybe even apologize for not being there lately. That would make me feel much better.

Consultant: That's a great hope. So, if they responded in that way, you might feel understood and less alone. Acknowledging this could guide how you approach writing your letter. Let's also think about how you might maintain your emotional stability while waiting for their response. What strategies do you think could help?

User: Maybe I could talk to a friend or focus on my hobbies when waiting. That might help take my mind off things.

Consultant: Engaging in activities you enjoy or speaking to friends can definitely be effective ways to manage your emotions. It's important to have those outlets. How confident do you feel about taking this step with your letter and encouraging the communication with your parents?

User: I feel a bit more confident now. I think I can do it. 

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Building that confidence is a huge step. Remember, it’s okay to share your feelings—your emotions are valid. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’d like to work on before our next session. 

User: I want to write that letter and try to find ways to cope with my emotions while I wait for their response.

Consultant: Excellent goals, Xiaohao! You're making progress towards understanding your feelings and expressing them. We can revisit this in our next session and discuss how it went. Remember, it's all about taking one step at a time. I'm here to support you!

User: Thank you. I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing about your experience next time. Take care and see you soon!

Consultant: Hello Xiaohao! I'm glad you're here today. Let's talk about what you've been experiencing recently. How have things been for you?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit lost lately. I've been trying to get involved with school activities, but it seems like no one really supports me. It feels overwhelming, and I’ve had some emotional outbursts that I didn’t expect.

Consultant: I see. You're feeling overwhelmed and struggling to find emotional support in your activities. It’s completely understandable to feel this way. What do you think has triggered these emotional reactions?

User: I think it’s partly because I feel so lonely. My parents are often away for work, and I just have my grandma with me. I want to connect with classmates, but it feels really hard.

Consultant: That sounds tough, especially with the changes in your family situation. Wanting to connect with others is natural, but the feeling of loneliness can be quite challenging. Have you identified specific situations in school that make you feel particularly isolated?

User: Yes, during group activities, I often feel left out. Sometimes I feel like my classmates have formed their own groups. I just wish I could be part of that.

Consultant: It’s hard to feel excluded, especially in a social setting. Your desire to belong is valid. Can you share what thoughts go through your mind when you feel left out during these activities?

User: I often think that maybe they don’t like me, or that I’m not interesting enough to be included. It makes me very anxious.

Consultant: Those thoughts must be weighing heavily on you. It's important to explore how these thoughts impact your emotions. How do you feel emotionally when these thoughts occur?

User: I feel anxious and sometimes even get angry at myself. I start avoiding the activities because I don't want to feel hurt again.

Consultant: Avoidance can often seem like a way to protect yourself, but it can end up reinforcing your feelings of isolation. What if we started thinking about ways to gradually face these situations, rather than avoiding them? 

User: I guess I could try joining in more, but it feels scary.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel scared; that’s a normal reaction. We can create a step-by-step plan to help you face those situations. What’s one small thing you could do this week to engage with your classmates?

User: Maybe I could try sitting with them during lunch instead of just watching from the side.

Consultant: That sounds like a great starting point! It’s a small step, but it could lead to greater connections. How do you feel about setting this as a goal for yourself?

User: I feel a bit nervous about it, but I think I want to try. It might work.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you are willing to give it a shot! Remember, it’s completely normal to have some nervousness. We can also talk about how to handle your feelings if things don’t go as planned. 

User: That would be helpful. Sometimes I just get really overwhelmed.

Consultant: Absolutely. Having a plan for both success and challenges can ease some of that anxiety. When you feel overwhelmed, what do you usually do to cope?

User: I sometimes talk to my grandma, but I feel like she doesn't understand everything I'm going through.

Consultant: It’s nice that you reach out to your grandma. Would you like to practice some self-soothing techniques that you could use whenever you feel overwhelmed?

User: Sure, that sounds okay. What do you suggest?

Consultant: One technique is to take a few deep breaths when you start to feel overwhelmed. It can help you to calm down and regain focus. Let’s practice some together. Inhale deeply... and exhale slowly...

User: Okay, I can do that. It feels a bit calming.

Consultant: Great work! Remember, using your breath can anchor you in the moment. Now, let's talk about how journaling about your experiences can help. Have you ever kept a journal?

User: No, I haven’t really tried that before.

Consultant: Journaling can be a powerful tool for reflection. You can write down your thoughts and feelings after engaging in activities; it helps you process your experiences. Would you be open to trying that?

User: Yes, I think so. It might help me understand my feelings better.

Consultant: That's a positive step forward! It will also allow you to track your progress and see the patterns in your thoughts and emotions. How do you feel about all these strategies we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful and less alone, actually. Having a plan makes me feel like I have some control.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Remember, you’re not alone on this journey. You are taking significant steps toward building your social skills and coping strategies. How confident do you feel about trying the lunch plan we discussed?

User: I feel a bit more confident now. I think I can at least try it once.

Consultant: That’s the right mindset! It doesn't have to be perfect—it’s about progress. Let’s plan to discuss your experience in our next session. 

User: Okay, I’m looking forward to it. Thank you for helping me talk about this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of you for being open and willing to work on these challenges. Remember, take it step by step, and we’ll build on this together. 

User: Yes, I feel like I can handle this better now. Thank you!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Xiaohao! You've made a lot of progress today, and I’m here to support you whenever you need. See you next time!

User: See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaohao! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing okay, but I've been thinking a lot about joining the study group. I'm really excited, but also a bit nervous about meeting new people.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Joining a new group can bring up mixed feelings. Can you share with me what specifically excites and worries you about this study group?

User: Well, I'm excited because I think it will help me learn better and make friends. But I'm also worried that I won’t fit in or that I won't be able to contribute meaningfully.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you see the potential for both learning and socializing. Let's explore that worry about fitting in a bit more. What makes you feel like you might not be able to contribute?

User: I guess I’m just afraid that everyone else will be smarter than me, and I won’t have anything valuable to share.

Consultant: That’s a very common concern. Often, we tend to underestimate our own abilities compared to others. Can you recall any past experiences where you felt you contributed positively in a group setting?

User: Yes, there was a group project last year where I helped organize our presentation, and my classmates appreciated my input.

Consultant: That sounds like a valuable experience! You were capable and appreciated by your classmates. How might you remind yourself of this when you're feeling doubtful about your contributions in the new group?

User: I could think about how I helped before and maybe write down some of my strengths to remember.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Writing down your strengths can serve as a helpful reminder. Now, let's imagine how you would introduce yourself to this new group. What would you say?

User: I might say, “Hi, I'm Xiaohao, and I'm looking forward to working together. I’m excited to learn from all of you!”

Consultant: That sounds really welcoming and positive! How do you feel about that introduction?

User: I feel a bit better saying it out loud, but I still worry about how they will react.

Consultant: It’s normal to worry about reactions, but remember, most people appreciate honesty and enthusiasm. Would you like to practice some responses in case their reactions vary?

User: Yes, that would help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Great! Let’s say someone responds positively—what might you say next?

User: I could say something like, “Thanks! I really hope we can all help each other out.”

Consultant: That’s an excellent follow-up! Now, how about if someone seems a bit indifferent or quiet? How could you handle that?

User: Maybe I could ask them a question about how they like to study or what their favorite subjects are.

Consultant: I love that idea! Asking questions shows interest in others, and it can help build connections. How do you feel about using these strategies during your first meeting?

User: I feel more confident. I think having a plan makes it less intimidating!

Consultant: Absolutely! Having a plan can really ease anxiety. Are there any other specific worries or concerns you would like to discuss regarding the study group?

User: No, I think we covered most of what I was feeling. I just hope I can stick to this plan when the time comes.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a solid approach. To reinforce this plan, it might be helpful to visualize your first meeting going well. Can you picture it? 

User: Yes, I can. I see myself engaging with others, sharing ideas, and feeling comfortable.

Consultant: That’s an uplifting image! Before we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize what you’ve gained. You have strategies for your introduction, responses for different reactions, and your strengths written down as reminders. How do you feel about your progress today?

User: I feel much better! I think I can really make this work now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Remember, you’ve built a lot of skills and confidence, and you can always come back if you need more support. I believe in your ability to connect with others. How about we set a goal for our next session?

User: Yes! I want to reflect on my experience after the first group meeting and see how I feel about my contributions.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! I look forward to hearing about it. You’ve made excellent progress, Xiaohao. Keep fostering that confidence, and I’ll see you next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaohao! It's great to see you again. I'm looking forward to our session today. How have you been feeling lately, especially after participating in the volunteer activities?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good actually. Helping out with the library made me feel useful and important. It was a nice change from my usual routine.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It sounds like you found a real sense of purpose in those activities. What specific aspects of volunteering made you feel important?

User: I think it was just knowing that my efforts were helping others, like organizing books and assisting classmates who needed help. It felt rewarding.

Consultant: That’s wonderful. Feeling rewarded and valuable can significantly boost self-esteem. Can you describe how this experience has affected your emotional stability since we last met?

User: Well, I feel more balanced and less caught up in negative thoughts. It’s like doing something positive shifted my mindset.

Consultant: That's a significant improvement! It's amazing to see how engaging in positive actions can influence your thoughts and feelings. Are there moments when you notice those nagging thoughts trying to creep back in?

User: Sometimes. Like when I think about my studies, I worry I won’t do well. It makes me anxious, but I try to focus on how well volunteering helped me.

Consultant: It makes sense that the pressure from school could still bring about those anxious feelings. Let’s explore that worry you have about studying. What specific thoughts go through your mind when you're overwhelmed by those concerns?

User: I often think, "What if I fail?" or "I'm not good enough" when I see my classmates doing better.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite harsh and can definitely contribute to your anxiety. It's important to recognize that these are negative automatic thoughts. How do these thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: They make me feel really stressed and like I want to give up sometimes.

Consultant: I understand. Stress can be overwhelming. Let's take a moment to question those thoughts—what evidence do you have that supports the idea that you will fail or that you're not good enough?

User: I guess I don't have actual proof. It's just how I feel when I'm stressed.

Consultant: That's a key insight! Our feelings can often distort reality. If a friend were in your position, what would you say to support them?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to struggle sometimes and remind them of their past successes.

Consultant: Exactly! You would encourage them to view things more positively, just as you deserve that same kindness toward yourself. What would it look like for you to challenge those negative thoughts moving forward?

User: I could remind myself of my strengths and the good feedback I've gotten from teachers about my volunteering effort.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Keep reminding yourself of your strengths and the positive experiences you’ve had. Let’s also think about how you might incorporate more activities that reinforce this positive mindset. Is there anything else you'd like to engage in besides volunteering?

User: Maybe I could join a study group or even help classmates with their schoolwork. That way I could feel helpful again.

Consultant: Joining a study group is an excellent idea! It allows you to help others while reinforcing your own learning. You could keep a journal reflecting on these experiences. How do you feel about documenting your thoughts and feelings after these activities?

User: I think writing it down would help me see my progress and hold on to those positive feelings better.

Consultant: Absolutely! Documenting your journey can help solidify those emotions and reflect on your growth. As we wrap up today’s session, could you summarize what we've discussed and any key actions you’d like to take moving forward?

User: Sure! I’ll focus on challenging my negative thoughts, remind myself of my achievements, and join a study group while keeping a journal about my experiences.

Consultant: That's a fantastic plan! You've shown great insight today, and I believe you’re well on your way to continuing this positive mindset. Remember, you can always return if you need more support. How are you feeling about everything we’ve talked about?

User: I feel really optimistic! I believe I can manage these challenges better now. Thank you for your help!

Consultant: It was a pleasure working with you today, Xiaohao. Keep up the great work, and I'm excited to hear about your progress in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaohao! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite good, to be honest. I've been practicing the skills we discussed, and I feel more confident about my ability to manage my emotions.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! It sounds like you're making great progress. Can you share a bit more about how you've been applying those skills in your daily life?

User: Sure! I've been trying to keep a journal and write down my thoughts, especially when I feel anxious or overwhelmed. It helps me sort through my emotions.

Consultant: Journaling is a great strategy! It can really help you gain clarity. What kind of thoughts do you usually notice when you write in your journal?

User: I tend to write about my worries regarding school and how I sometimes feel pressure to perform well. But I also jot down positive experiences and achievements.

Consultant: That balance is important. It’s great that you’re recognizing both challenges and achievements. How do you feel when you look back on your entries?

User: I feel proud of the progress I've made, but I also see that I often overthink things. Sometimes even small issues seem bigger when I write them down.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re becoming aware of how your thoughts can amplify your emotions. Can you identify any specific negative thoughts that come up frequently?

User: Yes, I often think things like, "What if I fail this exam?" or "Everyone is counting on me." It makes me really anxious.

Consultant: Those thoughts can indeed create a lot of pressure. How would you feel if I asked you to challenge those thoughts a bit? What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts them?

User: Well, I did well in my last exam, and my teachers have given me positive feedback. I guess I just tend to focus on what could go wrong instead of what’s gone right.

Consultant: That's a very insightful observation! It’s natural to worry, but focusing on past successes can help reframe your mindset. Would you be open to trying some techniques to help shift that focus?

User: Absolutely! I’m willing to try anything that can help me stay positive.

Consultant: Great! One technique is to create an evidence log where you note down successful experiences and positive affirmations. What do you think about starting that?

User: That sounds useful! I can record my achievements and positive feedback from others. It might help remind me of my capabilities.

Consultant: Exactly! Reflecting on those moments can reinforce a more realistic and positive outlook. Let’s also talk about setting some short-term goals. What specific goals would you like to work on in the coming weeks?

User: I’d like to make a study schedule that allows me to prepare for my exams without feeling overwhelmed. 

Consultant: A study schedule sounds like a fantastic idea! It can provide structure and reduce anxiety. How do you envision breaking down your study sessions?

User: I could set aside specific hours each day for different subjects and include breaks in between. It would make studying feel less daunting.

Consultant: That sounds effective! Breaks are essential for maintaining focus. How about setting a small daily goal related to your studies, alongside your journal practice?

User: Yes, I can set a goal to study one chapter a day and then reflect on it in my journal. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Reflecting on what you’ve learned will reinforce your knowledge. Do you foresee any potential challenges in keeping up with your schedule?

User: I might get distracted or lose motivation sometimes. 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Perhaps we can brainstorm some strategies to deal with those distractions when they arise. What have you found helpful in the past?

User: I’ve tried studying with friends before, which helps keep me motivated, but sometimes I’m not sure if they are available.

Consultant: Studying with friends can definitely provide motivation. Another option is to create a designated study space with minimal distractions. What do you think?

User: I could try that! Creating a quiet space just for studying sounds like it might help me concentrate better.

Consultant: Absolutely, having a designated spot can set the right mood for studying. As we incorporate these strategies, remember to check in with yourself regularly. How does that sound?

User: It sounds good! I’ll make sure to assess how I’m feeling about my progress and if anything needs adjusting.

Consultant: Perfect! You’re taking some great steps towards self-management. Before we finish today, let’s summarize what you’ll focus on moving forward.

User: I will keep journaling, create a study schedule, and set small daily goals for my studies. 

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Xiaohao! As you continue practicing these skills, remind yourself that progress takes time. How do you feel about everything we've discussed today?

User: I feel optimistic and motivated! I believe I can manage my anxiety better now.

Consultant: I love that enthusiasm! Remember, you're not alone in this process. If you encounter any challenges, don’t hesitate to reach out. This concludes our session today, but you’ve made significant strides. I'm proud of you!

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your guidance. I’ll definitely apply what we talked about.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xiaohao! Keep up the great work, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!
