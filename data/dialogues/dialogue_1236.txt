Consultant: Hello, Wang. I'm really glad to have you here today. It seems like you've been dealing with some difficult feelings recently. Can you share a bit about what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. Yes, there's been a lot on my mind lately. I felt really misunderstood during a campus event where some classmates labeled me as having "mental issues." It made me question whether I can fit in with others and if I actually have a problem.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Wang. Feeling misunderstood can be incredibly isolating, and it's understandable that you would start to doubt your ability to connect with others. What specific thoughts are you having about your social skills right now?

User: I keep wondering if I'm just awkward or if there's something fundamentally wrong with me. I feel like I can’t relate to others, and it makes me very anxious in social situations.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel anxious when you’re feeling uncertain about your social interactions. Let’s explore those feelings a bit more. When you think about being perceived as "awkward", what thoughts run through your mind? 

User: I often think that people are judging me or thinking I'm weird. It makes me want to avoid situations rather than face that anxiety.

Consultant: Avoiding those situations might feel like a safe choice, but it can reinforce the feelings of anxiety and isolation. Can you remember a time when you felt more comfortable interacting with others? What was different?

User: I guess when I’m with my close friends, I can be myself. But it seems like those situations are rare. Mostly, I feel judged when I'm in a larger group.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you have moments of comfort with friends. Those experiences show that you have the ability to connect. Maybe we can work together on stretching those moments into other environments. What do you think might help you feel more at ease in larger groups?

User: I guess if I had some strategies or tips on how to talk to people, that could help. But I worry I won't remember what to do in the moment.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Let's focus on some practical skills that you can practice, so they become more familiar over time. What if we started with some small steps you can take when you’re in a group setting? 

User: That sounds good. I would like to try.

Consultant: Great! One simple strategy could be to start with open-ended questions. For example, asking someone about their interests or thoughts on a topic can help spur conversation. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds manageable. But what if they don’t respond or the conversation dies? 

Consultant: It’s natural to worry about that. One approach is to have a few follow-up questions ready or to share something about yourself related to the topic. That way, you keep the conversation flowing. How comfortable do you feel with that idea?

User: I think I could handle that. It makes me feel a little less anxious thinking about it.

Consultant: That’s a step in the right direction! Remember, even if a conversation doesn’t go perfectly, it’s a learning experience. We can practice some of these scenarios together if you'd like.

User: Yes, I would definitely like to practice. 

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s role-play a situation where you approach someone at a gathering. How about you start with introducing yourself and an open question?

User: Okay, here goes. “Hi, I’m Wang. What do you think about the event so far?”

Consultant: That’s a great start! Now, let’s imagine their response. If they seem engaged, you can build on their answer. If they’re less responsive, you could share something about why you came to the event. How does that feel?

User: It feels less intimidating when I think of it this way. I can give it a try!

Consultant: Exactly! It’s all about practice and building your confidence. How about thinking of specific places or events coming up where you might use this strategy?

User: Well, there’s a study group scheduled next week that I could join. This is a good opportunity.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! It’s a smaller, more controlled environment, which could make it easier to practice your social skills. How do you feel about attending that group with these strategies in mind?

User: I feel hopeful! It’s less scary to think I have a plan.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous, and you have the tools to manage those feelings. Can we think about how you might handle it if you do start to feel anxious during the group?

User: Maybe I can take a few deep breaths and remind myself that it's okay not to be perfect.

Consultant: Absolutely! Deep breathing and self-compassion can be powerful tools. As our session comes to a close, let's reflect on the progress we've made today. What stands out to you as a key takeaway?

User: I think I’ve learned that I can prepare for social situations, and it’s okay to feel anxious. I’m also starting to believe in my ability to connect with others.

Consultant: That's a wonderful realization! Remember, building these skills takes time, and you're already on the right path. It’s normal for progress to be gradual. If you keep practicing, I believe you’ll feel more comfortable in social situations. 

User: Thank you so much for your help today. I really appreciate it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Wang! I’m proud of the work we’ve done together. If you have any other concerns or want to discuss further strategies, I’m here for you. Until next time, take care!

Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling about your social interactions lately?

User: Hi! I feel quite lost, to be honest. I tried joining a club recently, but I struggled to connect with others. It just feels like I don't belong anywhere, and it's really frustrating.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of loneliness and frustration from those interactions. Let's explore what happened in the club. Can you share more about how those interactions went for you?

User: Well, I think I just didn't know what to say or how to act. I felt really awkward, and I noticed that people weren't engaging with me the way I'd hoped. It's like my efforts to connect just fell flat.

Consultant: I see. That must have felt really disheartening. When those awkward moments happened, what thoughts were running through your mind at that time?

User: I kept thinking that maybe I just don't have what it takes to make friends. Like I'm just too different or weird.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts were quite negative and perhaps made you feel even more isolated. Do you think there's evidence that supports or contradicts that belief about yourself? 

User: I don't know. It just feels true when I'm in those situations. But then again, I don’t really know many people at all to compare with.

Consultant: That's a fair point. It might help to look at it from a different angle. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about feeling different or not fitting in?

User: I would probably say that everyone has their own quirks and it's okay to be different. But when it's me, I just can't seem to believe that.

Consultant: You're highlighting an important distinction. It's often easier to be empathetic towards others than to ourselves. Let's think about some specific moments when you felt awkward. What do you think led to those feelings?

User: I remember trying to join a conversation about a movie. I made a comment, but everyone just stared at me and then moved on. I felt so embarrassed.

Consultant: That sounds painful. It’s hard to be in that situation. What was going through your mind right after that happened?

User: I just wanted to disappear. I thought maybe I should just stop trying to engage with people altogether.

Consultant: That’s a common reaction after feeling rejected. However, avoiding these situations might reinforce your feelings of isolation. What if we think about small steps to help you engage without feeling so pressured?

User: I guess I could try asking questions instead of making comments. That might take the pressure off me.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Asking questions can often help others feel included and might take the focus off of you. What type of questions do you think would work well in a group conversation?

User: Simple questions about what they think of certain topics. Like, "What’s everyone's favorite movie?" That seems easier.

Consultant: That's perfect! It invites others to share and opens up the dialogue. Let’s practice that scenario a bit. Imagine you are at the club meeting again. How would you approach that question?

User: I would smile and say, “Hey everyone, I’m curious, what’s your favorite movie and why?” Then I could listen to their answers.

Consultant: Great job! Engaging like that can create a more inviting atmosphere. What concerns do you still have about trying out this approach?

User: I worry that no one will answer or that my question will seem silly.

Consultant: Those worries are completely understandable. Remember, sometimes people can be shy and might need someone to break the ice. Even if they don’t respond how you hope, it doesn’t reflect on your value as a person. Would you like to brainstorm some alternative questions or follow-up questions to keep the conversation flowing?

User: Yes, that might help me feel more prepared. 

Consultant: Let’s list a few together. You could ask about their favorite hobbies or what kind of music they enjoy. The goal is to show interest in them, which might lead to a more comfortable exchange.

User: Those sound good! I feel a bit more hopeful thinking about this now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s a journey, but building connections can take time and practice. As we continue, let’s follow up on your experiences in the next session. How do you feel about implementing this in your interactions this week?

User: I’ll definitely try asking those questions. I really want to improve my social skills.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful commitment, Wang. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes. What have you learned today that you can take with you moving forward?

User: I learned that I can approach social situations with questions to make it easier. I also realize I shouldn’t be too hard on myself if things don’t go perfectly.

Consultant: Absolutely! That positive self-talk will be so important. Let’s check in with each other next time on how these strategies worked for you. Remember, you’re not alone in this—I'm here to support you.

User: Thank you! I feel a little better knowing I have a plan. See you next time!

Consultant: Take care, Wang! Looking forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello Wang! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling lately with everything going on around you?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite low lately. After that group project incident, I felt really ignored and it made me realize how hard it is for me to adapt to others' viewpoints. I just feel a bit out of place.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds quite challenging. Let's talk a bit more about that incident. What thoughts were running through your mind when you felt ignored by your classmates?

User: I kept thinking that they just didn't care about my opinions, and I felt really left out. It made me question if I am even good at working with others.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way when you believe your opinions aren't valued. How did that situation affect your emotions in that moment?

User: I felt rejected and kind of sad. It's like my confidence took a hit, and now I’m worried about future group work.

Consultant: That sounds tough, Wang. It's important to recognize those feelings. You mentioned your confidence took a hit. Can you elaborate on how that might influence your actions going forward? 

User: I think it makes me less willing to share my ideas in groups. I might just stay quiet to avoid further rejection.

Consultant: It sounds like you're dealing with a fear of rejection that is leading you to withdraw in social situations. Let’s think together—what are some alternative thoughts you might have when you find yourself in group settings?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that my views are valid and that it’s okay if everyone doesn’t agree with me. I guess I just need to be more open.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Reframing your thoughts can really make a difference. How do you think you can practice sharing your ideas in a way that feels safer for you?

User: I could try starting with small comments in class discussions or even practice with a couple of classmates I feel more comfortable with.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Gradual exposure can help build your confidence over time. What do you think might help you to get started on this approach?

User: Maybe I could set a goal for myself to contribute at least once in every group discussion. It’s small but I think it might help.

Consultant: Setting a small, achievable goal is a fantastic strategy! Remember, each step you take counts as progress. How do you feel about having that as your goal?

User: It feels manageable. I do think it will help me push myself a bit without feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: That's a great mindset! As you work on this goal, it might help to reflect on how it feels each time you share your thoughts. What do you think could be a helpful way to reflect on those experiences?

User: I could keep a journal about my experiences after each discussion, noting what I said and how I felt afterward. 

Consultant: Keeping a journal is an excellent idea! It allows you to track progress and understand your feelings better. How does this make you feel about facing future group situations?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful now. I think having a plan makes it less daunting. I just need to remind myself it’s a learning process.

Consultant: Absolutely! Embracing it as a learning process takes some pressure off. It’s okay to be open to learning and evolving. Are there specific challenges you think might come up as you start this journey?

User: I guess I worry that I’ll still be rejected or ignored, which might discourage me again.

Consultant: That fear is valid and common. It’s part of being human. What might you tell yourself when those thoughts creep in, to help combat that fear?

User: I think I need to remind myself that not everyone’s opinion has to align with mine and that my contributions are still valuable.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive reminder! Balancing your self-affirmation with the understanding that not every response will be positive is crucial. What is one thing you’re excited about regarding this shift in perspective?

User: I think I'm excited to learn more about myself and improve my ability to communicate. It feels empowering.

Consultant: That's beautiful to hear, Wang! Being excited about personal growth is a powerful motivator. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ve learned about managing social conflicts and stepping into group settings.

User: I’ve learned to challenge negative thoughts, set achievable goals, and practice sharing in small steps. Plus, I want to keep a journal to reflect on my experiences.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic summary! I believe you have the tools to navigate these challenges ahead. Remember, we can always revisit anything that feels overwhelming. 

User: Thank you! This session has really helped and I look forward to applying these strategies. 

Consultant: I’m proud of your progress today, Wang. Keep being open to learning about yourself. If you need further support, don’t hesitate to reach out.

Consultant: Hello! I’m glad you’re here for our session today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a mix of emotions. Lately, I’ve started thinking more about my behaviors and emotions, especially after attending the mental health talk on campus. It made me curious about what drives my feelings.

Consultant: That's really insightful. Exploring your feelings can be a significant step toward understanding yourself better. What specific feelings or thoughts have you been reflecting on since the talk?

User: I often feel a sense of loneliness, even though I know I don't have any major issues. I just struggle to connect with others, and it makes me question what's wrong with me.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of introspection regarding your sense of connection with others. It's okay to feel this way, especially when navigating social environments. Can you share an instance where you felt this loneliness more intensely?

User: Sure. Recently, I was at a gathering with my classmates, and even though I was surrounded by people, I felt completely out of place and couldn't engage in the conversations.

Consultant: That sounds tough. Feeling out of place in social situations can be really uncomfortable. What thoughts went through your mind during that gathering?

User: I thought things like, "Why can’t I fit in?" and "Everyone seems to connect so easily." It made me feel so anxious and self-conscious.

Consultant: I see. Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. It seems like you might be engaging in some negative self-talk. Have you noticed how those thoughts affect your feelings in those situations?

User: Yes, definitely. Every time I think negatively about myself, I feel even more anxious, and it just spirals from there.

Consultant: That’s a common experience. Would you be open to identifying some of the specific negative thoughts you have when you're feeling anxious in social situations?

User: One recurring thought is, "I am not interesting enough for them." It feels like I have this constant echo telling me I'm not good enough.

Consultant: That sounds very challenging. How likely do you think it is that everyone at that gathering actually thinks you're not interesting? Can we challenge that thought a bit?

User: I guess it's not very likely. I mean, I have friends, even if they are few, and they seem genuinely interested in me.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s great that you have those connections. It might help to remind yourself of those positives when you start to have those negative thoughts. How would you feel about trying to reframe that thought into something more positive?

User: Maybe I could think, "I have unique perspectives to share." That feels a little better.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful shift! Focusing on your unique contributions can help reduce anxiety. Moving forward, how could you practice this reframing during upcoming social situations?

User: I could try to remind myself of my unique perspectives before entering a social setting, and even practice engaging in conversations with less pressure.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Practicing in low-pressure settings can help build your confidence. How do you feel about the idea of gradually facing these social situations with that mindset?

User: I feel hopeful. It seems more manageable when I think of it this way.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Hope is a powerful ally. Let’s also discuss some activities you could try that may allow you to connect with others in a more comfortable way. What interests you?

User: I enjoy art. Maybe I could join an art club or workshop where I can meet people with similar interests?

Consultant: Joining an art club is an excellent idea! Engaging in a shared activity can create natural opportunities for conversation. Do you think you’d be willing to take that step?

User: Yes, I think I will try! It sounds less intimidating since we would be focused on something creative.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on a shared interest can help take the pressure off interactions. As you prepare for this, what feeling do you want to cultivate before joining the club?

User: I’d like to feel confident and excited, rather than anxious about meeting new people.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic intention. If you encounter anxiety, remember to practice your reframing techniques. How do you think you can remind yourself of your strengths in those moments?

User: I could write down some positive affirmations about my art and my value. That might help.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! Creating affirmations can remind you of your worth before social interactions. Would you like to formulate a few together now?

User: Sure! Maybe something like, “My art is valuable, and I have unique insights to share.”

Consultant: That’s powerful! Having such affirmations will help reinforce your self-esteem. How do you feel about having these tools as you move forward?

User: I feel more prepared, and I’m hopeful about making connections in a less daunting way.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It seems like you’re really making progress in terms of understanding and managing your feelings. Remember, connecting with others takes time, and it's perfectly okay to take things at your own pace.

User: Thanks! I appreciate your support. It makes me feel like I can actually work on these issues.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s been a pleasure discussing this with you today. As we wrap up, what are your key takeaways from our session?

User: I think my main takeaway is to challenge my negative thoughts and use positive reframing. Plus, I’m excited to try connecting through art.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent takeaways! I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out again. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and I'm looking forward to our next conversation.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! Welcome back to our session. It’s great to see you again. Last time, we talked about your experiences in that psychology class and how it helped you recognize the value of positive interaction. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I've been feeling much better, actually. That class really opened my eyes. I consciously tried to engage more with my classmates, and it felt nice to connect. But I still have moments of doubt about my social skills.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you’ve started to engage more with your classmates. That shows great progress! Let’s explore those moments of doubt a bit more. What specific situations make you question your social skills?

User: I sometimes feel out of place during group discussions. Like, I worry that my contributions aren't valuable enough, and I end up holding back instead of sharing my thoughts.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. Engaging in discussions can be intimidating, especially when you’re trying to find your voice. Can you recall a recent instance where you felt hesitant to share? What thoughts were going through your mind at that moment?

User: Yes, there was a time when we had to share our opinions on a topic. My mind raced with the idea that my opinion was too simple or irrelevant. I decided to stay quiet, and afterwards, I felt a bit frustrated with myself.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like there was a strong fear of judgment affecting your decision to stay quiet. Let’s break that down. What evidence do you have that your contributions might not be valuable? 

User: I guess I don't have any solid evidence. It’s just a feeling that creeps in. I think others are more knowledgeable and confident.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, Wang. Oftentimes, our feelings can lead us to believe thoughts that aren't based on reality. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their contributions?

User: I would definitely encourage them to speak up! I’d remind them that everyone has unique perspectives to share and that their voice matters.

Consultant: Exactly! You already have the right mindset when thinking about others. Now, it’s time to apply that same kindness to yourself. How would it feel to remind yourself of that when you’re in a discussion?

User: I think it would help. I want to try reminding myself that my perspectives are valid, just like anyone else's.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic step forward! Let’s also consider some small actions you can take in your next discussions. Perhaps set a goal to share at least one thought, no matter how small? How does that sound?

User: That sounds doable! Maybe starting small will make it easier for me to build confidence.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s all about taking those incremental steps. After your class or group discussion, can we also reflect on how it went? This will help reinforce your positive experiences and learn from them.

User: Yes, I think reflecting would help me process my feelings afterward.

Consultant: Great! Reflection is a valuable tool. After identifying a situation where you share your thoughts, we can discuss how it made you feel, what went well, and any areas you’d like to improve. 

User: I like that approach. It gives me a chance to see my progress and work on my weaknesses intentionally.

Consultant: Exactly, it’s all about creating a learning experience for yourself. Remember, each time you choose to share your voice, you’re building a positive memory of that experience. Are there any upcoming opportunities where you think you could practice this?

User: Yes, we have a group project due next week. I could definitely try to contribute more actively during those meetings.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! Would you like to set a specific goal for how you would like to contribute?

User: Maybe I can aim to suggest one idea during each meeting. Even if hesitant, I can remind myself that it’s okay to be uncertain.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan, Wang! Aiming to suggest just one idea helps ease the pressure. Remember to acknowledge your feelings of hesitation but don’t let them stop you from participating. 

User: I’ll keep that in mind. I really appreciate your support. It’s nice to feel understood.

Consultant: I’m here to support you, and I’m glad you feel that way. It’s all about creating a safe space for you to explore your experiences. Is there anything else on your mind regarding your social interactions?

User: Sometimes, I do worry about keeping in touch with the friends I make. I’m afraid I won’t know how to maintain those relationships.

Consultant: It’s common to have those concerns. Maintaining friendships can be a learning process, too. What have you observed about how your classmates connect with each other?

User: I’ve seen them texting each other and inviting one another to study sessions. Maybe I could try doing something similar.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking that initiative could foster those connections. How do you feel about reaching out to someone you’d like to invite to study together?

User: I feel a bit nervous thinking about it, but I want to try!

Consultant: That’s a healthy attitude, Wang! Embracing that nervousness is often part of reaching out. We can also role-play how that conversation might go if you’d like.

User: That could really help me practice what I might say!

Consultant: Great! Let’s practice a possible invitation then. How about you open with a friendly comment, and then express your interest in studying together? 

User: Okay! I might say something like, “Hey! I noticed we’re in the same class. Do you want to study together before the exam?”

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start! It’s friendly and direct. How does saying that out loud feel to you?

User: It feels a little scary, but I think I can do it.

Consultant: That’s a step in the right direction! Remember, reaching out is a strength, and you’re allowed to feel a mix of excitement and nerves. You’re doing so well!

User: Thank you! I feel more optimistic about this now. 

Consultant: I’m delighted to hear that! Let’s aim to reflect together after your upcoming meetings and interactions. We can celebrate your successes and talk through any challenges.

User: Yes, I’m looking forward to that!

Consultant: Wonderful! You’ve made so much progress today, Wang. Keep reminding yourself of your strengths, and remember, it’s all part of a journey. 

User: Thank you for your encouragement. I appreciate your help so much.

Consultant: It’s truly my pleasure. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello Wang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite good, actually. I've spent the holiday with my classmates, and I could really feel the warmth of friendship and support. It's made me feel more open.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like spending time with your classmates positively impacted your feelings about social relationships. What specific experiences stood out to you during this time?

User: Well, I felt more comfortable talking to them and even participated in group activities. I realized I can be more engaged without feeling as anxious as before.

Consultant: That’s a great achievement! Feeling more engaged is a significant step. How has this change in your social interactions influenced your overall mood and self-perception?

User: I think my mood has improved a lot. I'm starting to see myself as someone who can connect with others well, which is a big shift from how I used to feel about my social abilities.

Consultant: It sounds like your self-esteem related to social interactions has increased. Can you identify any specific thoughts or beliefs you've changed that contributed to this positive shift?

User: I used to think I was awkward and wouldn't fit in. Now, I try to remind myself that everyone can feel out of place sometimes, and it helps me relax during conversations.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization! Recognizing that everyone has similar experiences can help reduce feelings of awkwardness. How do you plan to maintain this positive mindset going forward?

User: I think I need to keep spending time with my friends and challenge myself to join more group activities. I feel like practicing will help solidify these positive feelings.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Engaging in more social activities could reinforce your new beliefs. Are there any particular challenges you foresee in maintaining this momentum?

User: I worry about falling back into feeling isolated if I suddenly stop meeting with friends. But I do want to keep pushing myself to stay social.

Consultant: It's natural to have those concerns. Perhaps we can brainstorm some strategies to prevent isolation and encourage ongoing social engagement. What methods have worked for you in the past?

User: I think setting small, achievable social goals helps. Like, reaching out to a friend once a week or attending study groups occasionally.

Consultant: That's an excellent approach! Setting small goals can indeed make socializing feel less overwhelming. How about we explore some new goals you could set for the upcoming weeks?

User: Sure! I think I’d like to aim for inviting a classmate to study with me and maybe even suggest a group outing. 

Consultant: Those are fantastic goals! Inviting someone to study and suggesting group activities can help foster connections. How do you feel about taking these steps?

User: I feel excited but a bit nervous. What if they say no or aren’t interested?

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous! Remember that rejection is a part of social interactions, and it doesn’t reflect your worth. What could you tell yourself to ease that anxiety?

User: I can remind myself that it’s okay if they decline. At least I’m putting myself out there, and each attempt is a step forward.

Consultant: Exactly! Each attempt is indeed progress. Let's also consider ways to manage that anxiety when reaching out. What coping strategies have you found helpful?

User: Deep breathing and reminding myself of past successes usually help when I start feeling anxious.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Deep breathing can really help calm your mind in those moments. How about we develop a quick checklist for you to use before reaching out to someone?

User: That sounds useful! Like a reminder to breathe and think positive before I message or talk to someone?

Consultant: Yes, that would be a great addition! You could also include affirmations like “I am capable of making connections” or “It’s okay to be vulnerable.” How does that resonate with you?

User: I like that! It makes me feel more prepared and less worried about how others will respond.

Consultant: Wonderful! Now, as we wrap up our session today, let’s summarize the progress you've made and the strategies we've discussed. How do you feel about everything we’ve talked about?

User: I feel proud of how much I’ve improved. I’m also glad to have some concrete goals to keep me focused.

Consultant: That's fantastic! Remember, maintaining these connections and practicing positive self-talk will help solidify your progress. You’ve done really well, and I'm here to support you whenever you need. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support, and I’ll keep working on these goals.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep up the great work, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you feel the need to talk again. Have a wonderful week ahead! 

User: Thanks! I will. Have a great week too!
