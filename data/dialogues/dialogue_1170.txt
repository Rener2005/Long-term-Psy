Consultant: Hello Liu! I'm glad to see you again for this session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. Honestly, things have been quite overwhelming. The closer it gets to the end of the semester, the more anxious I feel. My thoughts keep drifting towards death, and it makes me feel so scared and unsettled.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like the pressure of the semester along with your fear of death is really weighing on you. Can you share more about those thoughts you're having?

User: Well, sometimes I just feel this dread about what happens after death... it’s like this constant worry in the back of my mind. It makes me feel like nothing is safe around me, and I worry about my family too.

Consultant: That sounds very heavy. It’s understandable to have such concerns, especially with everything going on in your life. Let's take a moment to explore that fear a bit more. When you think about death, what specific thoughts or images come to your mind?

User: I can't really explain it well, but I often picture being alone and not knowing what comes next. It terrifies me. Sometimes it feels like I can't escape those thoughts.

Consultant: It’s really powerful how those thoughts can create such intense feelings of fear. Let’s look at those thoughts together. Are there certain beliefs you have about death that might contribute to this fear?

User: I guess I believe that death is the end of everything. I also worry about my family suffering if something happens to me.

Consultant: That belief can certainly create a lot of anxiety. It's common to associate death with a sense of finality and loss. Let's challenge that belief a bit. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts this idea that death is the end of everything?

User: I suppose there are people who believe in an afterlife or some kind of continuation... but I just can’t bring myself to believe it.

Consultant: That's understandable. It can be tough to embrace different perspectives on such a profound topic. If you were to explore the possibility of other beliefs, what would they look like for you? Could they help in easing some of your fears?

User: Maybe if I considered that death is just a part of life, it wouldn’t feel so terrifying? But it’s hard to shift my thinking like that.

Consultant: It’s definitely a process, and it’s okay to take your time. We can work together on gradually shifting those thoughts. Let’s try a small exercise. Can you think of a time when you felt at peace with the idea of living? 

User: I remember moments when I was really engaged in my art, feeling like I was part of something bigger. Those times were nice.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful connection, Liu. It shows that you can find peace and engagement in life. Perhaps we can focus on activities that bring you joy, like your art, to help balance those heavier thoughts. What do you think about that idea?

User: I would love that! Focusing on my art helps me forget my worries, even if just for a little while.

Consultant: That's great to hear. Let’s plan some time for you to engage more with your art and see how it impacts your feelings. Alongside, we can practice some relaxation techniques to manage anxiety when it surfaces. Would you be open to trying some breathing exercises with me now?

User: Yes, I’d really like to try that. I think it could help.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let's start with a simple deep breathing exercise. Inhale slowly through your nose, filling your lungs, and then exhale gently through your mouth. Keep doing this while I guide you through. Focus on calming your mind with each breath...

User: Okay. I’m doing it. It feels a bit calming already.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Liu. Each time you practice this, it can help you ground yourself in those moments of anxiety. Remember, it's just one step at a time. As you engage more with your art and practice relaxation, you might find your fears become more manageable. 

User: I hope so. I’ve been feeling so trapped by my thoughts lately. 

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way, especially during stressful times. Remember, you’re not alone in this. We can navigate through these feelings together. What specific thoughts do you encounter when you start feeling trapped?

User: Usually it’s the thought that I can’t see a future without fear. It just feels discouraging.

Consultant: That’s a tough feeling to carry, but think about this: every time you confront those fears, you’re learning to tackle them head-on. Even small victories count. What if instead of thinking there is no future without fear, you consider that a future where you can manage your fears is possible?

User: That sounds a bit more hopeful. I wish it were easier to feel that way all the time.

Consultant: It’s a process, and it’s normal to have ups and downs. It’s all part of learning how to manage those thoughts and feelings. As we continue our sessions, we’ll explore more strategies to help you build that hope and resilience. 

User: Thank you. I really appreciate that. 

Consultant: You’re welcome, Liu. It's important to remember that you're making progress, even if it feels slow. Before we end our session today, let’s summarize some of what we discussed. What do you think you’d like to focus on moving forward?

User: I want to work on my art more and practice the relaxation exercises regularly. And I’d like to challenge my negative thoughts about death.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Engaging in what you love while also practicing techniques to challenge those thoughts can be powerful. Remember, it’s about taking small steps. 

User: I will try my best!

Consultant: I believe in you, Liu. Remember, it's okay to reach out if you need more support. Our next session will be a great opportunity to check in on your progress. You’re doing great work, and I'm here for you!

Consultant: Hello Liu! I'm glad to have you back for this session. How have you been feeling since our last discussion?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious, especially with the final exams coming up. It seems like I can’t escape this fear of uncertainty. It’s tough to focus on my studies.

Consultant: I completely understand that the pressure of final exams can amplify feelings of anxiety and uncertainty. Can you tell me more about the specific thoughts or worries that are running through your mind right now?

User: I keep worrying that I won’t do well in my exams. I feel like if I don’t succeed, I’ll disappoint my family, especially my dad, who works so hard for us.

Consultant: That sounds really stressful, feeling that pressure to meet your father’s expectations. Let’s explore these thoughts a bit more. When you think about not doing well, what specific feelings come up for you?

User: I feel really scared and even sad. Sometimes, I think that maybe I'm not good enough to be in my program. It’s like this constant fear of failure. 

Consultant: It’s tough to carry that fear of inadequacy with you. What do you think is the evidence behind this belief that you might not be good enough? Is there anything that contradicts that thought?

User: I guess I did well in my previous assignments, but I just can’t shake this feeling, especially now that exams are looming.

Consultant: It's great that you recognize your previous successes! It sounds like your mind is amplifying the fear despite having evidence of your capabilities. Would you be open to thinking about what you would advise a friend if they had similar fears?

User: I would tell them not to be so hard on themselves and that they’ve worked hard. But I can’t seem to believe that for myself.

Consultant: That's a valuable perspective. Let's practice shifting that mindset for you as well. Can we come up with a few self-affirmations that highlight your efforts and strengths? 

User: Maybe I could say, "I am capable, and I have prepared well for these exams." 

Consultant: That sounds excellent! Repeating such affirmations can help reinforce your self-worth. Now, when you start feeling anxious, how can we integrate some relaxation techniques to help calm your mind?

User: I think deep breathing might help. I’ve heard about it but haven’t really tried it.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a wonderful tool! Would you like to try a quick exercise together? Let's take a moment to breathe in deeply for four counts, hold it for four counts, and release for four counts. 

User: Sure, I can try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s do it together now. Inhale… 1, 2, 3, 4. Hold… 1, 2, 3, 4. Exhale… 1, 2, 3, 4. How did that feel for you?

User: That actually felt calming. I think I could use that before starting my study sessions. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Planning to integrate that before your studies will help set a positive tone. Moving forward, what specific steps can we take to better manage your study schedule and anxiety?

User: I’d like to create a study plan that doesn't overwhelm me. Maybe I could break it down into smaller sections.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! How about we outline what subjects or topics you need to cover, and we can create a manageable timeline together?

User: Okay, I have three main subjects. I can try to allocate specific days for each.

Consultant: Perfect! Allocating specific days can help create structure and reduce that overwhelming feeling. What do you think could be a good first step to tackle for tomorrow?

User: I think starting with the subject I feel least confident in would be good. 

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach. Just remember to incorporate those deep breathing exercises beforehand and take short breaks to keep your mind fresh. 

User: Yes, I’ll keep that in mind! 

Consultant: As you work on this plan, how do you feel about reaching out to friends or classmates for study support?

User: I usually don’t like to ask for help, but I think that could be beneficial. 

Consultant: Asking for help can be incredibly valuable, and it shows strength. Perhaps you could start with just one friend and share your study plans. 

User: That sounds doable! 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! I encourage you to take that step. Before we wrap up, let’s reflect a moment on your progress today. What do you feel you've gained from our discussion?

User: I think I’ve recognized some unhelpful thoughts and have a better plan for managing my anxiety and studies. 

Consultant: You’ve made excellent strides in understanding your feelings and creating an actionable plan. As we move forward, how will you ensure you continue to maintain this positive mindset?

User: I’ll keep reminding myself of my strengths and use the breathing techniques. 

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies! It’s essential to build upon what you’ve learned. Remember, it's okay to feel uncertain at times, but now you also have tools to manage those feelings. 

User: Thank you! I'm feeling a bit more empowered now. 

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that. As we conclude today’s session, keep practicing those skills, and know that you’ve made real progress. I’m here for you whenever you need support. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Liu! Don't hesitate to reach out, and take care.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad you're here today. Last time we spoke, we discussed some of the feelings of social isolation you're experiencing. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite lonely and unsure about how to handle my misunderstandings with classmates. It's really been weighing me down, and I feel like my confidence has dropped even more.

Consultant: I can see that the misunderstandings are troubling you and affecting your confidence. Let’s talk a bit more about those feelings. What specific situations are making you feel isolated or less confident?

User: Well, I had a disagreement with a classmate over a project. I think she misunderstood what I was trying to say, and now it feels awkward when I see her. I've lost touch with some other friends, too, and it just feels like I'm alone in this.

Consultant: It sounds really tough to deal with both the misunderstanding and the loss of those friendships. When you think about those moments, what thoughts come to mind that might be contributing to your feelings of loneliness?

User: I keep thinking that maybe I’m not good enough or that people don’t want to be around me. It's like I’m the problem.

Consultant: That’s a heavy thought to carry, Liu. Can we explore that idea together? What evidence do you have that supports this belief that you're the problem?

User: Well, I’ve made mistakes, and I can see other people getting along better without me. It just feels like I'm always the odd one out.

Consultant: It’s understandable to see the mistakes and focus on the behavior of others, but let’s consider if there might be alternative explanations. Could there be reasons why those friendships are changing that don't solely point to you as the problem?

User: I suppose some friends have their own issues they’re dealing with, but I still feel like I'm a burden when I reach out.

Consultant: Feeling like a burden can be really challenging. If a friend came to you expressing the same feelings, what advice do you think you would give them?

User: I would probably tell them that they aren’t a burden and that it’s okay to reach out for support. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight! You clearly have compassion for others; now let’s work on extending that same kindness to yourself. What do you think would happen if you allowed yourself to reach out, despite those fears?

User: Maybe it wouldn’t be as bad as I think? But I’m still scared they might reject me.

Consultant: That fear is very real, but it might also be keeping you from the support you need. We can think about small steps you could take to connect with others. What about starting a conversation with a classmate—just a simple hello or asking about class?

User: That sounds doable, but I still worry what they’ll think of me. 

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to have those worries. However, remember that a lot of people are also looking for connection. If they seem busy or uninterested, it doesn't mean you’re a burden; it’s just about timing. What if we role-play a simple conversational opener together?

User: That might help. I guess practice could make it easier.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s imagine you see a classmate. How would you start that conversation? 

User: Maybe I could ask about the project we’re working on together?

Consultant: Perfect! Asking about the project is a great way to open up the conversation. How would you feel saying that?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but it also feels like a safe topic. 

Consultant: Nervousness is totally normal. With practice, you might find those nerves decrease. If you try this and it doesn’t go perfectly, what will you do to support yourself afterward?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it's just practice, and it doesn’t define my worth. 

Consultant: Yes! That’s a powerful reminder. It’s all part of learning and growing. So, how about we set a goal for you to try reaching out to that classmate this week? 

User: I think I can do that! Just to say hi and see how it goes.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Let’s also schedule our next session to reflect on how it went. Together, we can explore any feelings that arise.

User: I’d like that; it helps to know I have someone to talk to.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, you're not alone in this. Before we end today, is there anything else you’d like to discuss?

User: No, I think I just need to process what we talked about. Thanks for helping!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Liu! I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hi there! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I still feel pretty isolated even after joining the art group. I want to feel more confident in my abilities, but sometimes I just doubt myself.

Consultant: I understand that you're feeling a bit lost despite the new connections you've made. It sounds like you're eager to build your confidence in your artistic skills. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you doubt yourself?

User: Well, sometimes when I'm working on a project, I compare my work to others, and I feel like mine just doesn't measure up. It makes me want to give up.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. Comparing ourselves to others can often lead to those feelings of inadequacy. What emotions come up for you when you find yourself making those comparisons?

User: I usually feel sad and frustrated. It’s like a cycle—I get inspired, then I feel bad about my work, and that makes me even less motivated to create anything.

Consultant: It seems like there's a pattern there that’s impacting your motivation. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come up during these moments of comparison?

User: I often think, "I'll never be as good as them" or "I don’t belong in this group." It just discourages me more.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite critical and may be adding to your sadness. Let’s explore them a bit. On a scale from 0 to 10, how much evidence do you think there is to support that you don’t belong or that you won’t improve?

User: I guess I would say 3? I have improved a bit since joining the group, but those negative thoughts really stick with me.

Consultant: It’s good to hear that you recognize some improvement! Let’s focus on that. If a friend came to you with those same thoughts, what would you say to them?

User: I would encourage them and remind them that everyone improves at different paces. I’d tell them to focus on their progress, not just the end result.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective! It seems like you know how to support others, so let’s try applying that same kindness to yourself. What small step could you take to acknowledge your progress when it comes to your art?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal of my artwork and note down what I liked about each piece, sort of like a personal record of improvement.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Documenting your progress can really help shift your focus to your achievements rather than comparisons. How do you feel about making that a regular practice?

User: I think I could do that. It sounds like a good way to boost my confidence.

Consultant: Perfect! Let's set a goal for you to start that journal this week. Additionally, how about we brainstorm some activities within the group that could help you feel more connected?

User: That might help. I think participating more in group discussions would be nice, but I often hold back.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize the potential benefits of being more involved! What’s one way you could challenge that hesitation to join in?

User: Maybe I could prepare a few ideas ahead of time to share. That would make me feel less anxious.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Preparing in advance can help ease your nerves. Are there any specific topics or creative projects you feel excited to share with the group?

User: I’ve been working on a piece inspired by nature. I think it would be a good conversation starter!

Consultant: That sounds beautiful and very engaging! Sharing about your inspiration could foster connection with others. What if you set a goal to share that piece next time? How does that feel to you?

User: A bit scary, but also exciting! I think it would help me feel more involved.

Consultant: It's normal to feel that mix of fear and excitement! Remember, the more you share, the more you can connect with group members. Plus, they might be inspired by your work too. How are you feeling about our discussion so far?

User: I feel a bit lighter. Talking about this really helps. I see a path forward now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Tracking your progress and being more involved could definitely be steps towards building your confidence. Let’s also touch on those feelings related to death. Have you noticed any patterns there that you'd like to explore?

User: Yes, I still have that underlying fear, especially when I see sad news or hear about someone's passing. It just hits me hard.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It’s quite common to feel anxious about those topics. When those feelings arise, what thoughts typically accompany that fear for you?

User: I often think, "What if something happens to my family?" It spirals into fear of losing everyone I care about.

Consultant: Those thoughts are really heavy — it's tough to carry that worry. Let’s apply some of what we've talked about today. How could you remind yourself of the support you have around you when those thoughts come up?

User: I could remind myself that I’m not alone and focus on the good moments we share instead of just the negative possibilities.

Consultant: That’s a wise approach! Focusing on the positive can really help shift your perspective. Do you think you could create a mantra or positive affirmation to use during those moments?

User: Yes! Something like “I am surrounded by love and support.” That feels comforting.

Consultant: That’s beautiful! Reaffirming that sense of support can be very grounding. How do you feel about implementing that when you sense the anxiety creeping in?

User: I think it would help. Just saying that could remind me of all the good things in my life.

Consultant: Absolutely! It sounds like you’re well-equipped to handle those fears. As we wrap up our session, let’s recap what you’ll take away from our discussion today.

User: I’ll start my art journal, try to prepare for sharing my work in the group, and use my affirmation to combat those anxious thoughts.

Consultant: Those are excellent steps! Remember, it’s all about progress — taking it one day at a time. You’ve made great strides in recognizing your feelings and finding ways to cope. I believe in your ability to maintain that positive momentum.

User: Thank you so much! I feel more hopeful about everything.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Remember, you can always revisit these strategies whenever you need to. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Liu! I'm really glad to see you again. Last time we talked about your recent success with your art project and how it positively impacted your mood. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better overall. I'm proud of my project, but I still get moments where I feel anxious, particularly when I think about death. It's like a shadow that appears sometimes.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you have pride in your work! But it sounds like the anxiety related to death is still weighing on you. Can you share a little more about those moments when the anxiety hits? What thoughts come to mind?

User: Sure. Sometimes I just start thinking about death unexpectedly, and it makes my heart race. I think about my family and what would happen to them if I weren't around. It can be quite overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, especially when those thoughts are unexpected and distressing. It's understandable to worry about loved ones. What feelings do you experience when these thoughts arise?

User: I feel a mix of fear and sadness. I start to feel detached from everything, like a wave of hopelessness washes over me.

Consultant: Those feelings of fear and sadness can be really heavy to carry. Have you noticed any particular situations or triggers that lead to those thoughts about death?

User: It tends to happen when I'm alone or when I hear about someone passing away on the news. It's like it makes everything too real.

Consultant: That makes sense. Sometimes external reminders can trigger our internal fears. Recognizing these triggers is a good first step. How do you usually cope when those feelings arise?

User: I usually just try to distract myself, like watching TV or scrolling through my phone, but it doesn't always help.

Consultant: Distracting yourself is a common strategy, but it might not always lead to relief. We can explore some more effective ways to cope with those feelings. How would you feel about trying some positive activities or outlets related to your art as a way to manage your anxiety?

User: I think that could be helpful. I haven't really used my art as a way to deal with my feelings yet.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Engaging in your art can be a powerful way to express and process those emotions. What types of art do you find most fulfilling?

User: I really love painting and sometimes sketching. It helps me relax, especially when I’m in the flow.

Consultant: Painting sounds like a perfect way to channel your feelings. Perhaps we can set some time each week for you to create something specifically inspired by your emotions or thoughts about death. Would that interest you?

User: Yes, that sounds really nice. I think I’d like to explore my feelings through art.

Consultant: Fantastic! Creativity can be a therapeutic outlet. As you create, I encourage you to reflect on your emotions. You can ask yourself: what does this feeling look like, or how does it change as you paint? 

User: I like that idea. It gives me a direction for my work.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Another approach we can take is to gradually expose you to some of the thoughts or topics related to death in a safe way. This could help you feel more in control when those thoughts arise. How do you feel about that?

User: It sounds a bit scary, but I’m willing to try if it can help me manage my anxiety.

Consultant: Your willingness to face this is commendable, Liu. We can start small, maybe by having conversations about it in more general terms or incorporating it into your art. How would that approach feel for you?

User: I think that could work. If I can control the way I engage with these thoughts, it might make it less scary.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking control can really help change how you feel. As we move forward, let’s also focus on celebrating your achievements, like your successful art piece, to build on that positive momentum. 

User: Yes, I’d love to keep that spirit going! It makes me feel more confident.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Confidence can be a strong ally in facing anxiety. Let’s also create some strategies together for when those anxious moments arise. What would be a good first step for you?

User: Maybe having a go-to activity or a short motivational mantra I can remind myself of when I feel anxious could help.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! We can brainstorm a mantra that resonates with your experiences and reminds you of your strengths. What thoughts or affirmations do you feel might help?

User: Something like, "I can handle my feelings" or "Art helps me express and cope" could work.

Consultant: Those are powerful affirmations! They remind you of your resilience and the value of your art. Practicing these mantras during calm moments can reinforce them for when anxiety arises. 

User: I’ll definitely try that. I can practice saying it while I’m painting, too.

Consultant: Exactly! Incorporating it into your artwork can create a beautiful synergy between your emotions and affirmations. As we approach the end of our session, how do you feel about the progress we’ve made today?

User: I feel hopeful. It’s nice to have some new strategies to work on and to know it’s okay to explore these emotions.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that, Liu! Remember, the process of managing anxiety and embracing your feelings takes time. You’re already on the right path. Would you like to set some goals or focus areas for our next session? 

User: I think I would like to discuss how my art experiences go and any anxiety I might face while working through those feelings.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan. We can check in on your progress and explore any new feelings that arise. Thank you for opening up today. I'm looking forward to our next session!

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to it, too.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I’m glad to see you again. Today, I’d like to talk about how you’ve been feeling since our last session and what you’ve been doing to maintain your progress. How are you doing?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling quite good actually. The recognition I received at the art exhibition really boosted my confidence. I’ve been trying to focus on the positives more.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like the success at the exhibition was a significant moment for you. Can you tell me more about how that experience impacted your feelings, especially regarding anxiety and your thoughts about death?

User: Well, it made me realize that my work can be valued. I felt more connected to others, which helped lessen my fears. I’m still aware of my thoughts about death, but they don’t seem as overwhelming anymore.

Consultant: That’s a significant step forward! Feeling more connected and confident can help manage those fears. What strategies or thoughts have you found helpful in keeping those anxious feelings at bay?

User: I’ve been trying to remind myself that life has its ups and downs. I also started talking more openly with my friends about how I feel, which has been really relieving.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Opening up to friends can create a supportive network, and recognizing life’s fluctuations is a healthy perspective. How do you feel when you share your thoughts with them?

User: It feels good to be heard. I often think I’m a burden, but when they listen, it reassures me that it’s okay to share my worries. 

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel that way, but it’s great that you’re expressing yourself. Sharing worries can foster deeper connections and lessen the burden. Have there been specific moments recently when you felt anxious again?

User: Yes, sometimes I still get anxious when things feel overwhelming, particularly with my studies or family arguments at home.

Consultant: Let’s explore that a bit. What thoughts tend to accompany those moments of anxiety regarding your studies or family situations?

User: I often think that I’ll fail or that things will spiral out of control. I imagine the worst possible outcomes, and it becomes really hard to focus.

Consultant: It seems like you’re recognizing some cognitive distortions there—viewing situations in an overly negative light. What would happen if you challenged those thoughts? 

User: I guess I could remind myself that not everything is as bad as I think. Those thoughts often happen when I'm tired or stressed.

Consultant: Exactly! Remembering that your thoughts are just thoughts can give you some space to breathe. What alternatives could you tell yourself in those moments to help soothe your worries?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that I’ve faced challenges before and managed them. Just because I have those thoughts doesn’t mean they will come true.

Consultant: That’s a powerful reframe. Recognizing your past successes can bolster your confidence. Can you think of an instance when you faced a similar situation but came out positively?

User: Yes, there was a time I had a big presentation, and I thought I’d mess it up completely, but I actually did well! Everyone complimented me after.

Consultant: That’s an excellent example! It’s a reminder that anticipating failure doesn’t equate to actual failure. How could you apply this mindset to your current studies and family pressures?

User: Maybe I could set smaller, achievable goals instead of overwhelming myself with everything at once. Break things down, you know?

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Setting smaller goals can create a sense of accomplishment and reduce feelings of being overwhelmed. What could be a small goal for you this week?

User: I think I’ll break down my assignment into sections and set deadlines for each part instead of trying to do everything at once.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Creating manageable tasks can help you maintain focus and reduce anxiety. How about your family situation? Do you have ideas for how to handle conflicts when they arise?

User: I’ve thought about that. I could practice remaining calm and maybe choose to step away for a moment when tensions rise, instead of engaging immediately.

Consultant: That’s a wise approach. Taking a break can allow you to respond more thoughtfully rather than reactively. Do you feel prepared to implement these strategies?

User: Yes, I feel motivated to try these ideas out! I think they’ll help me feel more in control.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! I’m really proud of the progress you’ve made, Liu. As we wrap up our session today, let’s reflect on your journey and discuss what you can do to maintain this positive change in the future.

User: I think it’s important for me to keep practicing sharing my feelings, setting goals, and remembering to challenge negative thoughts.

Consultant: Absolutely! Maintaining those practices will help reinforce your emotional resilience. Lastly, if ever you feel overwhelmed, remember that seeking support, whether from friends or professionals, is always an option.
