Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad you're here for our session today. To start, can you share how you’ve been feeling recently, especially with everything you've gone through?

User: Hi. Honestly, I feel really down. The pressure of starting college and the breakup with my boyfriend has left me feeling hopeless. I don’t know how to cope.

Consultant: I understand that this period is really tough for you, with both the transition to college and dealing with emotions from the breakup. Can you tell me more about what these feelings look like for you on a day-to-day basis?

User: I just feel sad all the time. I have trouble getting out of bed, and when I do, everything just feels overwhelming. Sometimes, I think about how it would be easier if I wasn't here anymore.

Consultant: It’s really concerning to hear that you’re having thoughts like that. It's a sign of how overwhelmed you're feeling. Let's take a step back and explore what’s been going through your mind lately. What thoughts come to you when you feel this way?

User: I often think that I'm not good enough, like I’ll never be happy again or succeed in college. I feel like I’m a burden to my family, especially since my parents don’t really understand what I’m going through.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound incredibly heavy and challenging to carry. It's common to feel like a burden during tough times, but let’s try to pull apart these thoughts together. Do you think there’s evidence supporting the idea that you’re a failure, or could there be other ways to see your situation?

User: I guess I don’t have evidence that I’m a failure, but it just feels that way. I did poorly on a test, and that made me doubt myself even more.

Consultant: It's understandable that a poor test result could impact your confidence. However, that one experience doesn't define your entire capability. If a friend was in your shoes and felt like a failure after one test, what would you say to them?

User: I’d probably tell them that it's just one test and that they should keep trying. I guess I forget to be kind to myself like that.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Liu. It shows how we often extend kindness to others but struggle to afford the same compassion to ourselves. What if we tried to replace those negative thoughts with more supportive ones, like how you'd support a friend? 

User: That sounds nice, but I’m not sure how to do that. 

Consultant: We can start by identifying specific negative thoughts and forming alternative, more balanced thoughts. For instance, instead of thinking "I'm a failure," we could reframe it to "I didn’t do well this time, but I can learn from it." Would you be willing to try that?

User: Yeah, I think I could give it a try. It’d be nice to think differently.

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s practice. Can you pick one negative thought you had this week, and let's work on reframing it together?

User: I kept thinking that I’ll never make friends at college, which adds to my loneliness.

Consultant: That’s a tough thought to have, especially when you’re in a new environment. Let’s try to reframe it. What might be a more balanced or hopeful way to think about making friends in college?

User: Maybe I could think that it takes time to build friendships, and I can try to meet people in my classes or social events.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic reframe! You're acknowledging the difficulty while also recognizing opportunities. As you think about your social experiences, how could you take a small step toward meeting new people?

User: I could attend some club meetings or study groups. I used to enjoy group activities back in high school.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Getting involved in activities where you're likely to meet others with similar interests can really help. Just remember to be patient with yourself. 

User: I’ll try to remember that. I still worry about feeling anxious in those situations, though.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel anxious when meeting new people. What if we explored techniques that could help you manage that anxiety in social settings? 

User: That could be helpful. I’d like to learn how to control my feelings better.

Consultant: Great! One method is to practice deep breathing. It helps calm the mind and body. Would you be open to trying some breathing exercises together?

User: Sure, I’m willing to try that.

Consultant: Let's do this. Take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four... hold it for a moment... and now slowly release through your mouth. (Pause) How does that feel?

User: It feels a bit calming. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! This can be a useful tool anytime you’re feeling anxious. Keep practicing it, especially before social interactions. Reflecting on these achievements will also reinforce positive feelings. 

User: I like that idea. I’ll practice it more.

Consultant: That’s the spirit, Liu! As we reflect on your journey today, can you share one thing you've learned that you feel helps you build a more positive mindset?

User: I think I’ve learned that it’s okay to not be perfect and that I can choose to think about my situation in a more positive way. 

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s all about creating that supportive internal dialogue. Now, looking ahead, what strategies do you think will be essential for you in maintaining this progress when you face similar feelings?

User: I’ll focus on self-kindness, and remember to use breathing techniques when I feel anxious. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! As we wrap up, I want you to know that it’s okay to seek help when needed. Building these skills takes time, and if you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out again.

User: Thank you! This session has really helped me feel a bit more hopeful.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Liu! Remember, growth is a journey. Keep taking those steps, and I look forward to our next session together. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I still feel a bit lost, especially with my parents constantly asking me about my plans. They don't understand why I need time off from school, and it makes me feel really guilty.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure from your parents, which is contributing to feelings of guilt and confusion. Can you tell me more about how their expectations affect your emotional state?

User: Yes, their demands make me feel like I'm not good enough. I remember when I was younger, I used to be happier. Now, I often feel trapped in their expectations and can't see a way out.

Consultant: I see. It seems like there’s a contrast between your childhood feelings and your current situation. Let's explore what those expectations mean to you. How do you think they impact your view of yourself?

User: I feel like if I don't meet their expectations, I am a failure. There’s this constant fear of disappointing them, which makes me want to isolate myself even more.

Consultant: That fear of disappointing others can be really heavy to carry. It’s understandable that it leads you to isolate yourself. Let’s try to identify some of those automatic thoughts that pop up when you think about their expectations. What goes through your mind in those moments?

User: I often think that I’ll never be as successful as they want me to be. It’s as if I can already hear them saying that I’m wasting my time.

Consultant: That’s a tough thought to have. It sounds like you feel a lot of pressure to succeed based on what they believe. Let’s challenge that thought together. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts this belief?

User: I guess I’ve done things that make me happy, but they don't seem to count. I try to make things work, but it feels like it's never enough for them.

Consultant: It’s important to recognize the positive efforts you’ve made, even if they seem small. What could be an alternative way to view your actions that might empower you rather than make you feel inadequate?

User: Maybe I could see my happiness and efforts as valid, regardless of whether they match my parents' expectations.

Consultant: That sounds like a great shift in perspective! Accepting your own definition of success can help relieve some pressure. How can you start to reinforce this new belief during challenging conversations with your parents?

User: I could remind myself that I have my own goals and that they don’t need to align perfectly with what my parents want. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Setting your own goals is key to your mental well-being. Let’s practice that. How would you express your feelings to your parents without feeling defensive? 

User: I could say something like, "I appreciate your concerns, but I'm trying to figure things out in my way and I hope you can support me."

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! Communicating your needs clearly can foster understanding and may help reduce their pressure on you. How do you feel about trying to have that conversation with them?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also determined. I really want them to understand me.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous. Remember that nervousness can coexist with determination. What strategies can you use to prepare for this conversation?

User: I could write down what I want to say, practice in front of a mirror, or even role-play with a friend.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Practicing can help you feel more confident. If things don’t go as planned, how can you still stay grounded and focused on your own path?

User: I suppose I could remind myself that their opinions don’t define my worth and stick to my goals.

Consultant: Exactly! Keeping your goals in sight and reinforcing your self-worth regardless of external opinions is powerful. Let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today. What are the key takeaways for you?

User: I learned that I can challenge my negative thoughts and accept my happiness and actions as valid. I also feel more prepared to communicate my needs to my parents.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Liu! Recognizing your self-worth and preparing to communicate your needs are significant steps forward. As we wrap up today, what do you think you might want to focus on before our next session?

User: I want to practice that conversation with my parents and keep reminding myself of my goals.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support before our next session. I'm here for you.

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful and ready to take the next steps.

Consultant: You’re doing great, Liu! I’m proud of you. Looking forward to hearing how it goes. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better emotionally. I've been trying to talk to more classmates, but I still struggle with the pressure of schoolwork.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling a bit better and making an effort to connect with your classmates! Can you share more about the pressure you're feeling? What specific aspects of schoolwork are challenging for you right now?

User: I think it's mainly the amount of assignments piling up. Sometimes, I feel overwhelmed and it makes me want to avoid studying altogether.

Consultant: That sounds quite challenging. It's common to feel overwhelmed when there's a lot on your plate. How does that feeling of being overwhelmed affect your motivation to study or participate in activities?

User: When I feel overwhelmed, I just freeze and can’t seem to focus on anything. It makes me anxious, and then I think about how I might not do well, which makes it harder to start studying.

Consultant: I see. It seems like there’s a cycle where feeling overwhelmed leads to anxiety, which then makes it harder to engage with your studies. Let’s explore this together. Can you recall any specific thoughts that come to mind when you start feeling anxious about your schoolwork?

User: I often think that if I don’t get perfect grades, my parents will be disappointed in me. I also worry that I won’t fit in with my classmates.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy to carry, especially when it comes to wanting to fit in and meet expectations. How do those thoughts make you feel in the moment?

User: They make me feel really stressed and sometimes even lead to sadness. I feel like I’m not good enough.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way given the pressure you’re under. Let’s challenge those thoughts a bit. What kind of evidence do you have that your parents would actually be disappointed in you if you didn’t achieve perfection?

User: Well, they do talk a lot about success and grades at home. But I guess they don’t say it directly. It’s more my interpretation of what they want.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Liu. Often, our interpretations can add layers of pressure. If a friend were in your situation, what might you advise them to think about their parents' expectations? 

User: I’d probably tell them that their parents are likely to be supportive no matter what, as long as they try their best.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s helpful to challenge the belief that you need to be perfect to earn support or love. Would you be open to trying an experiment? Perhaps you could share some of the struggles you’re facing with your parents, to see how they respond.

User: That sounds a bit scary but also kind of freeing. I think I could try that.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel apprehensive, yet that’s a brave step towards open communication. Additionally, what’s one small social activity you could prepare for that might help you engage more comfortably with classmates?

User: Maybe I could invite a couple of classmates to study together. That seems less intimidating than approaching them alone.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Studying together can create a softer environment for building connections. What would you need to make that happen? 

User: I guess I just need to send a message and plan a time. I’m just worried they might say no.

Consultant: That’s a natural concern. Remember, even if they say no, it’s not a reflection of your worth. You’re showing initiative, which is admirable. How would you feel if you took that step and reached out?

User: I might feel nervous at first, but I think it would be a good learning experience regardless of their response.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! Focusing on the experience rather than just the outcome can help. Let’s summarize what you’ll do for next time: you’ll reach out to your classmates to study together and communicate with your parents about your feelings around schoolwork.

User: Yes, I can do that! I feel a little more hopeful about it now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’re making progress. Before we conclude today, how can you remind yourself of this hope when you start to feel overwhelmed again?

User: Maybe I can write down some positive affirmations or remind myself that I’m doing my best.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy, Liu. Writing down those affirmations can serve as a quick reminder during tough moments. Keep practicing those social connections and communicating your feelings. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time!

User: Thank you! I feel more motivated to tackle these challenges. See you next time!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of the steps you're taking. Take care, and I’m looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! It's great to see you again. I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I’ve been trying to get involved more in school activities, and I think it has helped a bit. But sometimes I still feel overwhelmed, especially when I think about my past mistakes.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you’re attempting to engage more with activities at school! It shows a positive change in your behavior. Can you share more about what activities you’ve participated in and how they made you feel?

User: So, I joined a student club focused on art. I really enjoy drawing, and it felt good to express myself creatively. But there are moments when I doubt my abilities and feel anxious about what others think of my work.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic way to express yourself! Art can be very therapeutic. It's completely normal to have doubts, especially in a creative space. What specific thoughts come to mind when you start feeling anxious about how others perceive your work?

User: I often think that my drawings are not good enough, and that everyone else is much better. It makes me feel like I should just stop trying.

Consultant: I can see how those thoughts would be discouraging. It’s important to recognize that comparing ourselves to others can lead to those feelings of inadequacy. When you have those automatic thoughts, how do you feel emotionally?

User: I feel really down and frustrated. It’s like I’m trapped in this negativity, which makes me less willing to share my work with anyone.

Consultant: That sounds tough, Liu. It’s understandable to feel frustrated when you’re dealing with those thoughts and emotions. Let’s take a moment to identify if there are any cognitive distortions happening. For example, do you find yourself thinking in absolutes, like "I must be perfect" or "I always fail"?

User: Yes, I think I do. It’s like I expect myself to be really good immediately, and if I'm not, I feel like a failure.

Consultant: Recognizing those patterns is a great step forward. Let’s try to challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that you need to be perfect? Can you think of moments when you’ve learned something by making mistakes?

User: Well, I remember when I first started drawing; I wasn’t very good. But over time, I improved a lot. I guess I learned that it’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: Exactly! Improvement often comes through practice and making mistakes. If a friend were in your situation, what advice do you think you might give them?

User: I’d probably tell them not to be so hard on themselves and that it’s all part of the process.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective! Now, let’s work on incorporating that same kindness towards yourself. What might happen if you allow yourself to see your current efforts as a step towards improvement instead of looking for perfection?

User: I think I could feel more relaxed and maybe even enjoy drawing more without the pressure. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on the process rather than the end result can create a more positive experience for you. Let’s also set some small goals related to your art. What’s one thing you could commit to doing this week to help keep that positivity going?

User: I could set aside some time to draw without worrying about what others think. Just for myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Making time for yourself to enjoy your art can really foster that positive mindset. How about rewarding yourself for taking that time? What do you think would be a good way to celebrate that effort?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to some of my favorite snacks or watch a movie I love afterward.

Consultant: That sounds great! Celebrating your effort this way can reinforce the positive behavior. Remember, it’s about the joy of creating rather than the final product. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel good about it. I think it will help remind me to focus on enjoyment rather than stress. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed. You’ve recognized some negative thoughts, learned to challenge them, and created a plan for enjoying your art. 

User: Yes, that’s right. I feel more equipped to handle my feelings now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress, Liu! Continue reflecting on your self-worth and celebrate your efforts. Next time, we can review how this week went and make adjustments if needed. Remember, I'm here to support you. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I'll see you next time!

Consultant: You’re welcome! I look forward to hearing about your experiences. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hi Liu! I'm really pleased to see you today. How have you been since our last session? 

User: Hello. I've been feeling a bit better lately, but I still have my ups and downs. I'm trying to focus on being more independent and manage my feelings better.

Consultant: That’s great to hear you feel a bit better! Could you share more about what has helped you feel this way? 

User: I started reaching out more to my classmates and trying to connect with them. It feels nice to have someone to talk to instead of keeping everything inside.

Consultant: Building connections with your classmates sounds like a positive step. How have those interactions made you feel in terms of your self-reliance?

User: It has made me feel less alone, and I am beginning to realize that I can rely on myself and also on others when I need support. That feels liberating.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you’re finding strength in both yourself and your relationships. Do you notice any specific situations where you still find it difficult to manage your feelings?

User: Sometimes, when I talk to my parents, I feel a lot of pressure. They can be quite strict with me, and it often makes me anxious.

Consultant: That sounds challenging. It's understandable to feel anxious when under pressure, especially from parents. Can you describe what goes through your mind during those conversations?

User: I usually feel like I have to meet their expectations. It feels overwhelming, and I sometimes question whether I'm good enough for them.

Consultant: I hear you. Those feelings of pressure can be really heavy. Let’s explore this further. What would it look like for you to feel “good enough” in your own eyes, rather than solely through your parents' expectations?

User: I think if I could set my own goals and feel proud of my achievements, it would help. I want to feel that my efforts are valid, regardless of their opinions.

Consultant: Setting your own goals sounds like a valuable way to affirm your self-worth. How about we discuss a few small goals you can implement this week that would help you in that direction?

User: Sure! I can try to set a goal of studying a bit each day, instead of cramming for exams. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic goal! Daily study sessions can really build your confidence. How do you plan to keep track of your progress?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal to note down what I accomplish each day. It could help me see my progress.

Consultant: Keeping a journal is a great idea! It will help you visualize your growth. What kind of entries do you think you might want to include in it?

User: I’ll jot down what I study each day and how I feel. That way, I can reflect on my emotions and achievements.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach. Reflecting on both your emotions and accomplishments can empower you. How do you feel about this journaling idea now?

User: I feel excited! I hope it will help me stay motivated and perhaps even give me insights into my feelings.

Consultant: That enthusiasm is great to hear! Remember, it’s a process, and every little step counts. Have you thought about how to maintain this motivation over time?

User: I guess if I can celebrate my small wins regularly, that would help me stay engaged and motivated in the long run.

Consultant: Celebrating small victories is a very effective strategy! What kind of celebrations do you have in mind for yourself?

User: Maybe treating myself to something small or doing something I enjoy when I’ve completed my study goals.

Consultant: Those are wonderful ways to recognize your effort! It’s important to reward yourself. As we wrap up today’s session, is there anything else you want to address or any concerns on your mind? 

User: No, I think I’ve shared what’s been on my mind. I feel more positive about my goals now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You’ve made significant progress. Remember, you have the skills to manage your emotions and continue growing. I look forward to hearing about your journaling experiences in our next session!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’m looking forward to it as well. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Liu! Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself in this journey. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello Liu, I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I have been feeling more positive lately, and I've managed my emotions well despite the exam stress.

Consultant: That sounds great to hear! It's wonderful that you've been able to maintain a positive outlook. Can you share some specific strategies or techniques you've been using to manage the stress?

User: I've been sticking to a study schedule, and I take regular breaks. It helps me stay focused without feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: A structured study schedule paired with regular breaks is a strong strategy. It shows that you're taking control of your situation. How does adhering to this schedule make you feel?

User: It makes me feel more in control and less anxious. I also feel proud when I complete my study goals.

Consultant: It's amazing to feel that sense of control and accomplishment. Have there been any particular moments recently where you felt especially stressed, despite feeling generally positive?

User: Yes, just the other day, I had a panic moment while studying for a particularly tough subject. I thought I wouldn't be able to manage it.

Consultant: Those feelings of panic can be quite challenging. Can you tell me more about what thoughts were going through your mind during that moment?

User: I kept thinking that I would fail if I didn’t understand everything perfectly, which made me feel really overwhelmed.

Consultant: That's a common cognitive distortion where perfectionism can lead to increased anxiety. What evidence do you have that not understanding everything perfectly will lead to failure?

User: I guess I don't really have evidence. It just feels like a huge pressure that I put on myself.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that pressure, especially during intense study periods. If a friend were in your situation, what advice would you give them about not needing to achieve perfection?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s more important to do their best and that nobody is perfect.

Consultant: That’s wise advice. It suggests that you already know a healthier perspective. How could you apply this same perspective to yourself in those overwhelming moments?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to not get everything right and that my effort is what matters most.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic approach! Let’s think about some small experiments you could try during your study sessions to test this new perspective. What might you do?

User: Maybe I could set smaller, more achievable goals for each study session and allow myself to take breaks without guilt.

Consultant: That's a perfect idea! Setting smaller goals can reduce pressure and maintain your motivation. How do you think that might change your emotional experience while studying?

User: I think it would make me feel more relaxed and less anxious, knowing that I'm focusing on completing small tasks.

Consultant: Exactly! And by allowing breaks, you'll be giving your mind the rest it needs to recharge. When you think about your current strategies and these new adjustments, what do you hope to achieve by the time your exams arrive?

User: I hope to feel more confident and calm during the exams without feeling completely stressed out.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals. It’s great that you want to feel confident and calm. As we move towards your exams, how can we ensure that you maintain these positive feelings?

User: I think regular reflections on my progress and reminding myself that I’m doing my best might help.

Consultant: That sounds very effective. Regular reflections can reinforce your growth and achievements. Can you envision a way to keep track of those reflections?

User: I could start a journal where I write down my thoughts after each study session.

Consultant: A journal is a wonderful tool! It can serve as a personal space to process your thoughts and emotions. How do you feel about starting this journaling practice?

User: I'm excited about it. It feels like a good outlet for my feelings and a way to track my progress.

Consultant: That's the spirit! Remember, this reflection is not only about identifying challenges but also recognizing your strengths. How do you feel as we wrap up our conversation today?

User: I feel empowered and more equipped to handle my stress. I appreciate these strategies we’ve discussed.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! You've made significant progress, and I believe you can carry this confidence into your exams. Before we conclude, is there anything specific you want to ensure you remember going forward?

User: I want to remember to be kind to myself and that it’s alright to seek help when I need it.

Consultant: That's a really important takeaway, Liu. Being kind to yourself and recognizing the value of support is key. I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. You're doing great work—keep it up!

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to our next session as well.

Consultant: You're welcome! Take care, and we'll connect soon.
