Consultant: Hello, Yuyue! I'm glad you're here today. Before we begin, I'd like to understand how you've been feeling lately regarding going to kindergarten. Can you share your thoughts with me?

User: Hi! I really don’t want to go back to kindergarten. Every time I think about it, I feel scared and just want to be with my mom. I don’t like it there.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of anxiety when it comes to kindergarten and that being away from your mom is very difficult for you. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel afraid at kindergarten?

User: I feel like nobody is friendly and I get sick a lot. I just want to play with my toys at home instead. I don't like being around the other kids.

Consultant: That sounds tough, Yuyue. It's understandable to feel worried when you're not feeling well, especially in a new place. What kind of experiences have you had with the other kids that make you feel this way?

User: They don’t play with me sometimes, and I feel alone. I just want my mom to stay with me all the time. I don’t want to feel lonely.

Consultant: Feeling lonely can be really difficult, especially when you’re used to being close to your mom. Let’s think about your feelings for a moment. If you were to try and tell a toy how you feel about going to kindergarten, what would that toy say back to you? 

User: I think the toy would say it's okay to be scared, but it should try to make friends. But I can't! 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel scared, and I think that toy is giving you good advice. Making friends can take time, and trying is the first step. What do you think might help you feel a little more comfortable at kindergarten?

User: Maybe if I could take my favorite toy with me, it would make me feel better. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Bringing a favorite toy can give you comfort. Let's explore this further. How do you think having your toy with you can help you when you're feeling anxious?

User: It would remind me of home and keep me safe. I could hug it when I feel scared! 

Consultant: Hugs are very comforting! You’re already thinking of a helpful strategy to cope with your feelings. Besides your toy, is there something else that you feel might change your experience at kindergarten?

User: I think if I knew the teachers more, maybe I wouldn’t be so scared. 

Consultant: Building a connection with your teachers could definitely help you feel more secure. Would you like to practice how you might talk to them? What would you want to ask your teacher if you met them?

User: I would want to ask if they can help me feel better and ask them to play with me. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful way to reach out! Asking for help is a big step. Perhaps we could role-play this scenario. I can pretend to be your teacher, and you can practice asking for help. Would you like to try?

User: Okay, that sounds okay!

Consultant: Great! *pretending to be the teacher* Hello there, Yuyue! How can I help you today?

User: Um... can you help me feel better? I don’t like being alone and I want to play. 

Consultant: That’s a brave thing to say! It’s okay to ask for help. *switching back* How did that feel for you to express that?

User: It was a little scary, but I think it helped.

Consultant: I’m really proud of you for trying! Practicing this could make it easier the next time you see your teacher. Now, let’s think about what we can do to help you feel less anxious when you're not with your mom. What do you think about creating a special goodbye ritual with your mom before you go to kindergarten?

User: Like a hug and a special wave? 

Consultant: Exactly! A special hug and wave could help you feel connected to her even when you're apart. Do you think that might give you a little strength?

User: Yes, I think that might help me feel less scared when she leaves.

Consultant: Wonderful! This could become a comforting routine for you. As we continue working together, we can think of more ways to help you feel safe and connected in your environment. What other activities do you think might help you feel more confident in kindergarten?

User: Maybe if I try to draw with some other kids, I wouldn’t feel so alone. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Drawing is a great way to connect with others. You can invite someone to draw with you, which could help break the ice. Would you like to practice how to invite another child to join you?

User: Sure, I think I could say, “Do you want to draw together?”

Consultant: That’s perfect! It's simple and friendly. Remember, it’s okay if you feel nervous—just being open can lead to new friendships. How do you feel about trying this next time?

User: I feel a bit less scared about it now!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Yuyue! It seems you're making progress in managing those feelings. As our time together is coming to a close, let’s summarize what you’ve learned today. What are some steps you feel ready to take moving forward?

User: I will take my toy with me, practice asking for help, and try to draw with the other kids. 

Consultant: Those are excellent steps to help you cope! Remember, it's okay to feel scared, and these actions will help you slowly build your confidence. I'm here to support you as you prepare to return to kindergarten. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need me.

User: Thank you! This makes me feel better. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Yuyue! I’m proud of the effort you’re making. Take care, and I look forward to our next session together.

Consultant: Hello, Yueyue! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel a bit better at home, but I'm still scared about going out, especially to kindergarten. I really don’t want to see new people.

Consultant: I understand that you still feel nervous about visiting new places and meeting new friends. It’s perfectly okay to feel that way. Can you share more about what you think about going to kindergarten right now?

User: I remember feeling sad when I was at kindergarten before. I don't want to feel that way again. It just feels easier to stay home with my mom.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to want to stay in a place where you feel secure, especially if you have those memories from kindergarten. Let's try to reframe those memories. What were some things that you liked about kindergarten, even if they seem small?

User: Well, sometimes I liked the playtime. We had fun games, and I liked the art activities.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Playtime and art sound like enjoyable experiences. We can definitely focus on those moments to create a more positive connection to kindergarten. How about we plan some fun activities at home similar to what you did at kindergarten? 

User: That sounds nice! But can we skip going outside until I'm ready?

Consultant: Absolutely, we can take our time! It’s important to feel comfortable. We can create a kindergarten-like environment at home first. How do you think it would feel to play some of those games or do art activities here with your mom? 

User: I would like that. I think it would be fun to paint and play pretend!

Consultant: Great! Painting and playtime can help you ease into those positive feelings. Would you like to have a special painting day planned for this week? 

User: Yes, I would love that! It sounds really fun.

Consultant: Fantastic! We can set that up. Also, can you tell me what you think you would feel like at that moment when you’re painting or playing? 

User: I think I would feel happy and maybe a little less scared.

Consultant: Feeling happy and less scared is a lovely goal. Let's explore that excitement together. As we prepare for this painting day, what do you think could help you feel even more brave about going back to kindergarten in the future?

User: Maybe if I have fun pictures to show my friends, it would be easier. 

Consultant: That’s a brilliant idea! Sharing your artwork can be a great way to connect with new friends. We could practice what you might say when you share your painting. How does that sound to you?

User: I like that. I could say, “Look what I made!”

Consultant: That’s perfect! It sounds so friendly and inviting. Let’s keep practicing how to introduce your artwork. It might make you feel excited about meeting new friends. 

User: I think that would help! But I still worry about if they won’t like my painting.

Consultant: It’s okay to worry about that. Let’s think about it together. Do you remember a time when you saw someone else’s art? How did that make you feel? 

User: I liked them! I thought they were cool.

Consultant: Exactly! Just like you liked their art, others will likely appreciate yours too. It’s about expressing yourself and having fun. If someone doesn't respond the way you hope, you can think about how much you enjoyed creating it. 

User: I get it. I just need to remember that it’s okay to just enjoy it.

Consultant: Absolutely! Enjoyment is the key here. And remember, your mom is there to support you too. When you try going back to kindergarten, you can tell her how you feel, and she can help you.

User: Yes, I feel better thinking about it that way. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Yueyue! Let’s keep building on this positive feeling. For now, how about we also create some little goals for you to work on at home? 

User: Sure! Like what?

Consultant: Perhaps we can set a goal to try one new art project this week, then share it with your mom. This will help boost your confidence while having fun at the same time. 

User: That sounds good! I can try making a card for my grandma.

Consultant: What a lovely idea! Making a card for your grandma is a wonderful way to stay connected. How do you feel about that plan?

User: I feel happy! It’s nice to make things for others.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Helping others can bring joy and build connections, which can also ease your worries about new environments. We are making fantastic progress!

User: Thank you for helping me feel this way.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm proud of the steps you're taking. Keep that excitement alive, and remember, we'll keep working together until you feel more comfortable. 

User: I can’t wait for painting day!

Consultant: Neither can I! It’s going to be so much fun. We’ll talk again next time about how your painting day went and continue building your confidence. 

User: Sounds great! I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: Me too, Yueyue! Remember, you're doing amazing, and I believe in you. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello there! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling about being in new places or around other people? 

User: Hi! I feel a bit curious when I go out with my family, but I still get really nervous in unfamiliar environments. I always want to stay close to my mom. 

Consultant: It sounds like you have some curiosity when you're out, but that feeling of needing to stay close to your mom can be a bit overwhelming at times. Can you tell me more about what makes those new places or situations feel uncomfortable for you?

User: Well, there are just so many people, and everything feels different. I don't know what to expect, and that makes me want my mom even more.

Consultant: I understand. Having so many unfamiliar things happening can make anyone want to find a safe spot. When you’re with your mom, it feels safe. What do you think would help you feel a little bit more at ease when you are out?

User: Maybe if I could know more about what's going to happen or what the place is like, it might help. 

Consultant: That's a great insight! Preparing ahead of time can really help reduce those nervous feelings. Would you like to try talking about some activities you could do in these new places that could make it feel a bit more exciting and less scary?

User: I think that could be fun! I love playing on slides and swings at the park!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Slides and swings are so much fun. How do you feel about the idea of starting with a short visit to the park and perhaps exploring the swings for a little bit? We can plan for your mom to stay close by too.

User: That sounds good! I like it when my mom is nearby, but maybe I can try going to the swing on my own for a quick time.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Having your mom close by will make it easier to try that out. After you try the swings on your own, how do you think you might feel about that experience?

User: Uhm, I think I would feel a little proud but also maybe still a bit scared at first. 

Consultant: Feeling proud is a wonderful goal! It's totally okay to feel a little scared too. Maybe when you finish swinging, you can tell your mom how you felt. That way, you can share your excitement and any worries you have. Would that work for you?

User: Yes, I would like talking to my mom about it! 

Consultant: That’s a lovely idea, sharing with your mom can really help you feel supported. Do you think you could also bring a small toy or something that makes you feel happy? This might give you a bit of comfort if you start to feel anxious.

User: I can bring my favorite bear! It always makes me feel better. 

Consultant: Your favorite bear sounds perfect! Having something familiar with you can help ease those feelings. What about after you play? If you find it fun, could we think of ways you could try to interact with other kids as well? 

User: Maybe I could say hi to them or ask if they want to play something together. 

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Saying hi is a wonderful first step. We can also think about what to say if they invite you to play something. How does that sound to you?

User: I like that! That could be fun.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! It sounds like you are feeling more excited about trying these new experiences. How do you think practicing these small activities will help you in the long run when you're in new places?

User: I think I’ll get more used to it and won’t feel so scared anymore.

Consultant: Exactly! Each small step can help build your confidence and comfort. It’s all about practicing and supporting yourself during this journey. Would you like to talk about how you might feel after your first visit to the park?

User: I hope I’ll be happy and want to go again. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! Feeling happy and looking forward to going again is exactly what we want. Let’s make a plan for how to celebrate your successful visit to the park together. Do you have any ideas?

User: Maybe we can have ice cream afterward if I try swinging by myself!

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic reward for your bravery! I think that will motivate you really well. So, let’s recap: you’ll bring your bear, try swinging on your own for a bit, say hi to other kids, and celebrate afterward with ice cream. How does that sound?

User: Sounds like a good plan!

Consultant: I'm super proud of you! Remember, it’s completely okay to take your time with each part of this process. After trying this, we can talk again about how you felt and what you learned, okay? 

User: I would like that! 

Consultant: Great! I look forward to hearing about your experience. You’re doing a wonderful job working through this, and I believe you will have a fantastic time. Let’s catch up after your park adventure! 

User: Thank you! I’m excited!

Consultant: You’re welcome! I'm excited too. Remember, you are capable of more than you know, and I’m here to support you along the way. Enjoy your time at the park!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yueyue! I'm really happy to see you today. I’d love to hear about how you've been feeling lately, especially after starting your new parent-child activities.

User: Hi! I've been feeling a little better since those activities started. I enjoy playing with the other children and trying new games, but sometimes I still feel a bit anxious when there are too many people around.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing some positive feelings from playing with other kids, which is wonderful! It's normal to feel a bit anxious in new situations. Can you tell me more about the games that you like or any moments when you felt really happy during the activities?

User: I really liked the music game we played! We danced and it was so much fun. I felt happy when I could dance with my friends, but I got nervous when there were other kids I didn’t know.

Consultant: Dancing with your friends sounds like a fantastic experience! It’s great that you felt happy during that game. It's also okay to feel nervous around new kids. How did you manage those feelings while you were dancing?

User: I just tried to focus on the music and enjoy the moment. But sometimes I just wanted to be with my mom to feel safe.

Consultant: That’s a really smart way to cope! Focusing on the music helped you enjoy the moment. It’s completely understandable that you want your mom nearby when you feel nervous. What do you think you could do next time to help yourself feel more comfortable while also participating in the activities?

User: Maybe I could try to make friends with one kid first before playing, like talking to them or dancing together.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Making a friend can make you feel more comfortable. When you take that first step, how do you think it will make you feel about being around new kids?

User: I think it would make me feel less scared if I knew one kid. I might feel braver to join in the games.

Consultant: Absolutely! Knowing even one friend can help ease your fears and encourage you to join in. It’s wonderful to see how you’re thinking about this! What other ways could help you feel excited about joining new activities?

User: Maybe if I can play the games in my head first, like pretending in my room before going. That might help.

Consultant: Pretending to play the games in your room is a creative approach! Visualization can really help ease anxiety. When you picture yourself having fun in these games, how does that make you feel about trying them in real life?

User: It makes me feel more confident. I think I would be excited to try if I imagined it first!

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Imagining yourself excited can be a powerful tool. Let’s plan to practice this together. For our next session, we can think of a specific game you might encounter, and you can share how you plan to visualize it.

User: Okay! That sounds fun. I will try to think about a game that I like.

Consultant: Perfect! Focusing on a game you enjoy will make the visualization even more effective. How did it feel discussing your feelings and thoughts today?

User: I feel really good. It’s nice to talk about these things and think of ways to be happy at the activities.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Talking about your feelings is an important part of gaining confidence. As we move forward, let’s keep building on these tools. Reflecting on your experiences can help a lot as you prepare to meet new friends and participate in group activities.

User: Yes, I want to feel less nervous and have more fun!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! We’ll keep working together to make sure you feel ready to enjoy your time with others. As you think about these activities, remember that it’s okay to feel nervous sometimes, but you have the strength to face it!

User: Thank you! I feel more ready now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s inspiring to see your progress. Remember, each step you take is an important part of your journey. I’m excited to see how you grow in our next session!

###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm so glad you're here today. How are you feeling about things lately, especially regarding social situations and the idea of going back to kindergarten?

User: Hi! I feel a bit better than before. I’ve been trying to play outside more with other kids, and I even shared my toys with them!

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Sharing toys is a big step in building friendships. Can you tell me more about how it felt when you shared your toys with the other children?

User: It felt nice! They were happy, and I was happy too. I think I want to make more friends.

Consultant: That's great to hear! Wanting to make more friends shows you’re ready to connect with others. What do you think makes it fun to play with new friends?

User: I like it when we play games together. It’s just more fun than playing alone!

Consultant: Playing games together is indeed a wonderful way to bond with friends. What kinds of games did you enjoy playing with them?

User: We played tag and shared toys like dolls and blocks. I liked when everyone was laughing together!

Consultant: Laughing and having fun together is the best part of playing! How did it feel to join in these games rather than playing by yourself?

User: I think it would be fun! We could make pictures together.

Consultant: Absolutely! Making pictures together can be a great way to bond. What would you say to your new friends if you wanted to invite them to color with you?

User: I would say, “Do you want to color with me? It’s fun!”

Consultant: That's a perfect invitation! It’s friendly and inviting. How do you think your friends might respond to that?

User: I hope they say yes! I really want to color and play with them.

Consultant: I’m sure they would love that! It shows that you’re ready to connect with them. What else do you think you could do to feel even more confident when you go back to kindergarten?

User: I could practice saying "Hi" to new kids when I see them. That might help!

Consultant: Practicing greetings is a wonderful idea! It can be easy to start a conversation that way. How about we come up with a little game to practice saying "Hi" to others?

User: That sounds fun! I like games.

Consultant: Perfect! We could pretend to meet new friends and practice our greetings and how to introduce ourselves. Would you like to try that together?

User: Yes! I want to play!

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine we’re at kindergarten. You see a new friend playing with blocks. How would you approach them and start talking?

User: I would say, “Hi! I’m Yueyue. What’s your name?”

Consultant: That’s an excellent way to introduce yourself! Remember, it’s friendly and open. How do you feel after practicing that introduction?

User: I feel a little less scared. It seems easy!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! It’s all about practice. What do you think will happen when you actually say it to someone at kindergarten?

User: I think I might be surprised! They could say their name back.

Consultant: Exactly! They might even want to play with you. How would that make you feel?

User: Really happy! It would be fun to have a new friend.

Consultant: Absolutely, making a new friend is such a joy! As we get ready for kindergarten, it’s okay to feel a bit nervous, but also remember all the fun you can have. Are there any more thoughts or feelings you want to share about going back to kindergarten?

User: I hope I can be brave and have fun with the other kids.

###################
Consultant: Hello, Yuyue! It's great to see you again today. How are you feeling about going back to kindergarten?

User: Hi! I'm actually feeling really excited! I've participated in some group activities recently, and I think I've become more independent and social.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's nice to hear that you're feeling more independent and eager to engage with your peers. What specific things are you looking forward to when you return to kindergarten?

User: I can't wait to play with my friends and do fun activities together. I really missed the games and stories we had.

User: I feel happy! I think I will enjoy being with everyone and playing together. I'm not as scared as I was before.

Consultant: That's a significant improvement, Yuyue! It’s important to acknowledge those positive feelings. Can you tell me what helped reduce your fear of being away from your mom in those group activities?

User: I think participating in activities with other kids helped. I realized that they were nice and I could have fun too. My mom also tells me that it's okay to be away from her for a while.

Consultant: That's excellent that you found comfort in your interactions with other children, and it’s great that your mom supports you too. It seems like you’re really learning to trust yourself in those situations. Can you share how you felt when you were participating in those group activities?

User: I felt excited and happy! I enjoyed making new friends and playing together. Sometimes I forgot to feel scared!

Consultant: It sounds like those experiences have truly empowered you! You mentioned earlier about your mom reassuring you. How does her support make you feel when you're at school or around others?

User: It makes me feel safe! I know she will be there when I come back, so I can have fun without worrying too much.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective to have. Knowing that you have that safety net allows you to explore and engage more freely. Now, let's imagine a day at kindergarten. What would be the first activity you would want to do when you get back?

User: I want to play the building blocks game first! It's so much fun to create things together.

Consultant: Building blocks sound like a great way to engage with your friends! It will give you a chance to collaborate and express your creativity. How do you think you would feel playing that game with others?

User: I think I would feel really happy and excited! I love building and showing my creations to everyone.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It’s great to have such enthusiasm for playing and creating with your friends. As you get ready to go back, let’s talk about how you can maintain this positive momentum. Is there anything specific you’d like to practice or focus on before your return?

User: Maybe I can practice saying goodbye to my mom without feeling sad? 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Practicing goodbyes can help ease any lingering anxiety. How do you think you can make saying goodbye a more positive experience for yourself?

User: I could give her a big hug and tell her I will have fun. And then I can remind myself to think about the fun I will have!

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy, Yuyue! By focusing on the fun you’re about to have, you’re shifting your thoughts away from sadness. Would you like to try out a short role-play of your goodbye with your mom right now?

User: Sure! I can pretend she is here. 

Consultant: Great! Whenever you are ready, go ahead and start your goodbye.

User: (pretending) Bye, Mom! I will have fun at kindergarten! I’ll see you after my big playtime!

Consultant: That was fantastic! You delivered your message clearly and confidently. How did it feel to say that?

User: I felt happy! It made me excited to think of what I will do!

Consultant: That’s wonderful, Yuyue. This practice can help you build confidence in real situations. As we wrap up today, what do you think are the most helpful things you learned about returning to kindergarten?

User: I learned to focus on the fun and to practice saying goodbye. And that I can be brave!

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve made remarkable progress, and I’m glad to see how confident you feel about your return. Remember, you have the tools to handle your feelings positively. If something feels overwhelming, just take a deep breath and remind yourself of the fun ahead. 

User: Thank you! I’m really looking forward to kindergarten now!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Yuyue! I believe you’re ready for this new adventure. We’ll conclude our session here, but always remember you can come back if you feel you need more support. Have fun at kindergarten!

User: Bye! I’ll have lots of fun!
