Consultant: Hello, Wang. Welcome to today's session. It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. I've been feeling somewhat better, but I’m still really anxious about my health and my studies. I just can’t seem to shake off that worry.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you've made some progress, but anxiety is still hanging around. Can you tell me more about what specifically is triggering your anxiety regarding your health?

User: Well, I have these thoughts that something might be seriously wrong with me, even though I have no real reason to think that. It just feels overwhelming sometimes.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Wang. It’s understandable to have those feelings, especially with everything going on in your life. Let’s explore those thoughts together. What kind of thoughts come to your mind when you start to feel anxious about your health?

User: I often think about illnesses, and I worry I might have something serious, like heart issues or something. I know it's irrational, but I can’t help it.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me. It seems like you're having some very intense automatic thoughts. When those thoughts arise, what emotions do you experience?

User: I feel a knot in my stomach, and it just makes me feel really uneasy. Sometimes it leads to sleepless nights.

Consultant: That sounds exhausting. It’s hard to concentrate on anything when you're feeling that way. Let’s think about those thoughts again. You mentioned that you know they're irrational. What evidence do you have that contradicts these thoughts?

User: Well, my doctor said I'm healthy during my last check-up, and I exercise regularly. I know I'm not at high risk for anything serious.

Consultant: That’s great evidence, Wang. It’s important to remember that your doctor found no issues and that you’re taking care of your health. How might you reframe those anxious thoughts to align more closely with that evidence?

User: I guess I could tell myself that my check-up results mean I am healthy, or at least focus on that instead of the worst-case scenarios.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a great step towards challenging those negative thoughts. What if you practiced telling yourself that when you start to feel anxious? 

User: I think that would help! But sometimes it just feels so automatic to worry. 

Consultant: That’s completely normal, especially when anxiety has been a consistent part of your life. Let's try to develop a strategy for when those thoughts crop up. Could we practice a comforting and positive statement together, maybe something like, “I am healthy, and I have supportive evidence to prove it”?

User: Yes, I like that! I can remind myself of that when I start to feel anxious.

Consultant: Perfect! Now, in addition to reframing thoughts, we should consider how to address the physical sensations of anxiety you mentioned, like the knot in your stomach. Have you tried any relaxation techniques to help with that?

User: I haven’t really done anything in particular… I guess I just let it build up.

Consultant: That’s understandable, but we can work on that together. Would you be open to practicing some progressive relaxation techniques? It can be quite effective in calming your body and mind.

User: Sure, I’d like to give it a try. I’ve heard it can be helpful.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start with a simple method. We can take a few moments to focus on breathing deeply—from your abdomen rather than your chest. It helps slow down your heart rate. Would you like to try it now?

User: Yes, I’d love to! 

Consultant: Perfect. Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a moment, and then slowly release it through your mouth. Let’s try this a few times together… 

(User and Consultant practice deep breathing for a couple of minutes.)

Consultant: How do you feel after that exercise?

User: I feel a bit more relaxed! I didn’t realize how much tension I was holding in.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! This simple practice can help lower your anxiety levels over time. Remember, it's all about consistency. How do you feel about incorporating this into your daily routine?

User: I think I can do that. Maybe even before bed to help with my sleep.

Consultant: Absolutely! That sounds like a great plan. Incorporating relaxation techniques before bedtime may help with your sleep disturbances. Now, before we wrap up, what are your thoughts on what we’ve discussed today? 

User: I feel like I have some good strategies now to manage my anxiety and recognize my thoughts better. I’m hopeful!

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Wang! You should feel proud of the steps you’re taking. Remember to practice what we’ve discussed, and I’m here to support you as you continue to make progress. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. It feels good to have a plan.

Consultant: You’re welcome! You’ve made great strides today. I look forward to our next session, and in the meantime, be kind to yourself. 

User: I will. See you next time!

Consultant: See you next time, Wang!
###################
Consultant: Hello Wang! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been trying to cope, but honestly, I'm still feeling quite anxious. My worries seem to wrap around every little detail, especially at school. 

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're experiencing lingering anxiety and an over-focus on details. Could you share with me a recent situation where you felt particularly anxious or over-sensitive? 

User: Well, it’s about my roommate's habits. He’s quite messy, and I find it hard to concentrate when things are out of order. It disrupts my peace, and I can't help but think about it constantly. 

Consultant: That can definitely be challenging, especially when you're trying to focus on your studies. What thoughts cross your mind when his habits bother you? 

User: I keep thinking that if he doesn't change, I'll fail my courses. I know it sounds extreme, but it just feels like everything is connected, and his mess is a huge distraction. 

Consultant: It makes sense that such thoughts would lead to heightened anxiety, especially with academic pressures. Can we evaluate whether there’s strong evidence supporting the idea that his behavior will affect your grades? 

User: I guess not really. I mean, I can still study somewhere else if I need to. But it’s hard to just push those thoughts away. 

Consultant: That's a significant insight! It looks like you already have some alternative options. What would happen if you approached the situation with a bit more flexibility in your thinking? 

User: I could try studying in the library or another location instead of fixating on his cleanliness, I suppose. But it’s just so hard to switch my mindset. 

Consultant: Changing our thinking patterns can indeed be tough, but it’s definitely possible. How about we make a plan? What would it look like if you committed to studying in the library for a few days? 

User: That could work! I’ve wanted to get into the habit of studying in the library; I just need to take that first step. 

Consultant: That's a great start! It might also help to identify any negative thoughts that come up when you think about leaving your room. What else makes you anxious about finding a new study spot? 

User: I worry about whether I’ll get distracted in the library too, or if I'll run into someone I don’t want to talk to. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those concerns. Let’s explore these fears. What might happen if you do encounter a distraction while studying at the library? 

User: I might lose my focus and feel even more stressed about my work. 

Consultant: That’s a possible outcome. But let’s consider how you might handle it. What strategies could you use to refocus if that happens? 

User: I guess I could take a short break or set a timer for focused study sessions. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Establishing those strategies can help you regain control and ease your anxiety. Is there something else that has been bothering you this week? 

User: Just a general feeling of pressure around my grades. I feel like I can’t keep up with my classmates sometimes. 

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a lot of pressure weighing on you regarding your performance. How have you been coping with those feelings? 

User: I’ve been trying to stay positive, but it's tough. Sometimes I just feel lost when I look at my peers. 

Consultant: It’s normal to feel that way, especially in a competitive environment. Maybe we could challenge the thought that others are always doing better than you. What evidence do you have of your own successes? 

User: I have done well in previous tests, but I just... can't seem to remember that during these moments of doubt. 

Consultant: Acknowledging your past successes is crucial. Perhaps we can develop a practice to remind yourself of those achievements during high-stress times. How would that work for you? 

User: I could keep a list of my accomplishments somewhere visible, like on my desk. That might help me focus on my strengths. 

Consultant: Excellent idea! That way, when you start feeling overwhelmed, you can easily remind yourself of your capabilities. Would that make a difference? 

User: Yes, I think it would. I just need to remind myself more often that I can do this. 

Consultant: Absolutely, and it’s wonderful that you’re recognizing the importance of self-affirmation. As we move forward, are there other coping strategies you’d like to integrate in your routine? 

User: I could try to talk to my roommate more openly to address my concerns instead of keeping everything bottled up. 

Consultant: Open communication sounds like a constructive approach! How do you feel about bringing that up with him? 

User: I’m a bit nervous, but I think it would help both of us. Maybe we can find a compromise. 

Consultant: That’s a brave step to take! Communication can often lead to better understanding. Let’s set a goal for your next session—by then, how about you have that discussion with your roommate? 

User: I’ll try! I really want to improve this situation. 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! We’ll review how it goes in our next session. Before we wrap up, how are you feeling about your overall progress today? 

User: I feel a bit lighter, actually. I’m not all the way there yet, but I can see some steps I can take. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Each step matters. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. I look forward to hearing how these strategies work for you next time. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Wang! Remember, you’re not alone in this. Take care until our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite anxious and stressed about my grades. I’m still struggling to remember things when studying, and it's really discouraging. 

Consultant: I understand that you’re feeling more anxious because of your grades and the memory issues you’re facing. It can be overwhelming. Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you about your performance?

User: I'm just afraid that I won't do well on the upcoming exams. I feel pressure from my parents and the expectations that come with being in a military school. It feels like everyone is counting on me.

Consultant: It sounds like there is a lot of pressure on you, both from yourself and your parents. It’s natural to feel anxious in such situations. When you think about these pressures, what thoughts come to your mind?

User: I often think about how disappointing it would be if I don't meet everyone's expectations, especially my father's. It makes me feel like I can't handle it.

Consultant: I can see how those thoughts can create a heavy weight on your shoulders. Let’s try to break it down a bit. What evidence do you have that not achieving your goals would be such a disappointment? 

User: Well, I've always been told that I need to excel since I'm the only child. There’s this feeling that if I fail, it would reflect badly on my parents and me.

Consultant: That’s a significant burden to bear. It seems like you’re making a connection between your performance and your self-worth as well as your parents’ pride. Can we explore alternative perspectives? What would you say to a friend if they were in your situation?

User: I suppose I would tell them that it's okay to have ups and downs and that failing a test doesn’t define who they are. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to recognize that your worth isn't solely tied to your grades. What if you approached your studies with the mindset that you're learning and growing rather than solely focusing on the outcome? 

User: That makes sense. I think I’ve been so focused on the grades that I forgot to appreciate the learning process. 

Consultant: Great insight! Implementing that mindset could really help reduce some of your anxiety. Let’s think about how we can set a reasonable study plan that allows you to focus on learning rather than just results. 

User: I’d really like that. I've just been so overwhelmed that I haven't been able to create any structure for my studies.

Consultant: It’s understandable. Let’s start with small, manageable goals. How many hours a day do you think you could dedicate to studying without feeling overly stressed?

User: I think if I can manage around three hours a day, that wouldn't be too overwhelming.

Consultant: Three hours sounds like a reasonable start. We can divide those into smaller sessions with breaks to help maintain your focus. How does that sound to you? 

User: Yeah, breaking it down sounds much better! I often end up feeling burnt out when I try to study for too long.

Consultant: It’s all about finding balance. Plus, giving yourself breaks can actually improve your memory retention. What activities do you think would help you relax during those breaks?

User: Maybe I could take a short walk or listen to some music. I usually feel a bit better after doing something enjoyable. 

Consultant: Those are great ideas! Engaging in enjoyable activities can indeed refresh your mind. How do you feel about incorporating those into your study schedule?

User: I think that would really help. It’s nice to have things to look forward to while studying. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Let's set this up as your plan. Remember to also check in with yourself about how you're feeling. Regular reflection can help you adjust as needed. 

User: I’ll definitely try to do that. I hope it helps me feel less anxious. 

Consultant: It’s a step in the right direction. As we continue, it will be important to monitor your thoughts and feelings about your progress. Do you think you can manage to journal about your experiences while you follow this plan?

User: Journaling sounds helpful! I sometimes forget my thoughts, and writing them down might clarify things. 

Consultant: Exactly! Writing can be a powerful tool for processing your feelings. If you notice negative thoughts creeping in, writing them down can help you challenge them effectively. 

User: I think I can do that. I just hope I don’t let the anxiety take over again.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to have those feelings. The goal is to be aware of them and to challenge any unhelpful thoughts. Remember, you’re not alone in this process. 

User: Thank you. That really makes me feel more supported. 

Consultant: I'm here for you, Wang. Let’s keep working together towards your goals. How are you feeling about the plan we've established today?

User: I feel more hopeful and less overwhelmed now. Thank you for helping me see things differently! 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You’ve taken a positive step today. Remember, change takes time, so be gentle with yourself. 

User: I will try to remember that. I have a long way to go, but I feel more equipped to handle things now.

Consultant: You are indeed equipped for this journey. Let's meet again to check on your progress and make any necessary adjustments. 

User: Sounds perfect! I look forward to it. 

Consultant: Excellent! I'm looking forward to seeing how you progress. Take care, and remember to focus on learning and self-compassion along the way. 

User: Thank you again! I really appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Wang. Until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad you're here for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last talk?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better about my health concerns, but I still worry sometimes. I’m just unsure about whether I should trust the recent health check results completely.

Consultant: It’s good to hear that there’s been some improvement. You mentioned feeling uncertain about trusting the health check results. Can you share more about what specifically makes you feel doubtful?

User: Well, even though the results were good, I still have this nagging feeling that something might have been missed. It’s like I keep replaying the possibility of getting sick in my head.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, feeling like the anxiety about your health still lingers despite getting positive news. What do you think triggers those thoughts or feelings about getting sick?

User: I think a lot of it comes from trying to maintain a good lifestyle and not really knowing if I’m doing enough or if it will be enough. I guess I just fear not being in control of my health.

Consultant: I can understand why wanting to feel in control would contribute to anxiety. Sometimes, when we focus so much on our health, it can lead to more uncertainty instead of reassurance. Let's explore what being in control means to you. What does being "in control" of your health look like for you?

User: I guess it would mean feeling confident in the choices I make, like eating right and exercising. But I need to believe those choices actually protect me from illness, which I often doubt.

Consultant: It sounds like having confidence in your health choices is very important to you. Let’s unpack that a bit. When you think about your eating and exercise habits, what positive outcomes have you noticed?

User: I've been trying to eat healthier and exercise when I can. Sometimes I feel more energetic, and I know that's a good sign, but then there are days when I just feel tired and wonder if I'm doing it right.

Consultant: Feeling tired can be disheartening, especially when you’re putting in effort to take care of yourself. It's normal for energy levels to fluctuate. How do you usually cope with those days when you feel less energetic? 

User: I usually end up resting more, but then I worry that I'm being lazy or not doing enough. It's like I can't win either way.

Consultant: That’s an understandable struggle, feeling caught between wanting to rest and fearing you're not doing enough. What if we tried to challenge that notion? What might you say to a friend who felt the same way about their energy levels?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to rest and that everyone has days like that. I guess I don’t really give myself that same understanding.

Consultant: That's a wise perspective! You offer compassion to others but hold yourself to a different standard. It could be helpful to remind yourself that rest is a vital part of maintaining health, not a sign of weakness. How does that idea resonate with you?

User: It makes sense. I just need to remind myself that I won’t always be at 100%, but that doesn't mean I'm failing.

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing that fluctuations are part of life can be freeing. Let’s talk about some strategies to help you reinforce this idea. What activities or practices could you incorporate that allow you to balance effort in health with self-compassion?

User: Maybe I could write down my achievements and remind myself that even small steps count? 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic approach! Keeping track of your achievements can help you reframe your perspective. Perhaps, along with that, you could also jot down moments when you felt good about your health choices or experienced positive energy. What do you think?

User: I love that! It would be nice to celebrate the good things instead of just focusing on the worries.

Consultant: Absolutely! Shifting focus to your successes can be incredibly empowering. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. Have you thought about how you’d feel once you start practicing this shift in focus?

User: I think I’d feel more positive and less stressed about health issues. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Wang! We can gradually cultivate that positivity. Striking a balance between awareness of your health and allowing room for compassion towards yourself is key. Moving forward, let’s set a time to review your reflections and achievements. How does that sound?

User: Sounds good! I’ll definitely give it a try and let you know how it goes next time. 

Consultant: I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences! Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s perfectly okay to have ups and downs along the way. How are you feeling about our session today?

User: I feel a lot better! I appreciate how we talked about thinking differently, and I’m excited to try this new approach.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Keep focusing on the small steps we discussed, and remember you’re not in this alone. You have support, and I’m here whenever you need to talk. I believe you can keep moving toward that balanced mindset you're aiming for.

User: Thank you! Your support means a lot to me.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m glad you found it helpful. Let’s reconnect in our next session and continue developing your strategies. Take care, Wang! 

User: Take care! See you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! Welcome to today’s session. It’s great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling better overall, thanks to my family’s support. My anxiety is not as intense, but I still think about it often. I'm hoping to maintain this stability and perhaps learn some strategies to keep it up.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear that you’re experiencing some relief! It’s important to acknowledge the support from your family. Let’s focus on maintaining that stability today. Can you describe what helps you feel more relaxed and balanced recently?

User: I think talking to my family really helps. They understand me well. Also, I’ve been trying to spend time with my friends and engage in activities that I enjoy, like exercising.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that connecting with your family and friends is making a difference for you. Engaging in activities you enjoy, like exercising, is also a positive step. How do you feel after you engage in those activities?

User: Exercising makes me feel energized and helps clear my mind. Sometimes, however, I feel guilty for taking time off from studying. It’s like a constant struggle between wanting to rest and needing to keep up with my studies.

Consultant: I understand that struggle. It's common to feel torn between self-care and academic responsibilities. Let’s explore this further—what specific thoughts go through your mind when you take a break from your studies?

User: I usually think that if I’m not studying, I might fall behind or disappoint my parents. I often worry about not living up to their expectations.

Consultant: Those feelings of pressure can be quite heavy. It sounds like there are some negative thoughts creating stress for you. What evidence do you have that taking breaks will negatively impact your studies or your parents’ expectations?

User: I don't have concrete evidence; it’s just a fear that I hold. I've done well enough before, but the anxiety makes me feel like I might lose my progress.

Consultant: It’s important to recognize that fear. Sometimes our minds exaggerate the consequences of taking a break. If a friend were in your situation, what would you tell them about balancing study and relaxation?

User: I would probably tell them that breaks are important for mental health and that they should not feel guilty for taking care of themselves.

Consultant: Exactly! You are already aware of the benefits of breaks. Now, let's see how we can challenge those negative thoughts you have. Could we create a simple plan to ensure that you're incorporating breaks without feeling guilty about it?

User: That sounds helpful! I think I could try to schedule short breaks between study sessions. Maybe setting a timer would help remind me when to take a break.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Perhaps we can aim for a balanced approach—like studying for a certain period, then allowing yourself a 10-15 minute break. How does that sound?

User: I like that! It feels more manageable and gives me something to look forward to while studying.

Consultant: Perfect! Also, let’s include some enjoyable activities during those breaks. What are some things you can do during those moments to boost your mood?

User: I enjoy stepping outside for fresh air or listening to music. Sometimes I even do short workouts to get my energy up.

Consultant: Those are excellent choices! Incorporating fresh air and music can really lift your spirits. Let’s establish that plan: study for 25 minutes, take a 10-15 minute break, and during that break, do something that makes you happy. Can we try that until our next session?

User: Yes, I'm excited to give it a try! I feel confident that it will help me manage my time better.

Consultant: I love your enthusiasm, Wang! It’s essential to build this habit for your overall well-being. Remember to be kind to yourself along the way. As we wrap up today's session, how are you feeling about the changes we’ve discussed?

User: I feel optimistic! Discussing this has helped clarify my thoughts. I want to maintain this positive mindset.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Maintaining a positive attitude will be crucial as you move forward. Remember, it’s okay to reach out if you need additional support. As you prepare for the coming weeks, what goals would you like to set for yourself?

User: I want to keep my emotions under control and find joy in both my studies and my downtime. I’d also love to work on my confidence when studying.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! Confidence comes with practice. As you balance your studies and personal time, I have no doubt that you will see progress. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Remember, you’ve already taken significant steps towards a healthier mindset.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I will work on this and see how it goes.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here for you. Until next time, take care and keep up the good work, Wang!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm really glad you're here today. You mentioned that you're feeling very confident after your excellent exam results. How has that positive feeling impacted your day-to-day life?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel like all my hard work has finally paid off. I’ve been more motivated, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead. However, I’m also a bit anxious about how to maintain this momentum and what my next steps should be.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling motivated! It’s normal to feel a bit anxious when thinking about the future. Let’s explore this anxiety together. What specific thoughts do you have about maintaining your momentum?

User: I worry that I might not be able to keep up this level of performance. Sometimes I feel like I could easily fall back into old habits if I don't stay focused.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, Wang. It sounds like you’re anxious about losing the progress you’ve made. Can you identify any specific thoughts that make you feel this way, especially when you think about your future goals?

User: I often think things like, “What if I don’t do as well next time?” or “Maybe I just got lucky this time.” These thoughts make me doubt my abilities.

Consultant: I understand. Those thoughts can be really discouraging. Let’s try to challenge them together. How much evidence do you think supports the idea that you just got lucky, rather than recognizing your hard work and skills?

User: I guess there’s not much evidence. I studied hard and prepared well. It just feels like luck sometimes, especially since I’m still adjusting to military school life.

Consultant: You’ve highlighted a key point—you prepared well and worked hard. It’s important to acknowledge your efforts and successes instead of attributing them to luck. What evidence do you have that reinforces your abilities in this environment?

User: I guess my grades have consistently improved, and I've even received positive feedback from my instructors. They see potential in me.

Consultant: Exactly! That feedback is a powerful affirmation of your skills. When you think about your future, how would it feel to replace the thought “I might not maintain this level” with “I have the tools and support to succeed”?

User: That actually sounds reassuring. It’s a more positive way to look at my situation. I think I can try to remember that.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let’s take it a step further. Can you think of a specific goal you want to set for yourself moving forward?

User: I want to improve my physical fitness and get more involved in extracurricular activities. I believe that would help balance my academics and personal growth.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic goal! Improving physical fitness and getting involved in activities can certainly boost your confidence and social connections. What steps can you take to start working toward that goal?

User: I could join a fitness club and maybe participate in some student organizations. Those might help me meet new people too.

Consultant: Those are excellent steps! Engaging in a fitness club and student organizations can be a great way to build connections and community. What support or resources do you think you might need to achieve these goals?

User: I might need a workout plan to keep me motivated and maybe some advice on which organizations to join. 

Consultant: Creating a workout plan can really help keep you accountable! As for organizations, perhaps talking to some of your classmates about their experiences could give you insights into what interests you. Would you like to brainstorm some ideas for creating that workout plan?

User: Yes, I’d like that! It would help to have it structured so I can stick to it.

Consultant: Great! How about we outline a basic plan together? We can start with how many days a week you want to work out and what activities you enjoy, like running or group classes.

User: I think I could commit to three days a week. I enjoy running and maybe some bodyweight exercises.

Consultant: Three days sounds manageable! A combination of running and bodyweight exercises could be very effective. Would you prefer to include some flexibility in your plan, such as different activities for variety?

User: Yes, that would keep things interesting and help me stay motivated over time.

Consultant: Excellent approach! Keeping your workouts varied can definitely help maintain motivation. Let's set it up: you could run one day, do bodyweight exercises another, and leave the third day open to try something new or a mix of both. How does that sound?

User: That sounds perfect! I feel excited about starting this plan now.

Consultant: I’m really pleased to hear that! Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. How will you celebrate your achievements, no matter how small, as you follow this plan?

User: I could treat myself to a nice meal or spend some time with friends after reaching certain milestones.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful ways to celebrate your efforts! Acknowledging your achievements can reinforce your motivation. Moving forward, how do you feel about your ability to maintain confidence and a positive mindset?

User: I feel much more confident now. I think setting these goals will help me stay focused and positive about my future.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear, Wang! It sounds like you've turned a corner. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ve taken away from our session and how you plan to move forward.

User: I’ve learned to challenge my negative thoughts and acknowledge my efforts. I’m excited to make a workout plan and join some clubs to expand my college experience.

Consultant: That’s a great summary! You’ve made wonderful progress, and I believe you have the tools to continue growing and thriving. Whenever you feel uncertain in the future, remember the strategies we discussed today. I wish you all the best, and remember, you’re always welcome to come back if you need further support.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help. I'm looking forward to implementing what we talked about!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Wang! It was a pleasure working with you today. Take care, and I’m excited to hear about your progress next time!
