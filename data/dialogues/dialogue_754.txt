Consultant: Hello Linxia! I'm glad you're here today. I understand that you've been facing some tough emotions lately. Could you share more about how you've been feeling recently?

User: Hello. Yeah, I've just been feeling really down. I used to love studying and focusing on my interests, but now everything seems pointless. When I found out my favorite idol started dating, I felt like my whole world just collapsed. 

Consultant: That sounds really painful, Linxia. It’s understandable to feel that way when someone you admire goes through a major change. Can you tell me more about what thoughts were running through your mind at that moment?

User: I kept thinking that I’m not good enough, that if my idol can find love, why can't I? It just makes me feel worthless and makes me question my own value.

Consultant: It's tough when we compare ourselves to others, especially those we look up to. You mentioned feeling worthless. What emotions does that thought bring up for you?

User: It makes me feel really sad and empty. I don't want to do anything anymore. I just feel sort of lost.

Consultant: Feeling lost can be really overwhelming. It seems like you're in a space where you might feel a lack of purpose. What do you think has changed in your life that would lead you to feel this way?

User: I guess I used to have things I was excited about, like my studies or hobbies, but now everything feels like a chore. I can't focus, and my grades are dropping. It just feels like I'm failing at everything.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling quite defeated right now. You mentioned that studying used to excite you—can you recall when that change started happening?

User: It’s been about a month, ever since I found out about my idol's relationship. I keep thinking maybe if I were different, things would be better. 

Consultant: It’s interesting to notice how a specific event shifted your feelings toward studying and your self-perception. You mentioned wanting to be different. What exactly do you wish were different about yourself?

User: I just wish I could feel happier and more confident. I want to enjoy studying again instead of feeling like I'm just going through the motions.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Linxia. You deserve to feel happy and engaged. Let's explore some of these negative thoughts you have about yourself. When you say you want to be different, what kind of thoughts accompany that?

User: I think things like, “I’m never going to succeed,” or “I’ll always be this way.” 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy. It’s important to question where they come from. Do you think there’s any evidence to support those beliefs, or could there be another perspective?

User: I don’t know. Sometimes I see my friends doing well, and I think they must be better than me.

Consultant: Comparing ourselves to others can often lead us to feel inadequate. If a friend was feeling this way about themselves, what might you say to them to comfort them?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone has their own pace and that they shouldn’t be so hard on themselves. 

Consultant: That’s a compassionate response. It seems like you know deep down that comparing isn’t fair to yourself. What if you applied that same kindness to yourself?

User: That would be nice, I guess. But it's hard to believe it.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to struggle with that. How about we try a small exercise together? Let’s challenge those negative thoughts. What’s one positive thing about yourself or something you’ve accomplished recently?

User: I did finish a book last week, and I used to really enjoy reading. 

Consultant: That’s excellent! Finishing a book shows dedication and interest. How can we build on that interest to help you regain your motivation for studying or other activities?

User: Maybe I can try to read more and find ways to tie what I read into my studies, like making it more enjoyable.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan. Integrating your interests can help you feel more connected to your studies. Are there any specific subjects that you think could be more enjoyable for you right now?

User: I love stories, so maybe I could start with literature or subjects that include storytelling.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea, Linxia. Stories can bring subjects to life. Would you be open to setting small, manageable goals for yourself each week regarding your reading and studies?

User: Yeah, I think that could help. It makes it seem less daunting.

Consultant: Great! Let's set a goal for this week. How about reading a chapter from a book and then summarizing what you read? This could help make studying feel less overwhelming while also bringing back some enjoyment.

User: That sounds doable! I feel a little excited thinking about it.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! It’s a step towards rekindling your enjoyment. As we start setting these positive habits, remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time.

User: I will try to remember that. Thank you.

Consultant: Of course, Linxia! It’s been great discussing your thoughts today. Remember, it’s important to be gentle with yourself. We’ll continue to explore these feelings together. 

User: I'm looking forward to our next session already. 

Consultant: Me too! You're making important steps forward. Let's keep working together on this. Take care until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Lin Xia! It’s great to see you today. I want to start by understanding how you’ve been feeling lately about your studies and your recent experiences. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really down since I failed that exam. It just makes me think that studying is pointless. I don’t even want to try anymore.

Consultant: I hear you. That exam failure has really affected your motivation and confidence in your abilities. It’s understandable to feel discouraged in situations like this. Can you share more about what thoughts were going through your mind when you received the results?

User: I just kept thinking that I’m not good enough and that I’ll never improve. I feel like I disappoint everyone, especially my parents who support me.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling pressure to meet expectations, and that can be really overwhelming. Those negative thoughts, like not being good enough, can be heavy to carry. What emotions come up for you when you think about those thoughts?

User: I feel really frustrated and sad. Sometimes I even wish I could just disappear because it hurts so much.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It’s important to talk about these feelings. Let’s take a moment to consider—when you think, “I'm not good enough,” how true do you believe that thought is? What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts it?

User: I guess I don't have much evidence. I just feel like everyone else is doing better, and I can't keep up. But in the past, I did well before...

Consultant: It’s good to hear you’ve had successes in the past. That shows you have the ability to do well! What if we tried to challenge that “I’m not good enough” thought? What might a more balanced thought be that considers both your past successes and the current challenges?

User: Maybe I could think that I’ve done well before and that I can improve again. But it’s hard to believe it right now.

Consultant: It can definitely be challenging to believe positive thoughts when you're feeling low. One step we can take is to remember those past successes and think about what strategies helped you when you were doing well. Can we reflect on a successful study method or project that worked for you in the past?

User: I used to break my studying into smaller parts and take breaks. It really helped me stay focused.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Breaking things down into manageable parts is very effective. How about we set a small, achievable goal together using that method? For instance, could you set a goal for this week to study for a short time each day, using those breaks to keep it balanced?

User: I think I could try studying for 30 minutes a day, then take a 10-minute break. That sounds doable. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Building on small successes can really help boost your confidence over time. As you implement this, how do you think it will influence your feelings about studying?

User: I feel like if I can do it, maybe it won't feel so meaningless. I’ll give it a try.

Consultant: Exactly! Sometimes, taking small steps can help us reconnect with the meaning behind our efforts. As we move forward, let’s also talk about how you’re feeling socially, especially with peers at school. How do you think your recent experiences have impacted your interactions with others?

User: I feel awkward talking to my friends. I worry they won’t understand how I feel. I just avoid them sometimes.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when we’re going through tough times. Remember, social connections can be very helpful during challenging moments. What would it look like for you to reach out to a friend and share how you’re feeling, even a little bit?

User: I guess I could try to talk to one close friend about it. But what if they don’t understand? 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Sometimes, people can surprise us with their understanding. Even if they don’t fully get it, just sharing your feelings can lessen the burden. Would you like to set a goal to talk to that friend this week?

User: I think I can do that. I might just tell them I'm having a hard time and need someone to talk to.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful step! Remember, it’s okay to express that you’re facing challenges. Building these connections can provide support and encouragement as you navigate this time. 

User: Thanks, it feels good to have a plan. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize what you will focus on this week: studying for 30 minutes a day with breaks, and reaching out to a friend to share your feelings. How do you feel about these goals moving forward?

User: I feel hopeful and a little more in control. 

Consultant: That’s a great feeling to have! Keep reminding yourself of your past successes and don’t hesitate to lean on those strategies. We’ll continue to build on these in our next session. Remember, I’m here for you! 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Lin Xia! It’s been a pleasure talking with you today. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next meeting.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Lin Xia! I’m glad you’re here for this session. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi. Honestly, I feel pretty low. I participated in a school event recently, but I didn't perform as well as I wanted. I'm doubting my social skills and it’s really frustrating.

Consultant: I can understand how disappointing that must feel, especially when you're putting yourself out there. Can you share more about what specifically made you feel like you didn’t do well at the event?

User: I just felt awkward talking to people and nobody seemed interested in what I had to say. I thought I’d be able to connect with others, but it just didn’t happen. 

Consultant: It sounds like you had high expectations for how those interactions would go, but they didn’t turn out the way you hoped. What were some thoughts that went through your mind during that event?

User: I kept thinking that I must be boring or that no one would want to talk to me. It felt like everyone was judging me.

Consultant: That sounds quite distressing. You mentioned feeling like you were being judged. Can you identify how those thoughts affected your emotions during the event?

User: It made me really anxious. I just wanted the event to be over. I thought about how embarrassing it was to not connect with anyone.

Consultant: Anxiety can certainly impact how we interact with others. Sometimes, our minds tell us things that aren't accurate. If a friend were in your situation, what advice do you think you would give them?

User: I would probably tell them not to be so hard on themselves and that it’s okay to feel nervous. They might just need more practice.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! It seems like you are aware that practice can help improve social skills. Let’s explore your thoughts. Do you think there’s any evidence that supports your belief that you’re boring or that others were judging you?

User: I guess there isn’t really any solid proof. It’s just how I felt at the moment, but I can’t shake that feeling.

Consultant: It’s perfectly okay to feel that way, but it’s also helpful to challenge those thoughts. What if we rephrased your belief, perhaps thinking something like, "I may have felt anxious, but that doesn’t mean I'm boring. It's normal for social situations to be difficult."

User: That makes sense. I suppose it’s just my anxiety talking. 

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing that distinction is a big step. Now, let's think about how you can approach social situations differently next time. What’s a small, actionable step you could take?

User: Maybe I could try starting conversations in smaller groups first. It feels less intimidating.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Starting small can help build confidence. As you practice, it's important to celebrate those achievements, no matter how minor they may seem. What other activities do you think could help you feel more at ease socially?

User: I’ve thought about joining a club or group related to my interests. Maybe I’ll find people I click with.

Consultant: Joining a club sounds like a great approach! Engaging with people who share similar interests can make interactions easier. What interests you most about joining a club?

User: I think if I can talk about things I love, I’ll feel more comfortable. Plus, it might be easier to meet new friends that way.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Engaging in topics you’re passionate about can definitely help relieve some of that pressure. How do you feel about discussing this with your parents?

User: I think they wouldn’t understand why I want to join a club instead of focusing on my studies. They already think I spend too much time on other things.

Consultant: It sounds like you feel a bit cornered between your interests and their expectations. That’s tough. What would you like to communicate to them about your desire to join a club?

User: I want them to see that being involved in something I enjoy could help me feel better and maybe even improve my mood. 

Consultant: That’s a very valid point! Framing it in a way that shows the benefits could help them understand. Would you feel comfortable bringing it up with them in that context?

User: I’m nervous, but I’ll try. I just wish they could see things from my perspective more.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel nervous. It’s great that you want to bridge that gap. Maybe you can prepare some points about how engaging with your interests might help you emotionally. How else do you think you can improve communication with your parents?

User: I could start by being more open about my feelings. I don’t usually share much with them.

Consultant: That’s a positive step! Sharing your feelings can promote understanding. If they see how certain activities affect your mood, it might open up a better dialogue. Let’s talk about how you want to frame these conversations—how can you express your feelings clearly?

User: I think I can tell them that my hobbies help me cope when I'm feeling down and that they don't need to worry about my studies if I’m involved in something constructive.

Consultant: That sounds like a sensible approach! By highlighting your need for balance, they may become more understanding. As we wrap up today, what’s your biggest takeaway?

User: I guess I learned that my feelings don't define who I am, and I need to talk more openly with my parents about my interests.

Consultant: That’s a huge insight, Lin Xia! Remember, practicing these new communication skills can take time, but you are taking meaningful steps. Keep reflecting on your thoughts and feelings, and I look forward to seeing how things evolve in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful now.
###################
Consultant: Hi Lin Xia! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I guess I've been better... but mainly, I'm just really frustrated. My parents are still trying to limit my gaming time, and it's like they don’t understand why I enjoy it so much. I feel angry and helpless.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling really misunderstood by your parents and that their attempts to limit your gaming are causing you significant frustration. Can you tell me more about what gaming means to you and why it's so important?

User: Gaming helps me escape from everything. I enjoy the stories and characters, especially the ones I really like. It's like my own little world where I can be someone else for a bit. I just wish they could see it from my perspective.

Consultant: I can see why that would be important for you—it provides a sense of escape and enjoyment. It’s understandable that you want them to recognize that. Have you had a chance to talk to them about what gaming means to you?

User: Not really. I try to explain it, but it always turns into an argument. They think I just waste time instead of studying. I just get so angry and then shut down.

Consultant: It seems like those conversations become quite heated, and you feel like your feelings aren't being acknowledged, which only adds to your anger. What do you think prevents you from expressing your point of view without it escalating to an argument?

User: I guess I'm not sure how to say it without sounding defensive. I feel like they should just understand me. 

Consultant: That's a valid feeling. It can be tough to express ourselves when we feel defensive. What if we worked on some ways to communicate your feelings effectively, so your parents might be more receptive to hearing you out?

User: That would be really helpful. I want them to understand that I’m not just wasting time; it's more than that to me.

Consultant: Great! One effective approach is to use "I" statements to express how you feel without placing blame. For instance, instead of saying, "You don’t understand me," you might say something like, "I feel isolated when we talk about gaming because I think it's a big part of who I am." How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds less confrontational. I think I could try that.

Consultant: Exactly, it helps to express your feelings while keeping the door open for dialogue. Would you like to practice coming up with some "I" statements right now?

User: Sure! Maybe I could say, "I feel frustrated when my gaming time is limited because it’s something I really enjoy."

Consultant: That’s a great start! It clearly expresses your feelings. Now, how might you express your desire for understanding without coming off as defensive?

User: Um... I could say something like, "I would really appreciate it if you could understand why I enjoy gaming."

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s another effective statement. It invites a discussion rather than creating a barrier. How do you feel about these strategies so far?

User: I feel hopeful. It feels like there’s a way to talk about it without it turning into a fight.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You’re taking important steps towards expressing yourself. What do you think your parents might respond if you use these statements in a conversation?

User: Maybe they’d listen more. I hope it helps them see my perspective better.

Consultant: It’s entirely possible. Open and sincere communication can go a long way. Do you think you could set a time to talk with them this week about your feelings?

User: I can try to find a good moment. I want to do it when we're all calm and not stressed.

Consultant: That sounds like a wise approach! Finding a peaceful moment can foster a better conversation. What’s one method you could use to prepare before that talk?

User: I think I could write down what I want to say so I don’t get lost in emotions.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Writing your thoughts down can help you stay focused and clear. How are you feeling about the entire process now?

User: I feel less anxious about discussing it. I think I can do this.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! You’ve made tremendous progress in understanding how to approach your parents. As we prepare to wrap up today’s session, what’s one key takeaway you’d like to remember?

User: I want to remember to use "I" statements and to express my feelings clearly.

Consultant: Excellent takeaway! You’ve shown a lot of willingness to improve your communication with your parents. It’s a big step forward. Please remember you have the skills to navigate this. If you need further support, I’m here for you.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I feel more confident about talking to them.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Lin Xia! I’m glad to hear that our session has helped. I believe in your ability to enhance those family connections. Let’s check in next time about how the discussion with your parents went. 

User: Sounds good! I’m looking forward to it!
###################
Consultant: Hi Lin Xia! It’s great to see you again. How have you been feeling lately, especially after attending your classmate's birthday party?

User: Hi! I actually felt really good after that party. For the first time, I felt like I was being accepted by my peers. But I'm still struggling with my confidence overall.

Consultant: It sounds like that birthday party was a positive experience for you, which is wonderful to hear! Can you share more about what made you feel accepted during the event?

User: Well, we all played games, and I was actually able to make some jokes that got people laughing. It felt nice to be part of the group.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic accomplishment, Lin Xia! Making jokes and getting laughs shows that you were comfortable interacting. How did that make you feel about your social skills?

User: It made me feel a bit more capable, but then I also worry that I won’t always be able to replicate that success. 

Consultant: I understand that feeling. It’s common to worry about maintaining that level of confidence. Let’s try to reflect on this positive experience. What specific actions do you think helped you succeed in that situation?

User: I think just being myself and not overthinking too much helped. But sometimes I still feel unsure about how to continue conversations.

Consultant: Being yourself is a great starting point! It's about finding a balance. When you feel unsure, what thoughts go through your mind that might be holding you back?

User: I tend to think that I might say something stupid or that they won’t want to talk to me. 

Consultant: Those thoughts can definitely be discouraging. Let’s challenge them a bit. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you might say something “stupid,” or that people don’t want to talk to you?

User: Well, there have been moments where I felt ignored, but then there were also times like during the party when people laughed and included me. 

Consultant: It sounds like there are mixed experiences. It might help to focus on the positive ones, like at the party where you felt included. How could you remind yourself of that next time you feel anxious about talking to your friends?

User: I guess I could try to think about the good moments rather than dwell on the times I felt ignored. 

Consultant: That’s a solid strategy! Writing down those positive experiences might also help you see them more clearly. Would you be willing to try keeping a small journal of these moments?

User: That could work! I think I'll try writing down good experiences at the end of each day.

Consultant: Excellent plan! Reflecting on these positive experiences will definitely reinforce your confidence. Now, aside from the journal, are there any specific social situations you feel nervous about in the future?

User: I’m worried about group projects in school. I feel like I won't contribute enough or that my ideas won't be valued.

Consultant: Group projects can definitely feel daunting, especially when you worry about contributions. What strengths do you think you bring to group situations?

User: I’m good at brainstorming ideas, and I think I can encourage others, but I get nervous about voicing my thoughts.

Consultant: Those are valuable skills! Encouragement and idea generation are crucial in group work. Maybe you could practice voicing your thoughts by starting smaller—perhaps sharing one suggestion or thought in a casual setting first?

User: That seems manageable! I could try sharing one idea next time we have a group discussion.

Consultant: That sounds like a great step forward. It's important to take small steps. If you try that and it feels good, how might you build on that in future discussions?

User: Maybe I could ask questions to others more and get involved in the conversation that way.

Consultant: Asking questions is a perfect way to engage without the pressure of having to present big ideas right away. It keeps the flow of conversation going! How does that make you feel about your ability to participate in groups?

User: I feel more hopeful knowing I have different ways to engage without feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: That hopefulness is fantastic, Lin Xia! Remember, it's all about practice and gradually getting comfortable. As we continue, we can also work on how to handle any negative feelings or doubts that arise when engaging with others.

User: That sounds good to me! I definitely want to feel better about my social interactions.

Consultant: I'm pleased to hear that! So, let’s make that a priority. What can you take from today’s conversation to help you maintain your momentum in social situations?

User: I’ll focus on the positive experiences, try to share more during group discussions, and keep practicing asking questions.

Consultant: Those are effective steps! As we wrap up today, would you say you feel a bit more confident about your social abilities now compared to when we started?

User: Yes, definitely! I feel like I have real strategies to work on, and I'm excited to try them out.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It’s important to celebrate these improvements. Before we conclude, let’s talk about any goals you want to set for yourself in terms of socializing over the next week or so.

User: Maybe I could aim to start or contribute to at least one conversation every day, whether at school or home.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent goal! Small, consistent actions can lead to big changes. I’m proud of the progress you’re making, Lin Xia. If you need support or have questions, feel free to reach out anytime. 

User: Thank you! I'm really grateful for your help!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time we meet. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Lin Xia! It's great to see you again. I’m really proud of the progress you’ve made. How are you feeling today?

User: Hi! I feel a bit better compared to before. I've noticed that I'm not as gloomy, and I can focus on things a little more. I still worry sometimes, though.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear that you're feeling better and able to focus more! It sounds like you've been applying some of the strategies we talked about. Can you share a specific situation where you noticed a positive change?

User: Well, the other day I was really anxious about schoolwork, but instead of avoiding my studies, I actually sat down and worked on my assignments. It felt good to accomplish something.

Consultant: That's an impressive step forward! You're actively facing your challenges instead of avoiding them. How did you manage to push through that anxiety?

User: I remembered what you said about breaking tasks into smaller pieces. I focused on just one subject at a time, and it made it less overwhelming.

Consultant: Breaking tasks into smaller parts is a fantastic strategy! It really helps reduce that overwhelming feeling. How did it feel to achieve those smaller goals?

User: It felt rewarding. I realized I can do it, and I felt proud of myself.

Consultant: That sense of achievement is so important! It reinforces your capability and builds confidence. Have you thought about any goals you'd like to set for yourself moving forward?

User: I want to continue improving my grades and maybe join a club at school. I think being around others could help too.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! Joining a club can be a great way to meet new people and build social skills. What types of clubs are you interested in?

User: I’m thinking about a reading club or maybe something related to art. I enjoy both!

Consultant: Both sound like wonderful options! They can provide you with creative outlets and also create opportunities to connect with others. What would be your first step toward joining one of those clubs?

User: I guess I could check the club list posted on the bulletin board and see when they have their meetings.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic first step! Checking the bulletin board will give you all the information you need. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. It's a little scary to think about meeting new people, though.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about meeting new people. Remember, those feelings won't last forever, and taking that first step is often the hardest part. Do you have any strategies in mind to help with those nerves?

User: Maybe I could remind myself it's okay to be nervous and that everyone else probably feels the same way. 

Consultant: That's an insightful strategy! Acknowledging that it's okay to feel nervous can help lessen its hold over you. Is there anything else that has been on your mind lately?

User: I’ve been worried about my emotions again. I hope I can handle any setbacks if they come.

Consultant: It's great that you’re thinking about potential setbacks. It's part of life, and being prepared is key. Would you like to explore some techniques for managing those emotions when they arise?

User: Yes, that would help. I don’t want to feel overwhelmed again.

Consultant: A helpful strategy could be practicing mindfulness or grounding exercises. These techniques can bring you back to the present moment and help manage overwhelming feelings. Would you like to try one of those exercises?

User: Sure, I’d love to try!

Consultant: Great! Let’s do a quick grounding exercise. I want you to take a deep breath in and notice your surroundings. Can you tell me three things you can see, two things you can hear, and one thing you can feel?

User: Okay, I see my desk, my phone, and a plant. I can hear some birds outside and the ticking of a clock. I feel the chair underneath me.

Consultant: Excellent job! Focusing on your senses can help you anchor yourself in the moment. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt calming! I think I could use that in stressful moments.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s a valuable technique for when you feel overwhelmed. How will you remind yourself to use this strategy in the future?

User: Maybe I could write it down or set a reminder on my phone.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Having a visual reminder can reinforce the strategy when you need it. As we wrap up today, can you summarize what you feel are your key takeaways from our session?

User: I learned that I can break tasks down, I can handle my nerves about joining a club, and I have strategies to manage my feelings better.

Consultant: Those are powerful takeaways, Lin Xia! You're really taking charge of your progress. Remember, it’s a journey, and I’m here for support. How do you feel about everything we discussed?

User: I feel really positive! I’m excited to take these steps.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Keep building on that positivity, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support in the future. You've accomplished a lot, and I'm proud of you. Until next time, take care!

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Have a great day!
