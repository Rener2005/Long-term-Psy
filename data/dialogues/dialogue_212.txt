Consultant: Hello, Xiaofeng! I'm glad you’re here for this session. Before we dive in, I’d like to hear about your current feelings and thoughts. How have you been since our last meeting?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling overwhelmed with everything lately. The pressure of deciding between preparing for my exams or searching for a job is really getting to me. I feel stuck and anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling quite pressured and uncertain about your future choices. Can you share more about what thoughts are running through your mind regarding this decision?

User: Well, I keep thinking that if I choose to prepare for the exams, I’ll be putting off my career. But if I start looking for jobs, I might miss the chance to do well in exams. I just feel like I can't make a decision without messing things up.

Consultant: That’s understandable, Xiaofeng. It seems you're caught between two significant choices, which can be exhausting. How do these thoughts make you feel emotionally when you think about them?

User: They make me feel anxious and frustrated. I often lie awake at night, just spiraling in my thoughts about what to do. It's like I can't focus on anything else.

Consultant: It’s tough when your mind won’t allow you to rest. Let’s explore these feelings a bit more deeply. What specific thoughts come to you during those anxious nights, and what emotions do they trigger?

User: I often think that I'm not good enough for either path. I worry that I might fail if I try to study for the exams or that I’ll be left behind if I don’t start working soon. It’s like I’m doubting my abilities.

Consultant: It’s clear that self-doubt is weighing heavily on you. This questioning of your abilities is a common response to pressure. Can we examine these thoughts together? What evidence do you have that supports these feelings of inadequacy?

User: I guess I don’t have strong evidence, but I see my peers doing well, and it makes me feel even worse. Their success just highlights what I feel I’m lacking.

Consultant: It’s easy to fall into the comparison trap, especially in such competitive environments. Would it be helpful for us to identify some of the strengths or positive achievements you have experienced, even during this tough time?

User: Well, I did manage to complete my projects on time last semester. And I’ve been keeping up with my coursework, somewhat. But when I see others getting jobs, I still feel like I’m falling behind.

Consultant: Those are significant accomplishments, Xiaofeng! It’s great that you’ve managed to complete your projects on time. Let’s hold onto that achievement as a reminder of your capabilities. How do you think these positive experiences could inform your decision-making moving forward?

User: I guess recognizing my capabilities might give me a little boost. But I still feel confused about which path to take.

Consultant: Confusion often arises when faced with big decisions. Let’s try to break this down. Can you list out the pros and cons of both preparing for exams and starting a job search? 

User: For exams, a pro would be that I could potentially go into a good graduate program. But a con is that I might miss job opportunities. For a job, a pro is that I’d start gaining experience, but what if I end up regretting not studying for exams?

Consultant: That’s a valuable exercise, Xiaofeng. You’re clearly weighing your options thoughtfully. Can we take it a step further? What feelings arise as you consider these pros and cons? 

User: I feel anxious about the future, but also a bit hopeful that maybe there is a way to manage both.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. Feeling hopeful is a positive step forward! What do you think you could do to explore both paths simultaneously without feeling overwhelmed?

User: Maybe I could start by scheduling my days to include time for study and for job applications. That way, I won’t neglect either one completely.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Structuring your time effectively could help ease that overwhelming feeling and give you a sense of control. How confident do you feel about implementing this plan over the next week?

User: I think I can give it a try. It feels better to have a plan and not just be stuck in indecision.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Having a plan can make a big difference. As you move forward, I encourage you to check in with how you’re feeling throughout the week. What might you need to support yourself in sticking to this plan?

User: I guess I could set reminders in my phone and maybe keep a journal of my thoughts and feelings as I go through this process. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! A journal can be a powerful tool to help you process your emotions and track your progress. As we wrap up today, do you feel more equipped to tackle these feelings of anxiety and uncertainty?

User: Yes, I do feel a bit more equipped. I at least have a clearer approach, and I’m grateful for that.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiaofeng! Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s perfectly okay to take things one step at a time. I believe in your ability to navigate through this. Let’s plan to meet again and discuss how things went. 

User: Thank you so much! I look forward to our next session. 

Consultant: You're welcome, Xiaofeng! Take care, and I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Feng! Welcome to our session today. I’m really glad to see you. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. I don’t know... I still feel pretty down. Lately, I've been questioning my ability a lot, especially after those recent interviews. I can’t shake off this doubt about myself and it's making me anxious, especially with so much studying ahead.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re really struggling with self-doubt and anxiety, especially after those interviews. That’s completely valid. Can you tell me what specific thoughts are going through your mind when you think about your abilities?

User: I keep thinking that maybe I'm just not good enough, or that I won't find a job after graduation. It feels like I'm always lagging behind my peers, and that just makes me feel worse.

Consultant: It sounds really tough to carry those thoughts with you. It's like a heavy weight that’s affecting your confidence. When you think you’re not good enough, how does that make you feel emotionally and physically?

User: I feel really anxious, like there’s this knot in my stomach. It’s hard to focus on my studies, and sometimes, I even avoid studying altogether because I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: I can understand why you'd want to avoid studying under those feelings. It can be really exhausting to face those pressures. Let’s explore those thoughts you have about not being good enough more deeply. What evidence do you have to support that belief?

User: I guess I don’t have any strong evidence. I mean, I've done well in school before, but I just compare myself to others who seem to be doing better, and then I feel like I’m falling short.

Consultant: It sounds like comparison is a big part of your self-doubt. If a friend was in your position, feeling like they aren’t doing well despite their past achievements, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably tell them to focus on their own journey and not compare themselves to others. Everyone has their own timelines, right?

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s important to remember that everyone has their own path. You have accomplished things in the past, haven’t you? What strengths have you used before to tackle challenges?

User: I’ve always been diligent and organized in my studies. I've managed to get good grades, and I was able to complete some difficult projects.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strengths, Xiao Feng! It seems you have a solid foundation to build from. Let’s think about how you can apply those strengths to your current situation. How might you use your diligence and organization to help manage your study time better?

User: I guess I could set a more structured study schedule. That might help me feel less overwhelmed since I won’t have to cram everything last minute.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! A structured schedule can provide a roadmap, making tasks feel more manageable. How about we brainstorm a study plan together that includes breaks and time for self-care?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful. I often skip breaks because I feel guilty for not studying.

Consultant: Taking breaks is important! It’s a part of being productive. How about incorporating short breaks after every hour of studying? You can treat those breaks as a time to recharge without feeling guilty.

User: That sounds reasonable. Maybe if I look at it that way, I won’t feel so bad about taking time for myself.

Consultant: Exactly! And remember, those breaks can help improve your focus when you return to studying. Now, how are you feeling about approaching your upcoming study sessions with that plan?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Just thinking about having a plan makes things seem less daunting.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Planning can help create a sense of control. Another thing to consider is practicing self-compassion. When you make mistakes or feel you're not performing well, how can you respond to yourself more kindly?

User: I guess I could try to remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and that it's natural to have ups and downs.

Consultant: Yes! It's really important to treat yourself with kindness. It can change how you perceive challenges and setbacks. Would you like to practice some self-affirmations together?

User: That could be good. I often forget to acknowledge my own accomplishments.

Consultant: Let’s try this: Repeat after me. “I have the ability to learn and grow. I am doing my best, and that’s enough.” How does that feel?

User: It feels a little silly, but I can see how it might help to remind myself of that.

Consultant: It’s completely okay to feel that way; it can be quite new! Repetition can really drive home those positive messages. How often do you think you could practice that affirmation?

User: Maybe every morning as I start my day. That might help me set a positive tone.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Setting positive intentions can be powerful. As we wrap up today, what do you feel should be our next steps in our sessions moving forward?

User: I think continuing to focus on building my self-confidence and managing my anxiety around studying will be key. Also, practicing how to handle interviews effectively seems important too.

Consultant: Absolutely, we can certainly work on those aspects. You’re making progress, Xiao Feng, and it’s wonderful to see you exploring these new ideas. Remember, it’s about taking one step at a time. I look forward to our next session together! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today. See you next time!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and I’ll see you soon!

Consultant: Hi Xiao Feng! Welcome back to our session. I’m really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! Honestly, I still feel quite overwhelmed. The anxiety about my upcoming exams is just getting worse, and I still can't focus when studying. 

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like the pressure of exams is really causing you stress, and that can make it hard to concentrate on your studies. Can you tell me more about what you’ve been experiencing when you try to study?

User: Well, I’ve tried a few different study methods, but none seem to work. I just end up feeling frustrated and then I procrastinate even more. It makes me doubt my ability to succeed. 

Consultant: It sounds really frustrating to put in the effort but not see the results you’re hoping for. Procrastination can feel like a cycle that’s hard to break. What specific thoughts go through your mind when you find yourself procrastinating?

User: I often think, “What if I fail?” or “I’m never going to get this done on time.” It just makes me panic and want to avoid studying altogether.

Consultant: Those thoughts can really amplify your anxiety. It’s understandable that they would make you want to avoid studying. Let's try to break that down a bit. Can you recall a moment when you thought that way? How did it make you feel at that time?

User: I remember sitting at my desk last week, thinking about all the material I needed to cover. I felt so anxious that my heart raced, and I just shut my books and went to lie down instead.

Consultant: That sounds like a very tough moment. Your body was responding to that anxiety, which led you to avoid the situation. Let’s think about how realistic those thoughts are. What's the evidence that supports or challenges the belief that you will fail?

User: I guess I really haven't failed yet. I’ve done well in my classes before, but the pressure of exams makes me forget that.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! You’ve had success in the past, and that experience can be a strength. How can we use that strength to help you shift your mindset about studying for these exams?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that I’ve managed tough coursework before. I could try to take it step by step instead of focusing on the final exams.

Consultant: Absolutely! Breaking down your studying into smaller, manageable tasks can really help alleviate that overwhelming feeling. What specific steps can we identify for your study routine this week?

User: I could set aside specific time blocks each day for studying certain subjects. Then I could also include short breaks to clear my mind.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Establishing a routine can help create a sense of control. How do you feel about incorporating those breaks? What activities might you enjoy to refresh your mind during those times?

User: I like the idea of taking short walks or listening to music during breaks. It helps me relax a little.

Consultant: Those are great ways to recharge! Incorporating enjoyable activities can boost your motivation and refresh your focus. If we put this all together, what would your revised study plan look like for this week?

User: I think I’ll allocate two hours each afternoon to study, with a 10-minute break every 30 minutes to walk and listen to music. 

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect and manageable plan! How do you anticipate this structure will impact your mood and focus while studying?

User: I hope it helps me feel less anxious. Having breaks built in will hopefully make it easier for me to sit down and study because I won’t feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: I believe that can be quite helpful! Remember, it’s about progress rather than perfection. As you try this plan, what thoughts might arise if you start feeling anxious again?

User: I guess I should remind myself that I’ve succeeded before and that it’s okay to take things slowly. Maybe I can also share how I’m feeling with a friend.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Sharing your feelings can really lighten the emotional load. As we move forward, what other skills or strategies might you want to explore to manage these anxious feelings?

User: I’d like to learn some relaxation techniques or mindfulness exercises to help when I feel overwhelmed. 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! We can definitely incorporate some mindfulness practices into our sessions. It can help ground you in moments of anxiety. Are there specific techniques you’ve heard of that interest you?

User: I’ve heard of deep breathing and meditation, but I’ve never really tried them.

Consultant: Those are excellent options. We can start with some deep breathing exercises. They’re simple yet effective for calming anxiety. Want to give it a try together now?

User: Sure! I’m open to trying it.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment. Find a comfortable seated position and let’s start with a deep breath in through your nose, holding it for a moment, and then slowly exhaling through your mouth… 

User: Alright, I feel a bit calmer already. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Deep breathing can be a quick way to release stress. How do you feel about using this technique before studying or whenever the anxiety hits?

User: I think that would really help me. It gives me something to focus on other than my worries.

Consultant: Exactly! Incorporating this practice can empower you to manage your anxiety, and everyone can find their own rhythm. As our session comes to a close, what key takeaways do you want to carry forward?

User: I want to remember to trust my past successes, take breaks and try that deep breathing exercise when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Those are fantastic insights! I’m proud of you for the progress made today. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey, and I believe in your ability to navigate these challenges. If you need support later, I’m here for you.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today. I’m feeling more hopeful about managing my study anxiety now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Feng. I’m glad to hear that. Take care, and I look forward to our next session together!

User: See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaofeng! I'm glad to see you here today. Before we dive in, I’d love to hear about how you've been feeling lately and what brought you to seek this time with me.

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite low and anxious over the past couple of months. My concentration during studies has been terrible, and I struggle to stick with anything. I often feel restless and have trouble sleeping. I really want to improve my mental state, and after attending a psychology seminar at school, I became interested in meditation and relaxation techniques.

Consultant: It sounds like you're going through a tough time with your studies and overall mood. You mentioned an interest in meditation and relaxation techniques—what are you hoping to achieve by incorporating these practices into your routine?

User: Well, I hope to calm my mind and find some relief from my anxiety. I think if I can learn to relax, it might help with my focus when studying.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal. By learning to relax, you might find that it helps not just with your focus, but also in managing anxiety. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before attending that seminar?

User: No, I haven't really tried anything before. I just felt overwhelmed and didn’t know where to start. 

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. It’s great that you’re open to exploring new methods now. Let’s start by discussing some relaxation techniques. One common method is deep breathing. Would you be interested in trying a short breathing exercise with me right now?

User: Yes, I’d like to try that!

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment. Sit comfortably, and when you’re ready, close your eyes. Breathe in slowly through your nose to a count of four, hold for a count of four, and then exhale through your mouth to a count of four. Let’s do this a few times together.

User: Okay, I’m doing it now. 

Consultant: How did that feel for you, Xiaofeng? Did you notice any changes in your body or your mind during that exercise?

User: I felt a bit lighter and somewhat relaxed. It was nice to focus only on my breathing.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Deep breathing can really help reduce feelings of anxiety. Would you feel comfortable integrating this practice into your daily routine?

User: I’d be willing to try it daily. I think having some time to focus on my breathing could help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Consistency is key with these techniques. Apart from breathing, another effective approach is mindfulness meditation. This involves staying present and aware without judgment. Are you familiar with that concept?

User: I’ve heard a bit about mindfulness but don’t really know how it works. 

Consultant: Mindfulness is about observing your thoughts and feelings without trying to change them. It helps in recognizing your emotions without being overwhelmed. Would you like me to guide you through a short mindfulness exercise, too?

User: That sounds good! I’d like to learn more.

Consultant: Great! Let’s try a simple mindfulness exercise. Find a comfortable position, and when you’re ready, close your eyes again. Take a few deep breaths, and then start to notice how your body feels. Focus on your sensations, whether it’s tension or relaxation, without judging them. Just observe.

User: Okay, I’m observing now. It’s a bit harder than I thought. My mind keeps wandering.

Consultant: That’s completely normal! Our minds often wander, and that’s okay. When you notice your thoughts drifting, gently bring your focus back to your sensations. This practice gets easier with time. How did this exercise feel for you?

User: It was a bit difficult, but I think I see the value in it. 

Consultant: Absolutely! It takes practice, and that’s part of the process. It's great that you're willing to attempt it even if it feels challenging. How do you think you could incorporate this into your daily life?

User: Maybe I can set aside a few minutes each morning to practice. I usually start my day feeling anxious, so it might help me start fresh.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Setting aside time in the morning could really help set a positive tone for your day. In addition to these techniques, how are you feeling about your studies? Does anxiety still impact your ability to focus?

User: Yes, it really does. I often find myself getting frustrated and unable to concentrate. 

Consultant: I hear you, and that frustration must be really tough to handle. We can integrate the relaxation techniques we've discussed to help manage that anxiety while studying. Perhaps we could create a simple study plan that includes short breaks for practicing these methods. How does that sound to you?

User: I think that could work! It would give me something to focus on other than just studying. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Having a structured approach can definitely alleviate some of that pressure. Would you like to discuss what your study plan might look like?

User: Sure! I usually study for about two hours at a time and then take a break. I could try using one of those techniques during the break.

Consultant: That sounds effective! During your breaks, you could choose to practice deep breathing or mindfulness to refresh your mind. How do you feel about that approach? 

User: I feel optimistic about this! It gives me something practical to try.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! By implementing these practices, you’re taking proactive steps to improve your mental well-being and study habits. As we wrap up today, what do you feel is the biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think learning about mindfulness and deep breathing has helped me see that I have tools to manage my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight, Xiaofeng! It’s fantastic to hear you feel empowered by the tools we discussed today. Moving forward, remember you can use these techniques whenever you feel overwhelmed. How do you feel about scheduling another session to check on your progress?

User: I would definitely like to come back. I want to keep working on these skills!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! I look forward to our next session together. Remember, you’re taking essential steps to improve your mental state, and I’m here to support you along the way. Take care, and I’ll see you next time!

User: Thank you! See you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaofeng! I'm glad you're here for this session. How are you feeling today regarding your recent progress?

User: Hi! I'm feeling pretty good actually. I've noticed a shift in my mood over the last few weeks. I've been exploring my interests more, especially related to my major. There’s a sense of purpose I’ve been missing for some time.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're starting to connect more with what you love. Can you tell me more about what specifically you've found interesting or how you plan to explore this new sense of purpose?

User: Well, I found some areas in my major that really resonate with my personal values. I feel more engaged in my studies, but occasionally, I still struggle with anxiety and self-doubt, especially in group projects.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious in group settings, even while you are feeling more positive overall. Let’s explore that. What thoughts or feelings arise when you think about participating in group projects?

User: Often, I worry that I won't contribute enough, or that my ideas won’t be good enough for the group. That makes me hesitant to engage fully, even when I want to.

Consultant: I see. Those thoughts sound quite common, and they can certainly create a barrier to participating. How do you feel when you notice those thoughts coming up?

User: It makes me feel frustrated and sometimes helpless, as if I'm letting my teammates down by not speaking up. I want to move past this, but it feels challenging.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you want to contribute. Let’s work on challenging those thoughts together. What evidence do you have that supports your worry about not being valuable in the group?

User: Not much, honestly. It's mainly my own fear of judgment. When I actually share my ideas, I generally receive positive feedback, but the anxiety kicks in before I say anything.

Consultant: That's an important realization, Xiaofeng. It seems like your fear of judgment is based on assumptions rather than on evidence. If a friend were in your position, how would you advise them to think about contributing to the group?

User: I would tell them that everyone's input is valuable and that making mistakes is part of the learning process. I would encourage them to share their thoughts.

Consultant: Great perspective! Now, let’s turn that advice back to yourself. How can you apply that same kind of encouragement to your own situation? 

User: I guess I should remind myself that my ideas matter and that it’s okay to make mistakes. I need to focus more on the process than the outcome.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on the process can take some pressure off. What small steps could you take to start sharing your ideas more comfortably in group settings?

User: Maybe I could prepare a couple of points beforehand or practice sharing them with a friend first to build my confidence.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! By preparing and practicing, you can gradually ease into contributing during the meetings. How does that make you feel moving forward? 

User: It feels reassuring. Having a plan helps calm my nerves a bit and gives me something concrete to work with.

Consultant: That's a positive shift in your mindset! As you work on this, let's also think about what other activities or strategies you could engage in outside of academic settings to further boost your confidence in social situations.

User: I’ve been thinking about joining a club related to my major, but I haven't been sure if I should. 

Consultant: Joining a club could be a great way to practice your social skills in a more relaxed environment. What do you think would be a good first step towards getting involved?

User: I could attend a meeting as a visitor first to see how it feels. That wouldn’t require a big commitment right away.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect starting point! Attending a meeting allows you to learn more in a low-pressure setting. Can you set a date for when you’ll do that?

User: Yes, I can try to go to the next meeting next week. I feel a bit nervous, but excited too!

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a mix of emotions. Remember to celebrate your courage to try something new! What strategies could you use to manage any anxiety that arises before the meeting?

User: Maybe I could do some deep breathing exercises or remind myself of past experiences where things went well.

Consultant: Those are effective techniques! Deep breathing can help ground you, and reflecting on past successes can boost your confidence. How would you feel about writing down a few affirmations to remind yourself of your capabilities?

User: That sounds helpful! I could list out positive feedback I’ve received before. 

Consultant: Yes, creating that list can serve as a powerful reminder of your achievements. What else would you like to talk about today to ensure you're feeling prepared for these next steps?

User: I think I’ve covered a lot of ground today, but I'd like to check in on how to keep this positive momentum going in the long term.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflecting on your progress regularly is key. How often do you think you could set aside time to evaluate your goals and feelings moving forward?

User: I could start by journaling once a week to reflect on my experiences and note any challenges and successes.

Consultant: That's a fantastic method to maintain self-awareness and track your growth! Let’s summarize what we’ve talked about today to help solidify your action plan.

User: Sure! I’ll focus on preparing for group projects, practice sharing my ideas, attend club meetings, and keep a journal for self-reflection.

Consultant: Exactly! These steps sound both practical and achievable. How confident are you feeling about putting this plan into action?

User: I feel optimistic. I’m excited about the changes and confident that I can handle the challenges ahead.

Consultant: That’s a great attitude! Remember, it’s okay to reach out for support as you continue on this journey. It’s been great working with you today. Keep up the great work!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I feel like I have a clearer direction now and I’m looking forward to making these changes.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Feng! It's great to see you again. How are you feeling about everything since our last session?

User: Hi! I'm actually feeling pretty good. I've managed to participate more in group activities, and I’m optimistic about the internship I’ve secured. It feels like things are finally looking up.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It seems like you've made some significant progress. What do you think contributed to this change in your outlook?

User: I guess getting that internship really boosted my confidence. I'm starting to realize that I can manage my anxiety better.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Building confidence is a key step. How are you feeling about your studies and overall routine now that you’re engaged in group activities more often?

User: Honestly, I still have moments of distraction while studying, but I'm trying to implement a schedule. Even so, I sometimes fall back into that anxious mindset when I have too much on my plate.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those moments, especially with the added responsibilities of the internship. Could you share more about what thoughts or feelings come up during those anxious moments?

User: I often think that if I don’t do everything perfectly, I’ll mess up my chances for the internship or let people down. That really stresses me out.

Consultant: I understand why that would be stressful for you. It sounds like you might be holding yourself to very high standards. Have you noticed how those thoughts affect your feelings and actions during your study sessions?

User: Yes, definitely! When I think that way, I feel even more anxious, and I start procrastinating because I fear I won't do well. It becomes this vicious cycle.

Consultant: That’s a good insight, Xiao Feng. Let’s explore this pattern further. How realistic do you think these high standards are? What evidence do you have that supports these thoughts?

User: I don’t really know… I guess my performance hasn’t been as terrible as I make it seem in my head. I have succeeded in my studies before.

Consultant: Exactly! It seems like there might be a disconnect between your past successes and the negative thoughts you’re experiencing now. If a friend were in your situation and expressed similar fears, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably tell them to take things one step at a time, to focus on what they can control, and that nobody is perfect. It’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: That's a very kind and supportive perspective. Why do you think it is easier to offer that advice to a friend than to apply it to yourself?

User: I think it’s because I tend to be my own worst critic. I expect so much from myself that I forget it’s okay to be flawed.

Consultant: That makes sense. We can be very hard on ourselves. How about we practice turning that self-criticism into something more constructive? What might a more balanced thought look like regarding your studies and internship?

User: Perhaps, I could think that it’s okay to not be perfect, and as long as I’m trying my best and learning from my experiences, that’s enough.

Consultant: That's a great reframing! Allowing room for growth and learning can ease some of that pressure. What are some practical steps you could take to remind yourself of this new mindset when you feel the anxiety creeping in?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal to track my progress and reflect on my achievements, even the small ones, to see that I'm moving forward.

Consultant: Excellent idea! A journal can serve as a tangible reminder of your successes and growth. How do you feel about incorporating that into your routine moving forward?

User: I feel good about it! I think having something physical to look back on would help me manage my expectations better.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, let's reflect on the progress you've made. You’ve gained confidence and started participating more actively. What would you say is your biggest takeaway from our work together so far?
