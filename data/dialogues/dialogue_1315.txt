Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you today. I'm here to support you. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Lately, I've been really anxious. With the college entrance exam just around the corner, I feel overwhelmed with pressure. I cannot focus on my studies because of this compulsive behavior I have, like flipping through my books repeatedly. It’s driving me crazy.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly challenging. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed with such an important event approaching. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing when you feel the urge to engage in these compulsive behaviors?

User: Well, it usually starts when I sit down to study. I just can't seem to get started, and then I end up obsessively flipping through pages without really absorbing any information. It makes me feel even more frustrated and useless.

Consultant: It sounds like this compulsive behavior is really getting in the way of your studying and adding to your feelings of frustration. Have you noticed any specific thoughts or feelings that come up right before you begin to flip through the pages?

User: Yes, I often feel this wave of panic that I won't achieve good results. It's like I think if I don’t keep flipping through the material, I will forget everything. It’s a vicious cycle.

Consultant: It’s clear that you’re under a lot of pressure to perform well, and that panic is driving you to engage in behaviors that feel necessary but are ultimately unhelpful. Let’s explore this thought: what evidence do you have that flipping through the pages is truly helping you study or retain information?

User: Well, I guess there isn’t much evidence. I mean, it feels like it helps momentarily, but then I realize I haven’t really learned anything.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. It seems like this behavior is more of a coping mechanism in response to your anxiety rather than a productive study strategy. If a friend were in your position, what advice would you give them about this behavior?

User: I would probably tell them to take breaks and focus on understanding rather than just flipping through pages. But for me, it’s hard to break that habit.

Consultant: It’s understandable to find it challenging. Let's think about some alternative strategies to manage your anxiety and break this cycle. What might be a small step you could take to focus on studying differently?

User: Maybe I could set a timer for focused studying sessions, like 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break, instead of just flipping through pages endlessly.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Setting a timer helps create a structure for your study sessions, making it easier to stay focused. How do you feel about trying this approach next time you study?

User: I feel a bit hopeful about it. But there’s still that nagging fear that I won’t remember anything.

Consultant: It’s okay to have those fears. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Let's also look at those fears more closely. Are there specific thoughts that contribute to that fear of not remembering?

User: I often think things like "What if I fail? What if I forget everything during the exam?" It's like I’m setting myself up for disaster.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite intense and stressful. Looking at them, do you notice any patterns or cognitive distortions? For instance, could it be that you are jumping to conclusions or catastrophizing the situation?

User: Yes, I do think I catastrophize. I go from "I might forget a few things" to "I'm going to fail the entire exam."

Consultant: That’s a significant leap in thought. It’s essential to challenge those jumps to create a more balanced perspective. What alternative thoughts could replace the more catastrophic ones?

User: Maybe I could tell myself, "I will do my best, and I have prepared enough to succeed," rather than focusing solely on the worst-case scenarios.

Consultant: That’s a constructive alternative! Reframing your thoughts can help alleviate some of that pressure. Practicing this regularly could be beneficial. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds doable. I want to try it. 

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! As we move forward, let’s think about how to integrate this cognitive restructuring with a practical studying approach. What specific times can you practice setting timers and replacing negative thoughts starting this week?

User: I think I can start tomorrow during my study session in the afternoon. 

Consultant: Perfect! Committing to start tomorrow is an excellent step. Let’s also reflect on what we covered today. What are the most significant insights you've gained from our conversation?

User: I learned that my compulsive behavior is just a way to cope with my anxiety, and I can challenge my negative thoughts about studying and exams.

Consultant: Exactly! Those insights are significant achievements. We’re beginning to work on reducing the impact of your compulsive behavior as you prepare for your exams. Before we wrap up, what are you feeling right now, having discussed all this?

User: I feel a bit more in control, but there's still that underlying pressure. I guess I need to keep reminding myself that it's okay to take breaks.

Consultant: It’s entirely normal to still feel some pressure given the circumstances. But you're already making great steps by understanding your compulsions and actively trying new strategies. Remember to be kind to yourself as you navigate through this. 

User: Thank you. I appreciate your help. I’ll work on this and see how it goes.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad you found the conversation helpful. We’ll continue to track your progress and work on these strategies. If you need support, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care.

User: Take care!

Consultant: Hello, it's nice to see you again, Xiaoming. In our last session, we talked about your feelings of shame and helplessness related to your compulsive behavior. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi. I still feel pretty down, especially after my classmates noticed my behavior at school. I feel even more ashamed now, and it seems to make it harder to focus on my studies.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiaoming. It's understandable to feel embarrassed when others notice something that you’re struggling with. I want to emphasize that you're not alone in this feeling, and it’s okay to talk about it. Can you tell me more about how this experience has impacted your emotions lately?

User: I feel like I can't escape it. I just keep flipping through my books, and now I'm even more anxious about exams because I can't study properly. I worry about failing.

Consultant: It sounds like the situation is weighing heavily on you. The combination of anxiety about exams and feeling pressured by your compulsive behavior must be really overwhelming. How do you think these feelings of anxiety and shame are connected in your mind?

User: I think the shame makes me avoid studying even more. I feel like if I can’t handle this, how can I handle the exams? 

Consultant: That makes sense. It sounds like you might be caught in a cycle where shame leads to avoidance, which then increases your anxiety about the exams. Let’s explore more about the thoughts you have when you feel compelled to flip through your books. What goes through your mind at those moments?

User: I keep thinking that if I don’t do it, I will forget everything, or even worse, that people will think I’m not smart.

Consultant: I hear you. So, your mind is telling you that avoiding the behavior might lead to negative consequences, like losing information or being judged by others. Let’s challenge those thoughts a bit. Is there any evidence that supports these beliefs? 

User: I guess I don’t really have proof. It’s just what I feel.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, Xiaoming. Our feelings can sometimes mislead us. If a friend were feeling this way, what advice would you give them about their thoughts?

User: I’d probably tell them that feelings are not always facts and that they shouldn’t worry about what others think.

Consultant: Exactly! You show compassion for others, but it’s also essential to extend that compassion to yourself. Let’s try to replace some of those negative thoughts with more balanced ones. What could be a more positive view of your situation? 

User: Maybe I could think that it’s okay to take breaks and that it won't ruin my chances if I don’t flip through the pages all the time.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Allowing yourself to take breaks could help reduce the pressure. I propose we test this idea out with a small experiment. How about choosing a specific time to study without flipping through the pages and see how it feels? 

User: That sounds challenging, but I’m willing to try.

Consultant: That’s the spirit, Xiaoming! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. As you take this step, notice what feelings come up and how you react. We can check in about it next time. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also a bit hopeful. I want to improve.

Consultant: Hope is a powerful emotion! Along with that hope, it's essential to prepare for any setbacks. Instead of being hard on yourself, how might you handle it if you find it difficult to stick to this new approach?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s a process and that it’s okay to struggle sometimes.

Consultant: Exactly! Being kind to yourself is crucial during this journey. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’re taking away from our session. What stands out to you most?

User: I’ve realized that my feelings of shame are based on my thoughts, which might not be true. I’m going to try focusing on studying without flipping through the pages.

Consultant: That’s a huge insight! It's a big step forward. Remember, it's okay to feel anxious about the future. Each effort you make, no matter how small, contributes to your growth and confidence. I’m excited to hear how it goes next time. 

User: Thank you! I feel more motivated to address my issues now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoming! I believe in your ability to tackle this. If you face challenges, just remember that it’s all part of learning. Look forward to our next session, and take care until then!

Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today's session. I understand that you've been experiencing some challenges. Can you share with me how you've been feeling recently?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious and down. I just finished a mock exam at school, and my performance was worse than I expected. I can't seem to shake the anxiety, and my compulsive behavior, like flipping through pages in books, is really interfering with my studies.

Consultant: It sounds like the recent mock exam has added to your stress and affected your confidence. You mentioned that your compulsive behavior is causing you pain. Can we start by talking more about how that behavior impacts your study routine?

User: Yeah, it makes it hard for me to concentrate. I can’t sit down and focus on studying because I keep feeling the urge to go back and flip through the pages over and over again. It feels like I'm stuck in this loop.

Consultant: That must be incredibly frustrating for you. It sounds like you're feeling trapped by this behavior. What thoughts go through your mind when you feel the urge to flip the pages?

User: I often think that if I don't check the pages again, I might miss something important, or I'll end up failing my exams. It's like I can't let go of that need for reassurance.

Consultant: It’s understandable to want to feel prepared and not miss anything, especially with exams approaching. But it sounds like this need for reassurance is becoming overwhelming for you. Do you notice how this thought affects your feelings during your study sessions?

User: Yes, it makes me even more anxious and hopeless about my future. I worry that no matter how much I study, I won’t do well.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, especially with all the pressure you're under. It seems like your worries about the future are creating a cycle of anxiety and compulsive behavior. Let's think about how we can challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that you won't do well if you don’t flip through the pages?

User: I don’t have any solid proof, but I remember a previous exam where I felt unprepared, and it didn't go well. That memory just keeps coming back to me.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like there's a fear rooted in past experiences. However, it’s important to remember that past performance doesn’t always dictate future outcomes. If a friend were in your position, what advice would you give them about confronting that fear?

User: I would probably tell them to trust their knowledge and not worry so much about double-checking everything. But it's hard for me to follow my own advice.

Consultant: It's common to be our own harshest critics. What if we apply that same advice to your situation? Could we create a plan where you gradually learn to trust your studying without the compulsive checking?

User: That might be helpful, but I'm not sure where to start.

Consultant: Let’s break it down into smaller tasks. For example, after you finish reading a chapter, you could summarize what you learned instead of going back to check the pages. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds manageable. But what if I still feel anxious about not checking?

Consultant: What if we set a timer for your study sessions? After the timer goes off, you can take a short break to reflect on what you learned instead of checking back. This way, you can gradually build your confidence in your abilities while allowing yourself a structure.

User: That makes sense. Having a timer could help keep me focused. 

Consultant: I’m glad you think so! It gives you a concrete way to manage your study time. Remember to celebrate even the small wins, like completing a session without checking. How do you think that might change your feelings about studying?

User: It might help me feel more accomplished and lessen the anxiety a bit. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing your progress, no matter how small, can reinforce positive feelings and diminish anxiety over time. Are there any specific activities or rewards you could use to celebrate those small victories?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to a video game session after finishing my study targets for the day.

Consultant: That sounds like a great reward! It can be motivating to have something to look forward to after your study sessions. How does it feel to have that plan in place?

User: It feels good. It makes me feel like I have some control over my studying and my compulsive behaviors.

Consultant: That's excellent! Feelings of control are crucial in managing anxiety. Moving forward, let’s also reflect on how your family environment affects your emotions. You mentioned being sensitive to it. Can you share more about that?

User: My family situation is tough. My father and I have a distant relationship, but my mother and sister are supportive. It’s hard not to feel the pressure from my father, especially when he has high expectations.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re balancing different expectations. It’s completely natural to feel overwhelmed by that. How do you think this relationship adds to your feelings of anxiety or your compulsive behaviors?

User: I feel like I'm constantly trying to live up to his expectations, and when I can’t, I just feel more anxious and compelled to do things over and over again. 

Consultant: Those feelings seem intertwined—balancing your father's expectations with your own needs can create a lot of stress. What would it look like for you to set boundaries with those expectations while still striving for your own goals?

User: I think I need to remind myself that it's okay to do my best without being perfect. Maybe I could communicate with my parents about how I'm feeling too.

Consultant: That sounds like a valuable step—opening up about your feelings could help them understand your perspective and allow you to establish a healthier boundary. Are you ready to practice sharing those feelings with them?

User: Yes, I think I could try with my mother first. She’s usually understanding.

Consultant: That’s a positive start! Remember, it’s about being honest with yourself and them. You’re on the right path towards managing both your studies and your family dynamics.

User: I feel more hopeful now. Thank you for helping me frame my thoughts.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that you're feeling more hopeful! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ve learned. You’re working on managing your compulsive behaviors by setting study goals and celebrating your progress. Plus, you plan to communicate with your family about your feelings. How do you feel about these strategies?

User: They make sense, and I feel a bit more confident about tackling my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s wonderful progress! Remember, it's essential to continue reflecting on your journey. If you feel overwhelmed again, it's okay to reach out. You're not alone in this process, and I'm here to support you. 

User: Thank you so much! I’ll definitely reach out if I need help.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to our next session. Take care, and keep practicing your new strategies!

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're here today. Before we dive in, can you share with me how you've been feeling lately, especially with the pressures at home?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a lot of stress, especially with my family constantly checking on me. While they mean well, it's like their attention makes me more anxious instead of helping me feel relaxed.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like their concern, although caring, may be adding to your stress rather than relieving it. Can you tell me more about how their attention affects your emotions or mood?

User: Whenever they ask how I'm doing or if I'm studying, I start to feel this pressure to perform. It makes me anxious and sometimes I feel like I can't study at all.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. It seems the pressure to perform is heightened by their concern. How do you usually respond to that feeling of pressure when it comes up?

User: I try to focus on my books or listen to music to distract myself, but then I end up just flipping through pages without really absorbing anything. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're trying to cope but feel stuck in a cycle of distraction. Let's explore those feelings a bit more. What thoughts usually cross your mind when you find yourself flipping through the pages without studying effectively?

User: I think things like "I'm failing," or "I’ll never keep up." It just feels overwhelming.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy. It’s understandable to feel that way under pressure. How do these thoughts make you feel emotionally? 

User: Honestly, they make me feel really frustrated and sometimes hopeless about studying.

Consultant: Frustration and hopelessness can be really challenging to navigate. Let's try to identify if there are any specific situations that trigger these thoughts. Can you recall moments where you felt overwhelmed while studying?

User: Yes, I remember one time I had a lot of assignments, and my parents kept asking if I got them done. I just froze and couldn't do anything.

Consultant: It sounds like that situation was particularly intense for you. When your parents asked about your progress, you felt frozen. What did you tell yourself in that moment?

User: I just kept thinking, "I can't do this," and it made me want to avoid studying altogether.

Consultant: That's a tough place to be in. It sounds like those thoughts led to avoiding studying. Let's think about how we can challenge those beliefs. Do you think there's any evidence to suggest that you can manage your tasks better than you believe?

User: Well, I have finished assignments before, but when I’m anxious, it’s hard to remember that.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to acknowledge those past successes. If a friend were in your position, how would you encourage them to view their situation?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone struggles sometimes and that they just need to take it one step at a time.

Consultant: That’s a lovely perspective! You showed them kindness and understanding. It sounds like you might benefit from applying that same approach to yourself. How do you think you could take things one step at a time in your study routine?

User: I could break my assignments into smaller tasks and set aside short study sessions instead of trying to do everything at once.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Smaller tasks can definitely feel more manageable and less overwhelming. How do you feel about trying that approach in your next study session?

User: I think I can give that a try. It might make it feel less daunting.

Consultant: Absolutely! And remember to be gentle with yourself during this process. If you start feeling anxious, how might you use some relaxation techniques to help ease that tension?

User: I could try deep breathing or listen to calming music. That usually helps a bit.

Consultant: Those are excellent techniques! Breathing and calming music can help reduce anxiety. Let’s do a quick practice of deep breathing together to help you get comfortable with it. Ready?

User: Sure, let’s do it.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through our noses for a count of four... (breathes in) and now exhale gently through your mouth for a count of six… (exhales) How does that feel?

User: It feels nice to just pause for a moment.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear you find it calming. Learning to take those moments for yourself is a powerful tool. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what you've learned. What do you think will be your next step moving forward?

User: I think I’ll start organizing my study sessions and use deep breathing if I feel overwhelmed. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! You’re making great strides in managing your emotions. Remember, it's perfectly okay to take things slowly. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate the support. I feel hopeful now about tackling my studies. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! I'm here for you anytime. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need assistance before our next session. See you soon!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaomao! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, but I still struggle with those compulsive behaviors. Journaling helps me release some tension, but I want to make sure it's not just a temporary fix.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that journaling is helping you. It sounds like you're eager to build on this progress and find more effective ways to manage your emotions and behaviors. Can you share more about how journaling has affected your feelings?

User: Writing in my journal allows me to express things I usually keep inside. I feel lighter after I write, especially when I describe my day and reflect on it.

Consultant: That’s wonderful, Xiaomao. Expressing your thoughts and feelings can really be beneficial. What specific thoughts or emotions do you find yourself writing about the most?

User: I tend to write about my anxiety over school and my relationship with my dad. I think the pressure to perform well in exams makes my compulsive behavior worse.

Consultant: It sounds like school pressure is a significant source of anxiety for you, and it might be affecting your relationship with your father as well. Have you noticed any particular situations that trigger your compulsive behaviors?

User: Yes, when I sit down to study, I feel overwhelmed. I start flipping through my notes repeatedly without really absorbing anything. It just becomes this cycle that I can’t break.

Consultant: That sounds really frustrating. It seems like the act of studying leads to a lot of pressure for you. Can we explore those feelings and thoughts more? What goes through your mind right before you start flipping through your notes?

User: I usually think that if I don’t get everything perfect, I’ll fail. It feels like there's no room for mistakes.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very harsh and might contribute to your anxiety. It sounds like you're setting very high expectations for yourself. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about this kind of thinking?

User: I’d probably say that it’s okay to not do everything perfectly and that trying your best is what counts.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s easier to offer that kindness to others. How might you apply that same kindness to yourself when you're studying or facing pressure?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that learning is a process. I could also focus on doing my best without being so harsh.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Allowing yourself to be more forgiving can reduce some of that pressure. How about integrating this mindset into your journaling? You could reflect on moments where you feel you’ve done your best, regardless of the outcome.

User: That’s a good idea! I could write about my efforts each day, even the small wins, instead of just focusing on what I didn't accomplish.

Consultant: Yes! This way, you can begin to shift your focus from perfection to progress. Can you think of a small situation from this week where you demonstrated effort or resilience?

User: I did manage to finish a chapter in my textbook, even if I had to take breaks. I felt good about that.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Xiaomao! Celebrating those moments is key to reinforcing your progress. Moving forward, how can we set up a plan to keep building on these positive experiences and manage those compulsive behaviors more effectively?

User: I could continue journaling daily, recording both my challenges and my successes. Maybe I can also set aside specific time blocks for studying to limit that compulsive flipping.

Consultant: That's a solid approach! Having structure in your study time can help reduce feelings of being overwhelmed. Along with journaling, it could be beneficial to set aside time for activities that you enjoy to help relieve stress.

User: I like that idea. It would definitely help me relax. I can already see how balancing study with leisure could make a difference.

Consultant: It’s all about balance! Let’s also talk about how you’ll maintain this approach once your exams are over. What strategies can you think of that would help you continue managing your emotions in the long run?

User: I think continuing journaling will be key. And maybe I can also reach out to friends more often to talk about how I'm feeling instead of bottling things up.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Building a support network and maintaining your journaling practice can be very effective. As we conclude today's session, let’s reflect on the progress you've made and how you feel about your self-control skills moving forward.

User: I feel more optimistic. I see the value in self-compassion and I think it can really help me with my anxiety. 

Consultant: I'm really proud of you for recognizing that! You've made significant strides in understanding and managing your emotions. Remember, it's okay to ask for support when you need it. Do you feel equipped to handle challenges that may arise after your exams?

User: I do! I think I can use what I've learned to keep improving my mindset and behavior.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! You've developed a lot of skills during our sessions. Remember, if you need support in the future, I'm here for you. Best of luck with your exams, Xiaomao!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and guidance.
###################
Consultant: Hello, welcome to our session today! I'm glad you're here. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling much lighter lately. The anxiety I had before has really reduced, and I'm satisfied with how my review for the exams is going.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made significant progress in managing your anxiety. Can you share what specific changes you've noticed in your review process or your feelings?

User: Well, I used to feel overwhelmed when I studied, but now I can focus for longer periods without feeling the urge to flip through pages obsessively.

Consultant: It seems like you've found a better balance in your study routine. What do you think has contributed to this positive change?

User: I think it’s a mix of practicing some techniques we discussed and just realizing that it’s okay to take breaks and trust my preparation. 

Consultant: That's a great insight! Acknowledging the importance of breaks can really enhance focus. As we reflect on your progress, are there any specific moments where you felt particularly proud of yourself?

User: Yes! Last week, I managed to study for four hours straight without getting distracted. I used to struggle to sit for even half an hour!

Consultant: That’s an impressive achievement! Celebrating those moments is vital. Now, thinking about the exams approaching, are there any worries or thoughts that come to mind?

User: I still have some concern that I might slip back into those old habits, especially if the pressure increases. 

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those worries, especially with exams on the horizon. Let’s explore some strategies together to help you maintain your progress. What strategies have you found helpful so far?

User: I think the idea of setting small goals helped a lot. Breaking my study time into chunks makes it less daunting.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! How about incorporating a regular reflection on your progress? It could further reinforce your achievements and guard against slipping back into old habits. 

User: I like that idea! Maybe I could set aside time each week to evaluate my progress.

Consultant: Absolutely! This reflection time can also provide an opportunity to reward yourself for your hard work. What kind of rewards do you think would motivate you?

User: I enjoy watching a new episode of my favorite show or playing video games as a reward.

Consultant: Those sound like fun rewards! Balancing work with enjoyable activities is key to maintaining motivation. Now, let's think ahead—how do you envision your life after the exams, in terms of managing stress and emotions?

User: I really want to keep my current mindset. I hope to continue feeling this relaxed even after the exams finish.

Consultant: That’s a commendable goal! Now, let’s brainstorm some ways to support your mental well-being post-exams. Perhaps we can develop a plan to gradually integrate enjoyable and relaxing activities into your routine.

User: Yes, I’d like to focus on hobbies that I neglected while studying. Maybe I can rejoin my basketball team?

Consultant: Getting back to sports sounds like a wonderful idea! Physical activity can be a great way to relieve stress. Have you thought about how often you'd like to play or practice?

User: Maybe shooting for twice a week? It’ll help me stay active and also give me something to look forward to.

Consultant: Setting a regular schedule like that can definitely help you stay engaged. Along with basketball, are there any other activities you'd like to reintroduce into your life post-exams?

User: I also want to spend more time with my friends. I miss hanging out with them.

Consultant: Reconnecting with friends can be incredibly supportive for your mental health. What types of activities do you enjoy doing with them?

User: We usually go to the movies or just chill and chat. I'd really enjoy doing that again.

Consultant: Those sound like lovely ways to reconnect! It’s essential to build and maintain that social circle after the intense exam period. Now let’s summarize the strategies we’ve developed to help you maintain your progress and well-being. 

User: Sure! I’ll have my reflection time weekly, plan to play basketball twice a week, and make an effort to spend time with my friends.

Consultant: Perfect! Those are actionable steps that you can take. As we conclude today’s session, how do you feel about the plans and strategies we've discussed?

User: I feel really good about it! Everything seems manageable, and I’m looking forward to life after exams.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've made remarkable progress and have some solid plans in place. Remember, it's okay to seek support if you need it in the future. You can handle this, and I believe in your ability to maintain your progress.

User: Thank you so much! This has been really helpful. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need further support. You've got this. Goodbye for now, and take care!
