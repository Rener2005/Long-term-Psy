Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad you've come for this session today. It seems like you're going through a tough time. Can you share with me what’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious lately. It's all about my future job prospects. I’ve seen some of my senior classmates struggle to find jobs, and it’s making me doubt myself. I can't seem to shake off this worry, and it's affecting my sleep and energy levels.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you're overwhelmed by these worries about the future. Let's explore this a bit more. What specific thoughts do you have about your job prospects that are causing this anxiety?

User: I keep thinking that if my seniors can’t find jobs, what chance do I have? I doubt my abilities and feel like I’m not good enough to compete with others. 

Consultant: That's understandable, Zhang. It sounds like you're feeling quite hopeless when you think about your future. Can you tell me more about what specific feelings come up when these thoughts occur?

User: I feel a heavy weight on my chest, and sometimes I can't breathe properly. I also feel like I'm constantly on edge, and it’s hard for me to relax.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. The physical sensations you're describing seem to be quite distressing. Let’s try to break down those thoughts further. You mentioned feeling like you're not good enough. What evidence do you have that supports this thought?

User: Well, seeing my classmates struggling is evidence enough for me. It just confirms my fears that there aren't enough jobs for everyone, and I'm just another face in the crowd.

Consultant: I hear you, Zhang. It’s natural to draw conclusions based on observations, but let’s try to challenge that thought a bit. Is there any evidence that contradicts this belief? Have you achieved any accomplishments or received positive feedback in your studies?

User: I mean, I've done well in my classes, and I won a scholarship last semester, but it just doesn’t feel like enough when I think about the job market.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've had achievements like your scholarship! Those are significant accomplishments. They show you have the potential to succeed. Let’s consider how you might respond to a friend if they were expressing these same thoughts about themselves. What would you say to encourage them?

User: I’d probably tell them that they shouldn’t compare themselves to others. Everyone has different paths, and they have unique qualities that can help them find success.

Consultant: Exactly! So perhaps you could apply that same perspective to yourself. Instead of viewing your classmates’ struggles as a reflection of your own worth, can we consider that everyone has their unique strengths and experiences that will influence their career paths?

User: I guess that makes sense. But it's hard to shake off that fear. 

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s normal to feel that way, especially given the uncertainty around jobs. Let’s work together on some practical strategies. What would be one small step you could take this week to explore your interests in potential job pathways or build confidence in your skills?

User: I think maybe I could reach out to a career advisor at school to discuss my options. 

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent step toward gaining clarity and direction. It might help ease some of that anxiety and give you a clearer picture of that job market. What emotions do you think might come up as you start to take this action?

User: I think I would feel a mix of nervousness and hope—nervous about what I might find out, but hopeful to have a plan.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mix of emotions. It’s normal to feel nervous when facing uncertainty, but taking proactive steps like seeking advice can often lead to hope and new opportunities. Let’s remind ourselves that it’s okay to feel both.

User: Yeah, I see that. I really want to feel more hopeful about my future.

Consultant: Absolutely, Zhang. Fostering that sense of hope is essential. When you notice those negative thoughts creeping in, remember those accomplishments we've discussed and the smaller, positive actions you can take. Let’s also talk about how you can minimize the impact of these worries on your daily life.

User: I sometimes find it hard to focus on my studies when I'm anxious. 

Consultant: That’s a common experience. How about we brainstorm some coping strategies to help you refocus when anxiety arises? For example, would incorporating short breaks or relaxation techniques into your study routine help you feel more grounded?

User: Yeah, that could help. I haven’t really thought about taking breaks to help clear my mind.

Consultant: Giving yourself time to recharge could be very beneficial. Perhaps we can set a small goal: appreciate those breaks as tools to help manage your anxiety, so you return to your studies feeling refreshed. 

User: I can definitely try that. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s commit to discussing how it went in our next session. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. Each small step counts. 

User: Thank you. I feel a bit better already just talking about it.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Zhang. It's a positive sign that you’re beginning to see things differently. As we wrap up, let’s recap what we’ve discussed today and how you can apply these strategies moving forward.

User: Sure! I’ll focus on reaching out to the career advisor, remember my achievements, and incorporate breaks into my study routine.

Consultant: Perfect! You’re taking important steps toward managing your anxiety more effectively. Remember, it’s okay to feel anxious, but you have the tools to navigate through it. If you need support down the road, I’m here to help. 

User: Thank you, I appreciate your guidance. 

Consultant: You’re welcome, Zhang! I look forward to our next session. Take care of yourself, and have a great week ahead!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been struggling a lot lately. The situation with my classmates and their job troubles is really weighing on me. Plus, since my dad's accident, I feel this overwhelming pressure from my family responsibilities. It's hard to manage.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're feeling a significant amount of stress from both your classmates' challenges and your father's accident. That's a lot to carry, and it's understandable that it's affecting your sleep and overall mood. Let's explore this further. What specifically has been troubling you about your classmates' situations?

User: Well, they’re all anxious about finding jobs after graduation, and seeing them worry makes me feel even more anxious about my future. I start wondering if I'm even good enough to find a job. 

Consultant: It’s natural to feel anxious when you’re surrounded by uncertainty. It seems like their worries are amplifying your own fears about job hunting. What kind of thoughts come to mind when you think about your job prospects?

User: I often think that I'm not as smart or capable as my classmates. I feel like I might fail to find something suitable, and that thought really scares me. 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy. Let’s take a moment to unpack them. Do you notice any evidence that supports the idea that you aren't capable? Or is it possible that there might be a different viewpoint we could consider?

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence. It’s just a feeling I have. I keep comparing myself to others, which makes me feel inferior.

Consultant: Comparing ourselves to others can often lead to negative feelings about our own abilities. What if we tried to challenge those comparisons? If you were to see a friend feeling this way, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably say they’re just as capable as anyone else and that everyone has their own strengths. Maybe I should remind myself of my own strengths too.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Recognizing your strengths can help shift your perspective. Let’s think about some of the positive qualities and skills you have. What do you think they are?

User: I believe I’m quite resilient, and I’ve worked hard in my studies. Also, I get along well with people, which I think is an important skill when job searching.

Consultant: Absolutely! Resilience and interpersonal skills are essential assets in any job market. Now, when you think about job hunting, how does it make you feel when you apply this perspective of recognizing your strengths? 

User: It feels a bit better, like maybe I can give it a shot without thinking I will fail right away. 

Consultant: That’s a positive take! Remember, every step in the job search can be a learning experience, regardless of the outcome. Would you like to discuss some practical steps you could take to begin your job search with this mindset?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful. I feel like I need a plan to approach this without feeling so overwhelmed. 

Consultant: Let's brainstorm together. A good starting point could be updating your resume and identifying some job opportunities that align with your skills. Would you feel comfortable doing that?

User: I think I can manage that. Breaking it down into smaller tasks sounds less daunting.

Consultant: Exactly! Breaking it down into achievable steps can make the process feel less overwhelming. Are there any other activities or practices you might find useful to reduce your anxiety as you work on these tasks?

User: Maybe setting aside time for relaxation or hobbies could help. I used to enjoy painting, but I hardly do it anymore.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Engaging in hobbies can provide you with a much-needed break and rejuvenate your mind. How about scheduling some time during the week to indulge in painting or another activity you enjoy?

User: I could definitely try to set a specific time for that. It seems like a great way to balance everything I’m dealing with.

Consultant: That sounds fantastic! Balancing responsibilities with enjoyable activities is key to maintaining your well-being. As you prepare to tackle your job search, commit to giving yourself grace and space to feel your emotions. 

User: I’ll try to be kinder to myself. It’s just hard when I feel the pressure from my family too. 

Consultant: I understand, family pressures can be challenging to navigate. It might be helpful to communicate with them about how you're feeling. Would you be comfortable talking to them about your concerns?

User: I think so. Maybe if they understood what I’m going through, it could ease their expectations a bit.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Sharing your feelings can help them support you better. Remember, it’s okay to express what you need during this time. 

User: I appreciate that. I’ll definitely think about having that conversation. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, I want you to reflect on the strategies we discussed. What do you think your biggest takeaway will be?

User: I think it’s important to recognize my strengths and take things one step at a time. That will help me feel less paralyzed by my fears.

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing your strengths and taking small steps can help build your confidence. I believe you have the tools to manage this anxiety. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more equipped to handle everything. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! It’s been great working together on this. As you navigate these challenges, remember to take care of yourself. We can always revisit this if you need more support. 

User: I’ll keep that in mind. Thank you for your guidance today!

Consultant: Anytime, Zhang! You've made great strides today, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad you're here for our session today. How have you been feeling since we last spoke about your employment anxiety and balancing your studies?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed, honestly. Even though I know I have strategies to follow, the thought of finding an internship while keeping up with my studies just makes me anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling quite stressed about juggling both your studies and the pressures of securing an internship. Can you describe a bit more about what's been causing this anxiety for you?

User: I think it's the uncertainty about my future. I'm worried that if I don’t find a good internship, my chances of getting a decent job after graduation might decrease. Sometimes, I feel paralyzed by all these thoughts.

Consultant: I understand. It’s completely normal to feel uncertain about the future, especially regarding your career. Let’s explore some specific feelings or thoughts that come up when you think about finding an internship. What do you notice in your mind?

User: I often think things like “What if I mess up the application?” or “What if I'm not good enough?” These thoughts really get to me.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy and can certainly amplify your anxiety. Let's reflect on these thoughts—what do you feel when you think "What if I'm not good enough?"

User: I feel really defeated and anxious. It just makes me want to avoid applying altogether because I don't want to face rejection.

Consultant: That makes sense, feeling defeated can lead to wanting to avoid the situation entirely. But let’s challenge that thought a bit. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you’re not good enough for an internship?

User: I guess I don’t have strong evidence. I mean, I have done well in my studies, but the pressure makes me forget all the positives.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Zhang! It sounds like your achievements might get overshadowed by the anxiety. Instead of focusing on the "what ifs," could we reframe those thoughts? For instance, what would you say to a friend feeling the same way about internships?

User: I’d probably tell them to focus on their strengths and just to try their best. I think I could use that advice for myself too.

Consultant: Exactly! It's easier to apply that supportive perspective to someone else, but you deserve that same kindness. What strengths do you think you can bring to an internship?

User: I believe I have good study habits and I'm willing to learn. I also work well with others, which is important in any job.

Consultant: Those are valuable strengths, Zhang! Now, let’s think practically. What small steps can you take this week towards applying for internships while using your strengths?

User: Maybe I could start by updating my resume and looking at opportunities that interest me? It seems manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic start! Updating your resume can help you feel more prepared, and looking for opportunities that excite you will make the process more enjoyable. How do you feel about making that your goal for this week?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful about it. It seems less daunting when I break it down into smaller tasks.

Consultant: That's a great perspective! Breaking it down really helps make tasks feel more achievable. How can you hold yourself accountable for this task?

User: I could set specific times to work on it and maybe share my goals with a friend for support.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Sharing with a friend not only keeps you accountable but also provides an emotional support system. Have you thought about how you might respond if those anxious thoughts creep in again while you're working on this?

User: I suppose I could remind myself of my strengths and think about how I would advise a friend in the same situation.

Consultant: Absolutely! That would be a powerful strategy to counteract negative thoughts. This week, as you take these steps, try to notice any changes in how you feel about the process. What do you think?

User: That makes sense. I’ll try to keep in mind how I feel after I take each small step.

Consultant: Perfect! It’s about progress, not perfection. Remember, every small step counts. We can also discuss more coping strategies next time we meet. How are you feeling about our session today?

User: I feel lighter after talking it through. It's nice to have a plan and to know I'm not alone in this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Zhang! Remember, taking these steps is a sign of your strength. I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Just know that you’re capable of navigating through this anxiety.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. I will definitely work on my plan.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I believe in your abilities. If any challenges arise, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care, and I look forward to our next meeting!

User: Thanks, I will. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Zhang! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. Participating in the career planning workshop helped me rethink my future a bit. But I still feel some anxiety about finding a job after graduation.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’ve found the workshop helpful. However, it’s understandable to feel anxious about job searching. What specific thoughts do you have that contribute to your feelings of anxiety about the future?

User: I keep worrying that I won’t find a job that suits my skills or interests. Sometimes, I think maybe I won’t be good enough or my major isn’t valuable enough.

Consultant: Those thoughts can feel really overwhelming. It seems like you have some negative beliefs about your own abilities and the value of your major. Can you tell me more about how these thoughts make you feel when they arise?

User: When I think like that, I feel really discouraged and stressed out. It makes me want to avoid even looking into job opportunities because I fear rejection or failure.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are really affecting your motivation and willingness to pursue job opportunities. Let’s take a moment to examine those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you won’t find a suitable job?

User: I guess I don’t have any solid evidence. It’s mostly based on my fear of not meeting expectations, either from myself or others.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Zhang. It’s common to fear not meeting expectations, but it’s key to recognize that fear isn’t the same as reality. If a friend were feeling this way, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that they should focus on their strengths and not be so hard on themselves. 

Consultant: Exactly! You seem to have a kind perspective towards others. Now, let's apply that to yourself. What strengths or positive qualities do you possess that could help you in your job search?

User: Well, I am quite adaptable and I have good communication skills. I also enjoy learning new things and challenging myself.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strengths! Being adaptable and a good communicator are invaluable skills in the job market. Let’s focus on nurturing those qualities. What small steps could you take to utilize those strengths in your job search?

User: Maybe I could start by looking for internships or volunteer opportunities that allow me to communicate with others and learn more about the workplace.

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive approach! By engaging in internships or volunteer roles, you can gain practical experience while also honing your skills. How does that make you feel about your job search now?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Taking action makes the whole process seem less daunting.

Consultant: Hope is a powerful feeling when approaching challenges! Let’s also talk about time management since it can greatly influence your ability to tackle job searching. What strategies do you currently use to manage your time?

User: Honestly, I tend to procrastinate a lot. I start planning but then I get overwhelmed and put it off.

Consultant: Procrastination can stem from feeling overwhelmed. Let’s break it down. Could we create a simple and manageable plan for your job search that incorporates small tasks?

User: Yes, I think that could work. Maybe I could dedicate a couple of hours each week to research companies and network.

Consultant: That sounds very achievable! Dedicating specific hours for research and networking can make it feel less overwhelming. How about we set a goal for this week to start with that?

User: Sure! I can commit to two hours this weekend to start researching.

Consultant: Beyond just research, what else could you do within those two hours to connect with professionals in your field?

User: I could try reaching out to people on LinkedIn and introducing myself.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Connecting with professionals can help you gain insight and possibly find opportunities. What do you think would help you feel more comfortable in reaching out to them?

User: Maybe having a few key points to mention about myself would help. Just having a script or something to follow.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach! Writing down key points can provide clarity and boost your confidence. How about creating a brief introduction of yourself that highlights your strengths and your goals?

User: I’ll do that! It feels less intimidating if I prepare in advance.

Consultant: Definitely! Preparation can ease anxiety significantly. As we work through this, remember that progress takes time, and it's okay to take small steps. How are you feeling about making these changes?

User: I feel more empowered. I realize I can take control of my job search instead of just feeling anxious about it.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization, Zhang! Taking control is a significant part of reducing that anxiety. Let’s also consider how you can celebrate small achievements along the way. What might that look like for you?

User: I could treat myself to a nice meal or share my progress with friends.

Consultant: Perfect! Celebrating your accomplishments helps reinforce positive behavior and builds confidence. As we conclude today, what’s one key thing you would like to remember from our conversation?

User: I want to remember that I have valuable strengths and that taking small actions can help me ease my anxiety about job searching.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway! Embracing your strengths and taking actionable steps will support you moving forward. You’ve made great progress today, and I’m proud of you. If you find yourself needing more support, don’t hesitate to reach out. How would you like to end our session today?

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I feel more confident about tackling this job search. I look forward to our next session!

Consultant: I’m glad you feel that way! I look forward to hearing about your progress. Take care, Zhang!
###################
Consultant: Hello there! I’m really glad you could join me for this session. How have you been feeling lately, especially after your recent experiences with social practice activities?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling quite good. Participating in social practice made me realize that I can contribute and work well with others. I’ve become more optimistic about my abilities.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It seems like those activities had a positive impact on your self-esteem and teamwork skills. Can you share a specific moment during those practices that made you feel particularly proud of yourself?

User: Sure! There was a moment when our team had a conflict about how to approach a task. I suggested a compromise that everyone agreed on, and it worked really well. I felt like my input was valuable for the first time.

Consultant: That’s an excellent example! It shows that you are capable of contributing positively in a team setting. How did that experience affect your confidence in other areas of your life?

User: I think it made me feel more capable overall. I used to doubt whether I could handle group dynamics well, but now I feel more ready to participate in group projects in school.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re starting to see your own potential more clearly! What goals do you have in mind that might allow you to build on this newfound confidence further?

User: I want to get more involved in team activities, maybe join a student organization. I think it would help me keep improving my skills.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Engaging in more team activities could reinforce those skills and give you more opportunities to shine. How do you feel about taking this step?

User: I feel excited about it, but I’m still a bit anxious about stepping out of my comfort zone.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel anxious about new experiences. Let’s explore that a bit. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about joining a new activity?

User: I worry that I might not fit in or that I won’t be able to contribute effectively.

Consultant: I can understand why that might make you anxious. It sounds like you may be doubting your abilities in unfamiliar situations. Can you think of any evidence from your past that contradicts these thoughts? 

User: Well, during the recent social practice, I surprised myself with how well I was able to communicate and connect with others.

Consultant: That’s a strong piece of evidence! You demonstrated your ability to work with a team effectively. How could you remind yourself of that success in the future when those anxious thoughts come up?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal where I write down positive experiences and achievements. I could look back on it to boost my confidence when I feel anxious.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Journaling can be a powerful tool to help reinforce positive thoughts. How about setting a goal to write in your journal at least once a week? 

User: Yes, I think I can do that! It would help me reflect on my experiences better.

Consultant: Great! Reflecting on your experiences is integral to maintaining the progress you’ve made. In addition to journaling, are there any other strategies that you think could help you manage your anxiety as you take on new challenges?

User: I think practicing relaxation techniques could help. I’ve heard about deep breathing or mindfulness exercises.

Consultant: Absolutely! Relaxation techniques can be very effective in managing anxiety. Would you be interested in trying some deep breathing exercises together?

User: Yes, I would like that!

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s try a simple deep breathing exercise. Take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a moment, and then slowly exhale through your mouth. Let’s do this a few times together.

User: Okay! (User practices deep breathing.)

Consultant: How do you feel after practicing that?

User: I feel a bit calmer, actually. That was nice!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Integrating these techniques into your routine can help you manage anxiety in various situations. As we wrap up today, what key takeaways do you have from our discussion?

User: I think I’ve realized that I can build on my recent experiences to increase my confidence. Keeping a journal and practicing relaxation techniques will help me manage my anxiety better.

Consultant: Those are valuable insights! As you move forward, remember that you already have the tools for success. If you ever feel overwhelmed, you can revisit these strategies. How do you envision maintaining this progress in the upcoming weeks?

User: I plan to stay involved in team activities and regularly check in with my journal. I think that will really help.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I believe these actions will help reinforce your self-efficacy. Just remember, if you face challenges, it’s okay to seek support. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session.

User: Thank you so much for your support! I feel more prepared to face new challenges now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to be part of your journey. Remember, you have the strength within you to make positive changes. Take care, and I look forward to our next conversation!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! Honestly, I've been feeling much better. My anxiety has lessened significantly, and I feel more positive about my plans for the future. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made some progress. Can you tell me more about the steps you’ve taken or any moments that you felt particularly confident recently?

User: Well, I’ve been following the study plan I created with my mentor. I’m managing my time more effectively, and I feel like I'm moving toward my goals.

Consultant: It's impressive that you are sticking to your study plan. What specific changes have you noticed in your daily routine or mindset that contributed to this improvement?

User: I think I’ve become more organized and less prone to distractions. I set clear boundaries for studying, which really helps me focus.

Consultant: Setting boundaries is a great strategy! How does that make you feel when you’re able to stick to them?

User: It feels really rewarding. I feel a sense of accomplishment when I complete my tasks on time, and it boosts my confidence.

Consultant: That’s excellent! Feeling accomplished can really build your self-esteem. Have there been any challenges in maintaining this new approach?

User: Sometimes I still feel overwhelmed, especially when I think about everything I need to do long-term, like finding a job after graduation.

Consultant: It's natural to feel overwhelmed when thinking about the future. Let’s explore that feeling a bit. What thoughts come to your mind when you think about job hunting after graduation?

User: I worry that I might not find a good job or that I won’t be qualified enough, even though I know I’m working hard now.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing some self-doubt. Can we identify any specific negative thoughts associated with that anxiety? 

User: I keep thinking, "What if I don’t stand out among my peers?" It makes me feel inadequate.

Consultant: That’s a tough thought to carry. Let’s challenge it together. What evidence do you have that supports this thought, and what evidence contradicts it?

User: I guess I do have good grades and positive feedback from my mentor. But I still can’t shake off the feeling of comparison.

Consultant: Those achievements absolutely suggest you are capable! When you compare yourself to others, what feelings arise for you?

User: I feel stressed and anxious. It’s like I can’t enjoy my successes because I’m too busy worrying about what others are doing.

Consultant: Have you considered that your journey is unique, and your successes don't diminish what others achieve? 

User: That makes sense. I should focus on my own progress rather than comparing it with others. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Shifting focus to your own journey can help you maintain that positivity. What are some strategies you can use to remind yourself of your strengths?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal of my achievements or positive feedback to reflect on during tough times.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Regularly revisiting your accomplishments can help reinforce your confidence. Would you like to create a plan for incorporating this into your routine?

User: Yes, I think that would help me a lot! 

Consultant: Great! How about dedicating a specific time at the end of each week to reflect on what went well and any challenges you faced? 

User: That sounds good. I can set aside some time on Sundays to do that. 

Consultant: Perfect! As we wrap up today, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any lingering worries on your mind?

User: I think I’m okay for now. I just want to ensure I can keep this positive momentum going. 

Consultant: That’s a healthy goal! Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. You're doing a great job. In our future sessions, we can check in on your reflection and continue setting those long-term goals. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about everything now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’ve made significant strides today. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything before our next session. 

User: I will! Thank you for your support.

Consultant: You're welcome! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your reflections in our next session.
