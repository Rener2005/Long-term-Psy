Consultant: Hello, Xiaojun! I'm glad you could make it to our session today. I've been looking forward to talking with you. How have you been feeling lately about the upcoming exams?

User: Hey! I've been feeling really anxious about the first mock exam. My teachers keep emphasizing its importance, and it’s making me really nervous again. My hands get shaky, and I sometimes feel a tingling sensation all over. It’s frustrating because I thought I had managed this better.

Consultant: It sounds like the pressure from your teachers is bringing back some of those anxious feelings. You mentioned that your hands shake and you experience tingling sensations—these physical reactions can be really distressing. Can you tell me more about how you felt during your last exam?

User: During my last exam, I felt completely overwhelmed. I was sitting there, and I couldn't concentrate at all. All the negative thoughts came rushing in, like “What if I fail?” or “I’m not good enough.” It was really tough to push through those feelings.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult, Xiaojun. Those thoughts can be really powerful and overwhelming during exams. Let’s take a moment to explore those automatic thoughts you mentioned. What were some specific thoughts you had right before or during the exam?

User: Well, I kept thinking that if I didn’t get a high score, I would disappoint my parents and myself. I also thought everyone else was going to do better than me, which made me even more anxious.

Consultant: I see. It seems like there's a lot of pressure coming not just from your teachers, but also from your own expectations and comparisons with others. These thoughts are putting a lot of weight on your shoulders. How do these thoughts make you feel emotionally when you are experiencing them?

User: They make me feel really hopeless and scared. It’s like I freeze up and can’t think straight. I start to panic about what will happen if I don't do well.

Consultant: That freezing feeling is understandable, especially with the pressure you're under. It sounds like those thoughts are leading you to feel trapped and anxious. Let’s think about those thoughts a bit. Do you believe any of them might be distorted or overly negative? 

User: I guess I sometimes worry too much about disappointing my parents. They always say they just want me to do my best, but I feel like I have to get really high scores to prove that I’m working hard.

Consultant: You're tapping into an important realization there. The belief that you must achieve high scores to prove your worth can be a heavy burden. What if we shifted that thought to something like, “As long as I put in my best effort, that is enough”? What would that feel like for you?

User: It sounds a bit strange, but it might be a relief if I could think that way. I guess I do need to remind myself that my worth isn’t just defined by my grades.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a great insight, Xiaojun. Knowing your worth isn’t tied to just your grades can really help ease some of that pressure. As we continue, let’s explore some alternative thoughts you can remind yourself of during the exam. What if we also looked at some coping strategies for when you start feeling anxious?

User: I would appreciate that. I need to have some techniques ready to use, especially during the exam.

Consultant: Perfect! One effective method is to practice some deep breathing before and during the exam to help calm your mind and body. Would you like to try a short breathing exercise together right now?

User: Yes, that sounds good. I think it could really help to have that practice.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four… hold for a count of four… and breathe out slowly through your mouth for a count of four. Let’s do this a couple of times. How do you feel after trying that?

User: I feel a little calmer already. It’s nice to have something simple to focus on instead of all the pressure.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! With regular practice, this can become an effective way to manage your anxiety. Remember, you can also visualize yourself succeeding during the exam. Can you picture that in your mind?

User: I can try to picture sitting at my desk, breathing deeply, and just focusing on the questions instead of everything else. That sounds helpful.

Consultant: That’s wonderful, Xiaojun. A positive visualization can help reduce feelings of panic. As we approach your exam, let's develop a plan together for practicing these techniques. What would you like to include in your plan?

User: I think practicing deep breathing daily, visualizing during my study sessions, and maybe setting smaller goals for each subject could help.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent strategies! Setting smaller, achievable goals will give you a sense of progress, which can help reduce your anxiety. As you implement these strategies, how do you think that will change your experience with the upcoming exam?

User: I hope it will help me feel more in control and less overwhelmed. If I can keep reminding myself to breathe and that I’m good enough, maybe I won’t panic as much.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive outlook! Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ll work on before the next session. We will focus on the breathing exercises, positive self-talk, and visualization, right?

User: Yes, definitely! I feel more prepared already.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Xiaojun! You're taking important steps forward. In our next session, we can check in on how these techniques worked for you and adjust if needed. Remember, you’ve got this! If you encounter challenges, we can face them together.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I'll see you next time!

Consultant: You’re welcome! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress. See you soon!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Jun! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been a bit better, I think. The rugby training has helped some, but I still feel anxious about the upcoming exams. I'm not completely satisfied with my grades either.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. It sounds like you're making strides with the rugby training but still facing that familiar anxiety regarding exams and your academic performance. What specifically about the upcoming exams worries you the most?

User: I'm just scared that I won't do as well as I hope. I have this fear of disappointing myself and my parents, and it just makes everything feel more overwhelming.

Consultant: That must be really challenging for you, feeling that pressure to meet expectations. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that come to your mind when you're feeling overwhelmed? What do you notice about your thinking in these moments?

User: I often think that if I don’t get perfect scores, I’ve failed. I also feel like my future relies on these exams, which makes it worse.

Consultant: It seems like you have some very high standards for yourself and a lot of pressure regarding your future. Let's explore this a little further—how do those thoughts about needing to be perfect affect your emotions and behavior when studying or preparing for the exam?

User: When I think like that, I feel really anxious, and it makes it hard to concentrate on studying. I end up procrastinating because I don’t know where to start.

Consultant: I understand. Procrastination can often be a response to feeling overwhelmed by expectations. Let’s take a moment to discuss how we can challenge those negative thoughts. What evidence do you have that not achieving perfection means you've failed?

User: I guess I don’t have any real evidence. I have done well in the past, but I just focus on what I could have done better.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Xiao Jun. It sounds like you may be engaging in some cognitive distortions by viewing situations in black-and-white terms. If a friend were in your position, how might you encourage them to see it differently?

User: I would probably tell them that it's okay to make mistakes and that doing their best is what really counts, not being perfect.

Consultant: Exactly! You already have that understanding for others. Now, how can you apply that same kindness and perspective towards yourself? What would it look like to give yourself permission to aim for progress instead of perfection?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that as long as I try my best and learn from the process, that should be enough, right?

Consultant: Yes, that's a wonderful perspective! Shifting your focus from perfection to personal growth can relieve some of that pressure. Let's also consider some practical strategies. Apart from rugby, what are some activities or techniques you've used or could use to manage your anxiety leading up to exams?

User: I usually listen to music or sometimes go for a walk, but I haven’t made time for that lately.

Consultant: Those sound like effective methods! Let’s incorporate those into your routine, alongside your sports training. How about creating a balanced schedule that includes your studies, walking, and music? 

User: That sounds like a good idea! I could set aside specific times for walks and music in between my study sessions.

Consultant: That's an excellent plan! It’s essential to take breaks to recharge your mental energy. Let's also think about a few scenarios where you might feel anxious and how you could gradually face them. Is there a particular situation you find especially daunting?

User: Well, just sitting in the exam room is nerve-wracking. I worry about what everyone else will think and if I'm going to blank out.

Consultant: Let's try a small experiment. How about we visualize that exam situation together? Picture walking into the room, sitting down, and taking a deep breath. What would you say to yourself in that moment to calm your nerves?

User: I’d probably tell myself to just focus on my own paper and take it one question at a time.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Focusing on the present can help ground you. We can also practice this visualization technique before your exams. Let’s also review what you've learned so far about managing anxiety. What tools do you think you can rely on during the exam?

User: I think I can use my breathing techniques, remind myself of what I’d tell a friend, and take short breaks during the test if I can.

Consultant: Those strategies are fantastic, Xiao Jun! It’s about finding what works for you and trusting in your ability to navigate these situations. As we wrap up today's session, how do you feel about the progress you've made in understanding your anxiety and the steps you can take moving forward?

User: I feel more confident. I think I can handle my anxiety better and face exams with a clearer mindset.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s okay to have ups and downs, and you’re allowed to embrace a range of emotions. As you continue your preparation, give yourself grace and recognize the hard work you’re putting in. If challenges arise, return to these tools we've discussed.

User: Thank you, I really appreciate this. I feel like I have a better grasp of things now.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiao Jun! I believe in your ability to handle whatever comes your way. This is our last session for now, but remember, you have developed valuable skills. If you ever need support again, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, I’m glad you're here today. I’d like to hear how you’ve been feeling lately, especially with your upcoming exams.

User: Hi. I’ve been trying to manage my anxiety better. With the recent mock exams, I did well, but I still feel this pressure to be perfect. It’s like I can’t shake off that feeling.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of progress and pressure. Achieving good results is great, but the pressure for perfection seems to be still there. How do you think this pressure affects your feelings about upcoming exams?

User: I think it makes me more anxious. Even though I did well, I keep worrying about not living up to my own expectations during the real exams. There’s this fear that I might not perform as well.

Consultant: You’re expressing a common struggle between recognizing your achievements and the fear of not meeting your own standards. Can you identify any specific thoughts that come to mind when you feel this pressure?

User: I often think that if I don’t get perfect grades, it means I’m a failure. I just want to make my parents proud, but it feels like I’m just setting myself up for disappointment.

Consultant: That’s a heavy burden to carry, feeling that your worth is tied to your grades. What if you considered the idea that getting a less-than-perfect grade doesn’t define your value as a person or how well you can succeed in life?

User: I guess that makes sense, but it’s hard to accept. I’ve always been taught that hard work equals good results, and I feel like I should always push for the best.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially with the values instilled in you. However, let’s explore if there are different definitions of success that could relieve some of this pressure. What would it look like to have a more balanced view on success and grades?

User: I think if I could see grades as just feedback rather than a measure of my worth, it might be easier. But I’m still worried I won’t relax enough to do my best.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight—viewing grades as feedback can help alleviate some pressure. What strategies do you think we could apply to help you relax and focus, especially before exams?

User: Maybe I could try some relaxation techniques or deep breathing exercises. I've heard those can help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Incorporating deep breathing or mindfulness techniques can be effective in reducing anxiety. How comfortable are you with trying these methods before your exams?

User: I’m willing to give it a shot. It just feels a bit strange to think about, but I know I need to try something different.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a bit hesitant about new strategies. Let’s start with a simple breathing exercise that you can practice daily. Shall we go through a short one together now?

User: Sure, that sounds good.

Consultant: Great! Let’s begin. Take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a moment… now exhale slowly through your mouth. Let’s do this a few times together. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt calming, actually. I can see how doing this regularly might help me manage stress.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Consistency will be key. Besides practicing this technique, what else can you do to prepare mentally for your exams?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that I can learn from them. Maybe I can also talk to my friends about how they deal with exam stress.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy approach! Talking with friends can provide support and different perspectives. It sounds like you’re developing a more compassionate approach toward yourself. How does that resonate with you?

User: It feels actually encouraging. I often feel so alone in this, but knowing I can share with others makes it less isolating.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear. Creating a support network can make a huge difference. As we continue this work, let’s focus on your confidence and self-compassion as integral parts of your preparation. How does that sound moving forward?

User: It sounds good! I think focusing on self-compassion can really change how I feel about the pressure.

Consultant: Exactly! We’ll continue building on that. As we approach your exams, remember that your best effort is enough, regardless of the outcomes. What’s one thing you can do this week to practice self-compassion?

User: Maybe I could take a break when studying instead of pushing myself all the time. Just letting myself relax without guilt.

Consultant: That’s an excellent step! Allowing yourself breaks is essential for maintaining your well-being. How do you think you’ll feel after taking those breaks?

User: I think it will help me feel less overwhelmed and maybe even more focused when I come back to studying.

Consultant: Exactly! It's important to find balance. As we approach our next session, I encourage you to reflect on these practices and share how they affected your feelings and preparation for exams. 

User: I will do that. I’m looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: Me too! Remember, it's a journey, and it’s okay to take small steps. You’re making great progress, and I’m here to support you. 

User: Thank you! I feel a lot more hopeful now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your experiences. Take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Jun! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, but there's still this underlying anxiety about the upcoming exams. Even though I had a good experience with the speech competition, I still feel that panic creeping in before tests.

Consultant: I understand. You felt more confident during the speech competition, which is wonderful! It's normal to still feel some anxiety with exams approaching. Can you tell me more about the feelings you experience when you think about the tests?

User: I often feel my heart racing, and sometimes my hands shake. It's like my body reacts before my mind even realizes it. I wish I could just relax and focus better.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. Your body is responding with those physical symptoms of anxiety. It seems like there's a disconnect between how your body feels and how you want to feel. Let's explore this a bit more. Can you describe what thoughts go through your mind when you start feeling that anxiety?

User: I usually think, "What if I fail?" or "What if I forget everything I've studied?" Those thoughts just make me more nervous.

Consultant: It's understandable to have those thoughts, especially during such important moments. Let's take a closer look at them. On a scale from 1 to 10, how much do you believe those thoughts when they come up?

User: I’d say around 8. It really feels real when I'm in that situation.

Consultant: That’s quite strong. Now, let’s challenge those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you will fail or forget everything?

User: Well, I guess I've done well in the past, especially during the speech competition. I just get so caught up in the moment, I forget that I've prepared.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve successfully managed challenges before. It’s important to remind yourself of those accomplishments. If a friend came to you feeling this way, what would you advise them to think instead?

User: I would probably tell them to remember their past successes and to trust their preparation.

Consultant: That's a great approach! Now, what if we could practice some positive self-talk for you to use before exams? We could create a phrase that encourages you. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I think it could help me if I had something to say to myself.

Consultant: Let’s come up with something together. How about, “I’ve prepared well, and I can handle this”? Would you feel comfortable using that?

User: Yes, I think that could work! It’s simple yet powerful.

Consultant: Perfect! Now, let’s talk about what you can do in the moments leading up to your exams to manage your anxiety. Have you tried any breathing techniques or activities to help calm your mind?

User: I know about deep breathing, but I haven’t really practiced it much.

Consultant: No problem! Deep breathing can be very effective. Let’s practice it now together. Inhale deeply through your nose for four counts, hold for four, and then exhale slowly for four. Ready? Let's try it.

User: Okay, I'll give it a shot. Inhale... hold... exhale. That feels a bit calming!

Consultant: Great job! You can use this technique before your exams to help center yourself. Remember, it’s a tool you can rely on. Is there anything else you think might help reduce your anxiety as the exams approach?

User: Maybe planning a study schedule could help. I sometimes feel overwhelmed by everything I need to cover.

Consultant: Absolutely! Making a study plan can make everything feel more manageable. Let’s outline what your study schedule could look like for the next week. How many subjects do you need to cover?

User: I have four main subjects to study for.

Consultant: Excellent. How about we allocate specific times for each subject every day? This way, you'll have a clear idea of what to focus on, and it can reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed.

User: That makes a lot of sense! I think having structure will really help me.

Consultant: I’m glad you feel that way! After creating your schedule, it’s important to include breaks as well. Taking short breaks can enhance your focus. What kind of activities do you enjoy during your breaks?

User: I like listening to music or going for short walks. They help me clear my mind.

Consultant: Those are great options! Let’s plan for you to incorporate those activities into your schedule. It’s vital to balance studying with relaxation. How do you feel about the plan we discussed today?

User: I feel much more organized and less anxious. I think having these tools will really help me through the exams!

Consultant: I’m really happy to hear that! You’ve made great progress. Remember to keep using those positive affirmations, practice your deep breathing, and stick to your study schedule. Let’s meet again after your exams to review how everything went and to continue building on your progress. How does that sound?

User: That sounds awesome! Thank you for all your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Jun! I’m confident you’ll do great in your exams. Remember, you’re not alone in this. See you next time!

User: See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Jun! I'm glad to see you again. How are you feeling today, especially with the upcoming exams?

User: Hello. I'm feeling pretty good actually! I've managed to cope with recent mock exams without falling back into my anxiety. I'm starting to feel more confident about the upcoming exams.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made considerable progress since we last spoke. Can you share what strategies or techniques have been most helpful for you?

User: Sure! I've been using some of the time management techniques we discussed. Breaking up my study sessions into shorter, more manageable blocks has been really effective.

Consultant: Great! It’s promising that you’ve found a method that helps. How do you feel emotionally and physically when you study this way?

User: I feel less overwhelmed, and it’s easier to focus. I don't get that overwhelming sense of panic like before. My body feels more relaxed, too—no more shaking or numbness, which is a relief.

Consultant: That’s an important improvement, Xiao Jun. It seems like you’re developing a healthier relationship with studying. Have there been any specific situations lately where you felt challenged, or was it mostly smooth sailing?

User: There was one time during a practice exam when I felt that familiar knot in my stomach. I started to doubt myself, but I reminded myself of the techniques we've discussed, and I managed to push through.

Consultant: It’s impressive that you were able to recognize those feelings and apply what you've learned. What thoughts did you challenge to help you cope in that moment?

User: I told myself that I had prepared well, and it was okay to feel nervous. I focused on doing my best instead of thinking about the outcomes.

Consultant: Those are powerful reminders! Acknowledging your preparation and embracing your feelings rather than avoiding them is a crucial step. How did that experience affect your confidence moving forward?

User: It really boosted my confidence. I felt like I had control over my emotions, which had been a big issue for me.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic shift! Control over your emotions can significantly impact your performance. As we prepare to conclude our sessions, how do you plan to integrate what you’ve learned into your study routine for the upcoming exams?

User: I want to keep using the time management techniques and incorporate regular breaks. Also, I’ll remind myself that it’s okay to feel anxious and that it doesn’t define my capability.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Regular breaks and self-compassion can go a long way. Is there anything specific you’d like to do if you start feeling anxious during the exams?

User: I think I might try some deep breathing exercises or take a brief walk if allowed. Just stepping away for a moment might help reset my mind.

Consultant: Those are effective strategies. Practicing deep breathing can help calm your nervous system, and a short walk can give you a mental break. As we wrap up, let's reflect on what you've achieved during our sessions. What would you say was the most significant change for you?

User: I’d say learning to manage my anxiety and not letting it control me was the biggest change. I also feel more prepared and equipped to handle pressures when they come up.

Consultant: That’s a remarkable takeaway! You've developed valuable skills. As you move forward, remember that you've built a solid foundation for managing stress and anxiety. If you face challenges in the future, you can revisit the techniques and strategies we've discussed.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate all the help you've given me. I feel ready to face the exams now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Jun. I'm proud of the progress you’ve made. This wraps up our time together, but remember that you have the tools and understanding to manage your emotions. Don’t hesitate to seek support again if needed. Best of luck with your exams!

User: Thank you so much! I will definitely keep that in mind. 

Consultant: Goodbye, Xiao Jun! Wishing you all the best in your studies and exams.
