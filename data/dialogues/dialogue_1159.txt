Consultant: Hello, welcome to our session today! I understand that you’re feeling quite anxious lately. Can you share more about what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been really struggling with my decision on which major to pursue for my graduate studies. I'm torn between psychology, which I'm passionate about, and philosophy, which seems to have more job security.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re facing a significant dilemma between what you love and what might provide a more secure future. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about these two options?

User: I often worry if I’ll disappoint my parents if I choose psychology. They’ve always suggested more traditional and secure paths for me, and I feel like I’m letting them down by considering something different.

Consultant: That's a heavy burden to carry. It’s understandable to feel that way, especially with parental expectations involved. Can you tell me more about how these thoughts affect your emotions, particularly your anxiety?

User: Whenever I think about making the decision, I feel this surge of anxiety. I start doubting my abilities and wonder if I’ll be successful if I pursue psychology. It's hard to picture myself in either field confidently.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a lot of pressure coming from different directions—both from your parents and your own expectations. Let’s take a moment to explore those anxious thoughts further. What specific worries run through your mind when you think about pursuing psychology?

User: I worry that I won’t find a job afterward or that I won’t be as good as my peers. Sometimes I catch myself thinking that maybe I’m just not cut out for it.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. Those thoughts seem to be creating a cycle of doubt and anxiety. Can you think of any evidence that might support or contradict those thoughts?

User: I guess I have done well in my psychology courses, and I’ve always been interested in the subject. A part of me knows I could do well, but the fear of the unknown really holds me back.

Consultant: It’s great to hear you’ve done well in psychology and have a passion for it! What if we reframed those fears? If a friend were in your position, how might you encourage them to view their abilities and the risks involved?

User: I would probably tell them that it's okay to follow their passion and that success isn't guaranteed in any field. I’d remind them of their strengths and that they should pursue what makes them happy.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective. Now, can we think about how we might apply that same understanding to your situation? What would it look like if you were to act as your own supportive friend during this decision-making process?

User: I think I’d need to remind myself that it’s okay to pursue psychology and that I can create my own opportunities, rather than just focusing on the negatives. I guess finding a balance between what I love and the pressure from my parents is key.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about creating a pathway that aligns with your values while still considering your parents' perspectives. How do you think you might begin to explore this balance?

User: I could start by discussing my plans with my parents, maybe expressing why I’m interested in psychology and how I could potentially find success in it. I need to be honest about my feelings.

Consultant: That’s a proactive step. Open communication with your parents could help them understand your perspective better. Perhaps we can also explore ways to strengthen your confidence in your choice. What activities or experiences might help you feel more assured in pursuing psychology?

User: I could look for internships or volunteer opportunities in psychology to gain more experience. That might make me feel more confident in my decision.

Consultant: That sounds like a productive approach! Gaining practical experience can definitely help you feel more prepared. How do you think experiencing the field firsthand might influence your decision-making process?

User: Experiencing it directly could solidify my passion for psychology and lessen my worries. It would provide me with a clearer idea of what to expect in a career.

Consultant: Absolutely, direct experience can often bring clarity. Now, in addition to these exciting opportunities, what self-reflective practices might you incorporate to solidify your inner sense of direction and autonomy?

User: I might start journaling my thoughts and feelings about my choices. Writing things down might help me sort through everything and recognize my true desires.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Journaling can provide a space for self-discovery and processing your feelings. How often do you think you could commit to this practice?

User: I could probably set aside some time each week to reflect and write in my journal. Maybe on Sundays when I have a little more free time.

Consultant: That sounds like a manageable plan. As we work together on this journey, we can continue to check in about your feelings and any new insights you gain. Remember, this is a process of exploration. How are you feeling about the steps we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel a bit lighter. Just talking about it has made me realize that I have options and that I can pursue what I truly desire. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! We’ve made some good progress today. As we wrap up, what is one key takeaway you’d like to remember from our conversation?

User: I think it’s that I can honor my passion for psychology while still considering my parents’ views. It’s about finding that balance and being true to myself.

Consultant: That’s a profound realization! Remember, this journey is about your growth and choices. If you find yourself struggling again, think of our discussion today and the steps you’ve identified. I believe in your capability to navigate this decision.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I’ll definitely try to utilize the ideas we talked about.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process.

Consultant: Hello Zhang! I'm glad to see you today for our session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've been a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. The pressure from different mentors about career choices has been really intense, and I'm still trying to clarify what I want.

Consultant: I understand that you’re feeling the weight of these external expectations. It's normal to feel overwhelmed in such a situation. Can you tell me a bit more about how these discussions with mentors make you feel, particularly regarding your choices?

User: Well, I often feel anxious and uncertain. Some mentors push me towards certain paths, but deep down, I'm not sure if those paths align with what I truly want. I just want to choose something that feels right for me.

Consultant: It sounds like you're caught between what others expect of you and what you genuinely desire. Let’s explore this further. What would choosing a path that feels right for you look like? 

User: I think it would feel empowering, like I’m in control of my future. Instead of feeling anxious, I want to feel excited and confident about my choices.

Consultant: That’s a great vision to have! Feeling empowered and confident is crucial. Can you reflect on what truly matters to you in your career? What values or goals do you hold dear?

User: I really value independence and the ability to make an impact through my work. I want to feel like I’m contributing to something meaningful.

Consultant: Those are wonderful values, Zhang! Contributing to something meaningful and having independence can guide your decision-making process. Have you had the chance to think about how your current options align with those values?

User: A bit, yes. But the pressure often clouds my judgment. I feel like I should consider what will please my parents or what seems more prestigious, even if it doesn’t align with my values.

Consultant: It's understandable that external pressures can lead you to second-guess your values. How does it feel when you think about potentially disappointing your parents versus following your own desires?

User: It makes me feel guilty, like I'm letting them down. But at the same time, I feel frustrated because I want to live my life according to my own values.

Consultant: That’s a difficult position to be in. It’s common to experience conflicts between personal and family expectations. Let’s try an exercise. Imagine you’re having a conversation with your parents about your career choice. What would you want to communicate to them about your values and desire for independence?

User: I would tell them that I appreciate their guidance, but I need them to understand my perspective. I want to choose a path that resonates with who I am, even if it’s not their preferred choice.

Consultant: That’s a powerful message, Zhang. Expressing your appreciation while asserting your own needs shows courage. How do you think they might react to this conversation?

User: I hope they would be understanding and supportive, but I’m worried they might push back. 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It's important to anticipate various reactions. What could you say to help them understand your viewpoint more clearly during that conversation?

User: Maybe I could explain how their support means a lot to me and how my choices can still lead to a successful future, just in a way that's true to myself. 

Consultant: That’s a nice approach! Framing your aspirations in a way that highlights how they align with your success could help them understand your perspective better. What do you think might help increase your confidence in voicing these thoughts?

User: Practicing what I want to say might help. If I rehearse it out loud, I might feel more ready to discuss it with them.

Consultant: Absolutely! Rehearsing is a great way to build confidence. How about we create some possible dialogues as practice? This way, you can feel more prepared for that conversation. 

User: That sounds like a good idea! I’d like to try.

Consultant: Great! Let’s draft a few statements together that you can use. Start with what you want to express about your values.

User: I want to say something like, "I know you care about my future, but I also need to pursue what feels right for me." 

Consultant: That’s a very heartfelt opening. Now, let’s add a bit about how your choices can lead to success in your own way, perhaps mentioning your values of independence and meaningful contribution.

User: I could say, “I believe that if I follow my passion and choose a path that’s meaningful to me, I can also forge a successful career.”

Consultant: That’s beautifully said, Zhang! You’re clearly asserting your needs while also acknowledging their concerns. How does it feel to practice saying these things?

User: It feels good. It’s empowering to think about standing up for what I want while still being respectful.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, reinforcing your beliefs and values in these conversations can build your confidence. As we wrap up, what are your key takeaways from today’s session?

User: I need to practice communicating my values and desires to my parents clearly. That’s important for my personal growth and independence.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve made significant progress today. Remember that it’s a journey, and you are learning to trust yourself more. If you face challenges in the future, we can always revisit these strategies together.

User: Thank you! This session helped me clarify my thoughts and feel more prepared for my decisions.

Consultant: You're welcome, Zhang! I'm proud of the progress you've made. Believe in yourself and your choices. Looking forward to our next session, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need support in between.

User: I will! Thanks again, and see you next time!

Consultant: See you next time, Zhang! Take care.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad you're here today. I want to start by checking in on how you're feeling lately. Can you tell me about what's been on your mind?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really confused and frustrated lately. I had a conversation with my parents about my future plans, but we couldn't agree on anything. It left me questioning if I can really make my own decisions.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like that conversation really impacted your confidence in making independent choices. You mentioned feeling frustrated—what specifically about that discussion felt challenging for you?

User: It felt like no matter how I expressed my thoughts, they just kept pushing their own expectations on me. I want to have my own path, but their opinions weigh heavily on me.

Consultant: That sounds tough, feeling that weight of their expectations while wanting to chart your own course. What do you think are some of the main concerns your parents have when it comes to your future?

User: I think they want me to have a stable job and a secure future, which is understandable, but I wish they'd trust my judgment more. I feel like I'm stuck between what I want and what they expect.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s completely natural to seek their approval, especially when they care about your well-being. Let’s explore this further. How do you feel when your parents express their expectations?

User: I feel anxious and upset. I start to doubt my own abilities and worry if I’m making the wrong choices. It's like a cycle; their expectations trigger my anxiety, and then I question myself even more.

Consultant: It appears like their expectations lead you to a place of self-doubt and anxiety. Can you recall a specific thought that went through your mind after that conversation?

User: I kept thinking, “What if I fail? What if I'm not good enough?” Those thoughts just replay in my head.

Consultant: Those thoughts must feel overwhelming. Let's take a moment to examine them. What evidence do you have for the idea that you might fail or that you're not good enough?

User: Well, I haven't failed yet, but the pressure makes me feel like it’s a possibility. I guess I’m afraid of not living up to everyone’s expectations.

Consultant: It sounds like you're weighing the potential outcome against your self-worth. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably tell them that they’re capable and that one conversation doesn’t define their future. They should trust themselves more.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! Now, let's try to apply that same kindness to yourself. How could you reframe those negative thoughts into something more supportive?

User: Maybe I could think, “I am capable of making choices, and I can learn from whatever happens." That feels more encouraging.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic shift in thinking! It promotes a sense of resilience and self-efficacy. How would you feel about trying to communicate this to your parents in the future?

User: I think I could try that! It would be helpful to explain my feelings and show them that I can take responsibility for my decisions.

Consultant: That sounds like a great approach. Preparing to express your perspective can help foster better understanding. What specific points do you think you would want to communicate to them?

User: I want to discuss my plans, show them my reasoning, and ask for their input instead of just facing their expectations. 

Consultant: That's a constructive strategy! Engaging them in a dialogue where their input is invited rather than imposed could improve the situation. How do you think you’ll feel after trying that?

User: I think I could feel more empowered, and even if they disagree, I’d feel like I stood up for myself, which is important.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking that step towards assertiveness will not only build your confidence but also strengthen your relationship with them. Let's role-play a bit. I’ll be your parent, and you can practice expressing your thoughts.

User: Okay! I’ll give it a shot. “Mom and Dad, I want to talk about my future and share my thoughts with you. I really value your opinions, but I need your support in my choices too.”

Consultant: Excellent start! You’re inviting dialogue while also asserting your need for support. How does it feel to say that?

User: It feels empowering! I wish I could say this to them.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Remember, practicing these conversations can help ease your anxiety when the real moment comes. How do you feel about the progress you've made today?

User: I feel a lot better. I have a clearer idea of how to communicate my feelings, and I’m feeling more confident in my ability to make decisions.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It’s really important to acknowledge your progress. As we wrap up today, what strategies can you keep in mind for handling future conversations with your parents?

User: I’ll focus on expressing my thoughts clearly and showing that I’m capable. Also, I’ll remind myself that it’s okay to have different perspectives.

Consultant: Those are great strategies, Zhang. It's about building that bridge of understanding. Remember, you’ve got this! If you ever feel unsure again, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m here for you.

User: Thank you so much! I feel more in control now. I appreciate your help!

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m really proud of the steps you’re taking. I look forward to hearing how it goes next time we meet. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel like I've made some progress. I've been thinking about how to balance my interests with my parents' expectations. It's still a bit overwhelming, but I'm trying to stay positive.

Consultant: That's great to hear that you're processing your thoughts. Can you share more about what specific interests you're starting to recognize as important to you?

User: Well, I always enjoyed music and art, but I felt pressure to focus solely on my studies for the exams. Now I realize I want to incorporate creativity into my future career as well.

Consultant: It sounds like you're beginning to recognize the value of creativity and how it relates to your career. How does that realization make you feel?

User: It feels liberating! But I still worry about how my parents will react if I pursue something they aren’t fully on board with.

Consultant: I understand that concern. It’s natural to want to please your parents, but it’s also important to follow your own desires. What do you think would happen if you shared your thoughts about blending your interests with your career aspirations?

User: I think they would be surprised. They always envisioned me taking a more traditional path, but I'm worried they might not support my change in direction.

Consultant: That fear of surprising them is common. Let’s explore this a bit. What evidence do you have that they wouldn’t support your creative interests? 

User: I guess they have always encouraged academic success, and I’ve never really talked about my passion for art. I just assume they will see it as a distraction.

Consultant: It’s easy to jump to conclusions. Sometimes, our assumptions can lead us to feel anxious. What if you approached the topic with them and framed it as an extension of your studies rather than a distraction?

User: That's an interesting perspective. I hadn't thought about it that way, but I could present it as something that could enhance my career.

Consultant: Exactly! Highlighting how your interests align with your goals might open up a more positive conversation. How would you feel about planning a discussion with them about it?

User: I feel a mix of excitement and nervousness. I want to express my thoughts, but I'm unsure about their reaction.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel that way. What if we practiced how you might start that conversation? What would be a good opening for you? 

User: Maybe I could say that I’ve been reflecting on my future and realized that including my creative side could be beneficial.

Consultant: That sounds like a good start! It communicates your reflections clearly. As you continue this self-exploration, what steps can you take to ensure you’re also honoring your interests?

User: I can set aside time each week for creative projects, regardless of my study schedule. It may help them see that I'm serious about my interests.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Action steps can really support your mindset. How do you feel about taking that initiative?

User: I feel more motivated actually. It makes me feel like I’m taking control of my own journey rather than just following expectations.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! Taking control is essential. What do you think you will focus on in your creative projects first?

User: I think I’ll work on some artwork that reflects my experiences. It could be a way to express myself while also keeping track of my growth.

Consultant: That sounds meaningful! How do you think this creative expression might impact your overall well-being?

User: I believe it will be therapeutic. It’ll help me manage stress and remind me of my identity outside academic pressures.

Consultant: That's an excellent insight! Creativity can be a wonderful outlet for stress relief and self-discovery. How can we ensure this remains a consistent part of your routine, even with studying?

User: Maybe by scheduling time for it like I do for my studies. It’s just as important for my well-being.

Consultant: Absolutely! By prioritizing your well-being, you’ll have more energy and focus for your studies too. How do you feel about keeping us updated on this balance in our future sessions?

User: I’d love that! It would help me stay accountable and reflect on my journey.

Consultant: Perfect! I look forward to hearing about your experiences and progress. Remember, persistently nurturing your interests can empower you to navigate both family expectations and personal desires better.

User: Thank you! This has been really helpful. I feel more confident about my plans moving forward.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Zhang! Keep trusting yourself as you work through this. You're on a positive path, and it's okay to communicate your needs. 

User: I will! Thank you for guiding me today. I feel a lot more equipped to handle this situation now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m here to support you anytime. Keep nurturing that confidence and creativity. Looking forward to our next session!

User: Me too! Thank you again, and see you next time!

Consultant: Take care, Zhang. See you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! It’s great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really confident lately, especially after receiving the scholarship. It’s given me a boost, and I feel I can balance my studies and personal life better.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like the scholarship has really empowered you. Can you share more about how your life and studies have changed since then?

User: Sure! I've started to organize my time more effectively. I allocate specific hours for studying and also make time for relaxation and hobbies. It feels good to have that balance.

Consultant: It sounds like you've developed some solid time management skills! What hobbies have you found you enjoy during your downtime?

User: I've been getting into painting more. It relaxes me and allows me to express myself creatively. I feel more at ease after a painting session.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Zhang! Engaging in creative pursuits can indeed be very therapeutic. As you continue to build on your confidence and manage your time well, how do you feel about exploring your future career paths?

User: I want to explore how psychology and philosophy intersect. I believe understanding both can help me develop a better perspective on life and teach others.

Consultant: That’s an interesting direction! Exploring the connection between psychology and philosophy can deepen your insight. How do you envision applying this exploration in your studies or future career?

User: I think I want to integrate psychological principles into teaching philosophy. I aim to help students not only understand concepts but also apply them to their lives.

Consultant: That's a meaningful goal! Helping students connect their learning to real-life applications can significantly impact them. What steps could you take to explore this intersection further?

User: I could start by looking for courses or workshops that focus on both fields. It would also be great to talk to professors who specialize in these areas for guidance.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Seeking out courses and engaging with professors can provide you with valuable insights and mentorship. How do you feel about taking those steps?

User: I feel motivated! I think getting more information will help me make informed decisions about my future.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that enthusiasm! As you pursue these opportunities, how do you plan to ensure you manage the potential stress that may come with them?

User: I want to keep prioritizing self-care—like painting, spending time with friends, and possibly practicing mindfulness. I think these will help me stay grounded.

Consultant: Those self-care strategies are essential for maintaining your well-being. Have you ever tried any specific mindfulness techniques, or are you considering starting something new?

User: I’ve read about mindfulness meditation but haven’t tried it yet. It seems beneficial, though. I’d like to explore that.

Consultant: Mindfulness meditation can be a powerful tool for managing stress and enhancing focus. Would you like to set a goal for how you might incorporate it into your routine?

User: Yes! I could start with just a few minutes each day. Maybe doing it in the morning would set a positive tone for my day.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Starting small can make it more sustainable. How confident do you feel about committing to this new practice?

User: I feel quite confident! I think with my current motivation, I’ll be able to stick to it.

Consultant: That’s excellent to hear! As you integrate this mindfulness practice, how will you evaluate its impact on your stress and overall well-being over time?

User: I could keep a journal to track my feelings before and after meditating. It would help me see any changes in my mood or stress levels.

Consultant: Keeping a journal is a great approach! It can provide valuable insights into your emotional patterns. Is there anything specific you hope to notice as you reflect on your journey?

User: I want to recognize any shifts in how I handle stress, especially with my upcoming exams and projects. I'd like to be more resilient.

Consultant: Building resilience is a wonderful goal. As you focus on that, how do you feel about the support system you have around you, like friends and family? 

User: They have been really supportive! My friends encourage me to pursue my goals, and my family is understanding of my need for independence, which helps.

Consultant: That’s reassuring to hear! Having a supportive network can make a significant difference. How do you plan to maintain or even strengthen those connections as you pursue your goals?

User: I’ll make an effort to communicate regularly, maybe set up study sessions with friends and share my thoughts with my family about my plans. It’s nice to keep them involved.

Consultant: Engaging with your network actively is a great way to nurture those relationships. As we approach the end of today’s session, let’s summarize what you’ve learned about yourself and your plans moving forward.

User: I’ve realized the importance of maintaining balance between my studies and personal life while also being proactive about my mental health. I feel optimistic about my path ahead!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway! It sounds like you’re in a great position to embrace the journey ahead. Remember, it’s okay to seek help when needed, and you’ve developed valuable tools for your growth. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance. I’ll work on my plans and keep you updated on my progress.

Consultant: I look forward to hearing about your progress, Zhang! You're doing an amazing job. Until next time, take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need support.

User: Thank you! I will. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good, actually. I made my decision about my future studies, and my parents have been supportive, which makes me feel more confident.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve taken some significant steps forward. Can you tell me more about how you’ve been balancing your academic life with your personal life?

User: Sure! I’ve been trying to manage my time better. I set aside specific hours for studying and also make sure to have time for myself, like reading or going out with friends.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy approach! It’s important to maintain that balance. How does this improved time management impact your overall feelings towards studying and preparing for your exams?

User: I feel much less overwhelmed. Knowing that I have a plan makes me feel more in control, so I don’t stress out as much.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Zhang. It seems like having a structured plan helps alleviate your anxiety. In our last session, we talked about maintaining emotional stability. How are you managing your feelings in light of this recent clarity you have?

User: I’ve been more aware of my feelings and tend to check in with myself regularly. When I start to feel stressed, I remind myself of the progress I’ve made and that it’s okay to take breaks.

Consultant: It’s excellent that you’re checking in with yourself! Acknowledging your achievements is vital. Are there any particular moments when you feel your confidence waver? 

User: Sometimes, when I see others working harder or longer, I question if I’m doing enough. I worry that I might not meet expectations.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to have those moments of doubt, especially in a competitive environment. Can you remind yourself of the reasons why you've chosen your path? How do those reasons align with your personal aspirations?

User: I chose my field because I genuinely enjoy it. Whenever I focus on that, I feel motivated again. I just need to remind myself that everyone has their own pace.

Consultant: That’s a valuable perspective, Zhang. Everyone’s journey is unique, and it’s great that you recognize what brings you motivation. Have you considered any strategies for when you experience those feelings of doubt in the future?

User: I think I could talk to friends or even just write down my thoughts. That usually helps clear my mind and gives me a different perspective.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Talking it out and journaling can offer new insights and reduce feelings of overwhelm. During times of stress, identifying and utilizing your personal support systems can be so beneficial. 

User: Yes, I’ll definitely start incorporating those strategies more.

Consultant: As we look ahead, let’s also think about how you can maintain this positive state. What kind of practices do you think you could adopt to ensure you continue feeling grounded and oriented towards your goals?

User: I want to keep some of my routines consistent, like my study schedule and social activities. I also think reflecting on my progress regularly can help me stay motivated.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach! Consistency will help reinforce your confidence. How about specific moments you’d like to celebrate—those small wins along the way? 

User: I guess I could create a little checklist and reward myself for completing sections of my study plan or even just for sticking to my schedule for the week.

Consultant: A checklist and small rewards can be incredibly motivating! Celebrating your accomplishments reinforces positive behavior. How does that idea resonate with you?

User: It sounds great! I think it will make the process more enjoyable rather than just feeling like a chore.

Consultant: Absolutely! Enjoying the journey is just as important as achieving the end result. Lastly, as this session comes to a close, what do you feel has been the most beneficial aspect of our conversations, and how can you carry that forward?

User: I think recognizing my challenges and having strategies validated has been really helpful. I feel equipped to handle what comes next.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that, Zhang! You’ve made remarkable progress, and I have no doubt you will continue on this positive path. If you find yourself needing support in the future, remember you have the strategies and resources to reach out.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance through this process. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It has been a pleasure working with you. Wishing you all the best in your studies; take care!
