Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you today. I want to hear about what's been on your mind lately. How have you been feeling?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really anxious and sad. I can't pinpoint exactly why, but it seems to be getting worse since I watched those scary videos during summer break. I'm afraid to be alone, even when I take a shower or sleep.

Consultant: It sounds like those videos left a significant impact on you, causing some persistent anxiety. Can you tell me more about the feelings you experience when you’re alone or during those times?

User: When I'm alone, I feel this overwhelming fear that something bad might happen. It makes me really uncomfortable, and I can't relax at all. Even during the day, I'm often anxious, especially after I had a bad grade in English.

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like your feelings of anxiety are quite persistent, especially after that English test. How does it feel specifically when you think about your English grade?

User: It makes me feel like I'm not good enough. I start worrying about my future, and then I feel even more anxious. It's like a cycle I can’t escape from.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling stuck in that cycle of anxiety and self-doubt. Can we explore this a bit further? What specific thoughts run through your mind when you think about not being good enough?

User: I often think that if I don’t do well, everyone will be disappointed in me. I also worry that I won’t be able to keep up with my classmates, and what if I fail?

Consultant: That must feel really heavy, fearing disappointment and failure. It seems you are placing a lot of pressure on yourself. Is there any evidence that supports these thoughts, or could there be another way to look at the situation?

User: Well, I guess I don’t really know if everyone would actually be disappointed. My parents always say that trying your best is what matters, but in my head, I keep thinking I need to be perfect.

Consultant: It's great that your parents are supportive, but it sounds like your mind is pushing you towards perfectionism. Let’s take a moment to challenge that thought. If a friend were in your position, how would you advise them to view their performance and feelings?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to make mistakes, and that no one is perfect. They should just do their best and not worry too much.

Consultant: Exactly! You have a really compassionate perspective when it comes to others. Now, let’s try to apply that same kindness to yourself. How can you remind yourself that it’s okay to make mistakes?

User: I could maybe write down positive affirmations or remind myself that I'm still learning and growing. I want to believe that it's okay to not be perfect.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea, Liu! Writing down positive affirmations can help reinforce a kinder self-talk. Let's think of a few affirmations you could use. What would you want to tell yourself each day?

User: Maybe something like "I am enough as I am" or "It’s okay to make mistakes, I’m still learning."

Consultant: Those are powerful affirmations! Let’s practice using those whenever you feel anxious or overwhelmed. Now, let’s talk about some coping strategies. Can we explore some activities that might help you feel more relaxed?

User: I guess I could try listening to music or drawing. I used to enjoy that.

Consultant: Music and drawing can be wonderful outlets for expressing your emotions! How about we set a goal for you to engage in these activities regularly? Maybe start with a few moments each day to unwind with music or drawing.

User: That sounds good! I think I could get back into drawing, especially when I feel anxious.

Consultant: Perfect! Establishing a routine with drawing can create a sense of calm and creativity. How about we also work on some breathing techniques to help you in those anxious moments?

User: That would be helpful. I’ve heard about deep breathing but never really tried it.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be very effective. Let’s practice together. Take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four, hold it for four seconds, and then breathe out slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Want to give it a try together?

User: Sure, I’ll try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s go ahead and do it a few times. Inhale… hold… and exhale… How does it feel to focus on your breathing?

User: It feels calming. I like that I can focus only on breathing for a moment.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Focusing on your breath can create a little oasis of calm. How do you think you can incorporate this into your daily routine?

User: I could practice it before I go to bed or when I feel anxious. I think it will help me relax.

Consultant: Absolutely! Using it at night or during anxious moments can help you regain control. It seems like you're finding effective strategies to manage your anxiety. As we’re nearing the end of our session, let’s reflect a bit. What are your biggest takeaways from our conversation today?

User: I’ve realized that I can be kinder to myself and that it’s okay to make mistakes. I also have a plan for coping with my anxiety that I didn’t have before.

Consultant: That’s a huge step forward! It sounds like you've gained insights into how to manage your feelings better. Remember that it’s a journey, and that you're already taking important strides. If you encounter anxious feelings in the future, what strategies will you use?

User: I’ll remind myself that I am enough and that mistakes are a part of learning. I’ll also remember to use breathing techniques and spend time drawing or listening to music.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies, Liu! Your awareness of your feelings and the tools you now have will help you in the future. I'm proud of the progress you've made today. Remember, it’s okay to reach out for help whenever you need it.

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful and ready to face my anxiety now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to hear that. Today was a meaningful session, and I look forward to seeing how you continue to grow. Take care of yourself, and we’ll talk again soon!

Consultant: Hello, Liu Qiupeng! I'm glad you’re here today. I want to talk about what’s been on your mind lately. How have you been feeling since we last met?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really anxious, especially about the upcoming sports day at school. I couldn't sleep at all the night before because I was worried I wouldn’t do well. 

Consultant: I hear that you’re feeling a lot of pressure about your performance, which makes it hard to relax. It’s completely normal to feel this way in group activities. Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you about the sports day?

User: I’m just afraid of letting my team down. I think everyone is counting on me, and what if I mess up? 

Consultant: It sounds like you carry a heavy responsibility for the team's success. Let’s explore that a bit. What thoughts go through your head when you think about possibly disappointing your teammates?

User: I think they’ll be really disappointed in me, and I’ll feel like I’m not good enough to be on the team. 

Consultant: It seems like those thoughts make you feel inadequate and anxious. Can we take a moment to challenge that idea? What evidence do you have that you will actually disappoint them? 

User: I don’t know... I just feel it. 

Consultant: Feelings can be strong, but they aren't always based on facts. If you consider your past performances, have you let your team down before?

User: No, I usually do okay, but this time feels different. 

Consultant: I understand why it feels different this time. New situations can heighten our fears. How might you talk to yourself differently before the event to reduce that anxiety?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that I’ve done well in the past and that it's okay to not be perfect.

Consultant: That's a great start! Affirming your past successes can be very helpful. How about we practice that? What would you say to yourself in a moment of self-doubt during the sports day?

User: I could say, “You've trained for this and you’re good at it, just do your best!”

Consultant: Excellent! That sounds like a compassionate and realistic thought to help counter those anxious feelings. How do you feel right now when you think about using that phrase?

User: I feel a bit better. It seems more encouraging! 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Building a supportive inner dialogue is crucial. Now, let’s work on connecting your thoughts with your emotions. When you think about sports day, what emotions come up for you?

User: Mostly anxiety and fear about performing badly. 

Consultant: And when you think about doing your best, how does that change your emotions?

User: It makes me feel a bit more confident and less worried. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful shift! Now, let's think about practical steps. What could you do on the day of the event to manage those feelings in the moment?

User: I could take deep breaths and remind myself of what we practiced. Maybe even visualize a successful performance. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Visualization can be very powerful. If you start feeling overwhelmed during the event, how can you implement deep breathing?

User: I guess I could step aside for a moment, close my eyes, and take a few deep breaths to calm myself down.

Consultant: Absolutely! Giving yourself that space is important. It allows you to reset. Now that we've identified some strategies, what do you think is your biggest takeaway from our conversation today?

User: I think it's important for me to challenge my fearful thoughts and have a more positive self-talk. 

Consultant: Yes, and recognizing that you’re capable is a wonderful step towards building confidence. As we wrap up today, what will you do to prepare mentally for sports day?

User: I’ll keep practicing my positive affirmations and remember that I just need to do my best. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic approach! I'm really proud of you for taking these steps. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. If you face setbacks, don’t hesitate to reach out again. You’ve got this!

User: Thank you! I feel more prepared now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Liu Qiupeng! Believe in yourself, and I look forward to hearing how things go at the sports day.

Consultant: Hello, Liu Qiu Peng! I'm glad you're here today. How are you feeling about your project leadership role, and would you like to share your recent thoughts or experiences?

User: Hi. I'm feeling a bit excited about being the project leader, but also really nervous. It's a big responsibility, and I don't want to let my group down. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed and anxious about it.

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel a mix of excitement and nervousness when taking on such a responsibility. It sounds like you care a lot about doing well for your group. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel overwhelmed or anxious during this time?

User: Well, I think about all the things I have to manage, like gathering everyone's ideas and making sure we stay on track. What if I forget something important or if my teammates don't like my ideas? 

Consultant: Those concerns make sense, especially considering that you want to make sure everything goes smoothly for your group. Let's break it down a bit. What thoughts come to your mind when you think that your teammates might not like your ideas?

User: I start feeling like I'm not good enough or that I might fail. It makes me really anxious just thinking about it.

Consultant: I hear you, Liu. It can be tough when those thoughts start to take over. Would you say that this fear of not being good enough is something you've experienced before, or is it related only to this project?

User: I think it's a bit of both. I felt this way in the past, especially during tests or when I had to present something. I worry that I won't meet expectations. 

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It's important to acknowledge those feelings. Let's work together to identify some alternative thoughts that could help you feel more confident. For instance, can you think of a time when you did something well, despite feeling nervous?

User: Yeah, last semester I did well on a science presentation. I was very nervous, but it turned out okay.  

Consultant: That's a great example! You were able to do well despite your nerves. What do you think contributed to that success? How did it feel afterward?

User: I felt proud of myself for overcoming my fears and doing a good job. It was really nice to hear my classmates say I did well.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Feeling proud and receiving positive feedback can be powerful motivators. As you lead this project, what if you remind yourself of that success? How could you apply what you learned from your science presentation to manage your current responsibilities?

User: Maybe I could break down the project into smaller tasks, just like how I prepared for the presentation step by step. That might make it less overwhelming.

Consultant: Absolutely! Breaking it down into smaller tasks can help make everything feel more manageable and less intimidating. Would you like to outline some of those tasks together to help you get started?

User: Yes, I would like that! I think starting with gathering ideas from everyone would be the first step.

Consultant: Great! Involving your teammates right away can also help you feel more supported. What do you think the next task could be after gathering their ideas?

User: I guess after that, we would need to organize those ideas and decide how to put them together for the project.

Consultant: Exactly! Organizing and collaborating is key. By taking it one step at a time, you're allowing yourself the space to manage your feelings of anxiety. How does that approach feel for you?

User: It feels better knowing I have a plan, but I still worry a little.

Consultant: That’s perfectly okay! It’s normal to have some worries. Remember, you’re building confidence with each step you take. We can also work on some pressure management techniques. Would you like to learn some strategies that can help you cope with those anxious feelings?

User: Yes, I think that could really help!

Consultant: One effective strategy is to practice deep breathing when you start to feel anxious. It can help calm your mind and bring your focus back. Would you like to try a few breathing exercises together now?

User: Sure, I’d like to try that!

Consultant: Okay, let’s take a deep breath in—hold it for a moment—and now slowly exhale. Let’s do that a couple of times and notice how it feels. How was that for you?

User: I feel a bit more relaxed. It’s nice to take a moment to breathe.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, you can use this technique anytime you feel overwhelmed. As you continue with your project, how do you think your feelings about leading your team might change with these new strategies?

User: I think I might feel less scared and more in control if I keep practicing these techniques and stay organized.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic insight, Liu. Feeling more in control can lead to greater confidence. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what you’ve accomplished in our sessions. What skills or strategies do you feel you can rely on moving forward?

User: I can break the project down into smaller tasks, involve my teammates, and use breathing exercises when I feel anxious. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent summary! I believe these strategies will serve you well in your project and beyond. For our next session, we can discuss how you applied these skills and what you might want to focus on next. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I feel more prepared already. 

Consultant: I’m so pleased to hear that, Liu. You’ve made wonderful progress today, and I look forward to hearing all about it next time. Remember, you can always reach out if you need more support. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Liu! Take care and have a great day. Looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello Liu! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling much more confident lately. I did a presentation in class and received a lot of positive feedback from my classmates and teacher!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like the presentation went really well. How did it feel to receive that recognition?

User: It felt amazing! I wasn’t so anxious like before; I actually enjoyed it. But there are still times when I can feel a bit of anxiety creeping back in.

Consultant: I understand. It's great that you've experienced such progress, but it's also normal to have some lingering anxiety. Can you tell me about any specific moments when you felt that anxiety returning?

User: Sometimes when I think about being alone at home or when I'm about to sleep, I feel a little scared again, especially after watching those scary videos.

Consultant: That makes sense. It sounds like those previous experiences are still affecting you. When those anxious thoughts come up, what do you usually think about or feel in those moments?

User: I feel a knot in my stomach and I think that something bad might happen, like I could be in danger or something. I try to tell myself it’s not real, but it doesn’t always help.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way after those videos. Let's take a moment to challenge those thoughts together. What evidence do you have that something bad will actually happen when you’re home alone or going to sleep?

User: Well, nothing really happens, I know that. It’s just my imagination making things seem worse. 

Consultant: That's a good observation, Liu. It sounds like your imagination is a big part of what fuels that fear. If a friend were feeling this way, what do you think you would tell them?

User: I would probably tell them it's okay and that they don’t have to be scared because nothing is going to happen.

Consultant: Exactly! You have a kind perspective. Now, can you apply that same reassurance to yourself? What would it feel like to give yourself that same advice?

User: I think it would help me feel a bit better. I can remind myself that I'm safe and that it’s just my mind playing tricks on me.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! It seems like you have the ability to recognize those thoughts and challenge them. What else could you do when you feel that anxiety creeping back in?

User: Maybe I can practice some deep breathing or talk to my mom about it when I feel scared. 

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Deep breathing can help calm your body, and talking to your mom can provide support. How often do you think you would like to practice these strategies?

User: I think I should do it every day, especially before bed when I tend to worry the most.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Let’s also come up with some positive affirmations you can say to yourself at night. What’s something positive you could remind yourself of?

User: I could say, "I am safe, and I have the strength to face my fears."

Consultant: That's a powerful affirmation! Saying that to yourself can help reinforce your confidence. How does it feel to have this affirmation in your mind before you sleep?

User: It makes me feel stronger and a little more in control. I like it!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Liu. It’s essential to recognize that you are gaining control over your thoughts and feelings. As we wrap up today, let's reflect on the progress you've made. What strategies from our sessions have felt most effective for you?

User: I think challenging my negative thoughts and using positive affirmations have really helped. 

Consultant: Absolutely! You've made significant strides in not only recognizing your thoughts but also in managing them. How will you continue to practice these strategies moving forward?

User: I’ll keep practicing my breathing and affirmations every day. I want to stay confident, especially while dealing with school and social situations.

Consultant: That’s an excellent commitment, Liu! Remember, it’s all about consistency. I believe in your ability to maintain this positive mindset. If you ever feel overwhelmed, know that you can always reach out for support. 

User: Thank you! I feel more confident that I can handle my anxiety now.

Consultant: You’re doing a fantastic job, Liu. I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Let’s plan to touch base again soon to see how you're continuing to apply these techniques.

User: Sounds good! I’ll definitely keep working on it. 

Consultant: Great! Keep up the good work, and don't hesitate to practice those skills. You're developing a toolkit that will serve you well in the future. Take care, Liu!
###################
Consultant: Hi Qiupeng! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. I was surprised to see that I did well on my first mid-term exam this semester. It made me really happy!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It's great that you feel happy with your progress. How did you manage to focus while studying for your exam this time?

User: I tried to remind myself that I could do it. I thought about how well I did in my last exam and that helped me stay calm. 

Consultant: That's a strong mindset! Reflecting on your past successes can definitely boost your confidence. What else do you think contributed to your positive feelings?

User: I guess I also wrote some nice things in my journal about what I enjoyed during the day. It helped me see the good stuff more clearly.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely practice! Keeping a journal can really highlight the positives in your life. Would you be interested in continuing with journaling to maintain this positive outlook?

User: Yes, I think I’d like that! It feels nice to look for good things every day.

Consultant: Fantastic! It sounds like you're building a great habit. How about we set a goal for your journaling? Maybe you could aim to write down three positive things each day?

User: That sounds doable! I think I can handle that.

Consultant: Excellent! As you write those positive experiences, how do you think this will help with any feelings of anxiety that might come up in the future?

User: I think focusing on the good might distract me from feeling anxious about other stuff. It could remind me that there are still fun things happening.

Consultant: Absolutely! By keeping your focus on positive events, you'll create a much stronger sense of optimism. Have you noticed any situations recently where you felt anxious again?

User: Sometimes I still feel a bit scared, especially when I’m alone at home. It’s not as bad as before, though.

Consultant: It’s perfectly okay to feel that way sometimes. Let’s think together—what strategies can we work on so you might feel more comfortable being alone?

User: Maybe I could play music or watch funny videos to distract myself? 

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Engaging with something enjoyable can really help. Would you like to try doing that whenever you feel anxious alone?

User: Yeah, I’ll try that! I like listening to music.

Consultant: Perfect! Music can be such a great source of comfort. In addition to that, would you be open to practicing some breathing exercises before facing those moments?

User: Sure, I haven’t tried that much. 

Consultant: Great! Breathing exercises can help reduce anxiety. Let’s practice a simple one together now. When you feel anxious, just take a deep breath in for four counts, hold for four, and then breathe out for four. How does that sound?

User: That sounds easy enough! I can do that.

Consultant: Wonderful! This technique can really calm your mind. How do you feel about trying that this week when you’re home alone?

User: I feel good about it! I’ll give it a shot.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! And remember, it’s all about finding what works best for you. What are some other positive activities you could explore this week?

User: I think I might want to draw more. I love drawing!

Consultant: Drawing is a great way to express yourself! That could be another excellent addition to your routine. Maybe you could start by dedicating a little time every day to draw something that makes you happy?

User: Yes, I’d love that! I can draw my favorite characters.

Consultant: That's a beautiful idea! Finding joy in your drawings can further enhance your positive mindset. How do you feel after thinking about all these fun activities?

User: I feel excited! I really like having plans that can help me feel better.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It sounds like you’re on the right path. As we come to the end of our session, would you like to summarize some of your goals for this upcoming week?

User: I want to write three positive things every day, practice breathing exercises, and draw daily. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful goals, Qiupeng! I believe these strategies can support your positive mindset and lessen those occasional feelings of anxiety. Remember, you’re not alone on this journey.

User: Thank you! I appreciate that. It helps to talk about these things.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. Keep embracing your positivity, and remember, I’m here if you need to talk again. 

User: I will! Thanks again, and I’ll see you next time!
