Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today's session. I'm here to support you. Can you share with me how you've been feeling lately, especially regarding relationships?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really anxious, especially when I think about dating. After my last short relationship, I started to feel scared about love, particularly when it comes to intimate topics. I can't seem to shake off this feeling of confusion and guilt.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're carrying a lot of anxiety and confusion about love and intimacy. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel anxious when thinking about a new relationship?

User: There’s this new classmate I like, but I find myself pushing him away because of his height. I keep thinking that maybe I shouldn’t get involved because of this.

Consultant: That sounds tough. So, it seems like you have some feelings for this new classmate, but the height difference is creating hesitation. Can you describe what thoughts run through your mind when you think about dating him?

User: I keep thinking about how others might see us and whether I would be judged. I worry that it wouldn't work out, and I’d end up feeling the same way I did before.

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry about judgment and past experiences influencing how you perceive potential relationships. How do you feel when these thoughts come up? 

User: I feel a mix of fear and guilt. Fear that I won't be able to handle another relationship, and guilt for even being attracted to him when I have these thoughts.

Consultant: Those feelings sound really heavy. It’s important to acknowledge and explore them. What do you think might happen if you allowed yourself to engage with these feelings instead of pushing them away?

User: I guess I’d be more open to the idea of dating again, but it’s hard to imagine not feeling anxious about it. 

Consultant: Absolutely, facing those feelings can be challenging. We can work together on this. Can you identify any specific thoughts that make you feel anxious about dating? 

User: I often think that I’m not good enough or that I’ll mess things up like I did last time.

Consultant: That’s a common concern. Let’s explore the idea of “not being good enough.” What evidence do you have that supports this thought, and is there any evidence that contradicts it?

User: I suppose I don’t have strong evidence. I mean, I did have good moments in my last relationship, even if it was brief. 

Consultant: It sounds like there were positive aspects you can focus on. If a friend came to you with those feelings of “not being good enough,” what advice would you give them?

User: I would probably tell them to look at their strengths and that no relationship is perfect. 

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! You mentioned you had good moments in your last relationship, so it’s clear you have strengths worth recognizing. What if we worked on replacing the thought of “not being good enough” with something more balanced? 

User: That could help, but I still feel scared about repeating past mistakes.

Consultant: Feeling scared about the past is natural. Would you be open to trying small steps that allow you to engage socially without expecting too much from yourself?

User: I think I could handle that. What kind of steps do you mean?

Consultant: Perhaps you could start with simple conversations with your classmate, focusing on getting to know him better without the pressure of dating. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds manageable. I guess talking wouldn’t hurt as much.

Consultant: Exactly! Building a friendship first could alleviate some pressure. Remember, it's okay to take it slow. How do you feel about taking this approach?

User: I feel a bit relieved, like this could work. But I still worry about how he might react.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Often, we can’t predict how others will respond. What if we explored the worst-case scenario? What’s the worst that could happen if things don’t go as you hope?

User: I guess the worst would be feeling embarrassed or rejected. 

Consultant: It’s natural to fear those feelings. However, rejection is a part of life that everyone experiences. Could speaking about it in more neutral terms help lessen its weight for you?

User: Maybe thinking of it as just a part of dating might help me cope better.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Embracing dating as a journey with ups and downs might help reduce the fear. What can you do to remind yourself of this perspective during your interactions?

User: I could write it down somewhere or remind myself before talking to him. 

Consultant: That sounds like a practical plan! Writing it down can reinforce your new perspective. How do you feel about implementing this in your next conversation with him?

User: I think I can do it! I feel more motivated to try now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on your progress. What’s one takeaway from our conversation today?

User: Realizing that it’s okay to go slowly and focusing on the positives rather than the negatives makes a big difference.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve taken some significant steps in recognizing your feelings and thoughts. Remember, it’s a process, and I’m here to support you. If you ever feel overwhelmed, you can always come back to discuss things further.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support, and I’ll definitely keep this in mind. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care of yourself, and I look forward to hearing how your next interaction goes. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello C! Welcome back to our session today. I appreciate you coming in. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a mix of guilt and anxiety. It’s hard for me to approach new friends because I keep thinking about my past friendship and how it fell apart. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're really struggling with those feelings. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that come to mind when you think about that past friendship?

User: I keep feeling responsible for losing contact. I think if I had tried harder, we would still be friends. And now, I feel anxious about opening up to new people because I’m worried the same thing will happen again.

Consultant: I understand that feeling of responsibility can be heavy. Let’s explore that thought a bit more. When you think, “If I had tried harder, we would still be friends,” what emotions does that bring up for you?

User: It makes me feel really guilty and a bit ashamed. I shouldn’t have let it end, but I did. 

Consultant: Guilt and shame can be really tough to carry around. Can you see how this thought might be influencing your behavior with new classmates? 

User: Yes, I’ve noticed I’m really cautious. I tend to hold back when I meet new people because I’m afraid of getting hurt or hurting them.

Consultant: Your caution seems to stem from a place of trying to protect yourself. But it sounds like this is also preventing you from forming new connections. What would it look like for you to approach these new relationships differently?

User: I guess I’d like to feel more open and less worried. But it's just so hard to shake off the fear.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Fear can be a strong barrier. If you had a friend in a similar situation, what advice might you give them?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay to try again and that not every relationship ends badly. I guess I just don’t take my own advice. 

Consultant: That’s a very insightful realization. Let’s think about how you can apply that advice to yourself. What if you allowed yourself to approach new relationships with the belief that not every experience will end in loss?

User: I suppose I could try that, but it feels risky. 

Consultant: It’s definitely a risk, but sometimes risks can lead to rewarding experiences. Could we brainstorm some small steps you could take to slowly open up to others?

User: Maybe I could start with casual conversations in class or during lunch? Just light topics to ease into it.

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! Engaging in light conversations could help reduce anxiety and build confidence. How do you think you might feel after trying that?

User: I think I’d feel more relaxed talking to them. But I still worry about getting too close too fast.

Consultant: It’s okay to want to take your time. We can set a pace that feels comfortable for you. What’s one thing you could do to ensure you maintain that comfort level as you interact with them?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to keep things light and that I don’t have to rush into deeper conversations right away.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a healthy approach. It’s about taking small steps at your comfort level. How does thinking about this make you feel?

User: It makes me feel a little relieved and more in control. 

Consultant: That’s a positive response! What do you think might happen if you start applying this mindset in your interactions with new classmates?

User: I could probably enjoy myself more without the overwhelming fear. It might make things feel a bit easier.

Consultant: Yes, that ease can lead to more fulfilling connections. Can we talk about how to handle any feelings of guilt that come up during this process?

User: Sure. I think I just need to remind myself that not everything is my fault. It’s normal for friendships to change. 

Consultant: Exactly, relationships can ebb and flow. If those feelings of guilt pop up, how would you like to challenge them? 

User: I could say to myself that guilt isn’t helping me and that it’s okay to forgive myself for the past.

Consultant: That’s a powerful strategy. By acknowledging your guilt but choosing to forgive yourself, you’re taking a significant step towards emotional growth. 

User: Yes! I like that. It doesn't mean I forget but that I can let go a little.

Consultant: Precisely! It’s about learning to move forward while accepting what has happened. How are you feeling about sharing these thoughts with me today?

User: I feel lighter! Discussing my thoughts helps a lot, even if I still feel some anxiety.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling lighter. Remember that it’s okay to experience some anxiety—it’s a part of the process. What do you think your next steps should be after today’s session?

User: I’ll focus on those small conversations and work on forgiving myself when guilt creeps in. 

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! As you take these steps, consider keeping a journal to capture your experiences and feelings. This might help you process things more clearly.

User: That’s a good idea! I’ll give it a try. 

Consultant: Fantastic! Before we wrap up, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from today’s session?

User: I learned that I can take things slow and that it’s okay to forgive myself for past mistakes.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. I’m proud of you for acknowledging that! Remember, you’re capable of building new connections and taking care of yourself along the way. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're welcome, C! I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care and good luck!

Consultant: Hello, it's great to have you here today. How have you been feeling lately about social situations?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious, especially since the recent school social event. I felt like I couldn't connect with anyone and that made my fear of relationships even worse.

Consultant: I can see how that would be really challenging for you. You feel like you're having a hard time engaging with others, which is increasing your anxiety about relationships. What specific thoughts or feelings came up for you during that social event?

User: During the event, I felt so out of place. I thought everyone was judging me, and it made me really nervous to talk to anyone. I just kept thinking that I wouldn't fit in.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts about being judged were quite overwhelming for you. Can you share what feelings came alongside those thoughts?

User: I felt a mix of embarrassment and wanting to hide. It was as if I was trapped in my own mind, and I just wanted to escape the situation.

Consultant: That must have been tough. So in that moment, your anxiety and those negative thoughts made you wish to retreat rather than engage. Let’s dive a bit deeper—when you think, “I won’t fit in,” what does that make you feel?

User: It makes me feel hopeless, like there's no point in trying to connect with anyone. I just feel defeated.

Consultant: Feeling hopeless can be really heavy to carry. What if we looked at that thought more closely? Is there any evidence that supports or contradicts the idea that you won't fit in?

User: Well, sometimes I do have moments where I can connect with my friends, so I guess that does contradict it. But it's hard not to focus on the negative.

Consultant: It's understandable that the negatives can feel so much louder. If you had a friend who expressed similar feelings about fitting in, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that they have strengths and that not fitting in doesn't mean they're not worth knowing.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective! You recognize their value despite their worries. How might you apply that same kindness to yourself in social situations?

User: I suppose I could try to remind myself that I have my own strengths, too, and that not everyone has to like me.

Consultant: That's a wonderful insight! Embracing your strengths can help reduce anxiety. Let's think about some practical steps you could take in a social situation. What’s one small action you could try the next time you feel anxious?

User: Maybe I could start by just saying hi to one person instead of trying to talk to everyone at once.

Consultant: That sounds like a manageable step! Starting small can build your confidence over time. How do you feel about trying that?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful about it. It feels less intimidating to just focus on one person.

Consultant: That's great to hear! Focusing on one conversation can make the situation feel less overwhelming. Do you have any relaxation techniques you can use before this kind of social event to help with your anxiety?

User: I’ve heard about breathing exercises, but I’ve never really tried them before.

Consultant: Breathing exercises can be very effective! They help calm your mind and body. Would you like to try a simple technique together now?

User: Sure! That sounds good.

Consultant: Let’s do this: take a deep breath in through your nose for four counts, hold for four counts, and exhale slowly through your mouth for six counts. Let’s try it a few times together.

User: (follows the breathing exercise) That feels nice and calming.

Consultant: I'm glad you found it calming! Incorporating breathing exercises before social events could help ease your anxiety. How do you feel about adding that into your routine?

User: I think I'll definitely try it. It’s nice to have that tool to help me relax.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s all about finding what works for you. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on your progress. What do you feel has been your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I think realizing that my feelings don't have to dictate my actions is a big step. It’s about challenging those thoughts and trying new approaches.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight! You’re discovering ways to challenge negative thoughts and create a more positive narrative for yourself. 

User: Yes, I feel more empowered now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Remember, it's all about taking small steps and being kind to yourself. If you ever feel overwhelmed, you can come back for more support. How do you feel about our progress today?

User: I feel really good about it. I’m looking forward to practicing what we've discussed.

Consultant: Wonderful! I'm proud of you for being proactive about your feelings. Keep applying what you've learned, and we'll touch base again soon. Take care, and remember to be gentle with yourself. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your support.

Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit lighter, especially after trying out some relaxing music during my breaks. It's helped me to not think about things so much. But I still feel anxious when I think about dating.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that the music has brought some relief! It sounds like you're making progress. Can you describe a bit more about your feelings regarding dating? What specifically makes you anxious?

User: Well, ever since my last short relationship, I get really nervous thinking about dating again. The thought of being intimate or even just asking someone out feels overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It’s completely understandable to feel that way after a difficult experience. How do you think your recent relaxation techniques could help you when those anxious thoughts come up?

User: I think they might help if I can remember to use them. Sometimes, I just get caught up in the anxiety and forget to take a step back.

Consultant: It’s common to feel that way. Let's work together to create a plan for when those anxious thoughts arise. Would you be open to trying some breathing exercises or meditation techniques today?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I think they could help me calm down.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start with a simple breathing exercise. You can close your eyes if you’d like. I’ll guide you through it. Breathe in deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold it for four, and then exhale through your mouth for a count of four. How does that feel?

User: That feels nice. I like focusing on my breath. It distracts me from the anxiety.

Consultant: I’m happy to hear that. Focusing on your breath can really help shift your attention. As we continue, how do you feel about incorporating this exercise whenever you start feeling anxious about dating or social situations?

User: I think that sounds like a good idea. If I can just pause and breathe before I spiral into anxious thoughts, it might help.

Consultant: Absolutely, taking those pauses can significantly change how you respond to stress. Now, let's think about a recent situation where you felt anxious. What thoughts were you having at that moment?

User: I remember a day when a friend asked me to join her for a social event. My mind immediately went to, "What if I embarrass myself?" or "What if no one talks to me?"

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. Let’s examine them a bit more closely. What evidence do you have that you would embarrass yourself or that others wouldn't engage with you?

User: I guess I don't really have any solid evidence. It’s just this fear that creeps in.

Consultant: That insight is important! It shows that your anxious thoughts may be more about your feelings than actual evidence. How would you feel if you challenged those thoughts with a more positive perspective?

User: It’s hard, but maybe I could tell myself that it’s okay to be nervous and that it doesn’t mean I’ll embarrass myself. 

Consultant: Exactly! Replacing negative thoughts with more realistic ones can be powerful. How about we practice formulating a positive statement for when you feel that anxiety rising?

User: Okay, maybe something like, "I can be myself, and it’s okay to feel nervous."

Consultant: That’s a great affirmation! Whenever you find those anxious thoughts creeping in, you can remind yourself of this. What else do you think might help you feel supported in social situations?

User: Talking to friends about my feelings could help. I think they would understand.

Consultant: Absolutely, leaning on your friends can be very supportive. You’re already creating a network to help you through challenging times. How would you feel about planning a small get-together with friends to practice these social skills?

User: That sounds nice. I could see how it goes without too much pressure.

Consultant: Perfect! It’s all about taking small steps. How do you feel about your feelings toward dating after our conversation today?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I see that I can manage my anxiety with some techniques and support.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s a process, and giving yourself permission to take things one step at a time is key. What are some takeaways from today that you’d like to carry into the future?

User: I want to keep using the breathing techniques and challenge my negative thoughts. Also, leaning on my friends more sounds helpful.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Before we wrap up today, what do you feel you still need to explore regarding your fears about dating or relationships?

User: I think I just need to remember that it’s okay to feel scared and that I’m not alone in this.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s very normal to feel that way, and you’ve already taken significant steps to address those fears. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time we meet. 

User: Thank you. I’m feeling more equipped to handle things now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been great working with you today. Remember, you have the tools and support you need. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you again today. It sounds like you've made some progress since we last spoke. Can you share how you're feeling right now regarding your past experiences with love?

User: Hi! Yes, I’ve been feeling a little lighter since talking to my friends about my feelings. I realize now that I was holding onto a lot of fear and anxiety regarding relationships. 

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like you've found some relief by sharing your feelings. What specific fears or anxieties do you still feel, if any, when it comes to relationships?

User: I still feel a bit anxious when I think about dating. The thought of getting close to someone makes me nervous, especially when it comes to physical intimacy. 

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those feelings, especially given your past experiences. Let’s explore that anxiety a bit more—when you think about dating, what specific thoughts come to your mind?

User: I often think that if I get too close to someone, it might end badly, just like my last relationship. I worry about being hurt again.

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like you're worried about the potential for pain. Let’s challenge that thought a bit—how true is it that all relationships will have the same outcome as your past one? 

User: I guess it's not really fair to assume that. My last experience was brief, and I haven’t given others a chance because I’m so focused on that fear.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! What would you say to a friend if they were in your position, feeling hesitant to pursue new relationships because of past experiences?

User: I would probably tell them that every situation is different and that they should give new people a chance without worrying too much about the past.

Consultant: Exactly! It's important to remind ourselves that each relationship is unique. How can we help you apply that same advice to your own situation? 

User: Maybe I should try to think of dating as an opportunity to learn about others instead of just fearing what might happen.

Consultant: That’s an excellent perspective! It’s all about discovering connections rather than focusing on outcomes. What steps do you think you could take to start approaching dating in this way?

User: I suppose I could try talking to people more casually first, without the pressure of dating. Just getting to know someone could help ease my fears.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Building a friendship might help create a safer emotional space. How does that idea feel to you?

User: It feels good. It takes the pressure off and makes it seem less scary.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s think about how you can initiate those casual conversations. What activities or groups are you involved in where you could meet new people?

User: I’m part of the art club at school, so I could try to connect with members there during our meetings.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Engaging in shared interests can naturally ease the pressure. What if you thought of a few open-ended questions to ask your peers to start conversations?

User: Yes, maybe I could ask them about their favorite art styles or what inspires them. That could lead to more discussion.

Consultant: Definitely! Open-ended questions can help create engaging dialogue and build rapport. How would you feel about setting a goal to initiate a conversation this week?

User: I feel motivated! I’ll aim to chat with at least one person during our next club meeting.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful goal! Remember, it's okay to take your time. How do you think you'll feel after taking that step?

User: Honestly, I think I'd feel proud of myself. Just taking that step feels like progress.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Celebrating small achievements can reinforce positive feelings. Are there any skills or strategies we could work on today to help you feel even more prepared for that conversation?

User: Maybe practicing what I’d like to say could help? I get nervous when talking to new people, so rehearsal might ease my anxiety.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s role-play a conversation. I can act as someone from your art club. Ready to give it a try?

User: Yes, let’s do it!

Consultant: Great! Imagine I’m a fellow club member. Hi there! I noticed your artwork in the last exhibition; it’s really captivating! What inspires your creations?

User: Oh! Thanks! I draw a lot from nature and my emotions. What about you?

Consultant: I love that! Nature has such a calming influence. I often find inspiration in music. What kind of music do you listen to while you create?

User: I usually listen to instrumental music. It helps me focus.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! It seems like we have a lot in common. What have you worked on recently that you’re excited about?

User: I’ve been experimenting with watercolor; it’s enjoyable but challenging!

Consultant: That's fantastic! It sounds like a rewarding process. How did you get into using watercolors?

User: I took a workshop last summer, and it really sparked my interest. 

Consultant: It’s great that you had that opportunity! You did well in that conversation! How did it feel to practice?

User: It felt really nice and less intimidating than I thought it would be. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, with each interaction, you're building your confidence. As we wrap up today, what have you learned about addressing your fears around dating and relationships?

User: I’ve realized that it’s okay to take things slow and that I can learn a lot from simply getting to know someone without the pressure.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a significant breakthrough. Keep building that support network and exploring these conversations. Remember, it's perfectly fine to seek help whenever needed. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session! 

User: Thank you! I’m excited to share my progress next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty good, actually. I’ve been enjoying my time with friends and participating in some activities. I feel more comfortable around my classmates than I did before.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear that you’re engaging with your peers and finding comfort in those interactions. What specific activities have you been involved in lately?

User: I joined a school club and went to a couple of group study sessions. It really helped me bond with others. I feel like I'm part of something.

Consultant: Joining a school club and participating in study sessions can be so enriching! It seems like you’re creating connections and feeling more included. How does this newfound acceptance within your peer group influence your feelings about relationships?

User: It’s actually helping me a lot. I’m not as scared about relationships as I used to be. I used to freeze up when I thought about dating, but now it feels less daunting.

Consultant: That's a significant shift! Can you describe what caused this change in perspective for you? What do you think is helping you feel less anxious about dating?

User: I guess it’s just being around friends and realizing that dating doesn’t have to be so serious or scary. I’m opening up more to the idea of it, rather than stressing over every little detail.

Consultant: It sounds like your friends have been a supportive influence, helping you see dating in a more relaxed light. What do you think you might do next when it comes to exploring potential relationships?

User: I’ve been thinking about just being more open to meeting new people and seeing where things go, rather than forcing anything. It feels nice to let things flow.

Consultant: That’s a healthy approach! Letting things flow can often lead to more genuine connections. Are there any specific scenarios you envision where you might apply this mindset?

User: Maybe when I go to social events or hang out in casual group settings. I think I wouldn’t be so focused on impressing someone, but just enjoying the moment.

Consultant: Enjoying the moment sounds like a great strategy! Allowing yourself to just be present can relieve a lot of pressure. Have you thought about any challenges you might face as you navigate this new perspective?

User: I worry about reverting to my old habits, like overthinking or feeling anxious. Sometimes I doubt whether I can handle a relationship if it comes my way.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to have those concerns. What if we explored some techniques together that could help you manage any anxious feelings that might arise in those situations?

User: That sounds good. I’d like to learn some strategies to keep that anxiety at bay.

Consultant: Great! We can focus on identifying and challenging those anxious thoughts when they come up. What are some specific thoughts that might pop into your head when you feel anxious about dating?

User: I usually think things like, "What if they don’t like me?" or "What if I mess things up?" 

Consultant: Those thoughts are common! Let’s challenge them. Can we explore the evidence that supports these thoughts? What might be another way to view these situations that could reduce your anxiety?

User: I suppose I could remind myself that everyone has their insecurities and that it’s okay to be myself. I shouldn’t expect perfection.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a positive reframe. It’s a reminder of our shared humanity. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably tell them to relax, be themselves, and that it’s all about having fun and learning rather than putting pressure on themselves.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate and supportive perspective! Would you be willing to apply that same advice to yourself moving forward?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. It will take some practice, but I’m willing to try.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that! Practicing self-compassion is key. As we wrap up today, let’s talk about your progress. What have been your biggest takeaways during our sessions together?

User: I think I’ve learned that it’s okay to feel anxious but also to not let it control me. I can choose how I want to approach relationships.

Consultant: That's a valuable lesson! You’ve made remarkable progress in your mindset. Before we conclude our sessions, what strategies do you plan to implement if anxiety arises in the future?

User: I plan to remind myself of what we discussed today—about having fun, being myself, and leaning on my friends for support.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Remember, it’s a journey, and you have the tools to navigate it. This is our last session, so I want to acknowledge the strides you've made. You’ve done wonderfully and can manage your emotions moving forward.

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate all your help. I feel more confident now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! If you ever feel the need for support in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. Wishing you all the best in your journey ahead!
