Consultant: Hi, Xiaolu! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’m feeling even more anxious. I’m studying for the TOEFL, but I just can’t seem to focus. Also, I feel overwhelmed thinking about going abroad with no support from my family. It’s really getting to me.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It seems like you're dealing with a lot of pressure from both your studies and the uncertainty of your future. Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing in terms of anxiety?

User: I feel like I'm constantly doubting myself. Not only about my ability to pass the TOEFL, but also if I can actually manage studying abroad alone. It just makes me feel so small and incapable.

Consultant: I understand how overwhelming that can feel. You're grappling with self-doubt, and that’s completely normal in a challenging situation like this. What thoughts come to your mind when you think about studying abroad?

User: I keep thinking that I won’t manage everything by myself, that I’ll fail. I worry about not being able to adapt to a new environment. 

Consultant: Those thoughts are concerning, and they can certainly contribute to feelings of anxiety. Let’s explore them further. What evidence do you have to support those beliefs? Have you faced any similar challenges before?

User: Well, I did move to the city for university, and while it was hard at first, I managed. But this feels different. It's a bigger leap, and I feel like I'm not as strong as I was back then.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you managed the transition to university. It shows you are capable of overcoming challenges. Would it be helpful to think about what helped you back then and how those strategies could apply to your current situation?

User: I guess I had a support system then, like my friends. I don’t have that now, and it feels really isolating. 

Consultant: Feeling isolated can definitely heighten anxiety. It seems like having support was crucial for you in the past. Let’s think about how you could build a support system now. Are there ways you can connect with others, perhaps at school or online?

User: I haven’t really thought about it. I guess I could try joining a study group or reaching out to other students. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Connecting with peers can provide both support and motivation. Additionally, what activities could you engage in that might help lessen your anxiety while studying?

User: Maybe taking breaks to walk outside or doing some relaxation exercises could help. I’ve been so focused on study that I’ve stopped taking care of myself.

Consultant: It's essential to take care of yourself, especially during stressful times. Implementing breaks and relaxation strategies could certainly aid your focus and reduce anxiety. How about setting specific times to take these breaks?

User: I could schedule short breaks every hour to step away from my study space. That makes sense!

Consultant: That sounds fantastic, Xiaolu! Taking regular breaks can truly boost productivity. Now, let’s tackle those negative thoughts you mentioned earlier. How might you challenge the belief that you won’t be able to manage studying abroad?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that I’ve faced difficulties before and succeeded. I just need to be patient with myself.

Consultant: That’s a powerful perspective! Acknowledging your past successes reinforces your ability to face future challenges. Could you write down these affirmations for yourself to refer back to during tough moments?

User: Yes, I can definitely do that. It feels empowering to think about my strengths.

Consultant: Empowering indeed! As we move towards our final sessions, let’s take a moment to reflect on your progress. How are you feeling about your ability to cope with these challenges now compared to when you first started?

User: I can see some improvements. I still feel anxious, but I’m starting to recognize that I can do things to help myself rather than feeling helpless all the time.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Recognizing your agency is a significant step forward. Before we wrap up, let’s think about what you can do if you find yourself feeling overwhelmed again. What strategies can you lean on?

User: I could reach out to a study group, remind myself of my past successes, and take breaks. I think those can help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember, it’s perfectly okay to seek help and lean on others. As we conclude today’s session, keep practicing these strategies, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need support. You're capable of navigating this journey.

User: Thank you so much for the guidance. I feel a little less lost now, knowing I have some tools to work with.

Consultant: You're welcome, Xiaolu! I’m glad you feel that way. Keep believing in yourself, and if you ever want to discuss further or need support, feel free to come back. Wishing you all the best in your studies and future journey!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaolu! It's great to see you again. Last time we spoke, you were feeling overwhelmed by your thesis and uncertain about your career path. How have you been since then?

User: Hi! Honestly, not very well. The pressure seems to have only increased. My thesis advisor didn't give me the feedback I was hoping for, and I'm feeling even more lost about what I should do after graduation.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that it's been tough for you. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of pressure related to your thesis and your future job prospects. Can you tell me a bit more about what specifically is causing you the most concern right now?

User: I think it's the uncertainty of everything. I feel like I'm supposed to have my life figured out, like everyone else, but I'm just not there yet. I'm really worried about how I’ll manage financially once I graduate, especially with the loans I will have to start paying.

Consultant: That uncertainty can be really daunting, especially when you have financial concerns weighing on your mind. Let's explore those feelings a bit more. What are some specific thoughts that come to your mind when you think about your financial situation after graduation?

User: I keep thinking that I won't find a job that pays enough or that I will struggle to meet my loan payments. It feels like I’m already setting myself up for failure before even trying.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite heavy and negative. It’s understandable to feel anxious about job hunting and finances, but I wonder, are there any positive aspects or alternative thoughts that could help balance your perspective?

User: Maybe I could try to look for part-time jobs or internships while I’m studying. I haven't thought about that much. But what if those don’t lead to anything either?

Consultant: That's a great insight! Seeking part-time opportunities could indeed give you a sense of control and proactive measures during this uncertain time. Let’s challenge that thought of “what if it doesn’t lead to anything.” What evidence do you have that it won’t lead to more opportunities?

User: I suppose I don't have any solid evidence. It’s just this fear that keeps nagging at me. Also, I feel like other students seem to be doing much better than I am.

Consultant: The comparison to others can often intensify our feelings of inadequacy. It's important to remember that each person's journey is unique. How would you feel about setting small, achievable goals for yourself rather than focusing solely on the bigger picture?

User: That could be helpful, actually. I think if I broke things down into smaller steps, it might seem less overwhelming. But I’m still worried about whether I can actually achieve those goals.

Consultant: It’s reasonable to have those doubts, but let’s lean into that idea of setting smaller goals. What might be one small goal you could set for yourself this week that feels manageable?

User: Maybe I could spend an hour each day working on my resume or looking for job openings? That sounds doable.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic goal, Xiaolu! Working on your resume and job search consistently is a proactive step. How would you feel doing this for the week? 

User: I think setting aside that time could help. But I’m still worried about making sure I find a job that fits my skills and brings me some financial stability.

Consultant: That concern makes sense. It's a common worry, especially during a transitional period like this. It might be helpful to remember that stability often comes from experience and learning, which take time. What skills do you feel confident in that you could highlight in your job applications?

User: I think I’m pretty good at communication and organization. I’ve always managed my academic projects well.

Consultant: Those are wonderful skills! They are highly valued in many fields, especially in human resources where you're studying. Reflecting on your strengths can help build confidence. How might you present these strengths in your resume and future interviews?

User: I guess I could give examples from my projects and internships. That could show that I really have those skills.

Consultant: Absolutely! Providing concrete examples is a very effective way to demonstrate your abilities. What steps can you take to prepare those examples for your job applications?

User: I could start by listing my experiences and figuring out how to frame them. Maybe I can write them down as bullet points.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Taking that step can help clarify your thoughts and ensure you represent yourself well. As you move forward with this, what strategies could you use to manage any anxiety that might come up?

User: If I feel anxious, I could take a break and practice some deep breathing. I've done that before, and it helped.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a wonderful practice for managing anxiety. It gives you a moment to reset. As you embark on this week with your goals, can you commit to practicing that technique whenever challenges arise?

User: Yes, I can commit to that. It feels good to have a plan!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Having a structured plan can be very empowering. Before we wrap up, let’s reflect on what you’ve discussed today. What do you think is the most important takeaway from our session?

User: I think realizing I can set small goals and recognizing my strengths is key. I’m still worried but I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: That’s a valuable realization. Hope is a powerful motivator. Remember, it's okay to feel anxious as you navigate this phase of your life. You’ve made great progress today. We can keep building on this in our next sessions. 

User: Thank you! I feel like I’m at least going in the right direction now.

Consultant: Absolutely, Xiaolu! You've taken important steps today. I’m here to support you, and we can explore more strategies in our future sessions. If you have any questions or need to talk further, I'm here for you. Looking forward to our next meeting!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're welcome! Take care, and we’ll talk soon.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaolu! I'm glad you're here today. Let's talk about what's been on your mind lately. I understand that you're feeling anxious about your financial situation and the burden of student loans. How has that been affecting you?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been really worried about my finances. With all these student loans, I feel like I'm drowning. I constantly think about how I'm going to repay them, and it makes me feel lost regarding my future.

Consultant: That sounds quite overwhelming. So, you're feeling a lot of pressure from the loans and uncertain about what the future holds. Can you share a bit more about how this anxiety manifests in your daily life?

User: I find it hard to concentrate on my studies because I'm always thinking about money. Even when I manage to sit down and study, my mind drifts to worrying about job prospects and financial stability. It's like there's a cloud over my head.

Consultant: It sounds like these worries are really clouding your ability to focus and enjoy your studies. Have there been specific thoughts that come to your mind when you feel this way?

User: Yes, I often think things like "What if I can't find a job after graduation?" or "What if I end up in debt for years?" Those thoughts just keep repeating, and I feel more anxious every time.

Consultant: I see. Those thoughts sound quite distressing and are likely contributing to your anxiety. Let's explore them further. How much evidence do you think there is to support these fears about not finding a job or being in debt?

User: Honestly, I don’t know… I see a lot of my peers getting internships and job offers, and I feel like I’m falling behind. It's hard not to compare myself to them.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel this way, especially when you're comparing your progress to others. When you see those comparisons, how does that make you feel about your own achievements and abilities?

User: I tend to feel inadequate and question whether I'm making the right choices. I sometimes think that maybe I'm not good enough for the opportunities I'm pursuing.

Consultant: That must be really tough, especially after all the hard work you've invested in your studies. If a friend were in your position, what advice would you give them about feeling inadequate?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on their own journey and not compare themselves to others. Everyone has different paths, right?

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to remember that we all have unique experiences and timelines. Let's think about what small steps you can take to manage these feelings of inadequacy. What are some realistic goals you could set for your financial situation?

User: I guess I could start by budgeting my expenses better and maybe looking for part-time work to help with my finances. That might ease some of the pressure I feel.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Setting a budget and exploring part-time work can help you feel more in control of your finances. How comfortable are you with creating a budget?

User: I'm not too experienced with budgeting, but I'm willing to learn. I think if I have a plan, it might help reduce my anxiety.

Consultant: Learning to budget is a valuable skill that can greatly help you manage financial stress. Let’s outline a simple budgeting plan together. What are some of your regular expenses that you can identify?

User: Well, I have tuition, books, and living expenses like food and rent. Those are my main ones.

Consultant: That's a good start. By categorizing your expenses, you can have a clearer picture of where your money goes. Have you thought about how much you need to allocate for each category?

User: I haven’t really calculated it out yet, but I know I need to keep track. It feels a bit daunting.

Consultant: It can feel overwhelming at first, but breaking it down into smaller steps could make it easier. For instance, you could start by tracking your spending for a week and then organize the data into your budget. How does that sound?

User: That sounds manageable. I could definitely give it a try for a week.

Consultant: Great! And remember, this is a learning process. If you find it challenging, don't hesitate to reach out for help. Now, besides budgeting, what other strategies can we explore to help you feel more confident about the future?

User: I think I might need to work on my self-confidence, especially when it comes to applying for jobs. I often feel intimidated.

Consultant: Building self-confidence is a vital part of moving forward. One approach could be to list your strengths and what you bring to the table. What are some strengths you believe you have?

User: I’m good at teamwork and have strong communication skills. I’ve always received good feedback on group projects.

Consultant: Those are excellent strengths that can be very appealing to employers! How might you leverage these strengths when applying for jobs?

User: I guess I could highlight them in my resume and during interviews. Maybe practicing how to communicate them would also help me.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practice makes a big difference. How about we gently role-play a job interview scenario focused on showcasing your strengths next time we meet? 

User: I would like that! It would help ease my nerves.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we continue our work together, remember to remind yourself of your accomplishments and strengths. They're an integral part of who you are. How do you feel about progressing with that idea?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful now. I think focusing on these small steps and practicing what I’m good at could make a difference.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Let's set that as our next goal. As we close this session, let's summarize the steps you'll take moving forward. You’re planning to track your spending, create a budget, and prepare to discuss your strengths for job applications. Is that correct?

User: Yes, exactly. I’ll work on those, and then I’ll update you on my progress.

Consultant: Perfect! I'm looking forward to hearing how it goes. Remember, you’re not alone on this journey, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your support.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaolu. You've made some great insights today. I believe in your ability to navigate this process. If you need anything, just reach out. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaolu! Welcome back to our session. I'm glad you're here. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling pretty overwhelmed lately, especially with my friends getting jobs while I’m still searching. It's really making me doubt my own abilities and choices.

Consultant: I can see how that would be challenging for you. It sounds like the comparisons you’re making with your friends are weighing heavily on your mind. Can you tell me more about these thoughts and feelings?

User: Yes, every time I see a friend getting hired, I can't help but think about how I'm still struggling to find something. It makes me feel really inadequate and lost. I wonder if I made the wrong choices in my education or career path.

Consultant: Those feelings of inadequacy can be really tough to handle. It's understandable to question your choices when you're under pressure. Let's explore what specific thoughts come to your mind when you see your friends succeeding. What do you tell yourself in those moments?

User: I usually think that they must be better than me or that I’m not good enough for the jobs I'm applying for. It’s like I’m setting myself up to fail.

Consultant: That sounds like a lot of negative self-talk, which can really affect your confidence. How do these thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: They make me feel anxious and really down. I sometimes even doubt whether I should continue pursuing my degree or if I should change my career plans entirely.

Consultant: It’s clear that these thoughts are troubling you deeply. Let's try to break this down a bit. How much evidence do you think there is to support the idea that you're not good enough or that you’ve made the wrong choices?

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence. I’ve done well academically, and I have skills that I could offer. But it just feels easier to focus on the negative right now.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It seems like you do have evidence of your capabilities. Let’s challenge that negative thought. If a friend were to express these feelings to you, what would you say to reassure them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone’s journey is different and that it’s okay to take time to find the right job. I’d remind them of their strengths and accomplishments.

Consultant: Exactly! You have a compassionate perspective that you can extend to yourself as well. It’s essential to recognize that your journey is unique and that comparing yourself to others can be misleading. What strengths do you see in yourself that we can focus on?

User: Well, I’ve always been a hard worker and I have strong research skills. I also genuinely care about helping people through HR. I just need to remind myself of that more often.

Consultant: Yes, those are fantastic strengths! It’s important to focus on your unique path and recognize the value you bring. How can we create a plan to help you remember these strengths when those negative thoughts arise?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal of my accomplishments, no matter how small? That might help me see my progress more clearly.

Consultant: Keeping a journal sounds like a wonderful idea! It will serve as a reminder of your achievements and the qualities that make you unique. How about we set a goal for you to reflect on this journal every week?

User: Yes, I think that could help a lot. I’d like to see my growth over time instead of always comparing myself to others.

Consultant: That’s a positive step forward! Along with the journal, let’s also explore some new strategies for job hunting that might feel less overwhelming. What kinds of job opportunities are you interested in right now?

User: I’m looking for roles related to employee development or recruitment. I want to contribute to people’s growth within organizations.

Consultant: That’s admirable! How can we take tangible steps toward applying for positions in those areas that feel manageable for you?

User: I could research companies that align with my values and maybe even reach out for informational interviews. That feels less daunting than applying directly.

Consultant: Informational interviews are a fantastic way to network and learn more without the pressure of a job application. Let’s set a small goal for you to identify a few companies and reach out over the next week. How does that sound?

User: That sounds doable! I think it would also help me build my confidence to connect with people in the field I’m interested in.

Consultant: Absolutely! Engaging with others in your field can reinforce your skills and help you feel more connected. As we wrap up today’s session, what’s one key takeaway you want to remember when those negative comparisons come creeping back?

User: I want to remember that my journey is my own, and I have strengths that matter. I shouldn't diminish my accomplishments just because someone else's success looks different.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway, Xiaolu! Recognizing your own worth is so important. You’ve made great progress today, and I believe these strategies will help you move forward. Remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and feel a bit more hopeful about things now.
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaolu! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty frustrated, actually. I tried to implement some new study methods I learned about, but it’s just not working out as I hoped.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like these new methods didn't meet your expectations, and that’s understandably disappointing. Can you share more about what you tried and how it felt?

User: Sure. I read about active recall techniques and tried using flashcards, but I felt overwhelmed and my retention didn’t improve. I keep thinking that maybe I’m not cut out for this.

Consultant: It's tough when you put effort into something and don’t see the results you want. Let’s explore those feelings a bit. When you think, "I’m not cut out for this," what emotions come up for you?

User: I feel a mix of sadness and anxiety, like I’m failing. It makes me question my abilities and future.

Consultant: That sounds really hard; questioning your abilities can be very frustrating. You’re working so hard in a challenging field. Can we examine where that thought originated from? What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you might not be cut out for this?

User: I guess I don’t have concrete evidence. It’s more about the failure to adapt quickly to new methods. I compare myself to others who seem successful.

Consultant: Comparisons can often lead to negative thinking. It’s natural to feel pressured, but since you’ve achieved so much to get where you are, let’s think about your strengths. What has helped you succeed in the past?

User: I've always been diligent and persistent. In the past, when I studied hard, it usually paid off eventually.

Consultant: That’s a great strength to recognize in yourself! Your diligence has led you to success. How might you use that same persistence when trying out these new study methods? 

User: Maybe I should be more patient and give myself time to adjust to these methods instead of expecting immediate results.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach. Instead of focusing solely on results, how can you track your progress or the small changes that may indicate improvement?

User: I could keep a journal to note down what I tried each day and how I felt about it. That might help me see progress over time.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Writing things down can give clarity and help with reflection. Moving forward, are there any small, achievable goals you could set during your study sessions?

User: I could aim for studying for 30 minutes with a new method instead of putting pressure on myself for a long session.

Consultant: That sounds very doable! Breaking it down into smaller pieces can make it less overwhelming. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel more hopeful, like this might actually help me regain control over my studies.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. As you continue to explore these methods, what strategies will you implement if something doesn’t seem to work?

User: If something doesn’t work, I’ll remind myself that I can always try another approach and that it’s okay to experiment.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset! Embracing the idea of experimentation can reduce the pressure on you. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think I need to focus on my process rather than just the outcome, and being patient with myself is key. I feel more equipped to try again.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! You’ve shown a lot of self-awareness, and I believe you can apply this to your studies. How do you envision our next steps together in future sessions?

User: I’d like to check in on how my new strategies are working and maybe explore how to handle stress better when things don’t go as planned.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. We’ll definitely address that next time. Remember, I’m here to support you. You’re not alone in this journey. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance. I’m looking forward to our next session!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care until then, and remember to celebrate the small victories along the way. Speak soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaolu! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hello! I've actually been feeling a lot better. My emotions have stabilized, and I have a more positive outlook on the future. I've started to think about what career path might suit me. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made some meaningful progress in how you feel. Can you share more about what you envision for your future career?

User: I’ve been reflecting on my strengths and interests, and I think I might want to pursue a career in human resources. I’ve always enjoyed helping people and supporting them in their professional growth.

Consultant: That's a great direction! It aligns with your studies in human resources management. What specific aspects of the HR field appeal to you the most?

User: I really like the idea of recruitment and talent development. I believe that finding the right job for the right person can make a huge difference in both their lives and in a company's success.

Consultant: That’s a very insightful observation! Finding the right fit can indeed lead to greater satisfaction and productivity. Have you thought about any practical steps you could take to explore this field further?

User: I have! I’m considering applying for internships or part-time roles in HR departments to gain some hands-on experience.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Gaining practical experience can really enhance your understanding and skills. What do you think might be your biggest challenge in pursuing internships or roles in HR?

User: I guess my biggest fear is not standing out among other candidates. I might not have enough practical experience compared to others.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way, especially in a competitive job market. Let’s take a moment to explore that thought. What evidence do you have that you wouldn’t stand out to employers?

User: Well, I don’t have any HR experience, only academic knowledge, and I feel like many candidates might have already worked in the field.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, but remember, every candidate has a unique background. What skills or experiences do you possess that might be appealing to employers, even if they are not directly related to HR?

User: I’ve done a lot of group projects during my studies, and I've taken on leadership roles. I’m good at communication and resolving conflicts within the team.

Consultant: Those are valuable skills! Effective communication and conflict resolution are crucial in HR roles. How do you feel about highlighting those experiences in your applications?

User: I think I could definitely emphasize them more! It gives me more confidence to know that my academic experiences still matter.

Consultant: Absolutely! Your academic experiences reflect your abilities and readiness for HR roles. How do you feel about setting a specific timeline or goal for your internship applications?

User: I think that would help a lot. Maybe I could aim to send out a few applications by the end of this month?

Consultant: That sounds like a reasonable plan! Setting a timeline can help keep you motivated. What steps can you take this week to prepare your materials for the applications?

User: I need to update my resume and tailor a cover letter for different positions. I also want to reach out to my professors for any potential leads.

Consultant: Those are excellent actions! Updating your resume and seeking guidance from your professors can provide you with valuable insights. How are you feeling about taking these steps?

User: I feel excited and a little nervous, but I'm ready to move forward!

Consultant: It's great to hear that you feel a mix of excitement and nerves; it shows you are ready for new challenges. Are there any support systems you can lean on during this process?

User: I have a few classmates who are also looking for internships. I think we could motivate each other.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Supporting each other can make a significant difference. How will you keep each other accountable during this job search?

User: We could schedule regular check-ins to share our progress and discuss our applications. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! It encourages collaboration and accountability. As you move forward, how can you remind yourself to stay positive during moments of doubt or frustration?

User: I think I can create a list of affirmations or reminders about my skills and past successes to refer back to whenever I'm feeling unsure.

Consultant: That's a powerful approach! Creating a list of reminders about your strengths can help you maintain confidence. Is there anything else you want to address in our session today?

User: I just want to make sure I stay on track and keep this positive energy going. 

Consultant: You’re doing an amazing job in recognizing your emotions and proactively planning for the future. How about we set a date for our next session to continue tracking your progress?

User: Yes, that sounds great! I’d like to check in about my applications and see how I’m feeling by then.

Consultant: Perfect! I’m looking forward to hearing about your journey. Remember to celebrate your little victories along the way. If you feel overwhelmed, take a step back and reflect. You’ve got this!

User: Thank you so much for your support. I feel more motivated and clear about my path now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to see the progress you’ve made. Enjoy the process of applying and discovering your career path. Until next time, take care!

User: Thank you! I’ll see you next time!
