Consultant: Hello, Jessica! I'm glad you could join me today. I know this has been a tough situation for you. How have you been feeling about coming here for these sessions?

User: Hi. Honestly, I feel like I’m just here because I have to be. I don't see how talking will really help my situation. 

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling a bit resistant and not quite sure about the benefits of these sessions. What do you think would make it feel more valuable to you?

User: I guess if I could figure out how to avoid getting in trouble at school, that would be helpful. But I just don’t feel like talking will change anything.

Consultant: That makes sense. You're looking for real solutions to your situation. Let's explore what behaviors specifically have led to these warnings. Can you share what happened in class?

User: I was just joking around with my friends, and I guess I didn’t realize I was being disruptive. It feels like I can’t really joke at all now.

Consultant: It sounds like you want to have fun and connect with your friends, but it’s also impacting your school life. How do you feel when the teacher tells you to stop or when you get into trouble?

User: I feel embarrassed and a bit angry. Like, why does it matter so much? We’re just trying to have a good time.

Consultant: Those feelings are completely valid. It’s tough when you’re trying to enjoy yourself but it gets taken the wrong way. What do you think your teachers’ perspective might be?

User: They probably think I'm not taking things seriously. But I’m just a teenager trying to have fun. 

Consultant: That’s understandable. You’re in a phase of life where socializing is important. What do you think could help you balance having fun with following the class rules?

User: Maybe if I could find a way to be funny without getting in trouble? But I don’t know how to do that.

Consultant: That’s a great goal! Finding a middle ground could be a wonderful strategy. Let’s think about ways you could approach humor that might not disrupt the class. Can you recall moments when you were funny without causing issues?

User: Sometimes I can crack a joke quietly or make a funny face. But those moments feel rare.

Consultant: It’s a start! Those subtle moments of humor can be effective. What if you made a plan to use those subtle ways to engage with your friends while still being respectful in class?

User: I guess I could try that. But what if I slip up anyway? 

Consultant: It’s natural to worry about that. Perhaps we can work on developing a few coping strategies for when things don’t go as planned. How does that sound?

User: That could help. But I still feel like it’s a lot of pressure.

Consultant: It is a lot to manage, and it’s okay to feel pressured. Let’s break it down into smaller steps. What’s one small action you could take this week to try out your subtle humor approach?

User: Maybe I could just focus on keeping my comments to a minimum during class and observe how others act.

Consultant: That sounds like a reasonable first step! Observing can give you insights into how to handle those moments. How would you feel about tracking how that goes afterward?

User: I think I could do that, but I might forget. 

Consultant: It’s totally normal to forget things like that. Would setting a reminder on your phone or keeping a small journal help you remember?

User: Yeah, a journal might work. 

Consultant: Fantastic! Writing can be a great way to reflect on your experiences. After trying your new approach, how would you assess how it’s going?

User: I could write down what works and what doesn't, I guess. But will this really help me not get into trouble?

Consultant: Tracking your experiences will provide insights. Plus, it’s part of learning and changing your behaviors over time, which leads to fewer issues at school. 

User: That makes sense. It feels more manageable.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. If you do slip up, that’s just another moment to learn from. 

User: I’ll try to keep that in mind.

Consultant: Great! And if you feel overwhelmed, we can discuss it here to find ways to cope. How are you feeling about our discussion so far?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I like that we’re coming up with an actual plan instead of just talking about what went wrong.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Jessica! It’s about taking actionable steps. Is there anything else you want to explore today?

User: Not really, I just hope I can remember all this for next time.

Consultant: That’s completely okay. We’ll keep working at it together. Just take it one step at a time. I’m looking forward to seeing how your journal goes next session!

User: Thanks, I think I can do this. 

Consultant: Absolutely, you’ve got this! Remember, I’m here to support you. Looking forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Jessica! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. To be honest, I’ve been feeling pretty overwhelmed. I thought writing in my journal would help, but it just feels like a lot to keep track of.

Consultant: It makes sense to feel overwhelmed with tracking your thoughts and feelings. Would you like to share what you’ve written in your journal? 

User: I didn’t write that much. I jotted down a couple of moments when I tried to be more subtle with my humor, but I still ended up getting in trouble once.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you faced some challenges. What happened in that situation? 

User: Well, I made a joke during a group project, and the teacher thought I wasn’t taking it seriously. She got really upset with me.

Consultant: I can see how that would be frustrating, especially when your intention was to lighten the mood. How did that make you feel when your teacher reacted that way? 

User: I felt embarrassed and angry again. It’s like I can't win—I want to have fun, but it keeps getting me into trouble.

Consultant: Those feelings are completely valid. It's tough to strike a balance between wanting to enjoy yourself and the expectations from your teachers. Would it help to think about other ways you could connect with your friends in class? 

User: Maybe. I guess I could try participating more in the project itself instead of making jokes. 

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach! Focusing on the project could help shift attention away from joking while still allowing you to engage. How might you make that shift during your next group activity? 

User: I could pay more attention to what everyone is saying and come up with ideas instead of trying to be funny all the time.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Engaging in the work can foster a different dynamic with your peers. What do you think about setting a personal goal for your next group project? 

User: I could aim to contribute at least one idea in the discussion. 

Consultant: That sounds like a realistic goal! It might also give you a sense of accomplishment. How do you think you’ll feel after you try to contribute in that way? 

User: I think it might feel good to be involved. I’d have to focus, though, which worries me.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel apprehensive, especially with the pressure of contributing. Maybe finding small ways to ease into it could help. What's one small thing you could do to prepare for that? 

User: I guess I could practice sharing my ideas with a friend before the project. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Practicing can build your confidence. How would it feel to share your thoughts with a friend before presenting them in class? 

User: It might make me feel less anxious. I might get some feedback too. 

Consultant: Exactly! Feedback from a friend could provide reassurance and help you refine your ideas. How likely do you think you are to do that before the next project? 

User: I think I can do that. It feels more manageable than just diving in headfirst. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Breaking things down into smaller actions can really make a difference. Are there any other concerns you want to address during today’s session? 

User: I still worry about how my parents will react if I get in trouble again. I feel like they just won’t understand.

Consultant: That sounds challenging. It’s tough when you feel like you’re not being listened to or understood. Have you had a chance to talk to them about how you feel regarding school and the pressure? 

User: Not really. I’m afraid they’ll just think I'm making excuses. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. If you were to approach them, how do you think you might express what you’re going through? 

User: I could try telling them about the pressures of school and how I’m working on improving things. 

Consultant: That sounds like a step in the right direction! Expressing your efforts might help them see that you’re trying to make changes. Is there a way you could prepare for that conversation to feel more confident? 

User: Maybe I could write down what I want to say first so I don’t forget. 

Consultant: Writing it down is a great strategy! It can provide clarity for your points and help you communicate your feelings effectively. How do you feel about discussing this with them? 

User: I feel nervous but also kind of relieved to have a plan. 

Consultant: That’s a good place to start. Feeling nervous is natural, but having a plan can empower you. What do you think your next steps will be after this session? 

User: I’ll try practicing my ideas with a friend, write down what I want to say to my parents, and keep up with my journal entries.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid action plan! Each step you take will help you feel more in control over your situation. I'm really proud of your willingness to work through this. 

User: Thanks. It feels nice to have someone support me in figuring this out.

Consultant: I’m always here for you, Jessica. It's great to see you taking these steps to navigate your challenges. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session! 

User: Me too. Thanks for your help today! 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jessica! It's nice to see you again. How have things been for you since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling kind of lost. I tried talking to my parents like we discussed, but it didn't go as well as I expected.

Consultant: I’m sorry to hear that. It can be really tough when things don't go as planned. Can you tell me more about what happened during that conversation with your parents?

User: I told them I was feeling pressured at school and wanted to improve, but they just seemed frustrated. They kept saying I need to take things seriously.

Consultant: It sounds like their response felt dismissive, which can be really discouraging. What emotions did that bring up for you?

User: It made me feel even more isolated, like they don’t understand me at all. I ended up shutting down and not saying much.

Consultant: That sounds really frustrating, feeling misunderstood by your parents. In situations like this, what do you think might help you express your thoughts more clearly?

User: I think if I could share specific examples of the pressures I feel, that might help, but I'm not sure how to phrase it.

Consultant: Sharing specific examples is a great idea! It can provide context. If you were to prepare a few key points, what would you want them to understand about your experience?

User: I’d want them to know that my stress comes from school pressure and wanting to fit in. It’s not just about being lazy or not caring.

Consultant: That's a very clear message to convey. Crafting it in a way that emphasizes your efforts could help them see your point of view. How might you frame those examples to ensure they understand?

User: Maybe I could explain how I’ve been trying to balance school and friends. I could say I’m working on being better, but it’s still hard.

Consultant: That sounds very effective. It shows that you're taking responsibility while still acknowledging your struggles. How do you feel about approaching them again with these points?

User: I’m still nervous, but it feels a bit clearer. I think I could write it down first, like we talked about.

Consultant: Writing it down can definitely help! It might take the pressure off during the conversation. Do you have a plan for when you might bring this up again?

User: I don’t know. I guess when things feel a bit calmer. Maybe over dinner?

Consultant: That sounds like a reasonable time. Setting the right moment can make a big difference. In the meantime, what coping strategies can you use when you feel overwhelmed?

User: I could try to focus on my breathing or take short breaks when I feel stressed.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Breathing exercises can be really grounding. Would it help to practice some of those techniques together right now?

User: Sure, that might be nice.

Consultant: Let's take a moment to breathe in deeply together. Inhale through your nose for a count of four... hold for four... and exhale slowly for a count of four. How does that feel?

User: It feels calming. I could definitely use that!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Incorporating such techniques into your routine can be beneficial. How do you think you could remind yourself to practice this when you’re feeling stressed?

User: Maybe I could set reminders on my phone or just keep it in mind during class breaks.

Consultant: That's a great plan! Reminders can help reinforce those habits. Is there any other area of your life where you're feeling unsure or needing support?

User: I guess I’m still feeling a bit lost in the new social club I joined. I don’t think my humor fits in there.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel a sense of isolation when you’re adjusting to a new group. Have there been specific moments that made you feel this way?

User: Yes, there were a couple of times when I tried to joke around, but no one laughed or seemed to get it, and it felt really awkward.

Consultant: Those moments can be really tough. It’s not uncommon to take time to feel comfortable in a new social environment. What do you think might help you connect with this group better?

User: I guess I could try to listen more and gauge their sense of humor before jumping in with my own style.

Consultant: That's a fantastic approach! Taking the time to understand their dynamics can help you find common ground. How do you feel about that strategy?

User: I feel a little more hopeful. It seems less pressure than trying to be funny right away.

Consultant: Absolutely! It allows you to be more present and engage naturally. What do you think your next steps would be in terms of both your family and social interactions?

User: I’ll practice sharing my feelings with my parents, focus on listening in my club, and keep using those breathing techniques when I'm stressed.

Consultant: That sounds like a thoughtful and well-rounded plan! Each step you take will help you feel more empowered in these situations. How do you feel about all of this right now?

User: I feel a lot less overwhelmed and more ready to tackle everything one step at a time.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Remember, it’s all about progress. I’m here to support you through each of these steps. Looking forward to seeing how things go in our next session!

User: Thanks for all your help. It means a lot! 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and I look forward to checking in on your progress next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jessica! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit confused again. I tried to connect more with my club members, but I still feel like I don’t belong.

Consultant: I’m sorry to hear that you’re struggling with feeling like you belong. Would you like to share more about what you've experienced in the club?

User: Sure. I tried to listen and engage with them, but any time I tried to make a joke or lighten the mood, it just didn't land. They didn’t seem to think it was funny.

Consultant: That must be really frustrating, especially when you're trying to connect. How did that make you feel when your humor didn’t resonate?

User: I felt embarrassed and isolated again. It’s like I can’t be myself without feeling out of place.

Consultant: Those feelings are completely valid. It can be tough when humor is such a big part of your personality. What do you think might help you feel more comfortable expressing yourself in that group?

User: I guess I could try to understand their interests better before jumping in with my own humor.

Consultant: That's a very insightful approach! Taking time to learn about their interests could help you find common ground. How would you go about doing that?

User: I could ask them questions about what they enjoy or talk about their experiences, maybe trying to fit in that way.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic strategy! Engaging with them personally can pave the way for stronger connections. How would you feel about trying to practice these conversation starters next time?

User: I feel nervous, but I think it’s a good idea. It might take the pressure off trying to be funny right away.

Consultant: Absolutely! It creates space for natural interaction. How about setting a small goal for your next club meeting?

User: Maybe I could aim to ask at least two questions about their interests during the meeting.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! Setting a specific target can provide clarity and focus. How do you think you’ll feel after engaging in that way?

User: I think it might help me feel more connected, even if I still feel a bit nervous.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! Remember, even small steps can lead to significant changes. Is there anything else on your mind regarding the club or your interactions with others?

User: I’m still worried about my parents and their expectations. I don’t want them to think I'm failing.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that pressure from your parents. Have you had a chance to reflect on your conversation with them since we last talked?

User: Not really. I’ve been avoiding it because I'm worried about their reaction if I bring it up again.

Consultant: It can be complex to navigate those conversations. If you were to approach them again, what would you want to say to ease your own worries?

User: I'd want them to understand that I’m trying my best and that it's hard to balance everything.

Consultant: That’s important to communicate! Focusing on your efforts and the challenges you face may foster understanding. How do you feel about preparing for that conversation?

User: I still feel anxious about it, but I know it’s probably necessary.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious. Would writing down your thoughts and feelings once more help you clarify what you want to say?

User: Yes, I think that would help me organize my thoughts better.

Consultant: Great! Writing things down can provide clarity. Do you have an idea of when you might share these feelings with them?

User: I’ll try to bring it up over dinner this weekend. I’m hoping it will be a calmer moment.

Consultant: That sounds like a sensible plan! Choosing a calm moment can create an opportunity for a more open dialogue. In the meantime, what coping strategies can you use to manage anxiety when you think about this?

User: I could practice deep breathing and remind myself that it’s okay to express my feelings.

Consultant: Those strategies are excellent! Practicing deep breathing can help ground you. Would you like to do a quick breathing exercise right now together?

User: Sure, that sounds nice.

Consultant: Alright, let's breathe in deeply through our noses for a count of four... hold for four... and exhale slowly through your mouths for a count of four. How do you feel after that?

User: I feel a bit calmer. It helps to pause and breathe.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Incorporating this into your routine can make a difference. Before we finish today, are there any other areas of your life you'd like to discuss?

User: I'm still feeling lost in how to be myself and fit in with my friends.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way, especially in social settings. Finding your place can take time. Have you considered reaching out to trusted friends to talk about your feelings?

User: I could try that. It might help to get their perspective.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Friends can provide valuable support and insight. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel hopeful. It seems nice to know I can lean on my friends for support.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Support from friends can really strengthen your sense of belonging. So, what are your next steps going to be after this session?

User: I’ll practice engaging with my club peers, try to talk to my parents this weekend, and reach out to a close friend for support.

Consultant: That sounds like a comprehensive plan! Every step you take is a move toward feeling more confident and connected. How do you feel about everything we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel more prepared to handle things and less overwhelmed.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about progress, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Looking forward to hearing how everything unfolds in our next session!

User: Thanks! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jessica! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, but I still have moments where I question if I'm making the right choices, especially with my friends.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear there are some improvements! It’s normal to have those moments of uncertainty, especially when it comes to friendships. Can you share a recent situation where you felt that way?

User: Sure. I had the chance to hang out with some classmates, but I wasn't sure if they really wanted me there. I felt like I was just tagging along.

Consultant: That sounds tough. Feeling like you're just an observer can be lonely. What emotions did that experience stir in you?

User: I felt anxious and a bit excluded. It’s like I want to fit in, but I keep second-guessing myself.

Consultant: Those feelings of anxiety and exclusion can be really hard to cope with. What do you think might help you feel more included when you’re in those situations?

User: Maybe if I could speak up more or initiate conversations? But it's hard to know what to say.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Initiating conversation can help bridge that gap. Let’s brainstorm some topics or questions you could use to start engaging with them.

User: I guess I could ask about what shows they’re into or talk about classes we share.

Consultant: Those are excellent conversation starters! Asking about shared interests can open up discussions. How would you feel about trying to bring up one of those topics the next time you’re with them?

User: I feel a little nervous about it, but also excited. It seems like a doable plan.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! It’s normal to feel nervous, but taking those steps can help build your confidence. How about setting a small goal for your next gathering with them?

User: Maybe I could aim to ask at least two questions about their interests during our next hangout?

Consultant: That sounds like a great goal! Starting small can make it feel more manageable. How do you think you’ll feel after trying that out?

User: I think it might feel good to be proactive. Even if it’s a bit nerve-wracking, it could help me connect better.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking initiative can give you a sense of accomplishment. Is there anything else on your mind regarding your friendships or your experiences lately?

User: I’m still worried about how my parents see my social life. I don’t want them to think that I'm not being responsible.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Balancing social life and responsibilities can be tricky. Have you talked to your parents about how you’re managing your time?

User: Not really. I feel like they might judge my choices or think I’m not taking school seriously.

Consultant: That fear is common. If you were to discuss your social activities with them, how might you reassure them about your responsibilities?

User: I could explain how I’m balancing both friends and my schoolwork, showing them I’m still managing things well.

Consultant: That’s a thoughtful approach! Emphasizing your balance can help them feel more at ease. How do you feel about preparing for that conversation whenever you're ready?

User: I think I would feel better if I had some points written down to express my thoughts clearly.

Consultant: Writing it down is an excellent strategy! It can help you feel more organized and confident. Do you have a time in mind for when you might bring this up with them?

User: Maybe over dinner this weekend if it feels right.

Consultant: That sounds like a reasonable plan. Creating a calm environment can help facilitate a more open conversation. In the meantime, have you thought about coping strategies for managing any anxiety leading up to that talk?

User: I could practice deep breathing or remind myself of the positive things I’ve accomplished socially.

Consultant: Those are wonderful strategies! Positive self-talk and deep breathing can be very grounding. Would you like to practice a quick breathing exercise together now?

User: Yeah, that sounds nice!

Consultant: Alright, let’s take a moment to breathe in deeply through our noses for a count of four... hold that breath for four... and exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of four. How do you feel after that?

User: That feels calming. I definitely need to remember to do that!

Consultant: I’m glad it helps! Incorporating breathing techniques into your routine can make a big difference. Before we end today, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or explore further?

User: I guess I’m still feeling a little uncertain about the club. I want to connect more, but it’s challenging.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel that way. Building connections often takes time. Have you considered reaching out to one or two friends from the club to talk about your feelings?

User: I could try that. It might help to get their perspective and feel less alone.

Consultant: Absolutely! Having someone to share your feelings with can provide comfort and insight. How does that make you feel moving forward?

User: It makes me feel more hopeful. I like that I can lean on my friends.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Support from friends can really help strengthen your sense of belonging. So, what are your next steps going to be after this session?

User: I’ll practice engaging with my classmates, prepare for my talk with my parents, and look into friends from the club to connect with.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Each of those steps is moving you closer to feeling more confident and connected. How do you feel about everything we talked about today?

User: I feel more motivated to take action and less overwhelmed about it all.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! Remember, progress is key, and I’m here to support you through these steps. Looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!

User: Thank you, I really appreciate your help!

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, Jessica, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jessica! It's wonderful to see you again. How have things been for you since our last session? 

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit more grounded. I tried some of the strategies we discussed, especially with my friends, but I still feel uncertain sometimes.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear you're feeling more grounded! It’s completely normal to feel uncertain as you try new approaches. Can you share a specific situation where you felt that uncertainty creep in?

User: Sure. I was at a club meeting, and I tried to initiate a conversation about a popular show, but it felt awkward. No one really engaged, and I ended up feeling left out again.

Consultant: That sounds challenging. It’s tough to put yourself out there, and I can see how an unresponsive group would make you feel isolated. What emotions did you experience in that moment?

User: I felt embarrassed and a bit defeated. I really thought that would work!

Consultant: Those feelings are completely understandable. It's frustrating when you try to connect, and it doesn’t go as planned. How do you feel about the approach you took with initiating the conversation?

User: I thought it was a good idea, but now I’m second-guessing myself. Maybe I should just not try to engage at all.

Consultant: It’s easy to fall into that mindset after a tough experience, but it’s important to remember that trying is a significant step. Perhaps we can think about how to approach these interactions differently next time. What’s a small adjustment you could make to your engagement strategy?

User: Maybe I could ask questions instead of trying to lead with a specific topic. That way, it could be more open-ended.

Consultant: That’s an excellent insight! Asking open-ended questions can help start a conversation more naturally and allow others to share their interests. What types of questions do you think you could ask next time?

User: I could ask about their favorite genres in TV shows or what they’ve been up to lately.

Consultant: Those are great conversation starters! Engaging with what they enjoy can build rapport. How do you feel about setting a goal to ask at least two open-ended questions during your next meeting?

User: I think that sounds doable! It might take some pressure off me too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Setting a manageable goal like that can reduce pressure and empower you to engage. How do you think you’ll feel once you try that out?

User: I think I might feel more confident and less anxious about speaking up.

Consultant: That's the spirit! Confidence is built through practice and small successes. Is there another area of your life where you feel uncertainty that we can explore together?

User: I still feel a bit uneasy about talking to my parents. I don’t want them to think I’m not responsible, especially with school.

Consultant: It’s common to feel that way. If you were to approach them again, what points would you want to emphasize about your responsibilities?

User: I’d want them to know that I’m managing my school work and social life, but it’s challenging sometimes.

Consultant: That's a clear message and an important one to convey. Preparing those points in advance can help ease your nerves. How do you feel about coming up with a plan for your conversation?

User: I think writing down my key points would help me remember what to say.

Consultant: Definitely! That can provide clarity and boost your confidence during the conversation. Do you have a timeframe in mind for when you might talk to them again?

User: Maybe this weekend, during dinner. It seems like a calmer time.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity. Setting the time can help ease the flow of conversation. Meanwhile, what strategies can you use to manage any anxieties leading up to that talk?

User: I could practice deep breathing techniques to calm myself before the conversation.

Consultant: That’s an excellent coping strategy! Practicing deep breathing can help ground you. Would you like to practice that technique together right now?

User: That sounds good!

Consultant: Let's take a moment together. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four... hold that breath for four... and exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of four. How does that feel?

User: It feels relaxing! I need to remember to use that.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Incorporating breathing techniques can make a big difference in how you approach stressful situations. Before we wrap up, is there anything else on your mind that you’d like to address today?

User: I think I've been avoiding reaching out to my club friends for support. I want to connect but feel insecure.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel that way in new environments. Have you thought about mentioning your feelings to a close friend from the club?

User: I could try. It might help to share my experience with someone who understands.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Talking to someone can provide perspective and support. How does that make you feel as you consider taking that step?

User: It makes me feel hopeful. I like the idea of having support from someone who gets it.
