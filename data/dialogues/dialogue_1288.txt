Consultant: Hello, Yang! I'm really glad you're here today. Before we dive in, I’d like to hear about how you’ve been feeling lately and what brought you to this session.

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling overwhelmed and anxious, especially after my cousin's tragic accident. On top of that, I've been having a lot of arguments with my boyfriend, which makes everything worse. It’s been hard for me to socialize, and I often feel like I don’t measure up to others.

Consultant: I'm so sorry to hear about your cousin and the stress with your boyfriend. That’s a lot to carry. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed given these circumstances. Let’s explore your feelings together. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you feel anxious about social situations or work presentations?

User: When I'm in those situations, I often think that everyone is judging me. I feel like I’m not doing well enough, and that makes me want to avoid speaking up or participating. It’s exhausting.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts of being judged are really heavy for you. Can you identify how these thoughts impact your feelings during those situations? 

User: Absolutely. When I think that way, I get really nervous, my hands start to shake, and I just want to escape. It makes me feel worthless, like I don’t deserve to be there.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly tough, Yang. It's like these negative thoughts are creating a cycle that makes you feel trapped. Could you share with me how you react to these feelings of worthlessness? 

User: Most of the time, I either freeze up in those situations or I just avoid them altogether. I end up missing out on opportunities to connect with others, and then I feel bad for being anti-social.

Consultant: It seems like avoiding those situations provides some temporary relief, but also leads to more feelings of regret and isolation. Let’s take a moment to question those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're being judged or that you’re not good enough in those scenarios?

User: I can’t really point to any specific examples. It’s just a gut feeling, you know? I guess I just assume it’s true, especially when I feel anxious.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially during an anxious moment. However, since you don’t have clear evidence, would it be helpful to consider alternative perspectives? For example, what would you tell a friend who feels this way?

User: I’d probably remind them that everyone has their flaws and that it’s okay to not be perfect. Maybe I should take my own advice.

Consultant: That sounds like a valuable piece of advice. You have a lot of compassion for others. What do you think might change if you practiced being kinder to yourself in the same way?

User: I guess I might feel less pressure and more acceptance of my imperfections. It might help me open up more in social situations.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing self-kindness could create a big shift. Let’s think of some small steps you can take to incorporate this compassionate mindset into your daily life. What could that look like for you?

User: I could start by acknowledging my feelings instead of pushing them away. Maybe also remind myself of some positive aspects when I feel anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Acknowledging your feelings is the first step, and pairing that with positive reminders can help you challenge those negative thoughts. Would you be willing to set aside a few minutes each day to reflect on the positive aspects of yourself?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful. I could keep a journal for that.

Consultant: A journal is a fantastic idea! It gives you a space to express and reflect positively on your experiences. We can also discuss ways to gradually face those social situations you’re avoiding. How does that sound?

User: I’m a bit nervous about it, but I think it could help. I want to feel more confident.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel nervous about facing social situations, but taking small, manageable steps can make it less daunting. Let's plan an approach for you to engage in one small social interaction this week. What’s something comfortable that you might try?

User: Maybe I could join a small study group with classmates. I feel a bit safer in a learning environment.

Consultant: Joining a study group sounds like a wonderful way to ease into social interactions! You’re in a context where everyone shares a common goal, and that can often reduce pressure. How about setting a specific day and goal for this?

User: I think I can do that on Thursday. I need to study for an exam, so it fits perfectly.

Consultant: That’s perfect, Yang! Setting a specific day can help you prepare mentally. As you approach Thursday, remember to be kind to yourself, regardless of the outcome. This is a learning experience. 

User: Thank you. I definitely feel a bit of pressure to do well in that group.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that pressure, but remember, this is about connecting with others, not perfect performance. What strategies can you use to manage that pressure if it arises during the study group?

User: I could take deep breaths and remind myself that everyone is there to learn and help each other.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Deep breathing can be a calming tool, and reminding yourself about the group's purpose can shift your focus from performance to support. 

User: That makes sense. After the study group, I’ll reflect on how it went, whether it’s good or bad.

Consultant: Great! Reflection will help you gain insights and reinforce positive experiences. Remember, it’s all part of your growth. Before we wrap up, let’s summarize the main points we discussed today. What stands out to you?

User: I think acknowledging my feelings, practicing self-kindness, and taking small steps toward social situations are key takeaways for me. 

Consultant: Exactly! You’re making significant strides. It’s also important to continue recognizing your self-worth and not letting fear dictate your actions. As we conclude for today, what would you say your biggest takeaway is in regards to your self-value?

User: I realize that my value doesn't depend on others' opinions. I need to find a way to accept myself more.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, Yang! Embracing your self-worth is a journey, and you’ve taken great steps today. Remember, feel free to reach out if you need support moving forward. 

User: Thank you for the encouragement and guidance. I really appreciate it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. I look forward to our next session. Take care of yourself!

Consultant: Hello, Yang! I'm glad you're here today. I understand that you've been feeling overwhelmed with information and have been working on recognizing your self-worth. Can you share more about your current feelings and what has been going on recently?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling really pressured lately. The constant messages on QQ and WeChat are daunting. I’m trying to manage my time better, but I often feel inadequate and anxious about my performance in school.

Consultant: It sounds like the influx of information and communication is creating a lot of pressure for you. You mentioned feeling inadequate; could you elaborate on what specific thoughts come to mind when you're feeling this way?

User: I often think that if I'm not constantly available or responding quickly, people will think I'm not good enough or that I don’t care. This makes me even more anxious.

Consultant: I see. It seems like you're worried about how others perceive you, which adds to your anxiety. Let's try to explore this further. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that not responding quickly would lead people to think less of you?

User: I guess I don't really have solid evidence. It's just a fear I have. I often overthink how people react if I don't reply instantly.

Consultant: That's a common concern, and it can create a cycle of anxiety. Let's challenge that thought. If a friend of yours was in the same situation, what would you tell them about taking their time to respond?

User: I would probably tell them it's okay to take a break and focus on what they need to do. No one should feel pressured to respond all the time.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to show yourself the same kindness you would offer a friend. Let's work on applying that logic to your own situation. How could you start to create some space for yourself when it comes to responding to messages?

User: Maybe I could set specific times to check messages instead of constantly being available. That way, I could focus on my studies without distractions.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Setting boundaries can really help reduce that feeling of being overwhelmed. Can we talk about how you would implement this plan in your daily routine?

User: I think I could check messages in the morning, maybe after lunch, and then once in the evening. That way, I’m still connected but not constantly distracted.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! How do you feel about having this structure in place? 

User: I feel a bit relieved, honestly. It seems manageable and should help me feel less pressured.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As you start this new approach, how do you think it might impact your self-perception and your studies?

User: I hope it will help me focus more on my studies and improve how I see myself too. If I’m managing my time better, I might feel more accomplished.

Consultant: Absolutely! Managing your time can contribute to a more positive self-image. Let's touch on your self-worth again. What would it look like for you to feel more confident and recognize your own value?

User: I’d like to feel that my worth isn’t solely based on others’ opinions or my quick responses, but rather on the effort I put into my studies and what I achieve.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, Yang. Focusing on your own efforts and accomplishments can help reinforce your self-worth. Can you think of some recent achievements, big or small, that you could acknowledge as part of that?

User: Well, I’ve been getting decent grades in my classes, and I completed a project on time last week. Those are things I should celebrate.

Consultant: Absolutely! Those achievements are significant and reflect your hard work. Let’s practice acknowledging these successes regularly. How can you remind yourself of these positives moving forward?

User: I could keep a journal to write down what I accomplish each week, no matter how small it seems. That might help me see my progress.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Keeping a journal can help reinforce your sense of achievement over time. How do you feel about starting this practice?

User: I feel excited about it! It’ll be nice to have something to look back on and remind myself that I’m doing well.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that excitement! As you try this journal practice, remember to be compassionate with yourself. You’re making strides toward a healthier mindset. How do you expect to deal with any setbacks or challenges that might arise?

User: I guess I’ll have to remind myself that it’s okay not to be perfect. There will be tough days, but I can lean back on my strategies and the journal.

Consultant: That’s a very realistic approach. Acknowledging that setbacks are part of the journey is important. Let's plan to discuss your progress with journaling and any challenges you face in our next session.

User: Sounds good! I’m looking forward to sharing my experience, even if it feels tough.

Consultant: I appreciate your openness, Yang. You’re doing great work here. Before we wrap up today’s session, what is one takeaway you’d like to focus on until we meet again?

User: I think my main takeaway is to give myself permission to take breaks and focus on my own needs, along with keeping my journal.

Consultant: That's a wonderful takeaway! Giving yourself that permission is key to managing your anxiety. I believe you can do this, and I'm here to support you. See you next time!

User: Thank you so much! I’m feeling optimistic about applying these strategies. See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yang! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, but I still struggle a lot when I have to express my thoughts in front of others. I feel this tightness in my chest and it makes me want to avoid situations where I need to speak up.

Consultant: I understand how challenging that can be, especially when you're trying to share your thoughts. Can you tell me about a specific situation recently where you felt that anxiety?

User: Sure. Last week in a group meeting, I wanted to share my ideas about an event we were planning, but I just couldn’t bring myself to speak. I felt everyone was looking at me, and my mind went blank.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Yang. It’s common to feel a lot of pressure in those moments. What kinds of thoughts were running through your mind when you felt that pressure to speak?

User: I kept thinking that if I said something wrong, everyone would judge me. I also thought maybe my ideas weren't good enough, so I just stayed quiet.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts created a lot of fear for you. Let’s explore them a bit. Do you believe those negative thoughts have any solid evidence to support them?

User: I guess not really. I mean, there were times when people appreciated my ideas. But in the moment, those negative thoughts took over.

Consultant: That's a meaningful realization, Yang. It shows that while those thoughts feel real, they may not reflect the actual situation. How do you think it would change your experience if you were able to challenge those negative thoughts?

User: I think I would feel more confident to speak up. If I could remember those positive reactions, maybe I wouldn’t feel so anxious.

Consultant: Exactly! Replacing those thoughts with positive reminders can be a powerful tool. Let's practice some positive self-talk. What could you tell yourself before speaking up to counter those negative thoughts?

User: Maybe I could say, “I have valuable ideas to share, and it’s okay if I make mistakes.”

Consultant: That’s a great start! By telling yourself that, you're reinforcing a more supportive belief. Would you like to try this positive self-talk in a real or imagined scenario?

User: Yes, I’d like to try it in a real scenario next time I'm in a group setting.

Consultant: Wonderful! Preparing ahead of time can help reduce anxiety. Let’s also think about some small steps you can take leading up to that meeting—like practicing speaking in front of a mirror or sharing your thoughts with a friend first.

User: That sounds doable. I think practicing can really help me feel more comfortable.

Consultant: Absolutely. The more you practice, the more natural it will feel. Remember, it’s okay to start small. How do you feel about setting a goal for yourself for the next week?

User: I could aim to share at least one idea in my next meeting, whether it's big or small.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Sharing even one idea can help build your confidence over time. Let’s also talk about how you’ll feel after you accomplish that.

User: I think I’ll feel proud of myself, even if it’s just a small step.

Consultant: That's the spirit! Acknowledging those small wins is essential. Have there been any times in the past week when you've felt a bit more confident in expressing yourself?

User: Yes, actually. I shared my opinion in a group chat about an assignment, and it felt good to do that!

Consultant: That’s wonderful progress! Each time you express yourself, you're reinforcing that positive self-image. How can we build on that success in upcoming interactions?

User: I might try to focus on the positive feedback I received in the chat. Remembering that can help me feel less anxious next time.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Let’s continue to build on these experiences to create a more positive self-dialogue. For our next session, I’d love to hear how your goal went. How do you feel about that?

User: I feel good about it. I will definitely try to put everything we discussed into practice.

Consultant: I’m so proud of you for being open to this process, Yang. Remember, it's about gradual progress. Keep reinforcing those positive messages. If anything comes up before our next session, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident after that presentation I did. It was still nerve-wracking, but I realized I could manage my anxiety better. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some significant progress in handling those nerves. Can you tell me more about what strategies helped you manage your anxiety during the presentation?

User: I tried to focus on my preparation and remind myself that it was an opportunity to share what I know. I didn’t let my nerves completely take over.

Consultant: It's great that you leaned on your preparation and focused on the opportunity. How did that shift in mindset affect your experience during the presentation?

User: Well, it made me slightly more at ease. I realized that once I started speaking, I enjoyed sharing my ideas, and I felt accomplished afterward.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization! It sounds like once you engaged, your confidence grew. How would you describe that feeling of accomplishment you experienced?

User: It felt really good! I was proud of myself for standing there and presenting, despite being nervous. It gave me a sense of achievement.

Consultant: That sense of accomplishment is so important for reinforcing your confidence. Let’s talk about how you can keep building on this positive experience. What small social situations do you think you could engage in next?

User: Maybe joining a study group or participating in class discussions. I feel like those are manageable steps.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent opportunities! Participating in a study group could allow you to practice your skills in a supportive environment. How do you think you would feel about that?

User: I think it would be helpful. I want to share more with my classmates but sometimes hesitate.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel hesitant. What if we consider the successful feelings you experienced during your presentation? How could that help you in the study group?

User: I think I could remind myself that they are also students and probably feel nervous too. I could focus on what we can learn together rather than just my own fear.

Consultant: Exactly! Shifting the focus toward the collective learning experience can be freeing. Have you thought about keeping a record of these successful moments to reinforce your confidence?

User: Not specifically, but it sounds like a good idea. I could write about what went well after each experience.

Consultant: Yes! Documenting your successes is a powerful tool. It helps to visualize your progress. Would you like to try starting that today? 

User: Sure! I can jot down my thoughts after each group session. 

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Additionally, let's introduce some relaxation techniques you can use before these social engagements. Have you ever practiced any relaxation exercises?

User: I haven't really tried anything like that. What do you recommend?

Consultant: Breathing exercises or mindfulness techniques work well for many people. For instance, taking deep breaths to calm your body before a presentation can help. Would you be interested in trying a simple breathing exercise right now?

User: Yes, I’d like to try!

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s take a moment now. Inhale deeply for a count of four... hold for four... and exhale for six. Let’s do this a few times together. 

User: Okay, I feel a bit lighter already!

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Practicing this before social situations can really help you feel centered. How are you feeling about these upcoming group activities now?

User: I feel more equipped. Knowing I can use these techniques gives me confidence.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, each small step will reinforce the confidence you've built so far. What other ways can you think of to maintain those positive feelings after a successful engagement?

User: I think I could treat myself, maybe do something fun after. 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Rewarding yourself after achievements will help solidify the positive feedback loop. What specific activities do you enjoy that you could plan as a reward?

User: I love going hiking or watching a good movie. 

Consultant: Excellent choices! Perhaps you could plan a hike with a friend after your first study group session as a way to celebrate your success. How does that sound?

User: That sounds fantastic! It's something to look forward to.

Consultant: Perfect! Having something to look forward to can enhance your motivation. As we near the end of our session, let’s summarize what you’ve learned today.

User: I’ve learned to shift my focus in social situations, keep a record of my successes, and practice relaxation techniques.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve made great progress. Remember to practice what we've talked about and celebrate your achievements. How are you feeling about your ability to maintain your social connections moving forward?

User: I feel much more optimistic! I think I can keep building on my relationships now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Yang! You’ve done really well, and I’m confident that you can continue to nurture those connections. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need more support. Our session is ending today, but I look forward to hearing how you progress in our next meeting!

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care until we meet again.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling surprisingly good. Joining my classmates for a study project really boosted my confidence. I feel more appreciated and supported now.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like those social interactions have had a positive impact on your self-esteem and sense of value. What specific moments from that experience stood out to you?

User: I remember one day we were discussing a tough topic, and I shared my thoughts openly. They welcomed my input, which made me feel included and valued.

Consultant: That’s a great achievement, Yang! Sharing your thoughts and feeling appreciated in a group can significantly enhance your social confidence. How has this experience influenced your perspective on group activities moving forward?

User: I think I’m more open to participating in group activities now. I used to avoid them because I was unsure about fitting in, but now I see how much we can learn from each other.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re feeling more open! Building connections with others can be quite fulfilling. Have you set any goals for yourself in terms of continuing this positive trend in socializing?

User: I want to take the initiative more often, maybe organize small study groups or join clubs. I feel that pushing myself out there could lead to more positive experiences.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Organizing small groups is an excellent way to practice your social skills. What challenges do you think you might face while trying to take these initiatives?

User: I guess I might worry about being rejected or not being able to lead the group effectively. Those thoughts often make me hesitate before stepping out.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those concerns. Let’s take a moment to explore those thoughts. When you worry about being rejected, what evidence do you have to support those fears?

User: Well, I guess I don’t have specific evidence that they'll reject me, but I just feel anxious about not being good enough.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel anxious. But let’s challenge that thought a bit. If a friend of yours approached you with a similar worry, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably encourage them to just try and remind them that it’s okay to make mistakes. I mean, everyone has to start somewhere, right?

Consultant: Exactly! Reminding yourself of that can help ease the pressure you feel. It's all part of growth. What if you aimed to view setbacks as learning experiences rather than failures? 

User: That sounds more manageable. If I could see setbacks as learning opportunities, I think I'd feel less afraid to try.

Consultant: Yes! By adjusting your perspective, you can turn anxiety into motivation. Speaking of motivation, have you thought about some small steps you can take towards your goals?

User: I could start by reaching out to a couple of friends about setting up a study session next week. That seems like a small, achievable step.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Setting smaller goals can help build your confidence further. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel excited about it! I think it’ll help me push through my anxiety if I think of it as just hanging out with friends.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset, Yang! Focusing on the fun of being together can ease the pressure. Don’t forget to reflect on how you feel after each interaction too. How can we ensure you stay motivated?

User: I’ll keep a journal of my experiences, noting down what went well and how I felt. That should help!

Consultant: Great idea! Journaling will allow you to celebrate your successes and remind yourself of your growth. What else can you do to remind yourself of your self-worth during this process?

User: I could remind myself of the compliments I've received from my classmates. It might help counter those negative thoughts.

Consultant: Absolutely! Surrounding yourself with positivity is key. When self-doubt creeps in, these reminders can help you regain focus. Is there anything else you’d like to address or explore today?

User: I feel like we’ve covered a lot! But I’m still concerned about how to handle situations where I might feel uncomfortable or out of my depth.

Consultant: It's good that you’re considering those scenarios. Let’s role-play a situation where you might feel uncomfortable. We can practice how you’d respond to bolster your confidence.

User: That could really help! I think practicing will make me feel less anxious about it.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s imagine you’re in a group study session, and a topic arises that you’re not familiar with. How might you approach that?

User: I could ask questions and show I'm interested. I could also share what I do know, even if it’s not much.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Engaging by asking questions helps create dialogue. It shows that you value the group's input. How does that feel to you?

User: It feels empowering to think that I can contribute even if I’m not an expert.

Consultant: Exactly! Remember, everyone is there to learn from one another. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize what you’ve identified as positive changes in your social skills and areas for growth.

User: I’ve definitely improved my ability to share my thoughts and feel more confident overall. I want to keep up this momentum and continue growing.

Consultant: You should feel proud of your progress! Before we conclude, what strategies can you use to reinforce this growth and prevent any old habits from returning?

User: I’ll keep practicing social interactions and reflecting on my experiences, plus reminding myself of my worth whenever I feel down.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! You’re creating a healthy foundation for maintaining your progress. Remember, it’s all about celebrating your achievements along the way. Thank you for sharing today, Yang. You’ve done a great job!

User: Thank you! I feel a lot more optimistic about everything. I appreciate your support.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Keep pushing forward, and remember, I'm here whenever you need to talk. Looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yang! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good overall. Reconnecting with my boyfriend has been a positive experience, and I feel more confident in my social interactions.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear that your relationship has improved and that you’re feeling more confident socially. Can you share more about how this newfound confidence has affected your day-to-day life?

User: Well, I’ve been more open to meeting new people and participating in events. I didn’t feel like doing that before. It's like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

Consultant: That’s a significant change! It appears that your relationship dynamics are positively influencing your self-esteem and willingness to engage with others. How does this change impact your academic life?

User: I think it helps a bit. I feel less isolated, which makes studying a little easier. However, I’m still struggling with falling asleep, and it sometimes makes me tired during the day.

Consultant: I see. So, even though you’re feeling good emotionally, the sleep issue still lingers and affects your energy levels. Can you tell me about your sleep habits recently?

User: I still take about an hour to fall asleep. I usually just lie there, thinking about my day or what I need to do. It’s frustrating.

Consultant: That sounds quite challenging, especially since it impacts your daily energy. Have there been any strategies you've tried to help yourself fall asleep faster?

User: Not really. I haven't put much thought into it. I guess I thought it would get better on its own.

Consultant: It’s understandable to hope that it would resolve itself. Let’s explore some practical strategies for improving your sleep. Would you be open to trying a few techniques that might help you relax before bed?

User: Sure, I’m willing to try anything that can help me sleep better.

Consultant: Great to hear! One technique you might find helpful is creating a consistent wind-down routine. This could be anything calming, like reading a book or practicing deep breathing exercises. Does that sound like something you could incorporate into your evening?

User: Yes, I think reading could be nice. I usually enjoy it. 

Consultant: That’s a perfect choice! Reading can help distract your mind from stressors. How about setting a specific time each night to start winding down with a book?

User: That could work. I usually scroll on my phone before bed, so replacing that habit sounds reasonable.

Consultant: Absolutely, replacing screen time with a calming activity can benefit your sleep quality. In addition to that, would you like to try some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or mindfulness, to help ease your mind before sleep?

User: Yes, I’d like to try deep breathing. I’ve heard it can be beneficial.

Consultant: Excellent! Deep breathing can signal your body to relax. You might try inhaling for a count of four, holding for four, and then exhaling for a count of six. Would you feel comfortable practicing that technique with me now?

User: Sure, I’d like to try it. 

Consultant: Let’s go for it. Close your eyes if you're comfortable, and I'll guide you through a few cycles. Inhale deeply for four… hold for four… and exhale slowly for six. 

User: (Practices) Okay, that felt nice.

Consultant: Great! How do you feel after that practice?

User: I feel a little calmer. I think practicing this before bed could actually help me wind down.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! By making this a habit, you might find it easier to transition into sleep. Are there any other aspects of your life you'd like to discuss today?

User: I think that's pretty much it for now. I feel like I’m making progress, but I still worry about keeping it up.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have concerns about maintaining progress. What are some ways you can remind yourself of the positive changes you've made?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal about my feelings and what helps me feel good.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Journaling can help you track your growth and remind you of effective strategies. Would you commit to writing a little each day about your experiences and feelings?

User: Yes, I think that can help me stay focused on the positive.

Consultant: Excellent! As we wrap up today’s session, it's important to reflect on your journey. You've made significant strides in your emotional and social well-being. How do you feel about the progress you've made?

User: I feel proud of myself. It’s nice to recognize my improvements.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful feeling! Remember to celebrate these wins. Going forward, if you encounter any challenges, you have the tools and strategies we discussed today. You can always revisit them.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Yang. I believe in your ability to manage these changes and navigate any future challenges. This will be our final session for now, but remember that you can reach out whenever you feel the need. Take care, and good luck with your journaling and sleep techniques!

User: Thank you so much! I feel ready to take on what’s next!
