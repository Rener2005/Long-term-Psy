Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really confused and anxious. I keep having these thoughts that my classmates might be trying to hurt me, and it’s making it hard for me to focus in class and while studying.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It must be alarming to feel that way, especially when you're trying to concentrate on your studies. Can you tell me more about these thoughts and how they affect your daily life?

User: Well, I feel like I can't trust anyone at school. Sometimes, I even think I'm seeing things or hearing things that aren’t there. It’s all just so overwhelming.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re dealing with some significant stress and confusion. Let's dive deeper—when did these feelings and thoughts begin? Was there a specific event that triggered them?

User: I think it started a few weeks ago. I had a really tough week with exams coming up, and my dad has been really strict about my grades, which adds to the pressure. I just feel stuck.

Consultant: It must be extremely stressful to handle both academic pressures and a tense relationship with your dad. It’s completely understandable that these feelings can manifest in unusual ways, like thoughts of being harmed or experiencing illusions. Have you noticed any specific times when these feelings are stronger?

User: Yes, mostly when I'm studying alone or in class. I just can't shake the feeling that people are watching me or judging me. Even my roommate's actions sometimes make me anxious, like when she suggests we cheat.

Consultant: That sounds very challenging. The pressure to maintain your integrity while feeling isolated can create a lot of internal conflict. Can we explore how you feel when your roommate suggests cheating? How does that impact your sense of self?

User: I feel really conflicted. I want to do well in school, but cheating feels wrong. I feel guilty even thinking about it, like if I do it, I’m not being myself.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re recognizing those feelings of guilt and conflict. Those feelings can often indicate what truly matters to us. Can you tell me more about the thoughts you have when you think about cheating? What worries come up for you?

User: I worry that if I don't cheat, I won't pass. But I also think if I do, I'll just be lying to myself and my parents. I feel stuck between wanting to get good grades and wanting to be honest.

Consultant: That’s a tough position to be in. It seems like you’re grappling with significant values: honesty versus success. Let’s explore this dichotomy a bit more. What evidence do you have that supports both making the choice to cheat and the choice to stay honest?

User: If I'm honest, I could fail and disappoint my dad, but I know deep down that cheating could lead to even bigger problems later. Sometimes I think maybe I just can't handle the pressure.

Consultant: It’s insightful that you can recognize the potential consequences of cheating. Let’s talk about those feelings of being overwhelmed. What are some strategies you've tried to cope with these pressures?

User: I haven’t really tried anything specific. Sometimes I just isolate myself and try to study harder, but that doesn’t help much. I still feel anxious.

Consultant: It’s understandable that isolation feels like a natural response. Let’s think about how we can change that. What small actions could you take to engage with others rather than withdrawing? Perhaps something simple like joining a study group?

User: I suppose joining a study group could help. I just worry that if I do, I’ll still feel judged or compared to others.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way, but joining a group may provide you with support and new perspectives. It could also help to reduce feelings of isolation. What would be a manageable first step you could take in this direction?

User: Maybe I could ask a classmate to study together? That doesn’t seem too daunting.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Asking a classmate to study could provide you with some support. As you consider this, how do you feel about your thoughts regarding the illusions you've been experiencing?

User: Honestly, it’s really scary. Sometimes I think I might be going crazy, and that makes me not want to talk about it with anyone.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel scared, especially when faced with unfamiliar experiences. Let’s think about that fear—what evidence do you have that these experiences are due to anything more than stress and anxiety?

User: I guess I haven't really thought about it that way. I mostly just thought I was losing my mind.

Consultant: It’s common for stress to amplify our perceptions and feelings. Let’s take a moment to challenge that thought. What might you tell a friend who was worried about similarly feeling overwhelmed?

User: I would probably tell them to take it easy and focus on the positives, like how they’ve handled stress in the past. 

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective. You have the ability to be compassionate towards others. Can you apply that same kindness to yourself? What positives have you managed to accomplish despite these challenges?

User: I’ve done pretty well in my classes overall, and I have supportive friends, including my roommate, even if she has a different approach. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing your accomplishments is a significant step. As we wrap up our session, what are some specific strategies you could implement to manage your anxiety and the social pressures you’re facing?

User: I think I could work on opening up more to my friends about how I feel, join that study group, and just remind myself to take a break when it gets too much.

Consultant: Those sound like productive steps forward! Incorporating social support and self-care can really make a difference. As you move forward, keep in mind that it's okay to seek help when needed. We’re building your toolbox to cope and find balance. 

User: Thank you. I feel a bit better thinking about these strategies. I really hope they help me with my anxiety and the hallucinations.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm glad you feel a bit lighter. It's important to remember that understanding these feelings is a journey, and I believe you have the courage to navigate it. If you want to explore more about the hallucinations next time, we can definitely do that.

User: Yes, I would really appreciate that. Thanks for your support!

Consultant: It’s my pleasure. I’m looking forward to our next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're here today. I understand that you're feeling quite anxious with the recent increase in exam pressure. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been really stressed about my upcoming exams. Sometimes I doubt whether I can pass them. Also, my roommate has been asking me to help her cheat, which makes me uncomfortable. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now. The pressure of exams combined with ethical dilemmas regarding your roommate is understandably overwhelming. Let's discuss your feelings about the exams first. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about them?

User: I keep thinking that if I don’t pass, my dad will be really disappointed in me. He has high expectations, and I fear I won’t be able to meet them.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, especially with your dad's expectations weighing on you. These thoughts could definitely increase your anxiety. Can you share more about how those thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: Whenever I think about disappointing my dad, I feel anxious and sometimes even hopeless. It’s like no matter how hard I try, it won’t be enough.

Consultant: I can hear how deeply those feelings affect you. It's important to recognize how these negative thoughts can spiral. Have you noticed any patterns in your thinking that might be unnecessarily harsh or extreme?

User: Yes, I tend to think that if I fail this exam, it means I'm a failure overall. I know it's not entirely true, but it’s difficult to shake off that feeling.

Consultant: That’s an insightful observation. Those kinds of all-or-nothing thoughts can be quite limiting. Let’s challenge that belief a bit. What evidence do you have that a single exam defines your worth or capability?

User: I guess there isn’t much evidence. I’ve done well in other areas, but when it comes to exams, I just worry a lot.

Consultant: It sounds like you have had accomplishments. Focusing solely on exam performance denies your other strengths. What if you looked at this exam as just one part of your journey instead of the definition of your worth?

User: That makes sense. I should remember that I am more than just my grades. But I still feel so much pressure.

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s natural to feel pressure, especially when expectations are high. Let's work on some strategies to help you manage that pressure. Have you tried any activities or methods to reduce your anxiety when studying?

User: Not really. I usually just study more, but that hasn’t been very effective. 

Consultant: That’s a common approach, but sometimes more studying can lead to more stress. How about planning some breaks or integrating activities that you enjoy into your schedule? What activities help you relax?

User: I like listening to music and going for walks. I guess I could try to fit those in. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Incorporating those activities could provide a nice balance. Let’s brainstorm how to structure your study time to include breaks for music or walks. What would that look like for you?

User: I could study for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break to listen to music. That seems doable.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! The Pomodoro Technique is a good way to structure study sessions. Plus, those short breaks can really help maintain your focus. How are you feeling about this approach?

User: I feel a bit relieved thinking about it. It seems manageable.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Now, let's touch on your uneasy feelings about your roommate asking for help. What’s your thought process when she brings this up?

User: I feel really uncomfortable because I don’t want to cheat. But I also don’t want to lose her friendship over it.

Consultant: That's a tough situation to navigate, balancing integrity with friendship. Have you considered talking to her about how you feel? 

User: I’m afraid that she might get angry or not understand my point of view.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It might be helpful to express your feelings while also being honest about your values. How do you think she might respond if you approached it from a place of care rather than confrontation?

User: She might understand, but I can’t be sure. I’ve never tackled something like this with her before.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel uncertain. Maybe you could stress that you value your friendship and want her to succeed honestly. How would that feel for you to say?

User: It feels a bit scary, but also kind of right. Maybe I need to be honest with her.

Consultant: Honesty tends to strengthen relationships, even if it feels daunting initially. What’s one small step you could take to start this conversation?

User: Perhaps I could start casually and see how she responds before diving deeper into my concerns.

Consultant: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. Starting casually can help ease into the discussion. As we wrap up today, let’s recap what you've learned and any steps you want to take moving forward.

User: I want to try the study schedule with breaks, and I’ll think about how to approach my roommate about her request. 

Consultant: Those are excellent steps! You've made great progress in recognizing your thoughts and planning for actionable changes. In the future, how might you apply the strategies we discussed today to maintain your progress?

User: I can remind myself that one exam doesn't define me and that I can communicate my feelings better with my roommate.

Consultant: That's a healthy mindset to have. I’m proud of the strides you’ve made. Remember, it’s okay to take it one step at a time. Our time together today is coming to an end, but I’m confident that you can manage your emotions and challenges ahead. Feel free to reach out if you need support in the future.

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about everything now.

Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. I understand that you've made progress in your studies, but you still feel troubled about your relationship with your parents, especially with your father. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi, thanks for having me. Yeah, I did improve my focus in studies, but I can't shake this feeling of frustration when it comes to my dad. I often feel like he doesn’t understand me or what I’m going through.

Consultant: It sounds like you're grappling with a lot of feelings around understanding and being understood. That's challenging. Can you share a specific instance that highlighted those feelings recently?

User: Well, just yesterday, I tried to talk to him about my studies and how I’m managing things better, but he just kept focusing on what I haven’t done yet, and it turned into an argument. I felt really defeated.

Consultant: That sounds very tough, especially after you’ve worked hard to improve. It’s understandable to feel defeated when your efforts aren't acknowledged. Have you thought about how that conversation made you feel, and what thoughts were running through your mind during it?

User: I felt really anxious and upset, like I wasn’t even being heard. I kept thinking about how I disappoint him and how he just doesn’t see my progress.

Consultant: Those thoughts of disappointment and feeling unheard can be very heavy. Do you think there might be a pattern in how these conversations typically go with your dad, or other family members?

User: Yeah, mostly they end up the same way—me trying to explain myself, but it seems like he only wants to hear what he expects from me. I often leave feeling worse about myself.

Consultant: It makes sense that this cycle would lead to frustration. It sounds like your father's expectations are putting a lot of pressure on you. What would it look like for you to communicate your feelings and perspectives more effectively with him?

User: I guess I’d like him to understand my efforts instead of just focusing on what’s left to do. I want to express my feelings without it leading to another argument.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal and is definitely achievable. Let’s focus on some strategies you can use to convey your feelings better. How about we role-play a situation where you want to share your progress with him? What would you want to say?

User: Okay, I’d probably start by saying something like, “Dad, I’ve been really working hard on my studies, and I’d like to share what I’ve accomplished.”  

Consultant: That’s a great start! How do you think he might respond to that, based on past experiences?

User: He might say, “But what about this and that?” and point out my shortcomings again, I guess.

Consultant: If that happens, how might you want to respond to keep the conversation constructive?

User: Maybe I could say, “I understand that there’s more to do, but I feel encouraged by what I’ve managed to achieve and would love your support.”

Consultant: That’s a fantastic response! It validates both your efforts and his concerns while gently redirecting the conversation. How does practicing this make you feel about the possibility of future discussions with him?

User: It feels a bit more hopeful, like I could actually share my thoughts without feeling attacked.

Consultant: That’s an important step forward. Remember, it’s about opening up a two-way dialogue. After you practice this, what kind of outcome would you hope for?

User: Ideally, I’d love to feel respected and get him to see my side without it turning hostile.

Consultant: That’s a very valid hope, and it’s great you’re aiming for mutual respect. What if you encounter difficulty during these conversations? Do you have a plan for that?

User: I guess I could take a break, suggest we revisit the topic later if tensions rise. 

Consultant: That’s a wise approach. Stepping back can help prevent escalation and give you both time to cool off. Looking ahead, what’s one thing you can do this week to prepare for your next conversation with him?

User: I think I’ll write down what I want to say and how I’m feeling. It might help me stay focused and calm.

Consultant: That sounds like an effective strategy! Writing things down can help clarify your thoughts and reduce anxiety. I’m proud of you for taking action to improve communication. How are you feeling about the strategies we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel a bit more in control and ready to try. I still worry about how he’ll react, but at least I have a plan now.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel anxious about the unknown. Remember, you can't control his reactions, but you can control your responses and how you express your feelings. Reflecting on our role-play, what takeaway can you apply moving forward?

User: I think being clear about my feelings and staying calm is really important. I’ll try to be more assertive in expressing my achievements without feeling guilty.

Consultant: Absolutely! Assertiveness is key. You’re already making progress by thinking differently about these interactions. Keep practicing these strategies, and remember, it’s a process. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel like I have more tools now. Although I still dread the conversation, having a plan gives me hope.

Consultant: That hope is essential. You're building the skills needed to navigate these conversations more effectively. As we wrap up our session, what’s one positive step you’d like to commit to before our next meeting?

User: I’ll practice what I’ve learned and try to have that conversation with my dad this week. 

Consultant: That’s a solid commitment! I’ll look forward to hearing about it next time. Remember, progress takes time, and you’re doing great. If you have any difficulties, just know you can reach out. Good luck, and take care until we meet again!

Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. I remember our last session, and I’d like to hear how things have been going since then. How are you feeling about your communication with your father?

User: Hi! Well, I’ve been trying to improve how I talk to him, but it often ends up in arguments. I feel really disappointed when it doesn’t work out.

Consultant: I can imagine how frustrating that must be for you. It sounds like you're putting in the effort to communicate better, but the results haven’t met your hopes. What specific issues or disagreements have been coming up in these conversations?

User: It’s mostly about my studies and future plans. He insists I should focus more on my academics and worries about my grades. I just want to explain my perspective too, but it feels like he doesn’t listen.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a lot of pressure from him regarding your studies, and you feel like your side isn’t being heard. Let’s explore this further. Can you describe what you usually try to say to him during these conversations?

User: I try to tell him that I'm doing my best and that I want to pursue my interests, but he keeps bringing up my grades and how I need to be more serious.

Consultant: You're advocating for your interests and your understanding of your efforts, which is important. How does it make you feel when he responds by emphasizing your grades instead of your efforts?

User: It makes me feel unheard and a little hopeless. I feel like he judges me solely based on my performance, not as a person.

Consultant: That’s a difficult position to be in, especially when you feel judged. Let’s consider some ways to communicate your feelings effectively. Have you tried expressing how his comments affect you, rather than just focusing on the academic aspects?

User: I haven't really tried that. I usually just end up defending my grades or explaining myself.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Shifting the focus to expressing your feelings might help. For instance, saying something like, "When you emphasize my grades, I feel undervalued as a person," can create space for a different conversation. What do you think about that approach?

User: That sounds reasonable, but I worry he might react negatively and it would just lead to another argument.

Consultant: It’s natural to have that concern, especially given past experiences. However, sometimes expressing vulnerability can open up a more understanding dialogue. If he reacts negatively, how could you handle that in the moment?

User: I could try to stay calm and maybe suggest we take a break from the conversation if it gets too heated. That might help.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Recognizing when to take a step back can be very effective. It might also allow you to approach the discussion fresh later on. How do you feel about putting these ideas into practice next time you talk to him?

User: I feel a bit hopeful about trying it out. At least I’ll be trying something new rather than sticking to the same pattern.

Consultant: That's a wonderful mindset! Trying out new approaches can lead to different outcomes. As for your studies, are there any new techniques or methods you’ve started using since we last spoke?

User: Yes, I’ve been experimenting with a new study schedule that’s much more structured than before. I think it’s helping.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! A structured schedule can really boost your productivity. What do you enjoy most about this new approach so far?

User: I like that I feel more organized. I can see my progress and that motivates me to keep going.

Consultant: Seeing progress is such a great motivator! It seems like you’ve found a positive way to channel your energy into your studies. Is there anything specific you’d like to continue improving on in your study routine?

User: I want to stick to this schedule but sometimes I find it hard to resist distractions, especially when I’m feeling stressed.

Consultant: That's a common challenge. How have you been managing distractions while studying? 

User: I usually just try to push through, but I end up losing focus. I think I need some strategies to handle stress better while studying.

Consultant: Managing stress is crucial for maintaining focus. We can develop some techniques together to help you stay on track. How about setting specific break times during your study sessions? That way, you can give yourself permission to relax briefly.

User: That sounds like it could work! I often feel guilty taking breaks, thinking I should just keep studying.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way, but breaks can actually enhance your productivity and focus. It’s about finding a balance. Would you be willing to test out this structured break system and see how it impacts your stress and focus?

User: Yes, I’d definitely try that. It might help alleviate my stress and let me recharge.

Consultant: Great! I’d love to hear how that goes. Also, as we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed. You’re actively working on improving communication with your father, and you’ve found a study method that works for you. How are you feeling about these developments overall?

User: I feel more empowered to handle both my family situation and my studies now. I still have some worries about my father, but I’m hopeful.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway! Remember, progress takes time, and it’s okay to have worries. You’ve made significant strides in both areas. I believe you can continue building on these positive developments. If you ever need additional support, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you! This session really helped clarify things for me. I'm looking forward to trying these strategies.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Best of luck putting everything into practice, and I look forward to our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling better about my studies lately. The new group learning approach has really helped boost my confidence. But I still have some worries about my relationship with my dad. 

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more confident in your studies and that the group learning has had a positive impact. Let's explore your feelings about your relationship with your dad. What particular concerns do you have?

User: Well, he has really high expectations for me, and it can be overwhelming. I often feel like I'm not meeting those expectations, which adds pressure.

Consultant: That sounds challenging. Feeling overwhelmed by expectations can create a lot of stress. Can you describe a specific situation where you felt this pressure?

User: Last week, I received a grade that was lower than I hoped for. When I told my dad, he was disappointed, and I could feel his frustration. I worry that no matter how hard I try, it won't be enough for him.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It's understandable to feel anxious in those moments. What thoughts were running through your mind when you received that grade and spoke to your dad?

User: I felt like a failure. I thought, "I’ll never be good enough for him," and that made me really upset.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts really affected your emotions. Let's take a moment to examine those thoughts. How true do you believe the thought "I’ll never be good enough for him" is? 

User: I mean, I know it's not entirely true, but that's how I feel in the moment. It just feels overwhelming sometimes.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel that way. Sometimes our feelings can tell us one story, and it’s helpful to challenge that. If a friend came to you with those feelings, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that they are more than their grades, and their worth isn't defined by their performance.

Consultant: That’s excellent advice! You’re recognizing that your value isn’t solely based on grades. What if we worked together to reshape that thought for yourself? How might you express your worth beyond academic performance?

User: I guess I could remind myself of the skills I'm gaining and the progress I'm making, not just the grades.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on your personal growth and the skills you're building can help shift your mindset. How does that feel to think about your worth this way?

User: It feels a bit freeing. It’s nice to think that there are other ways to measure my success.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! Now, thinking more about your relationship with your dad, what kind of conversations do you think might help improve your communication with him?

User: Maybe if I talked to him about what I'm learning and how I feel, he might understand better. 

Consultant: That sounds like a really positive step! Sharing your learning journey and your feelings can help bridge the gap. What do you think might be holding you back from having those discussions?

User: I guess I fear his reaction. What if he dismisses my feelings or doesn't understand?

Consultant: That's a valid concern. How could you prepare for that conversation to make it feel safer for you?

User: Maybe I could write down my thoughts beforehand, so I don’t forget what to say.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Writing can help organize your thoughts and express your feelings clearly. How about also thinking of some examples to illustrate your experiences? 

User: That’s a good idea! I could share specific instances where I felt overwhelmed or proud of my learning.

Consultant: Exactly! It’ll make the conversation more relatable. As we continue working on this, how are you feeling about your progress in managing your anxieties related to both your studies and your family?

User: I'm feeling more hopeful. It helps to talk about these worries openly instead of keeping them bottled up.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Being able to share what’s on your mind is a big part of progress. Let’s take a moment to summarize what we’ve discussed today and how you can implement these strategies in your life.

User: Sure! I think I need to focus more on my overall growth instead of just my grades, and prepare for a conversation with my dad about my feelings.

Consultant: That sounds great! Remember, recognizing your value and sharing your experiences are important steps. How can you remind yourself of these points when you start to feel overwhelmed again?

User: I could write them down and keep them somewhere visible. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea. Keep those reminders close to you. Finally, as we conclude our session today, what’s your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: My biggest takeaway is that I can define my worth in my own terms, and I have the tools to better communicate with my dad.

Consultant: That’s such an empowering conclusion! Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and you have the strength to navigate these challenges. If you need support in the future, know that I'm here for you.

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate our talks, and I feel much more equipped to handle things now. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Take care, and I look forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress since our last session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really positive about my situation. My mood has improved a lot, and I feel more capable of handling my studies and my relationship with my parents, even though it's still a bit challenging.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made some significant strides. Can you share more about what specific changes or improvements you've noticed in your studies and your family interactions?

User: Well, I've created a study schedule that I actually stick to, and it's been helping me focus better. As for my parents, I've tried to communicate more openly with them instead of shutting down during our discussions. It's not perfect, but I'm making progress.

Consultant: It's impressive that you've developed a study schedule and are working on communication with your parents. What do you think has helped you the most in making these changes?

User: I think it's largely because I've started to realize that I can express my feelings without fear. Talking with my roommate has also been a big support, as she encourages me to stay on track and be more confident.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you have supportive relationships, like with your roommate. What strategies do you feel are working well for you when it comes to maintaining your focus while studying or improving your communications at home?

User: When studying, I try to take short breaks and reward myself with something enjoyable afterward. For communicating with my parents, I’ve been practicing staying calm and choosing my words carefully. I think that helps a lot!

Consultant: Those sound like effective strategies! Taking breaks can definitely enhance your focus. How do you feel when you're implementing these techniques? 

User: Honestly, I feel a lot calmer and more in control. It’s nice to see my efforts paying off, and I feel less overwhelmed than before.

Consultant: That's an important shift! You've noted a sense of control and calmness—traits that can really empower you moving forward. Have there been any challenges recently, despite your overall progress?

User: There have been some moments where I feel frustrated, especially with my dad, who still has high expectations. I sometimes slip back into feeling anxious about letting him down.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have these moments of frustration, especially when dealing with strong expectations. Can you think of a specific instance when you felt that way? What thoughts went through your mind during that time?

User: Yes, last week, I struggled with a project deadline, and I heard him mention how disappointed he would be if my grades dropped. It made me feel really anxious and started to spiral into thinking I would never meet his expectations.

Consultant: I understand how that can be overwhelming. Let’s investigate those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that supports or challenges the belief that you will never meet his expectations? 

User: I suppose I have done well on projects before, but my mind tends to focus on the worst-case scenarios. I keep thinking that one mistake could define my entire performance.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing some cognitive distortions, like overgeneralizing. If a friend were in your position, what advice would you give them about viewing their performance in a more balanced way? 

User: I would probably tell them that one mistake doesn’t mean they won’t succeed overall. It’s about the bigger picture and learning from experiences.

Consultant: That's wise advice. It’s important to remind ourselves of the bigger picture and our overall progress. What could be a small step you might take to challenge that anxious thought next time you have it?

User: Maybe I could remind myself of the positive feedback I've received in the past, or talk to my roommate about how I'm feeling in that moment. That could help ground me.

Consultant: Definitely! Reminding yourself of your successes and reaching out for support can be very helpful. Would you like to create a remindful statement you can use when you begin feeling anxious again?

User: Yes, I like the idea! Something like, “I have done well in the past, and I can learn from my mistakes,” feels pretty motivating.

Consultant: That’s an excellent affirming statement! Having a mantra can be a powerful tool to help you shift your mindset in those anxious moments. Can you think of any situations or plans where you might utilize this strategy going forward?
