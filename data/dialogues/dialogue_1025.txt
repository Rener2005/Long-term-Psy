Consultant: Hello, Zhao! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. Honestly, I still feel quite anxious, especially in social situations. I struggle with initiating conversations and often feel like I'm not as good as the others.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. You're feeling anxious and comparing yourself to your peers, which makes social interactions harder. Can you tell me more about a recent situation where you felt this way?

User: Well, just last week in class, I hesitated to answer a question because I was so scared of getting it wrong. I kept thinking that my classmates would judge me.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. It seems like that fear of being judged makes it difficult for you to participate. When you think about participating in class, what thoughts come to mind?

User: I often think that my answer will be wrong or that it will sound silly. Then I feel even more anxious and just stay quiet. 

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're stuck in a cycle of negative thoughts and anxiety when it comes to participating. What feelings do these thoughts evoke in you?

User: I feel embarrassed and small, like I don't belong there. It makes me worried that my classmates would think less of me.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s normal to want to fit in and not to feel judged. Let’s try to explore these thoughts a bit—what evidence do you have that your classmates would think negatively of you if you made a mistake?

User: I suppose I don't really have any direct evidence. It's just a feeling I have and also maybe from how I perceived my parents reacting when I made mistakes when I was younger.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Zhao. It sounds like those past experiences might be influencing how you see yourself in the present. Let’s think about a different perspective—if a friend were in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to make mistakes and that they shouldn’t worry too much about what others think.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s essential to be kind to yourself and recognize that making mistakes is a part of learning. How do you think you can remind yourself of this when you feel anxious in class?

User: Maybe I can write down some positive affirmations before class to help me remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that I have the right to answer questions.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Having affirmations can serve as a helpful reminder. Also, what small step can you take to gradually increase your participation in class?

User: I could try raising my hand at least once in each class, even if it’s just for a simple question or to agree with someone. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful and achievable goal! Focusing on small steps will help build your confidence over time. How do you feel about setting that as a goal for next week? 

User: I feel a bit nervous about it, but also hopeful. It seems manageable.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! A little nervousness is natural, but reminding yourself that everyone makes mistakes can help ease that tension. What else can you do to support yourself during this process?

User: I think talking to one or two classmates before class might help. Getting to know them could make me feel more comfortable.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Building those connections can create a supportive environment for you. Have you had a chance to speak with any classmates yet? 

User: Not really, I haven’t taken that step, but I think it would help if I tried.

Consultant: It’s completely okay to take your time with it. Do you have any ideas on how to initiate those conversations?

User: Maybe I could ask someone about the homework or their opinion on class topics. That feels less intimidating.

Consultant: Absolutely! Starting with topics like homework or shared interests is a great way to break the ice. As you practice this, how do you think it will impact your feelings towards class participation?

User: I hope it will make me feel more connected and maybe even reduce my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a really positive outlook! Building connections can indeed make a big difference. Remember to be patient with yourself as you make these changes. How would you like to reflect on your progress in the next session?

User: I want to share how it went with talking to classmates and whether I was able to participate more in class.

Consultant: That sounds good! We can review your experiences together and adjust your strategies as needed. It’s great to see you taking proactive steps. Before we finish today, is there anything else on your mind?

User: Just feeling grateful for this session. I appreciate the guidance.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m glad to be here for you. Remember, it's a journey, and every little step counts. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!

Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling about your classroom participation recently?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling pretty anxious about speaking up in class. Every time I have to say something, I feel like everyone is judging me, and I'm terrified of making mistakes.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel anxious in those situations, especially when you're concerned about how others perceive you. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts go through your mind when you have to participate?

User: I often think that if I say something wrong, my classmates will laugh at me or think I'm not smart enough. It makes me want to avoid speaking up altogether.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really overwhelming. It seems like you're worried about being judged, which is leading to your anxiety. What emotions do you feel when these thoughts arise?

User: I feel a knot in my stomach, and I sometimes start sweating. It’s really uncomfortable, and I just want to hide.

Consultant: That sounds very tough for you. It seems like these feelings of anxiety create a cycle that makes participation even harder. Have you noticed any specific situations in class that trigger these feelings more than others?

User: Yes, it happens a lot during group discussions or when the teacher asks for volunteers. I really want to contribute but just freeze up.

Consultant: It's great that you’ve identified those specific situations. Understanding your triggers is a good first step. How do you usually react when you feel this freeze coming on?

User: I mostly just try to stay quiet and hope that no one notices me. I feel like the more I avoid speaking, the worse it gets.

Consultant: Avoidance can give a temporary sense of relief, but it often reinforces that anxiety in the long run. What if we explore some steps that could help you practice speaking up gradually? 

User: I think that could help. But it’s still really scary to think about.

Consultant: It’s completely okay to feel scared; many people do when facing similar challenges. How about we start with small, manageable goals? For instance, you might try contributing one comment during a group discussion. How does that sound?

User: I guess that sounds doable, but I still worry about messing it up.

Consultant: It's normal to be concerned about making mistakes. Let’s challenge that worry a bit—what’s the worst that could happen if you made a small mistake? 

User: Maybe people would think I’m not smart, and I really don’t want that.

Consultant: It makes sense that you'd want to be perceived positively. But let's consider—do you think your classmates would judge you as harshly as you imagine? 

User: Maybe not. They probably make mistakes too. But I just can’t help but think negatively.

Consultant: That’s a very insightful realization! It sounds like you might be engaging in some negative thinking patterns. Would you be open to trying a little exercise where you challenge those thoughts and think of more realistic ones?

User: I would like that. What should I do?

Consultant: Try to write down those scary thoughts when you have them, and next to them, write a more balanced thought. For example, instead of thinking, “Everyone will laugh at me,” you might write, “My classmates understand that everyone makes mistakes." How does that sound?

User: I think I can do that. It might help me see things differently.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s a great step towards restructuring those thoughts. Let's also set a small goal for the next class—maybe just raising your hand once. Can you commit to that?

User: I can try to raise my hand once. That sounds less overwhelming.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Keep track of how you feel before and after you try it. We can discuss how it went in our next session. Remember, it’s about gradual progress.

User: I will! I hope I can follow through.

Consultant: I believe you can, Zhao. This is just the beginning of building your confidence. Shall we also talk about ways you can celebrate your success after you raise your hand?

User: Celebrating sounds good! I could reward myself with a treat after class.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Rewarding yourself can help reinforce positive behaviors, making it more likely you'll want to continue trying. 

User: I like that. I’ll plan to do that!

Consultant: Great! I’m excited for you to give this a try. Remember, it's okay to feel anxious, but with each step, you'll gain more confidence. What else is on your mind today?

User: I guess I’m just worried about not being able to keep this up. What if I can't raise my hand?

Consultant: It’s perfectly natural to have those worries. But even if raising your hand doesn’t happen right away, the intention to try is what matters. Every effort counts! 

User: That’s true. I’ll try to remind myself that it’s okay if I don’t succeed immediately.

Consultant: Exactly! Progress takes time, and being kind to yourself in the process is essential. How do you feel about our discussion today?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful, actually. I think I can start making some changes.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Zhao! Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. Continue to work on these thoughts and exercises, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.

User: Thank you. I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It’s my pleasure to support you. Take care, and see you at our next meeting!

Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I still feel a bit isolated at school. I tried to talk more with my dorm mates, but I still struggle to fit in. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're making an effort to connect, which is a great first step. Can you tell me more about those conversations and what feelings come up for you during those interactions?

User: Well, I feel anxious when I approach them. I worry they might not want to talk to me or find me boring. It's like I'm invisible in those moments.

Consultant: I hear you. That feeling of invisibility can be painful. Let's explore that anxiety a bit more. What specific thoughts run through your mind when you think about approaching your peers?

User: I often think, "They won't care what I have to say," or "They'll probably laugh at me." It makes me hesitant to start conversations.

Consultant: Those thoughts are quite negative and it's understandable why they would lead to feeling nervous. It might help to challenge those thoughts. How do you think your peers would actually react if you started a conversation?

User: I guess they might be polite and engage with me. But a part of me still believes it's going to be awkward. 

Consultant: It's common to fear awkwardness when starting something new. If a friend were in your situation, what would you encourage them to think or do?

User: I would tell them that it's normal to feel awkward and that most people appreciate when someone makes an effort to talk to them.

Consultant: That's a wise perspective! Now, let's consider how we can apply that understanding to your situation. What kind of small steps could you take to initiate a conversation next time?

User: Maybe I could start with a simple greeting or ask them about their weekend plans. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! Simple openings like that can really help ease the tension. How do you feel about making that step next time?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I also think it might be worth trying. 

Consultant: It's completely okay to feel nervous, but that willingness to try is a significant step! How about we role-play a quick scenario where you practice that greeting?

User: Sure, I can try that. 

Consultant: Great! I'll be your dorm mate. When you're ready, just start the conversation.

User: (smirking slightly) Hey! How was your weekend?

Consultant: Oh, hi Zhao! It was good, thank you! I went hiking. What about you?

User: I... I didn't do much. Just kind of stayed in. 

Consultant: That’s fine! It’s always nice to relax too. So, do you like hiking? 

User: I haven’t tried it much. I think I would be interested in it though.

Consultant: That’s a good topic to explore! You did really well. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt a bit easier in practice, but I still worry about actually doing it.

Consultant: That’s perfectly normal. Remember, the more you practice, the more comfortable it will become. Would you be willing to keep practicing some scenarios before trying them out in real life?

User: Yes, I think I could do that.

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s keep building on this. You’ve taken significant steps today, and I believe you can find joy in connecting with others. How do you feel about setting a goal for our next session?

User: I want to try saying hi to at least three people and see how they respond.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid goal. Just remember to be gentle with yourself, and celebrate each small step you take! How are you feeling about our time together today?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful and motivated to try. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhao! It’s been a pleasure working through this with you. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Remember, it’s okay to feel anxious; just take one step at a time. 

User: I will! Thanks again for your support. 

Consultant: Anytime, Zhao! Take care and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad to see you again for this session. How have you been feeling since we last spoke about participating in the club activities?

User: Hi. I've been a bit anxious, to be honest. I've been thinking a lot about joining the club, but I'm still quite scared of socializing with others.

Consultant: I completely understand your feelings. It's normal to feel both excited and anxious about new social opportunities. Can you share what specific thoughts or worries come to mind when you think about joining the club?

User: I keep thinking that I won't fit in or that people won't like me. It makes me second-guess whether I should even try to attend the activities.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really overwhelming. It sounds like there's a lot of pressure to be accepted. Let's try to break it down—what evidence do you have that suggests you won't fit in or be liked by others?

User: Well, I guess I don't have any solid evidence. It's just a feeling I have... I remember being shy in school, and sometimes I felt left out.

Consultant: It's important to recognize that those feelings of being left out may be based on past experiences. But now, as you consider joining this club, what might be some possibilities for building connections with others?

User: I guess I could try to talk to one or two people at first instead of the whole group. That might be less intimidating.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Starting small can make it feel much more manageable. How about we create a few steps that would feel comfortable for you when interacting with others in the club?

User: Sure. Maybe I could just introduce myself to someone who seems friendly at the first meeting? 

Consultant: That’s an excellent first step! Introducing yourself to someone is very approachable. What do you think you might say to start the conversation?

User: I could say something simple like, "Hi, I’m Zhao. What brought you to this club?" It sounds easy enough.

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a friendly and open way to engage. Now, how do you feel about trying that approach at the first meeting?

User: I still feel a little nervous, but it helps to have a plan. I think I might be able to do it.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous! Remember, taking that first step can be empowering. How do you think you might reward yourself after making that introduction?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to something I enjoy, like a favorite snack after the meeting. It might help me feel better.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely idea! A nice reward can reinforce positive experiences. Let's also talk about any possible fears you might have about the actual meeting. What else concerns you?

User: I worry I might not know what to say, or that the conversation will be awkward.

Consultant: Those concerns are valid. It might help to have a few general topics or questions in mind. Do you have any interests or hobbies that you could discuss with others?

User: I like playing video games and hanging out with friends. Those might be good topics to mention.

Consultant: Absolutely! Those are great conversation starters. If you ever feel stuck, you can use those interests to engage with others. How has talking about these steps made you feel?

User: I feel a little more hopeful. It helps to hear that I have a plan and things to talk about.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s all about building confidence step by step. How do you envision your first meeting going, based on what we’ve discussed today?

User: I think it will be a little scary, but I can see myself trying to approach someone and starting a conversation. I hope it goes well.

Consultant: That’s a strong mindset to have! Remember, regardless of the outcome, you’re taking an important step forward. How do you feel about setting a goal to reflect on your experience after the meeting?

User: That sounds good. I can write down how it went and what I felt afterward.

Consultant: Excellent! Reflecting on your experience will help you recognize your progress and learn from the situation. Are there any other activities or strategies you’d like to explore before the meeting?

User: I think I just want to focus on this goal for now. I really want to try it.

Consultant: That's perfectly fine! Focusing on one goal at a time can help reduce pressure. As your meeting approaches, remember that it’s okay to feel anxious, but you're also preparing to create a positive experience.

User: Thank you, I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe you can take this step. How about we schedule our next session to discuss your experience and feelings afterward?

User: Yes, that sounds good! I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: Wonderful! I look forward to hearing how it goes. Remember, you’ve got this, and every effort counts in moving towards your goals.

User: Thank you! I feel much better about it now.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Enjoy your upcoming meeting, and take care of yourself.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I’m glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better, especially since I've started connecting more with my classmates. But sometimes, I still worry about whether I'm doing it right.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've been connecting more with your classmates! It sounds like you're making some positive strides. Could you share what kind of interactions you've enjoyed the most recently?

User: I've had a few good conversations during group projects. I actually felt like I contributed and that my opinions mattered. That felt nice.

Consultant: That sounds really rewarding! Feeling valued in group interactions can significantly boost your confidence. How do you think these experiences have changed your overall perceptions of socializing?

User: I think I'm starting to feel that maybe I'm not as awkward as I thought. But I still have that nagging feeling sometimes, especially when I'm in larger groups.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel a bit anxious in larger groups! Let’s explore that feeling a bit more. Can you recall a recent moment where you felt that way in a group setting?

User: Yeah, there was a time at a group meeting where I wanted to speak up, but I hesitated. I thought people might not be interested in what I had to say.

Consultant: I understand. That hesitation can be tough! What kind of thoughts went through your mind at that moment? How did that make you feel?

User: I felt small, like I didn't belong there. I really wanted to share my ideas, but I just kept thinking they wouldn’t value them.

Consultant: It's natural to have those thoughts, but it's important to recognize how they affect your emotions and actions. Do you think there might be a more balanced way to view your contributions in those settings?

User: Possibly. I guess I should remind myself that everyone is there to learn and share. But it’s just hard in the moment.

Consultant: That’s a good insight! Remembering that everyone has something valuable to contribute can help. How about we work on a strategy for when you begin to feel that anxiety next time?

User: That sounds helpful! What do you suggest?

Consultant: One technique is to prepare a small point or question you can share ahead of time. This can lessen the pressure to come up with something on the spot. How does that sound?

User: I like that idea! If I have something ready, it might help ease my nerves.

Consultant: Absolutely! Also, celebrating those moments when you do share—regardless of the response—can reinforce your confidence. How do you feel about keeping a small journal of successful interactions?

User: Keeping a journal sounds like a good plan! I can look back and remind myself of my progress.

Consultant: Exactly! It’ll serve as a great reminder of your growth. When reflecting on your social experiences, what achievements do you think you might include in your journal?

User: I think I’ll note down the times when I felt confident speaking, and even when I just reached out to someone. Those little wins matter.

Consultant: They certainly do! Every step counts. As you continue to build this narrative of success, it’ll help cultivate a positive outlook. How are you feeling about setting new goals for your social interactions?

User: I feel motivated! I want to challenge myself to participate more in discussions, even if it feels uncomfortable at first.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, Zhao! Remember, each time you step outside your comfort zone, you’re expanding it. Is there a specific area or group where you'd like to practice this more?

User: Maybe I can try to speak up during class discussions. I often hold back there, but I want to change that.

Consultant: Great choice! Classroom settings can be perfect for practicing. What’s a small step you can take in the next week to work on this?

User: I think I’ll aim to ask a question in the next class. That feels doable!

Consultant: That sounds very achievable! Asking a question is a great way to engage. How can you remind yourself to be proud of that achievement, regardless of the outcome?

User: Maybe I could reward myself with a treat or something fun afterward. It could keep me motivated.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach! Positive reinforcement can be really effective. As we wrap up, what do you think is your biggest takeaway from today’s session?

User: I’ve realized that it’s okay to feel nervous, but I can prepare and celebrate my progress. That helps me feel more confident.

Consultant: Absolutely! Acknowledging your feelings while also preparing for them is a powerful strategy. I’m proud of the progress you’re making, Zhao. Remember, it’s all about the journey. If you ever feel stuck, you’re always welcome to come back.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao! It’s great to see you again. I’m looking forward to our session today. How are you feeling about your social progress since our last discussion?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling really good. I’ve noticed I’m more confident in social situations now, especially when it comes to expressing my opinions in group settings.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's fantastic to hear that you’re feeling more confident. Can you share a specific experience where you felt this growth in your social interactions?

User: Sure! Recently, I participated in a group project for class, and I was able to confidently share my ideas. I even got positive feedback from my peers about my contributions, which felt amazing.

Consultant: That’s an impressive achievement! Receiving positive feedback can be so validating. How did this experience change the way you feel about participating in future group activities?

User: I think it really motivated me. I used to be hesitant to speak up, but now I feel like I want to take on more leadership roles in group discussions.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you want to embrace leadership opportunities. What challenges do you think you might face as you step into these roles?

User: I worry that I might not be taken seriously or that my ideas won’t be well-received. Those thoughts still creep in sometimes.

Consultant: Acknowledging those concerns is a first step. Can you tell me what evidence you have to support those worries? Is there a pattern of your ideas not being taken seriously?

User: Actually, most of the time, my ideas have been well-received lately. I guess I just have a habit of thinking negatively about potential outcomes, even when things are going well.

Consultant: It seems like you’ve already moved past some of those negative thoughts with your recent successes. Would you be open to exploring some alternative thoughts that could help tackle that habit of negativity?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful. What do you suggest?

Consultant: Let’s try to reframe those beliefs. Instead of thinking, “My ideas won’t be taken seriously,” what if you considered, “People have valued my input before, and I can continue contributing positively”? How does that feel?

User: That does feel better, actually. It reminds me of those positive experiences instead of just the fear of rejection.

Consultant: Exactly! It's crucial to recognize the evidence that supports your capacity to contribute meaningfully. As you gather more positive experiences, it can bolster your confidence further. What can you do in your next group situation to reinforce this new belief?

User: I think I could remind myself of that positive feedback before speaking up, perhaps even jotting it down to look at when I feel anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Creating a tangible reminder can be very empowering. What other skills do you want to develop to support your social growth moving forward?

User: I’d like to work on being more assertive in conversations, not just in presentations. Sometimes I hold back my thoughts in one-on-one situations.

Consultant: That's an excellent goal! Assertiveness can significantly enhance your interactions. How about we come up with some techniques together to practice assertive communication?

User: That sounds good! More practice would definitely help me feel more comfortable speaking up one-on-one.

Consultant: One effective technique is using "I statements." When you express your thoughts, you start with “I feel” or “I think” to show your perspective. How do you think that approach might help you?

User: It sounds like a gentle way to express myself without sounding confrontational. I think it would help me feel more confident in sharing my views.

Consultant: Absolutely! Using "I statements" helps convey your message while inviting dialogue. Would you like to role-play a scenario where you practice this?

User: Yes, I’d like that. It would help me figure out how to apply it in real conversations.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine a situation where a friend is making plans for an outing, but you don't agree with the chosen place. How would you start that conversation using "I statements"?

User: I could say, “I feel a bit uncomfortable with that place; I’d prefer somewhere we can relax more.” 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start! You expressed your feelings clearly while suggesting an alternative. How does practicing this feel for you?

User: It feels more empowering to express my preferences instead of just going along with others.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Empowerment is key in maintaining assertiveness. As you keep practicing, you’ll likely feel less anxiety in these interactions. What do you think your next steps will be after today’s session?

User: I plan to use the "I statements" in my conversations and keep a record of my successes. I want to build on this momentum!

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Zhao! It’s essential to acknowledge and celebrate your wins as you progress. Perhaps we can set a follow-up to check on how this has been working for you?

User: Yes, I’d like that! Accountability can help me stay focused on my goals.

Consultant: Wonderful! We can review your experiences and adjust as needed during our next session. Remember, practice and patience are crucial in this journey. Before we wrap up, do you have any final thoughts or questions?

User: I just want to say thank you! I feel more confident about my next steps and appreciate your guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhao! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Remember, it’s a journey, and you’re taking significant strides. Looking forward to our next meeting!
