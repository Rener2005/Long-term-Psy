Consultant: Hello, Xiaomei! I'm glad you're here today. I understand you've been feeling low and confused about your friendships lately. Can we start by discussing how you've been feeling?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been really upset. My friend A has been so distant lately, and I can't figure out why. I keep worrying that I did something wrong. And then there's B, who I liked before, but now he just told me to "go away." I feel so confused and sad. I just don't understand what's happening.

Consultant: It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of emotional turmoil regarding your friendships. It’s natural to feel anxious when relationships change unexpectedly. Can you tell me more about how these changes have affected you?

User: I just feel so insecure. I keep thinking about what I might have done to push A away. And with B, I think he must be angry because I suddenly don't like him anymore. I can't stop replaying those moments in my head and it makes me feel worse. I can't focus on anything, even in class.

Consultant: It’s understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed. Relationships can be complex, and when things change, it can be hard not to blame yourself. Let’s take a moment to explore your feelings about A and B. What specific thoughts come to mind when you think about these situations?

User: I keep thinking that maybe I wasn’t a good friend to A or that I hurt her somehow. With B, I feel guilty for changing my feelings. I worry that I'm not worth caring about, and maybe I don’t deserve my friendships. 

Consultant: These thoughts you have about your worthiness and friendships are quite heavy. It seems like you’re holding a lot of responsibility for what might be happening in your relationships. Can we look at whether there’s any evidence supporting these thoughts? For instance, what makes you think you may not be a good friend or that you don't deserve care?

User: I just feel like if I was a better friend, A wouldn’t have ignored me. And with B, I feel like I must have done something terrible if he reacted like that. I can’t help but think I’ve failed.

Consultant: It makes sense that you would jump to those conclusions, especially when you’re feeling hurt. However, let’s consider the idea that there could be other explanations for A's and B's behavior. If a friend came to you with similar feelings, what would you tell them?

User: I suppose I would say that friendships can go through ups and downs and maybe it’s not all my fault. But it’s hard to believe that right now.

Consultant: That’s a very insightful perspective! Friendships do evolve, and it doesn't always indicate a failure on your part. Let’s challenge some of those negative thoughts you’re experiencing. What if we reframed those thoughts into something more helpful? For example, instead of saying “I’m not worthy,” could we say, “I am trying my best, and that’s enough”?

User: I guess I could try to think like that. But it’s still hard to shake off the feeling of being rejected. 

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way. Let's look for small steps you can take to manage these feelings of rejection. Have there been any activities or hobbies that usually help lift your mood?

User: I used to enjoy painting and drawing, but lately, I’ve just felt too low to do anything. 

Consultant: How about we set a small goal to bring some of that creativity back? Even just a few minutes a day could help provide a positive outlet for your emotions. How do you feel about that?

User: That sounds nice, but I worry it won’t help because I still feel sad thinking about A and B.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel sad while also making time for things you enjoy. Sometimes, engaging in a creative activity can create a balance and help alleviate some of that sadness. What do you think would be a good first step to get back into drawing?

User: Maybe I could just start with doodling again. It feels less pressure.

Consultant: Doodling sounds like a wonderful idea! It allows you to express yourself without the pressure of doing something “perfect.” How about setting a goal to doodle for five minutes today? 

User: I can try that. It doesn’t seem too overwhelming.

Consultant: That’s a perfect approach! As you do that, remember to be gentle with yourself. It’s natural to have ups and downs. Let’s also check in on your thoughts about A and B. How can we redirect some of that energy into self-acceptance rather than self-blame?

User: I guess I could remind myself that friendships are two-sided and that I can't control how they react. But it still feels hard sometimes.

Consultant: Absolutely, and it's okay to acknowledge those feelings of difficulty. Remember, it's a process. Maybe we could come up with a mantra you can repeat to yourself during these tough moments. What would feel comforting to you?

User: Maybe something like, “I’m doing my best, and it’s okay to have feelings.” 

Consultant: That’s a lovely mantra! It encapsulates self-compassion and reality. When those thoughts of blame or inadequacy arise, repeating this to yourself may help ground you. How does that feel?

User: It feels reassuring, actually. I think I’ll try to remember that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s keep building on that. Each week we can review what works and what doesn’t as you navigate through these feelings. For now, let’s focus on small victories like doodling and using your mantra. 

User: Yes, I like the idea of small victories. I hope it helps.

Consultant: It will, Xiaomei. Acknowledging your feelings and taking small steps towards self-care is crucial. As we continue our sessions, we’ll explore more strategies together. 

User: Thank you for your help. I’ve felt a little lighter talking about this today.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. I look forward to our next session and hearing about your experiences. You’re doing great!

Consultant: Hi! I'm glad you came in today. I understand you've been feeling quite down lately. Could you tell me more about what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. Yeah, I’ve been really upset about my friends lately. My best friend A seems to be cold towards me and I can't figure out why. I’m worried I might have upset her somehow. And then there’s B, the guy I used to like, who just told me to "get lost." I feel like maybe he’s upset because I don’t like him anymore and that makes me feel guilty. I keep dwelling on these thoughts and it’s making me really anxious.

Consultant: That sounds tough, especially since these feelings are affecting your daily life. It's understandable to want to know what went wrong in those relationships. What do you think is contributing to how you're feeling right now?

User: I guess I’m just feeling really confused and hurt. I keep thinking about what I might have done to upset A, and it eats me up inside. With B, it feels like I betrayed him somehow, and now I can't focus on anything else. 

Consultant: It's clear you're carrying a lot of weight from these situations. It’s normal to feel hurt when relationships shift. Can you share some of the specific thoughts that come to your mind about these events? What do you think about yourself in relation to A and B?

User: I often think that I’m not a good friend. Maybe I’m too inconsistent, or maybe I just don’t communicate well. I feel like I messed things up and now I’m paying for it.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite overwhelming and critical, especially when you’re already feeling down. It seems like you're being quite hard on yourself. Out of curiosity, what evidence do you have that you're not a good friend? Have you ever considered other perspectives?

User: I guess it's just how I feel. When I see A being distant, I instantly think I did something wrong. And with B, I just feel guilty for not liking him anymore. But maybe I’m being too harsh on myself.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re starting to see there might be different perspectives to consider. If a close friend was in your shoes, what would you say to them about these situations and their feelings?

User: I would probably tell them not to be so hard on themselves. Relationships can change, and it's not always their fault. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to apply that same compassion to yourself. You’re dealing with complex feelings, and it’s natural for relationships to fluctuate. Let’s explore ways to help you manage these feelings. What are some activities or self-care practices that usually help you feel better when you're down?

User: I used to enjoy drawing and hanging out with my family. I don’t know why I stopped doing those things. They used to make me feel good.

Consultant: Engaging in activities you love could be a helpful way to lift your spirits. How about we set a small goal for you to start drawing again or spend time with your family this week? 

User: That sounds good. I think I’ll try to draw at least once this week. I miss it.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful step! Now, concerning A and B, what would be a healthy way to communicate with them, keeping your feelings in mind and being kind to yourself?

User: Maybe I could just ask A if everything is okay between us and express that I care about our friendship. With B, maybe I should just let it go and not push for a conversation if he’s not ready. 

Consultant: That sounds like a thoughtful approach! It’s important to express your feelings but also respect their space. How do you feel about putting this plan into action?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also relieved to have a plan. It makes me feel like I’m taking control of my feelings.

Consultant: Taking control is a great step forward! Remember, the focus here is on your feelings and knowing that you are doing your best. How do you think you can remind yourself of your own worth during this process?

User: Maybe by acknowledging my own feelings and practicing some self-compassion. Like telling myself it’s okay to feel this way and that I deserve kindness.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing self-compassion can help you manage your emotions better. We can use some techniques to help with that. Can you identify one or two supportive resources in your life, like friends or family members, you could lean on during this time?

User: I have my mom, and she's always been supportive. I also have a few friends apart from A that I could hang out with.

Consultant: That’s excellent! Having those support systems in place is crucial. Let's summarize what we discussed today: you will try to draw this week, have a conversation with A, and respect B's boundaries while reminding yourself of your worth. How does that sound?

User: It sounds like a good plan. I feel a little more hopeful now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s a powerful step to feel hopeful. As we wrap up, remember that feeling anxious about these relationships is normal, and you have the tools to navigate them. We can always revisit these topics in our next session if you'd like.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’ll give this a try and see how it goes. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! I believe in your strength to manage these feelings. Remember, it’s a journey, and you’re not alone in it. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time.

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Mei! I'm glad you're here for our session today. I understand that you've been feeling a bit down and confused lately. Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing and what you hope to achieve today?

User: Hi. Lately, I've been feeling really anxious, especially about my interactions with classmates. I worry too much about what they think of me. I also can't stop thinking about why my close friend suddenly became distant and why a guy I used to like told me to "go away." I feel like I've done something wrong, and it's making it hard for me to focus on my studies.

Consultant: It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of emotional turmoil related to your friendships and self-image. It's completely understandable to feel anxious in these situations. What would it look like for you to feel more comfortable and confident in your interactions with others?

User: I guess I just want to stop overthinking everything. I want to be able to talk to my friends without worrying about their opinions or feeling like I'm going to mess things up.

Consultant: That makes sense. Overthinking can really hinder our ability to connect with others. Let’s explore what specific thoughts pop into your mind during these interactions. What do you usually tell yourself in those moments?

User: I often think things like, "They must think I'm boring," or "What if I say something stupid?" It just makes me feel even more anxious and I freeze up.

Consultant: I see. Those thoughts seem to carry a lot of weight for you. Let’s break that down a little. When you think, "They must think I'm boring," how does that make you feel internally?

User: It makes me feel really embarrassed and insecure. I start to doubt myself and think maybe I shouldn't even try to talk to them.

Consultant: That feeling of embarrassment and insecurity can be very heavy. Let’s challenge that thought together. How valid is it to assume that your friends see you as boring? Can you think of any evidence that might suggest otherwise?

User: Well, I have had fun times with them before, but when I'm anxious, I just forget about that. I guess I just focus on the worst case scenarios.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Xiao Mei. It sounds like you have positive experiences that prove the opposite of your fear, but anxiety can cloud that perception. If you were to view the situation more realistically, what might you say to yourself instead of "They must think I'm boring"?

User: Maybe I could think, "They enjoy spending time with me." I just have to remind myself that everyone can feel awkward sometimes.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a healthier and more balanced perspective to adopt. It’s normal for everyone to feel awkward. How does that new thought make you feel compared to the previous one?

User: It feels a bit better, like there's less pressure. I just need to practice reminding myself of that.

Consultant: Exactly! Practice is key. Let’s consider some situations where you can apply these new thoughts. Can you think of an upcoming opportunity to interact with your classmates where you could try this out?

User: There’s a group study session coming up. I'm really nervous about it, but I want to give it a try.

Consultant: That's a fantastic opportunity! What if we brainstorm some positive affirmations you could tell yourself before and during the study session to reinforce that healthier mindset?

User: I could say things like, "I belong here" or "I have valuable things to share." 

Consultant: Those affirmations sound powerful! It's important to remind yourself that you contribute positively. How about we role-play a situation where you might use these affirmations?

User: Sure! I think practicing might help. 

Consultant: Great! Imagine entering the room and seeing your classmates. What would you say to yourself first?

User: I’d tell myself, "You’ve got this!" and take a deep breath before approaching them.

Consultant: Perfect! Now, as you approach, how might you start a conversation that feels comfortable for you?

User: I could ask if they’ve started the homework yet or if they understand a specific topic we’re covering. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent way to engage! Asking about shared topics gives you common ground. How do you feel about this approach?

User: It feels more natural, especially since we’re all working on the same thing.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about building connections over shared experiences. After this session, how do you plan to keep this positive mindset going?

User: I think I’ll write down those affirmations and practice them a few times before the study session. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Also, be gentle with yourself. If things don’t go perfectly, it's okay. You're learning and growing. How do you feel about the progress we’ve made today?

User: I feel hopeful! I think I have better tools to manage my anxiety about interacting with people.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Xiao Mei! As we wrap up, remember that it takes time to make changes, and every small step counts. What do you think you’ll focus on in the upcoming days?

User: I'll focus on my affirmations and trying to connect more openly with others. 

Consultant: Fantastic! And always remember, you're supported by your family and friends. If you ever feel overwhelmed, you can always reach out for help. I'm looking forward to hearing how your study session goes. 

User: Thank you! This has been really helpful. 

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Take care, and I’ll see you in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaomei! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite confused and low recently. I'm worried about my friends and my studies. My close friend A has been really cold to me, and I'm not sure why. I keep thinking about it and wonder if I've done something wrong.

Consultant: It's tough to feel uncertain about friendships and to experience that emotional distance. Can you tell me more about what you think might have led to this change with your friend?

User: Well, I just feel like I've been excluded from things lately. It's like suddenly she doesn't want to spend time with me, and I think I must have offended her somehow. But I can't remember doing anything specific.

Consultant: It sounds really distressing to feel cut off from someone you care about. Have you had the chance to talk with her about how you feel, or what changed in your dynamic?

User: No, I haven't. I'm scared that bringing it up will just make it worse. I'm worried about what she might say or if it'll just confirm that she doesn’t want to be friends anymore.

Consultant: That fear is completely understandable. Often, we worry about the worst-case scenario and that can hold us back from reaching out. Can we explore what thoughts run through your mind when you think about talking to her?

User: I just keep thinking that maybe she thinks I’m annoying or that I’m not good enough. I feel like if I reach out, I’m just exposing myself to more rejection.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really painful and can definitely make reaching out feel challenging. Let’s take a moment to examine those feelings. Is there any evidence that supports those negative perceptions about yourself?

User: I mean, I guess there are times I feel insecure around her. But she has been my friend for a long time, so I don’t know if it’s true that I'm annoying.

Consultant: It's great that you recognize the history of your friendship! Sometimes our minds can exaggerate our fears. What would you say to a friend in your situation who felt that same way about themselves?

User: I would probably tell them that they’re being too hard on themselves and that friendships go through phases. I’d say it's okay to reach out and ask what's wrong.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective! It shows that you have the ability to be nurturing to others. Do you think you could apply that same understanding to yourself in this situation?

User: I guess I could. I just need to remind myself that my friendship with her has value, and it’s worth checking in.

Consultant: Exactly! Reaching out could be a positive step, regardless of the outcome. You mentioned feeling low about these relationship challenges; how is this affecting your studies and other parts of your life?

User: It's really distracting. I can’t concentrate in class, and I find myself daydreaming about what’s happening with my friend instead of focusing on my work.

Consultant: It’s tough when personal issues spill into academic life. By acknowledging this connection, you can start to see ways of addressing both your emotional wellness and your studies. Have you thought about any coping strategies that might help you focus better?

User: I haven’t really. I just feel stuck and overwhelmed.

Consultant: That makes sense. It can be hard to think of solutions when overwhelmed. We can brainstorm some small steps together to help you regain that focus. Would you be open to setting small, achievable goals for study time?

User: Yeah, that sounds okay. Maybe if I set a timer and take breaks, I could manage better.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Setting timers can help create structure and also give you regular breaks, helping to reduce feelings of burnout. How about we create a plan where you set a timer for, say, 25 minutes of focused study, followed by a short break?

User: I think that would help me to get started. I often just sit for hours feeling unproductive, which makes me feel worse.

Consultant: Absolutely! It can be a powerful shift to see progress, even in small amounts. And while you’re studying, try to remain mindful of your thoughts. If negative thoughts pop up about your friends or yourself, acknowledge them without judgment and refocus on your work.

User: I can try that! It’s hard, but I understand that I should not let those thoughts control my actions.

Consultant: Exactly! You are in control of how you respond to those thoughts. Let's focus on reinforcing that idea. When you encounter a negative thought, you might try reminding yourself of your strengths and the good things in your life.

User: I like that idea. I can remind myself of the things I’ve accomplished and the support I have from my family.

Consultant: Yes! Recognizing your achievements and support is crucial. You have a solid foundation, and you’re not alone in this. As we wrap up today, what is one takeaway you’d like to focus on until our next session?

User: I think I’ll focus on reaching out to my friend A and also practicing setting study goals for myself.

Consultant: Those are excellent focuses! I believe you’ll find that reaching out can not only help your friendship but also ease some of that burden you've been feeling. Remember, you have the strength to manage these challenges. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaomei! It's great to see you again. I remember we discussed your recent experiences and feelings. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to process everything we talked about. I feel a bit better about expressing myself, but I'm still worried about my friends and what they think of me.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling better about expressing yourself! It’s understandable to be concerned about how your friends perceive you. Can you tell me more about what worries you specifically regarding your friend A's coldness?

User: Well, I keep replaying our last conversation in my head, wondering if I said something wrong or if I did something to upset her. It makes me anxious.

Consultant: That sounds frustrating and stressful. It’s easy to overthink these situations. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about your conversation with A?

User: I keep thinking that maybe I wasn't supportive enough when she needed me, and now she feels distant. I feel guilty, like I’ve let her down.

Consultant: It's natural to feel guilty when we worry about others, but it’s also important to reflect on the situation objectively. Do you think there’s a chance that A's feelings might be influenced by factors unrelated to you?

User: I guess so. She might be dealing with her own stuff; she’s been under a lot of pressure with her studies too.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! Sometimes, friends are dealing with their own challenges, and it may not have anything to do with us. How do you feel about approaching A to check in on her, while also expressing your feelings?

User: I want to do that, but I’m scared she’ll just shut me down again. That fear holds me back.

Consultant: Fear of rejection is completely normal, but taking the step to reach out could also strengthen your friendship. What would it mean for you to try communicating with her despite that fear?

User: It would mean a lot! I really value our friendship, and I’d love to clear the air. But it’s hard to shake off this anxiety.

Consultant: Absolutely, and it makes sense to feel anxious. One thing we might try is to prepare what you want to say. Would you be interested in role-playing this conversation to build your confidence?

User: Sure, that could help! I think if I have a plan, I’d feel a bit more in control.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start by imagining how you’d introduce the conversation to her. What would you like to say at the beginning?

User: I might say something like, “Hey, I’ve noticed you seem a bit distant lately. Is everything okay?”

Consultant: That’s a considerate opening! It shows you care while inviting her to share. How do you feel saying those words out loud?

User: It feels a bit nerve-wracking, but I think it’s a good start.

Consultant: It is! Remember that it's okay to feel nervous—those feelings are part of trying something new. How might you follow up if she doesn’t open up right away?

User: Maybe I could say, “I’m here to listen if you want to talk about anything. I miss our chats.”

Consultant: That’s compassionate and supportive! Having clear follow-up messages can help ease tension. How do you feel about addressing B's sudden coldness at the same time?

User: I don't know... I feel more uncertain about him. I just want to avoid confrontation.

Consultant: That’s understandable, as conflicts can be uncomfortable. What if you approached him with curiosity? Asking open-ended questions might help you understand his feelings better.

User: Yes, maybe I could ask him why he seemed upset. After all, I didn’t mean to hurt him.

Consultant: Exactly! It could show him that you care and are willing to talk. How would you feel after addressing both relationships?

User: I think I’d feel relieved just to get things off my chest, like I've done my part in trying to mend things.

Consultant: That sounds empowering! It’s a step toward emotional clarity that can ease your anxieties. Let’s also explore ways to reinforce your self-confidence. Are there any small wins from recent days you’d like to share?

User: I managed to participate in class, even though I was nervous. It felt really good to get positive feedback!

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Celebrating such moments is important. How can we incorporate these victories into your daily routine to keep building your confidence?

User: I could keep a journal of my successes, big or small, and look back at them when I feel low.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Recognizing your strengths will help solidify your self-belief. Would you also like to discuss how to practice self-compassion during tough times?

User: Yes, I need that. I’m too hard on myself when things go wrong.

Consultant: Self-compassion is key! When you're feeling down, try treating yourself like you would a close friend. What kind words would you say to them?

User: I’d probably tell them it's okay to make mistakes and that they’re still worthy of love.

Consultant: That’s beautiful! Applying that same kindness to yourself can be transformative. Let’s remember these techniques as we continue. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel more hopeful and equipped to talk to my friends. Thank you for helping me see things differently.

Consultant: I'm really happy to hear that! Let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today and keep building on these strategies together next time. You’re making amazing progress!

User: Thanks! I’m looking forward to applying everything we talked about.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaomei! It's great to see you again. Today, I’d like to take some time to reflect on your progress and discuss how you can continue to maintain your positive changes. How are you feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel so much better overall. I've been able to focus on my studies a bit more, and my emotions are more stable now. But I still have moments where I feel anxious about my friendships and what I might have done wrong.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling better! Those feelings of anxiety regarding your friendships are still understandable, though. Can you share more about what specific situations are making you feel that way?

User: Yes, I keep worrying about my friend A. She has been distant lately, and I'm anxious that I must have upset her somehow. I just don't understand why our friendship changed.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, especially when you value your friendships so much. What thoughts come to mind when you think about your friend A and the changes in your relationship?

User: I keep thinking, maybe I said something wrong or didn't support her in the right way. It feels like I've failed as a friend.

Consultant: It's normal to have those thoughts, but I wonder—are there any specific instances that you think could have led to this change? 

User: Not really. I think everything was fine until she suddenly started acting cold towards me. I feel so confused and guilty.

Consultant: It's clear that this situation has left you feeling really uncertain. Let’s explore this a bit. What evidence do you have to suggest that you did something wrong? 

User: I don’t have concrete evidence, but I know her behavior changed. It makes me feel like I might have crossed some line without noticing.

Consultant: It makes sense to feel that way when you notice a change in someone's behavior. However, relationships can shift for many reasons that might not always relate to you. Have you had the chance to talk to A about how you're feeling?

User: I haven't. I'm afraid to bring it up because I don't want to make things worse if she really is upset with me.

Consultant: That's a very valid concern, but open communication can often help clarify misunderstandings. What might happen if you approached her and expressed your feelings?

User: I think it could help, but what if she reacts negatively? I don’t want to lose her completely.

Consultant: It’s understandable to fear a negative reaction. However, being honest could also open the door to healing. What if you framed it as wanting to understand her feelings, rather than assuming you've done something wrong?

User: That might work. I could say that I've noticed she's been distant and I just want to make sure everything is okay between us.

Consultant: That sounds like a good approach! It shows that you care about her feelings while also giving her space to share her perspective. How do you feel about trying to reach out to her?

User: I feel a little nervous, but also hopeful that it could bring us closer again. 

Consultant: That's a positive mindset! You are taking a brave step forward. Let’s also think about the situation with boy B. How are you feeling about that now?

User: I still feel confused. He told me to 'go away,' and it hurt. I didn't mean to hurt him, but I also can’t control how I feel anymore.

Consultant: It sounds like you're grappling with some guilt. It’s natural to feel conflicted when emotions shift. Have you considered discussing your feelings with him, similar to how you'd approach A?

User: I haven’t thought about talking to him again. I'm scared of what he might say.

Consultant: That fear is quite normal. Remember, being honest about your feelings can sometimes lead to understanding, even if it feels daunting. What would you like to achieve from a conversation with him?

User: I just want him to know how I feel and maybe clear the air. I don't want things to be so tense between us.

Consultant: That’s a great intention. Being open could help both of you understand each other better. Would you feel comfortable preparing what you want to say to him ahead of time?

User: Yes, that sounds like a good idea! Maybe writing it out will help me feel less anxious about it.

Consultant: Absolutely! Writing can provide clarity and confidence. As you prepare for these conversations, let’s reflect on how far you’ve come. What strategies have you found to be most helpful in maintaining your emotional stability recently?

User: I think talking to my family more has really helped. I’ve also been trying to focus on my hobbies to distract myself when I feel overwhelmed. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful strategies, Xiaomei! Engaging in hobbies and opening up to your family are excellent ways to cope. How do you plan to keep employing those strategies as you navigate these situations with A and B?

User: I want to keep talking to my family about my feelings and maybe set aside some time for my hobbies to keep my mind off things. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! It will be crucial to maintain those support systems as you approach these conversations. Remember, it’s okay to take your time and process your feelings.
