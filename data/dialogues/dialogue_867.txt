Consultant: Hello, Little L! It's great to see you again. Last time, we talked about the impact of bullying on your emotions. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi. I still feel really low and then angry sometimes. The comments and teasing from the classmates haven’t stopped, which makes it hard to deal with.

Consultant: I can imagine how tough that must be for you. It’s understandable to feel upset when you’re facing those kinds of situations. Have there been any specific incidents that really stuck with you recently?

User: Yeah, just a few days ago, some of them mocked me again in front of others. It makes me want to hide or not go to school at all. I hate the feeling of being judged like that.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly hurtful. It’s completely normal to feel that way. Hiding away might seem like a solution, but it doesn’t help you address the issue. How do you usually cope with those feelings when they arise?

User: I just try to ignore it and keep to myself, but it feels like it’s piling up inside. I don’t know how to not let it bother me.

Consultant: It’s tough when it feels overwhelming like that. We can work together on some techniques to help manage those feelings. For instance, have you ever tried techniques like deep breathing or mindfulness to calm down when you get upset?

User: I think I've heard of them but never really tried. I don't know how it helps.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a simple way to help reduce anxiety. It involves taking slow, deep breaths to relax your body. Would you like to try it together?

User: Sure, I can try that. What do I need to do?

Consultant: Great! Let’s practice it together right now. Take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a moment, and then slowly let it out through your mouth. Let's do this a few times.

User: *tries breathing* Okay, I think I feel a little calmer now.

Consultant: That’s a good start! How did that make you feel?

User: I felt a bit less tense. I hadn’t really thought about doing something as simple as breathing.

Consultant: It's amazing how something so simple can make a difference. You can use this whenever you feel stressed or overwhelmed. Besides breathing, have you thought about ways to talk back to those hurtful comments in your mind? 

User: I think I usually just accept whatever they say. I don't want to make things worse.

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry about things getting worse. But sometimes changing how you think about those comments can help you feel better. Let’s practice how to challenge those negative thoughts. Can you tell me a negative comment you remember?

User: Someone said I was too “soft” and need to toughen up. It really bothered me.

Consultant: That sounds like a harsh thing to say. Now, let’s explore that thought. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts this statement?

User: I guess I don’t really believe that I need to change completely. It just hurts to hear it.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s valid to feel hurt by those words, but you don't have to accept their judgment on who you are. What would you tell a friend if they were in your position?

User: I’d probably tell them they are okay as they are and that it’s not fair for others to say nasty things.

Consultant: That's a wonderful perspective! Now it's important to treat yourself with that same kindness. What could be a positive thought to replace that negative one?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that I’m fine just the way I am and that being kind is actually a strength.

Consultant: Yes! That’s a powerful reminder. Holding onto positive thoughts can really help improve how you feel. How about we come up with a personal mantra you can use when you feel down?

User: I could say, “I am strong and kind just as I am.” 

Consultant: I love that! That's a strong affirmation. You can repeat it whenever you start to feel those negative emotions creeping in. Are there any situations where you think you could practice using this mantra?

User: I think saying it to myself before going to school could really help, especially if I have to face them.

Consultant: That's a perfect plan! Remember, the more you practice, the more natural it will become. You’ve shown a lot of courage by sharing your feelings today. Are there other strategies you’d like to explore regarding your feelings about the bullying?

User: I think practicing how to confront those classmates would be helpful, but I’m scared of what might happen.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel scared; that’s normal. We can work on some ways to assert yourself calmly, so when you're ready, you’ll feel more prepared. Maybe we can role-play a situation to help build your confidence. What do you think about that?

User: Yeah, I’d like that! It sounds less scary if I practice first.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s think of a situation you’d like to role-play. What’s an interaction with them that you dread the most?

User: I think being called names again during class would be tough to handle.

Consultant: Okay, let’s role-play that. Imagine you’re in class, and someone calls you a name. I’ll be the person bullying you, and you can practice responding with your new affirmation or any other response you want to try.

User: Alright, I’m ready.

Consultant: *acts as bully* “Hey, look at L! Why don’t you toughen up?” 

User: *takes a breath* “I am strong and kind just as I am. Your words don’t define me!” 

Consultant: Excellent job! That was powerful! How did it feel to say that?

User: It felt good, like I had control over the situation for a moment.

Consultant: That’s the feeling we want to cultivate. Remember that you have the strength within you, and with practice, you can continue building your confidence. Looking back on what we’ve discussed, what strategies do you feel you’re ready to take forward?

User: I’m going to practice deep breathing and use my mantra when I feel down. I also want to try the role-playing again to feel more prepared.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I’m proud of you for taking these steps. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you still need support with moving forward?

User: I think just having a safe space to talk about this again would be great as I keep working on it.

Consultant: Of course, I'm here for that. We will continue to navigate this together. Remember, you are not alone in this journey. Keep practicing what we’ve discussed, and next time we meet, we can check in on how things have gone for you. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate it. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, Little L, and I look forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, L! I'm glad you came in for our session today. I know you've been facing some challenges lately, especially with your classmates. Can you tell me more about what you've been feeling?

User: Hi. I've been really down and angry. My classmates tease me about my weight and the way I talk. It makes me feel miserable. I just want it to stop.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, L. It's understandable to feel upset when people treat you that way. Can you share a specific instance that made you feel particularly bad recently?

User: Sure, just the other day, some kids made fun of my voice during class. I felt so humiliated that I didn't want to go to school anymore.

Consultant: I hear you. Being humiliated like that can have a huge impact on how you feel about yourself. What were the thoughts running through your mind at that moment?

User: I thought, "Why can't I just be like everyone else?" It felt like I just can't fit in.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are really heavy on your mind. When you think you're different, how does that make you feel about yourself?

User: It makes me feel worthless. I sometimes wish I could just disappear or change who I am.

Consultant: Those feelings of worthlessness are really painful. It's important to recognize that many people experience similar feelings at times. Would you like to explore some ways to challenge those thoughts about fitting in?

User: I guess I would. But it feels so hard to change my mind when everyone else thinks like that.

Consultant: Changing how we think can indeed feel challenging, but it is possible! Let’s start by questioning those thoughts. What evidence do you have that you need to change to fit in? Are there aspects of yourself that you like?

User: Well, I like that I'm kind and supportive to my friends, especially the girls. They are nice to me. But I still feel like I need to change.

Consultant: That's a wonderful quality to have, L! Being kind and supportive is something to embrace, not change. Instead of focusing on changing who you are, how might you celebrate those positive qualities?

User: I guess I could try being more confident about my kindness. But then I fear that others will still make fun of me.

Consultant: It’s natural to fear that kind of judgment. But what if you consider that others might respect you more for standing your ground? If a friend of yours faced bullying, what would you tell them to do?

User: I would tell them to be proud of who they are and to ignore the mean comments. 

Consultant: That's great advice! Now, what if you applied that same advice to yourself? How might that change your approach when dealing with teasing?

User: Maybe I could try to stay calm and respond confidently instead of feeling defeated. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Responding with confidence can change the dynamics. What do you think a confident response to a teasing comment might sound like?

User: Maybe I could say something like, "That's not really true, and I think it’s not okay to say that."

Consultant: That sounds assertive and respectful! Practicing responses like that can help empower you. How do you feel about trying this approach the next time it happens?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I also feel like it's worth a shot. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous, but you’re taking a big step toward asserting yourself! Remember to be patient with yourself during this process. How else can I support you in building this confidence?

User: I think just talking about it helps. It’s nice to have someone to share this with. 

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Sharing your thoughts is important. Let's discuss practical ways to practice those confident responses outside our sessions. 

User: Okay, maybe I could practice those responses with my mom or dad.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Practicing with supportive family members can build your confidence. How does that plan sound to you?

User: It sounds good. I feel like I have a plan now. 

Consultant: I'm happy you feel that way! Remember, it’s also important to acknowledge your feelings along the way. If you ever feel overwhelmed, what strategies can you use to calm down?

User: I usually listen to music or draw. Those help me feel better.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Engaging in activities you enjoy can provide relief when emotions feel heavy. Are there any other techniques you might want to explore together?

User: Maybe some breathing exercises? I’ve heard they help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Breathing exercises can be very helpful in managing anxiety. We can practice those together if you're interested.

User: Yes, I’d like that. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s try a simple breathing exercise. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in for four counts, hold for four, and exhale for four. How does that feel?

User: It feels relaxing. I think I could use this when I feel anxious or upset.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Incorporating those breaths can give you a sense of control. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what we’ve talked about.

User: I feel like I have some good strategies to handle the bullying and not respond in anger or retreat.

Consultant: That's an excellent takeaway, L! It's a significant step that shows you're beginning to build self-confidence and find your voice. Remember, it’s okay to feel sensitive about what others say, but you’re learning to manage that.

User: Yeah, I feel a bit more hopeful now. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Keep practicing those responses and self-care techniques. If you ever need to revisit these conversations, I'm here for you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You're very welcome, L! Remember, take things one step at a time. I believe in your ability to navigate these challenges. Until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, I'm glad to see you here today! How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! Honestly, I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed. School activities are coming up, and I worry about what my classmates will think of me. 

Consultant: I understand that you're feeling quite anxious about the opinions of your classmates. It sounds like that worry is weighing heavily on you. Can you share more about what specifically concerns you about their reactions?

User: Well, I'm worried they'll make fun of me because I'm a bit chubby and, um, they sometimes say I act a bit “girly.” It makes me really self-conscious.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, and it’s completely normal to feel sensitive in that situation. You mentioned feeling self-conscious—what kind of feelings do those thoughts about your classmates bring up for you?

User: I get really anxious and just want to hide. It’s like I can't do anything right, and sometimes I just don't want to go to school at all.

Consultant: It sounds like those feelings of anxiety and wanting to hide are quite intense. Let's explore that a bit more. What do you think would help you feel more comfortable in those social situations?

User: I guess I just want to feel accepted, like my classmates would see my good qualities instead of just focusing on my weight or how I act.

Consultant: It’s understandable to want acceptance and recognition for your positive traits. Can you tell me about some of those good qualities you wish your classmates could see?

User: I’m friendly, and I usually help others with their studies. I get along better with the girls in class, but the boys don’t always see that.

Consultant: Those are really valuable qualities, and it’s great that you’re kind and helpful to others. Do you think there’s a way you could remind yourself of those strengths when you feel anxious about how others perceive you?

User: I have tried thinking positive thoughts, but it’s hard when I’m under pressure.

Consultant: It can indeed be challenging to maintain those positive thoughts under pressure. Let’s work on some self-affirmation techniques together. For instance, when you start to feel anxious, you could say to yourself, “I am friendly and helpful, and that’s what matters.” How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds okay, but what if my classmates still make fun of me?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Let's think about ways to build resilience against those comments. If a classmate makes a remark that hurts you, how could you respond or reframe that situation in a way that protects your self-esteem?

User: I suppose I could try to focus on not taking it personally and remind myself that it’s their issue, not mine.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a fantastic strategy. Remember, their comments say more about them than they do about you. Do you feel comfortable practicing a response to a hypothetical comment from a classmate right now?

User: I can try. Maybe if someone says something rude, I could just say, “I’m happy being me.”

Consultant: That’s a powerful statement! It reinforces your self-worth. Practicing this response can help you feel more confident in real situations. How do you feel about role-playing a scenario where a classmate makes a negative comment?

User: Okay, let's give it a shot.

Consultant: Great! Imagine you’re at school, and a classmate says something hurtful about you. How would you respond using the affirmation we discussed?

User: Um, I would say, “You know, I’m proud of who I am, and that’s what matters to me.”

Consultant: That’s a wonderful response! By asserting your pride, you’re standing firm in your self-identity. How does practicing this make you feel about your ability to handle similar situations in the future?

User: I feel a bit more confident just saying it!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic sign of progress! Building that confidence is key. Remember, frequent practice can help reinforce these feelings. Do you think you could begin using this affirmation regularly, especially before school events?

User: Yes, I can try to think of it before going to class or during breaks.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. We can also explore activities you enjoy to enhance your self-esteem further. What are some things you love doing that make you feel good about yourself?

User: I like drawing and playing games with friends. It feels nice when we all have fun together.

Consultant: Those are great activities! Engaging in things that bring you joy is essential. How about setting some time aside for those activities as a way to uplift your mood and reinforce your self-worth?

User: I think that could help me feel better.

Consultant: It will definitely help! Balancing self-care with school responsibilities is essential. As we wrap up, let’s recap what you've learned today. You’ve got some affirmations ready and have practiced responses to cope with peer comments. How does that feel to you?

User: It feels good to have some strategies to use.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Always remember to be kind to yourself while practicing these techniques. As we continue in our next sessions, we can delve deeper into your experiences and how to strengthen your self-identity further. Do you have any final thoughts or questions today?

User: No, I think I’m good for now. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the steps you're taking. I look forward to seeing you next time and hearing about your progress.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Little L! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately with your social activities and school?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better since I started participating in more activities outside of class, but I still doubt my worth sometimes. It’s frustrating.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you're getting more involved! That’s a positive step. Can you tell me more about what specific activities you're enjoying and how they make you feel?

User: I joined a drama club, and it’s been fun. I can express myself more freely there, but when I'm not with my friends, I still feel insecure.

Consultant: Participating in the drama club sounds like a wonderful way to express yourself! It’s normal to feel insecure at times, especially in social situations. What do you think happens in your mind when you’re feeling insecure?

User: I keep thinking that I'm not good enough and that people are judging me. It makes me nervous to talk to others.

Consultant: I understand. Those thoughts can be really powerful and discouraging. When you think you’re not good enough, how does that affect your feelings towards interacting with others?

User: I just want to avoid talking to people. It feels safer, but then I miss out on having fun with friends.

Consultant: That’s a tough spot to be in. It seems like you’re torn between wanting to connect with your friends and the fear that holds you back. How do you usually cope when those insecure thoughts come up?

User: I just stay quiet most of the time. I don’t want to draw attention to myself, especially when I feel that way.

Consultant: Staying quiet can feel like a safe choice, but it can also make you feel more isolated. Let’s think about ways to challenge those thoughts. If a friend were feeling what you’re feeling, what would you tell them?

User: I guess I would say that everyone has their own insecurities and that they shouldn’t worry too much about what others think.

Consultant: Exactly! You have a supportive perspective for others. Now, how can we apply that same kindness towards yourself? What would it look like for you to speak to yourself like you would to a friend?

User: Maybe I could try reminding myself that it’s okay to be different and that I do have friends who like me for who I am.

Consultant: That sounds like a good approach! How about we work on some specific affirmations or thoughts you can remind yourself of when those doubts come back? 

User: Sure. I could say, “I am enough just the way I am,” and “I have friends who appreciate me.”

Consultant: I love those affirmations! Practicing them regularly could help reinforce your self-esteem. How do you feel about sharing these thoughts with someone you trust, like a friend or family member?

User: I think that could be helpful, but I'm still a bit scared.

Consultant: That's completely understandable. It’s a big step to share your feelings. How about starting small, maybe by sharing your experiences in the drama club or something you enjoy with a friend?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. I might tell them how much fun I’m having.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Sharing your positive experiences can help build connections. Let’s also think about how to work on those feelings of nervousness. What activities or interactions could we plan together that might make you feel more comfortable and confident?

User: Maybe I could practice talking to a few classmates in a group setting. That feels less intimidating.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Gradually practicing in group settings can definitely help. How about setting a small goal for our next session? Perhaps aim to speak to a few classmates about your interests?

User: I can try to do that! I think it might be easier if I focus on talking about things I really enjoy.

Consultant: Absolutely, focusing on your passions can make conversations feel more natural. Remember, it’s a process, and every small step counts. How do you feel about our plan moving forward?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It helps to talk about these things and get advice.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Little L! You’ve already made significant strides. Just keep practicing those affirmations and try sharing your interests. Our next session can be a great time to reflect on your experiences. 

User: Sounds good to me! I’ll give it a shot.

Consultant: I'm looking forward to hearing all about it! Until then, remember to be kind to yourself and take those small steps towards feeling confident. You’ve got this!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’ll see you next time, and keep in mind you can celebrate your efforts along the way. Take care!

User: You too!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, especially after your music class recognition?

User: Hi. I feel a bit better since I got praise in music class. But I still think about what my classmates said about me. It still bothers me sometimes.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've received positive feedback for your talents! However, it's also understandable that those negative comments linger in your mind. Can you share more about how their remarks affect your feelings?

User: Well, I often feel embarrassed about my body and how I speak. Sometimes I worry that I won't be able to fit in with the others. 

Consultant: That sounds tough, and it's completely natural to feel that way, especially at your age. Building confidence can be a challenge when you're facing those kinds of pressures. Have you managed to share these feelings with anyone, like your family?

User: Not really. I used to think they wouldn't understand, but I have talked to them a little more lately. It feels different now.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you've been talking to your family more! Sharing your feelings can help create understanding. What feedback have you received from them about your worries?

User: They listened, which was nice. They told me that I’m perfect the way I am, but I still find it hard to believe sometimes. 

Consultant: That’s encouraging to hear that they support you! It can be challenging to believe in those positive qualities, especially when we face negativity. What do you think makes it hard for you to accept their words?

User: I think because I still see the things I don’t like about myself, especially when others point them out. It feels like I'm not enough.

Consultant: It sounds like you're caught in a cycle where negative feedback outweighs the positive. Let’s explore a bit: can you think of some specific qualities you possess that you appreciate about yourself? 

User: I know I’m good at music, and my friends say I'm nice and funny. But it just doesn’t feel like enough sometimes.

Consultant: Those are wonderful qualities! Being good at music and being a nice friend are valuable traits. How could you remind yourself of these strengths when negative thoughts surface? 

User: Maybe I could write them down? But I haven't done that yet. 

Consultant: Writing them down could be a great start! It could help you visualize your strengths and develop a counter to those negative thoughts. Would you be open to trying that this week?

User: Yeah, I could give it a try! It sounds helpful. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Along with that, let's think about setting small goals for the week to reinforce your self-worth. Is there something specific you’d like to achieve? 

User: I want to share more of my music progress with my family. Maybe play something for them. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic goal! Sharing your music not only allows you to express yourself but also invites appreciation from your family. How do you think they would react when you play for them?

User: I think they would love it. They always say nice things about my music.

Consultant: Absolutely! Their support could boost your confidence even more. How about we plan a time for you to perform for them? 

User: I’ll do it this weekend! 

Consultant: That’s a great plan! It's exciting to think about sharing that moment with your family. As you prepare, what can you tell yourself to stay positive about the performance?

User: I can remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that they’ll still support me.

Consultant: That’s a very healthy mindset! It’s important to remember that everyone makes mistakes, and what matters most is that you’re sharing your passion. How do you feel about this upcoming performance now that we've talked about it?

User: I feel a bit more excited and less nervous. Thinking about their support helps.

Consultant: That's so encouraging to hear! Keep focusing on those supportive thoughts. As we continue to work on building your confidence, what areas do you feel you still want to improve in?

User: I want to feel more confident in social situations, especially with my classmates.

Consultant: Building confidence in those interactions is an important goal. We can work on social skills and coping strategies for those situations. Do you have any specific social situations in mind that you find challenging?

User: Sometimes during group work, I struggle to share my thoughts. I worry others won’t like my ideas.

Consultant: That’s a common worry, but your ideas are just as valuable as anyone else's. Let’s practice some strategies for expressing your thoughts. How do you feel about starting with small contributions in these settings?

User: I could try to say something short first, then build up from there.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Starting small can ease anxiety and help you get comfortable sharing. It’s like practicing before a performance! How do we want to phrase your first few contributions for your next group work?

User: Maybe something like, "I have an idea that could be helpful." 

Consultant: Perfect! That sounds clear and open. I believe with time and practice, you'll start feeling more confident about contributing. How are you feeling about our session today? 

User: I feel more hopeful now. I think I can actually work on these things.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! I'm really proud of the steps you’re taking. Remember, each small victory counts. Before we conclude today, let’s summarize what you've decided to work on for this week.

User: I’ll write down my strengths, perform for my family, and try to contribute more during group work.

Consultant: Those are fantastic goals! I’m looking forward to hearing how these go in our next session. Thank you for sharing with me today, and remember, I'm here to support you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate it. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Until next time, take care of yourself.
###################
Consultant: Hello, L! I'm glad to see you again. It's good to hear about your recent positive experiences at home. How are you feeling about everything that’s been happening lately?

User: Hi! I feel a bit better now that I'm sharing positive experiences with my parents. But I still worry about school sometimes, especially about the bullying.

Consultant: It's great to hear that your relationship with your parents is improving. Sharing positive experiences can really help strengthen that bond. Let's talk a bit more about school. How have things been with your classmates lately?

User: Some days are okay, but other days I still feel anxious, especially when I'm around the kids who bullied me. I just try to avoid them, but it makes me feel even more isolated.

Consultant: I understand that avoiding those situations can seem like a quick fix, but it might also be adding to your feelings of isolation. What are some ways you've been managing those feelings of anxiety when you're at school?

User: I usually just look down or keep to myself, hoping they won't notice me. But in class, I really want to participate more and feel included.

Consultant: Wanting to participate more is a positive goal! Have you thought about any small steps you could take to engage with your classmates or teachers, despite the anxiety?

User: Maybe I could try to answer questions in class or join a group project. But I feel like I'd just embarrass myself.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way. Remember, it’s okay to make mistakes, and everyone does! If you were talking to a friend who felt the same way, what advice would you give them?

User: I’d probably tell them that it's okay, and that people might not judge as harshly as they think. 

Consultant: Exactly! That same compassion you have for others is something you can offer yourself, too. Can we explore a situation where you felt comfortable contributing, even just a little? 

User: I guess there was a group activity in class where I felt confident because I knew the topic well. I helped my teammates, and it felt nice!

Consultant: That's a wonderful example! It shows you have the ability and knowledge to contribute positively. How did that experience impact your feelings about participating in class?

User: It made me feel good, like I can be part of the group. But I still worry that it won’t happen again.

Consultant: That’s understandable, but you have the evidence that you can succeed in those situations. What do you think would help you build on that confidence when you try to participate again?

User: Maybe if I remind myself of that experience, it might help. 

Consultant: Absolutely! You can visualize that moment, and that positive reinforcement can help combat any negative thoughts. How about setting a small goal for the next class to encourage that participation?

User: I could aim to answer at least one question. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great first step! If you do this, let’s talk about how it goes in our next session. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! 

Consultant: Before we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed. You’re feeling more confident at home and recognize your ability to contribute positively at school. Setting a goal to answer questions in class should help reinforce that confidence. 

User: Yes, that makes sense! 

Consultant: As we conclude today, remember that progress takes time and is full of ups and downs. It’s great that you’re open to taking these steps. How do you feel about heading back to school with these new strategies?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful now. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, L! Keep reminding yourself of your strengths. We’ll review your progress next time. And remember, feel free to share any experiences or challenges you encounter in between our sessions. 

User: Thank you! I will do my best. 

Consultant: I believe in you! Have a great week, and I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time.
