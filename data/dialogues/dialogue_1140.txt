Consultant: Hello, Yang! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really lonely and insecure. Ever since the public servant exam last month, it feels like everyone is laughing at me. I can't shake the feeling that people are talking behind my back.

Consultant: I hear you—it sounds very difficult to deal with those feelings of loneliness and self-doubt, especially when you feel like others are judging you. Let’s explore that together. Can you tell me more about how these feelings affect your daily life?

User: It’s like I’m stuck in a routine—class, cafeteria, and dorm. I don’t have any friends, and I don’t really want to interact with anyone. I thought university would be more exciting, but it feels dull and isolating.

Consultant: I understand how that can be frustrating. It seems like you’re longing for connection but feeling unable to reach out. What do you think is stopping you from making those connections?

User: I guess I’m just afraid of being judged. I think people see me as a failure now, especially after the exam. It just reinforces my insecurities.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. It’s natural to fear negative judgments, especially when you’re feeling vulnerable. Can you think of specific thoughts that go through your mind when you feel judged by others?

User: I keep thinking, "They must think I'm incompetent" or "I’ll never be good enough." It’s like this loop of negative thoughts that just won’t stop.

Consultant: It sounds like those automatic thoughts are quite harsh and discouraging. Let’s take a moment to examine them. When you think, "I’ll never be good enough," how does that make you feel? 

User: It makes me feel hopeless, like what’s the point of trying anymore?

Consultant: That feeling of hopelessness can be heavy to carry. Let’s challenge that thought a bit. Is there any evidence that supports or contradicts the belief that you’ll never be good enough?

User: I guess I did well in some of my classes, but I can't help but focus on that one failure.

Consultant: It’s understandable to focus on significant setbacks, but it’s also important to look at your achievements. What if you were to think about how you would support a friend feeling the same way? What would you say to them?

User: I would probably tell them that one failure doesn’t define their worth or abilities.

Consultant: Exactly. You have the ability to recognize that in others, so let’s work on extending that kindness to yourself. What might it look like to begin to shift that narrative about your abilities? 

User: I think I could start by remembering my successes and trying to be more compassionate towards myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan. Building self-compassion can take practice, but it’s certainly achievable. What are some small steps you could take to remind yourself of your strengths?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal of my accomplishments and try to challenge my negative thoughts more consciously.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Keeping a journal can help you track your progress and reflect on the good moments. How do you feel about actively engaging in social situations, even though it feels uncomfortable?

User: I think it would be hard, but maybe I could start with simple things, like greeting someone I see often.

Consultant: That’s a perfect place to start! Those small interactions can help build your confidence over time. What about planning a low-pressure activity, like joining a study group or attending a campus event? 

User: I could consider that. It feels daunting, but also kind of exciting to think about meeting new people.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! It’s okay to feel a mix of excitement and anxiety. As you prepare for these interactions, what strategies can you use to help manage those fears?

User: I could tell myself that it’s alright to be nervous and that everyone has their own insecurities. 

Consultant: Absolutely—recognizing that you’re not alone in feeling this way can be comforting. Let’s also work on visualizing a positive interaction. Can you imagine how you might feel if you connected with someone during an activity?

User: I can picture feeling more accepted and maybe even enjoying the conversation. 

Consultant: That visualization is powerful. It shows that there’s potential for positive outcomes. As you prepare for these upcoming activities, what’s one thing you would like to remind yourself?

User: I’d like to remember that I am capable of change and that I deserve to feel connected to others.

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation, Yang. Let’s wrap up today’s session by summarizing what you’ve learned and planned. What are your main takeaways from our discussion today?

User: I realized that I need to challenge my negative thoughts, focus on my accomplishments, and take small steps to connect with others. 

Consultant: You’ve made significant realizations today, Yang. How do you feel about your progress and the steps ahead?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful about trying to change my situation. It’s still daunting, but I think I can start addressing it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, change is a process, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. Before we end our session, what would you like to focus on before our next meeting?

User: I’d like to try journaling my thoughts and perhaps set a goal to greet someone next week.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress. Just remember, you’re not alone in this journey, and I’m here to support you. Take care, and I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Hello Yang! I'm glad you're here for our session today. It sounds like you're feeling quite anxious about your upcoming graduation and the uncertainties it brings. Can you share more about how this is affecting you?

User: Hi. Yes, I'm really confused and overwhelmed. I have this constant worry about what will happen after I graduate. I feel like I lack the skills and confidence to step into the workforce. It's just stressful thinking about it.

Consultant: I understand how overwhelming this can feel, especially with such a big transition ahead. It sounds like you're wrestling with a lot of uncertainty about your abilities and the future. What specific thoughts or worries do you have about entering the job market?

User: I worry that I won't be able to find a job in my field. I'm not sure what I want to do, and that just adds to my anxiety. I feel like everyone else knows what they want, but I'm just lost.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those feelings, especially when so many changes are coming your way. Let’s take a closer look at those thoughts. You mentioned feeling lost; can you describe what that feels like or what thoughts come to your mind when you think about your future?

User: It feels like a heavy weight on my chest. I think about how I might disappoint my parents or waste my degree. Sometimes, I tell myself I’m just not good enough compared to others.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Yang. It’s important to recognize how those negative thoughts are affecting your emotions. When you tell yourself you're not good enough, how does that make you feel in the moment?

User: It makes me feel even more anxious. I spiral into thinking that I’ll never succeed or find a good job. It’s like I’m stuck in this loop of self-doubt.

Consultant: I hear you. That loop of self-doubt can be very tricky to navigate. Let's challenge some of those thoughts together. You mentioned that you might not succeed—what evidence do you have that supports this belief? Could there be other explanations for your situation?

User: I guess I don't really have solid proof. It's mainly just how I feel. I think I see my classmates who seem more capable and prepared, and that makes me worry I’m behind them.

Consultant: It's understandable to compare yourself to others, but it can also lead to feeling inadequate. If a friend shared those concerns with you, how might you encourage them? What would you say to help them see things differently?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone has their own journey and it's okay to not have everything figured out. I would remind them of their strengths.

Consultant: That's a great perspective! We can apply that same kindness and understanding to yourself. So, what strengths do you feel you have that could help you in the job search or your future career?

User: I think I'm a good communicator when I get comfortable. I also enjoy learning new things, and I can adapt pretty well. But when I'm anxious, I forget about these strengths.

Consultant: Those are valuable strengths! It’s great that you can communicate well and adapt to new situations. It can be helpful to remind yourself of these qualities, especially when feeling anxious. How might we incorporate these strengths into a plan for exploring your career interests?

User: Maybe I could try reaching out to some alumni or professionals in fields I'm interested in. It would help me learn more and see if I'm really interested in those areas.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Networking can provide insight and reduce some of that anxiety. How about we set some specific goals for you to take these steps? What would be something manageable for you to start with?

User: I think I could start by sending a few emails to my school's alumni. I could ask them about their careers and how they got there. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start! Setting small, achievable goals can help ease some anxiety while building your confidence. How about aiming to reach out to a couple of alumni by the end of next week? 

User: Yes, that sounds doable! I think I can manage that.

Consultant: Great! Now, beyond the practical steps, are there any techniques you might want to practice that could help reduce your anxiety when meeting new people or engaging in these discussions?

User: I’ve heard about deep breathing exercises. Would that help?

Consultant: Absolutely! Deep breathing can be a simple yet effective way to ground yourself and manage anxiety. Would you like to practice a brief breathing exercise together right now?

User: Sure, I’d like that.

Consultant: Let’s try this: take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four… hold it for a count of four… and now slowly exhale through your mouth for a count of six. Let’s do that a couple of times.

User: That felt nice. I already feel a bit more relaxed.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! We can incorporate techniques like this into your routine to help manage anxiety during social situations. As we wrap up today’s session, what is one key takeaway you would like to remember?

User: I need to recognize my strengths and take small steps towards my goals. And I guess practicing breathing can help me stay calm.

Consultant: Those are excellent takeaways, Yang! It’s important to be kind to yourself while taking these steps. Remember, you’ve got this, and every small step counts. If you feel anxious, practice your breathing and remind yourself of your strengths. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Yang! I'm glad you could make it today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit uncertain. I tried that social event we talked about, but I was so nervous that I couldn't really interact and ended up feeling disappointed afterwards.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like the experience didn’t go as you hoped, and that must be discouraging. Can you share a bit more about what you were feeling during that event?

User: I felt really anxious the whole time. My heart was racing, and I kept thinking that everyone was judging me. I wanted to be more outgoing, but I just froze up.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Yang. It's completely understandable to feel that pressure in social situations. What thoughts were running through your mind that made you feel like everyone was judging you?

User: I kept thinking that if I said something wrong, they would laugh at me or think I'm awkward. I felt like I just didn’t belong there.

Consultant: Those thoughts can create a lot of anxiety. Let’s examine them together. What evidence do you have that the others were judging you in that way? 

User: I don’t really have any solid evidence, to be honest. It’s just this nagging feeling that everyone else is more confident and knows what to say.

Consultant: That’s a vital observation. Sometimes our feelings can distort our perception of reality. If a friend shared similar thoughts with you, how might you reassure them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that most people are focused on themselves, not on judging others.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you have a more compassionate perspective when considering someone else's feelings. Let’s practice applying that same understanding to yourself. 

User: I guess I’ve been too hard on myself. It’s just frustrating because I want to be more outgoing.

Consultant: Wanting to connect with others is a good goal, Yang. Let’s look at some small steps you could take to practice being more outgoing. Do you have any ideas on how you might start?

User: Maybe I could try starting a conversation with a classmate or someone in the dorm? 

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! What might you say to start that conversation? 

User: I could ask about their major or something related to classes. It feels safer than just jumping into personal topics.

Consultant: Yes, starting with something neutral like that is a wonderful strategy! How do you feel about trying that out this week?

User: I think I can do that. It might still be nerve-wracking, but I will give it a shot.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous about it. Remember, it’s about taking small, manageable steps. How will you reward yourself for trying, regardless of how it goes?

User: I could treat myself to my favorite snack or watch a movie afterward to unwind.

Consultant: That sounds like a nice way to acknowledge your effort! It’s important to celebrate your courage to step out of your comfort zone. How will you manage any negative thoughts that might come up before or during the conversation?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to be imperfect and that everyone feels nervous sometimes. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic thought! Keeping that in mind can help you remain grounded. Let's set a goal: after you initiate that conversation, how about checking in with me next session to discuss how it went?

User: Sure, that sounds good. I think talking about it afterward will help me process my feelings.

Consultant: Great! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experience. Before we wrap up today, is there anything else on your mind regarding social situations?

User: I suppose I’m just worried about repeating the same mistakes. I don't want to feel like this forever.

Consultant: It’s natural to worry about that, but remember, growth takes time. Each small step you take can lead to improvement. We’ll work together to help you build those social skills gradually.

User: Thank you! That makes me feel a bit better. I appreciate your support in this process.

Consultant: You're doing great, Yang! We’ll continue to tackle this together. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. I believe in your ability to feel more comfortable in social settings. 

User: Thanks! I'll do my best, and I hope I can share some positive outcomes next time.

Consultant: I look forward to it! Take care of yourself this week, and remember to be gentle with yourself. See you next time! 

User: See you!

Consultant: Hello, Yang! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling somewhat better about socializing. I've tried joining some club activities and even talked with a few classmates, but I still feel unsure about my performance in social situations.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step forward. It’s great to hear you’re making an effort to connect with others. Can you tell me more about those experiences? What specific moments have made you feel uncertain?

User: I guess during conversations, I often worry that I’m not interesting enough or that I'm saying the wrong things. I want to engage better but sometimes my mind just goes blank.

Consultant: It’s common to feel that way, especially when you're putting yourself in new social contexts. Let's explore some of those thoughts. When you say you're not interesting enough, what evidence do you have to support that belief?

User: I don’t have many exciting things to share, and I sometimes notice my classmates seem more confident or charismatic than I am.

Consultant: I understand how that can be discouraging. But let's challenge that thought a bit. If a friend told you they felt the same way, what would you say to help them see their value?

User: I guess I would remind them that everyone has something unique to offer, even if it seems minor.

Consultant: Exactly! Everyone has their own unique qualities and stories to tell. It might help to remind yourself of that too. Can you think of any qualities or experiences you bring to social situations that are valuable?

User: I suppose I have a good sense of humor, and I try to be a good listener. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Good listening skills and a sense of humor are great assets in conversations. Next time you find yourself doubting your contributions, try focusing on those qualities instead. How does that feel to consider?

User: It feels a bit comforting to think about it that way. I just hope it translates in actual conversations.

Consultant: It’s a process, and it’s okay to take it step by step. To help you feel more prepared, would you like to brainstorm some strategies for initiating conversations or responding to others?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful! I often freeze up when trying to start a chat.

Consultant: Let’s practice some open-ended questions you could use. For instance, you might ask someone about their favorite activities or how they ended up in the club. What do you think you’d feel comfortable asking?

User: I think asking about their interests might work, like what hobbies they enjoy. 

Consultant: That’s a great choice! It shows you’re interested in getting to know them better. How about responses? If they share something interesting, how could you keep the conversation going?

User: Maybe I could share my related experiences or ask follow-up questions about what they like.

Consultant: Perfect! Sharing related experiences can create a connection. Let’s outline a few key phrases or ideas you can use when conversations start to slow down. Would you like to create a few?

User: Yes, I’d really like to have a little guide to refer to when I feel lost.

Consultant: Absolutely! Here’s a simple one: "That sounds interesting! How did you get into that?" or "I love that too! What do you enjoy most about it?" Does that resonate with you?

User: Yes! Those sound easy to use, and I can remember them.

Consultant: Fantastic! Having these little tools at your disposal can boost your confidence. Now, let’s reflect on how you can practice these strategies. Can you think of an opportunity this week to try them out?

User: There’s a group meeting on Friday I could attend. I’ll try to use those questions then.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! It’s a perfect chance to reinforce what we’ve discussed. How do you feel about approaching this meeting now?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also more prepared. I really want to make a good impression.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel nervous, but your preparation will help. Remember to be kind to yourself; it’s okay if not everything goes perfectly. What could you tell yourself during that meeting to keep calm?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that it’s all about having fun and making connections, not being perfect.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset to have! Focusing on connection rather than perfection can reduce a lot of pressure. As our session comes to a close, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway today?

User: I think I’ve gained some new strategies for starting conversations and responding, which makes me feel more hopeful!

Consultant: That’s great to hear, Yang! I’m really proud of your progress. As we wrap up today's session, remember these strategies and give yourself some grace. If you face challenges, we will work on them together in our next meeting. 

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to practicing and hopefully feeling better about it all.

Consultant: You're welcome! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need support before then.

Consultant: Hello, Yang! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling about your recent internship and the communication challenges you've encountered?

User: Hi! I've been quite confused about how to communicate effectively with my colleagues. It feels like I don't know how to express my thoughts clearly, and I'm worried about making a bad impression.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way, especially in a new environment. Let's explore this together. Can you tell me about a specific situation where you felt communication was challenging?

User: Sure! Just last week, I had to present a project idea to my team. I was so nervous that I stumbled over my words and felt that my colleagues weren’t really following what I was saying.

Consultant: It sounds like that was a stressful experience for you. What thoughts were running through your mind during the presentation?

User: I kept thinking that I was going to embarrass myself or that they would judge my ideas as bad. It made me even more anxious.

Consultant: Those thoughts can indeed be overwhelming. It's important to recognize how they affect your feelings. Do you think those thoughts were based on any specific evidence, or could there be another way to view the situation?

User: I guess they weren't really based on anything concrete. I just assumed they wouldn't like my ideas without them even giving feedback.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! It's common to jump to conclusions like that. If a friend were in your position, how would you suggest they see the situation?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on sharing their ideas and not to worry too much about what others think. They might be surprised by the support!

Consultant: Exactly! It seems you have the insight to challenge those negative thoughts. Let's try to reframe your perspective for future interactions. What if you approached your next meeting with curiosity rather than fear? 

User: That might help! If I see it as a chance to learn and engage rather than just perform, I could probably feel less pressure.

Consultant: Yes! Adopting a learner's mindset could reduce the pressure you feel. What small steps can you take to practice this in your upcoming communications?

User: Maybe I could prepare a few key points ahead of time and remind myself that it’s okay to ask for feedback during discussions.

Consultant: Those sound like great strategies! Preparation can help build your confidence. How do you feel about implementing this approach moving forward?

User: I feel more hopeful. If I can keep reminding myself to be open to feedback, I think it might make a difference.

Consultant: That positive shift in mindset is important! It's important to celebrate each small success as you implement these strategies. What kind of support do you think you might need as you practice these new skills?

User: I think just having someone to talk to about my experiences would be helpful. Maybe I can discuss my progress with a classmate or mentor.

Consultant: Great idea! Sharing your thoughts with a peer or mentor can provide you with feedback and encouragement. How does that feel to you, having that support?

User: It feels reassuring. I don't feel as alone in this process anymore.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Remember, it's normal to face challenges as you build your communication skills. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what you’ve learned. What do you think is your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I’ve learned that I can challenge my negative thoughts and that it’s okay to seek feedback. I also realized that approaching situations with curiosity can help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing that you have the tools to challenge negative thoughts and to seek support is a big step forward. How confident do you feel about applying these insights in the future?

User: I feel much more confident now. I'm excited to see how these changes will impact my interactions!

Consultant: I'm glad you feel that way! Keep practicing what we've discussed. As you look ahead, what will you do to maintain the progress you've made?

User: I’ll keep reminding myself of what I've learned, and I’ll definitely reach out for support when I feel stuck.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Remember, growth is a journey, and you’re already on the right path. If you need more guidance in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you, I appreciate your guidance. I feel much better about everything now.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Yang! It's been a pleasure working with you, and I believe you have the skills to navigate your career challenges successfully. Best of luck with everything, and take care!

Consultant: Hi Yang! It's great to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially with your internship coming to an end?

User: Hello. I've been feeling pretty good, actually. I’ve adjusted well to the internship, and I’m starting to feel excited about my future career. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It sounds like the internship has had a positive impact on you. Can you share more about what aspects of the internship you enjoyed the most?

User: I think I enjoyed the hands-on experience and being able to apply what I’ve learned in school. It felt rewarding to see my efforts translate into real work.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Applying your knowledge in a practical setting can really enhance your confidence. What do you think this experience has taught you about your future career?

User: It taught me that I enjoy working in a team and that I can contribute ideas. I feel more confident in my abilities now.

Consultant: Feeling confident in your contributions is a huge step forward. How do you envision maintaining this confidence as you transition into a full-time job after graduation?

User: I guess I need to keep reminding myself of the skills I've developed and continue to seek feedback from others to improve.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Seeking feedback is a great way to grow. Are there any specific strategies you have in mind for staying open to feedback in your future work environment?

User: I think I could set up regular check-ins with my supervisor or colleagues. That way, I can understand their perspectives and suggestions.

Consultant: Absolutely, regular check-ins can provide valuable insights and keep you grounded. What else do you think you could focus on to ensure you continue developing professionally?

User: I want to keep learning new things and perhaps take some extra courses related to my field. I believe that will help me stay relevant and grow further.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach—continuous learning can significantly enhance your career development. Are there specific topics or skills you’re interested in pursuing further?

User: I’m particularly interested in improving my communication skills and maybe exploring digital marketing since it's becoming increasingly important in my field.

Consultant: Those are both valuable areas to focus on! Improving communication skills can help you collaborate effectively, and understanding digital marketing will certainly enhance your marketability. How do you feel about setting some goals around these interests?

User: I think that would be helpful. Maybe I can target at least one course this semester, and practice communication skills in group projects.

Consultant: Setting that goal sounds very achievable. It’s also a proactive way to continue growing. What emotions are you experiencing as you think about these goals and your future career?

User: I feel hopeful and motivated. I really want to make the most of my opportunities and not let fear hold me back anymore.

Consultant: It’s fantastic that you’re feeling hopeful and motivated! Acknowledging fear is important, but it seems like you’re ready to face it. Can you recall a time when you successfully overcame a fear or challenge before?

User: Yes, during my internship, I had to give a presentation. At first, I was terrified, but I practiced a lot, and when the time came, it went really well. 

Consultant: That’s an amazing achievement! Overcoming that fear shows your resilience and ability to prepare effectively. How can you use that experience to confront future challenges?

User: I can remind myself of that success. Planning and practice really do help me feel more comfortable.

Consultant: Remembering past successes can indeed be a great motivator. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize what you’ve accomplished and how you can carry this momentum forward.

User: Sure! I’ve recognized my growth from the internship, identified areas for further development, and created a plan to enhance my skills.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve made significant progress. As you move forward, what’s one key takeaway you'd like to remember that can help you stay focused on your goals?

User: I want to remember that preparation and seeking feedback are key to overcoming my fears. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway, Yang! You’ve done really well, and I believe you have the tools to continue succeeding in your career. If you ever feel overwhelmed or need support in this journey, feel free to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. It feels good to have someone to talk to about these things.
