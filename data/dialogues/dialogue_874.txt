Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyan! I’m really glad you’re here today. Before we dive into our session, I want to check in with you about how you’ve been feeling recently. What has been on your mind?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really down lately. It’s tough adjusting to middle school, and I feel so alone. I cry a lot, and my schoolwork is a mess. I wish I could just feel normal again.

Consultant: I hear you, Xiaoyan. It sounds like this transition has been really overwhelming for you, leading to these feelings of loneliness and sadness. Let’s take some time to explore what specifically has been causing this emotional strain. Can you share more about what’s been challenging for you in this new environment?

User: Well, everything seems so different. The classes are harder, and I'm having trouble keeping up. I don’t have any friends here yet, so I feel like I have no one to talk to about it.

Consultant: That’s really tough, and it makes sense that you’d feel lost without a support system. It’s a big change, and feeling disconnected can heighten these feelings. What kind of thoughts go through your mind when you struggle with your schoolwork or feel alone?

User: I often think that I’m not good enough. I see other kids doing well and feel like I’m falling behind. I keep thinking, “Why can’t I get this?” It makes me feel useless.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy to carry. It sounds like you’re being quite harsh on yourself. Let’s take a closer look at those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you’re not good enough? Have you had any successes, even small ones?

User: I guess I did manage to complete some homework, but it just feels like not enough. I mostly just see my mistakes. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to focus on mistakes, especially when you’re feeling low. However, recognizing those small achievements is also important, as they show your effort. Let’s challenge that “not good enough” belief. If a friend was feeling this way, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably say to be kinder to themselves and that it’s okay to struggle sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! It’s easier to be compassionate towards others than ourselves, though. Remember, struggling doesn’t mean you’re not capable. It’s part of the learning process. What if you allowed yourself to experience these challenges without labeling them as failures?

User: That could help. I guess it’s just hard to change how I think. 

Consultant: Absolutely, it's a process. One way to start shifting those thoughts is to practice reframing them. For instance, instead of thinking, "I'm useless," you might say, "I’m learning, and it’s okay to make mistakes." Have you ever tried writing down your thoughts and then rewriting them in a kinder way?

User: I haven’t, but it sounds like it could be helpful. 

Consultant: Writing can be a powerful tool for clarity and change. It can help you see things from a different perspective. Let’s discuss some specific ways we can set up a few small actions for you to take this week, such as keeping a journal. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Great! We can make it a fun experiment. Each day, you could write down a few things that went well or a positive thought. Over time, you might notice patterns that can help shift your mindset. What other activities do you think might help you feel more connected at school?

User: Maybe joining a club? I’ve thought about art club because I like drawing.

Consultant: Joining a club sounds like an excellent idea! It can be a great way to meet new friends who share your interests. Art can also be a wonderful outlet for expressing your feelings. Would you be interested in setting a goal to check out the art club this week?

User: Yes, I think I’ll give it a try!

Consultant: That's fantastic, Xiaoyan! Trying out new things can help you feel more engaged and less isolated. As we wrap up, let’s reflect on what we discussed today. How do you feel about the steps we talked about?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Writing things down and joining the art club seem like good ideas. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it’s okay to take your time adjusting to these changes. You’re already taking positive steps towards feeling better. Just as a reminder, if you ever feel overwhelmed, reaching out for support from someone in school can be really beneficial, too. 

User: Thank you! I’ll keep that in mind. 

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xiaoyan! I’m proud of the work you’re doing. We’ll continue to build on this in our next session. Remember, I’m here to support you. Take care until next time!

Consultant: Hello Xiaoyan! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I guess I've been okay, but not really. I keep thinking about my last exam. I did badly, and now I’m starting to doubt if I’m actually smart enough for school. 

Consultant: It sounds like that experience has really shaken your confidence. You’re feeling uncertain about your abilities. Can you share more about what thoughts are going through your mind when you think about that exam?

User: I just keep replaying it in my head. I thought I studied well, but my grades don't show that. Maybe I am not good at this, and I’ll never improve.

Consultant: I hear you. Feeling like your hard work isn’t reflected in your results can be really discouraging. It seems like you’re stuck in a loop of negative thoughts. Have you noticed how these thoughts impact your feelings or motivation towards studying?

User: Yes, I feel really anxious whenever I sit down to study now. I keep worrying that I won’t remember anything or that I'll fail again. 

Consultant: So, this anxiety is making it harder for you to study effectively. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit. When you think, “I’ll fail again,” what emotions come up for you?

User: I feel scared and kind of hopeless. It makes me want to give up before I even start. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel scared and hopeless in that situation. Let’s try something: What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you’ll fail again? Are there any examples that might challenge that thought?

User: Well, I did pass other tests before, but this one was just really hard. 

Consultant: That’s an important observation, Xiaoyan. You’ve succeeded before, and that shows you are capable. Could it be possible that this was just one challenging exam rather than an indication of your overall ability?

User: Maybe… I guess one test doesn’t define me, but it feels so personal. 

Consultant: It makes sense that it feels personal, especially when you’ve invested effort into studying. Let’s try to shift that perspective a little. Imagine if a friend shared a similar experience with you—how would you advise them after they faced a tough exam?

User: I would probably tell them not to be too hard on themselves and to keep trying. 

Consultant: Exactly! You would encourage them to keep pushing forward. Why not offer yourself the same kindness? Setting small, achievable goals could help you regain that confidence. What’s a small goal you could set for yourself this week?

User: Maybe I could study for 30 minutes a day instead of trying to do everything at once.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, Xiaoyan! It’s realistic and manageable. How do you think creating this structure might help ease some of your anxiety?

User: I think if I have a set time, it’ll be less overwhelming. I can just focus on those 30 minutes. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Breaking it down into smaller steps can certainly make it feel less daunting. Alongside this, would it be helpful for you to develop some strategies to cope with the nervous feelings before an exam?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I always just freeze up.

Consultant: We can work on some techniques, like deep breathing or visualization, to help calm your mind before tests. Would you like to try a simple breathing exercise together?

User: Sure, that sounds good!

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four… hold for four… and exhale slowly for a count of six. How do you feel after trying that?

User: That actually feels nice. I feel a bit calmer.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Practicing this technique before studying or an exam could help anchor you when anxiety rises. How do you feel about implementing both the small study goal and the breathing exercises this week?

User: I think I can do that. It feels more manageable than trying to study for hours.

Consultant: Absolutely! This way, you’re allowing yourself grace and room to grow. As we wrap up, let’s reflect on your progress. What are you taking away from our session today?

User: I’m realizing that I can be kinder to myself and that one exam doesn’t mean I’m not capable. 

Consultant: That’s a crucial realization, Xiaoyan! Remember, this is about growth and learning. If you face challenges, it’s perfectly normal. Would you like to commit to checking in about your experiences during our next session?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful.

Consultant: Awesome! I'm here to support you through this journey. You’re taking positive steps, and I believe in you. I look forward to hearing how you’re doing next time. 

User: Thank you! I’m feeling a bit better already.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyan! I'm glad you’re here today. I want to start by hearing about how you've been feeling lately. What's been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really lonely lately. I tried to join the choir club, but I just couldn't fit in. I'm not very confident, and I felt like everyone else was already friends.

Consultant: That sounds tough, Xiaoyan. Feeling left out can be really challenging, especially when you want to connect with others. Can you tell me a little more about what happened when you tried to join the choir?

User: Well, when I got there, everyone was chatting and laughing together. I felt really shy and didn’t know how to approach anyone, so I just stood there, feeling awkward. Eventually, I left without really talking to anyone.

Consultant: It must have been hard to feel so uncomfortable in that situation. It's understandable that talking to new people can be overwhelming, especially when you want to make friends. What were some of the thoughts that went through your mind while you were there?

User: I kept thinking that nobody would want to talk to me, and I started to feel like I didn't belong. I thought, "What if they think I’m weird?" 

Consultant: Those thoughts can create a lot of anxiety and can make it harder to reach out. It's common for our minds to jump to negative conclusions. How did those thoughts affect how you felt during and after the experience?

User: I felt really sad and embarrassed. Like I’m missing out on something that could be fun. After that, I didn’t want to go back to the choir, even though I was hoping to make friends.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling disappointment along with that loneliness. It's normal to want to be part of a group, and those feelings can be very discouraging. What do you think you could do differently next time you're in a similar situation?

User: I guess I could try to remind myself that it’s okay to feel nervous and that others might be just as shy. Maybe I should try talking to someone first before just walking away.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Xiaoyan! Recognizing that you're not alone in feeling nervous can really help. Let’s explore some small steps you could take to gradually ease into those social situations. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I want to try, but I’m still scared.

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel scared when trying something new. How about we brainstorm some easy conversation starters you might use next time you find yourself in a similar environment?

User: Okay! Maybe I could start with asking someone about the music they like or maybe comment on the songs we're rehearsing.

Consultant: Those are fantastic ideas! Asking about someone’s music interests can be a great way to break the ice. How do you think you would feel if you approached someone with one of those conversation starters?

User: I think I’d feel a bit better knowing that I have something to say. But what if they don’t respond well?

Consultant: It’s a possibility, but remember that sometimes people are busy or preoccupied. It doesn’t necessarily reflect on you. What if you tried to remind yourself that their reaction isn’t a reflection of your worth?

User: That makes sense. I guess I shouldn’t take it personally if they don’t seem interested.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on your effort to connect is what matters most. Let’s also discuss how you might prepare yourself mentally before these encounters, so you feel a bit more confident.

User: I could practice positive affirmations, maybe telling myself that I can do this and that it’s okay to be nervous.

Consultant: That's an excellent strategy! Positive affirmations can really help build your confidence. What affirmations do you think would be effective for you?

User: I could say, "I am capable of making new friends," or "It’s okay to take my time to open up."

Consultant: Those affirmations are powerful. By repeating them, you can challenge your negative thoughts and reinforce your capabilities. Would you like to commit to practicing these affirmations regularly?

User: Yes, I’ll try to repeat them every morning before school. I think that might help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! As you practice these affirmations, you might start to notice a shift in your feelings. We can also track your progress together, if you’d like. How does that sound?

User: I’d love that! It would be nice to see if I’m making any changes.

Consultant: Great! Let’s set a goal for our next session to discuss how your efforts in approaching new people have gone. Remember, every small step counts. 

User: I will do that! I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Xiaoyan! Remember, building connections takes time, and it’s perfectly okay to move at your own pace. Before we finish, do you have any thoughts or feelings you’d like to share about our conversation today?

User: I just feel thankful for your support. It helps to know I’m not alone in this.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It’s important to know you have support, and I believe you have the strength to move forward. Let’s check in on your progress next time, and remember, you can reach out anytime you need help. 

User: Thank you! I'm looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: Me too, Xiaoyan! Have a great week, and remember to practice those affirmations!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaoyan! I'm really glad you're here today. I remember last time we talked about your recent success with the article you wrote for the school newspaper. How have you been feeling about that achievement since then?

User: Hi! Thank you! I felt really happy when I read the positive feedback. But now, I still worry about whether I can keep doing well. 

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to have those feelings, especially after an accomplishment. Your success has given you a boost, but it's natural to wonder if you can maintain that level of performance. Can you tell me more about the specific thoughts that come to your mind when you worry about your abilities?

User: I often think that maybe I was just lucky this time, and I might not be able to write or perform well again. It makes me feel anxious that I might disappoint myself and others.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you’re experiencing some self-doubt after this success. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that suggests you can't achieve good results again? 

User: Well, I don't have a lot of experience with writing, so I feel like maybe it was just a one-time thing.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but it might help to consider other examples of times you've succeeded or received positive feedback. Can you remember any other achievements, no matter how small, that might reflect your skills?

User: I guess there were times when my teachers complimented my presentations in class, and my friends enjoyed my stories. 

Consultant: Those are great examples! It seems you have received praise in various forms. Would you be willing to think about how you might build on those experiences for future writing projects?

User: Yes, I think if I remind myself of those compliments, it could help. 

Consultant: Absolutely! One technique could be to keep a journal where you note down moments of success and positive feedback. This way, you can revisit these affirmations whenever self-doubt creeps in. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds helpful! I could really use a reminder when I feel unsure.

Consultant: Great! Now let’s also think about setting some achievable goals for your writing. What kind of writing projects would you be interested in pursuing next?

User: I would like to try writing another article or maybe a short story. But I’m worried it won’t be as good as the last one.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re interested in trying new projects! Remember that comparing your work to previous successes can create unnecessary pressure. What if you set a goal to focus on the process of writing instead of just the outcome? 

User: I could try that. Maybe if I just enjoy writing, it won’t feel so stressful.

Consultant: Exactly! Letting go of perfectionism and focusing on the joy of writing can lead to more authentic expression. How about setting a specific time each week to write, focusing on what inspires you rather than how well it’s received?

User: That sounds doable! I could write on weekends when I have more free time.

Consultant: Perfect! Planning specific times for writing can help ensure it becomes a consistent part of your routine. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel more motivated thinking about it as a fun activity rather than a chore.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Keeping that positive outlook will be key. As we wrap up today, let's reflect on what you've learned and how you’ll apply it moving forward. What do you think your biggest takeaway is?

User: I think I learned that I shouldn’t let self-doubt stop me from trying new things. I also realize that focusing on the process can help.

Consultant: That’s exactly right! Embracing the journey instead of just the results may help you enjoy your writing more. As you continue to build on these experiences, what do you think will help you maintain this positive mindset?

User: Maybe regularly reminding myself of my past successes and keeping this journal will help. Also, accepting that not everything has to be perfect.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve got a solid plan for maintaining your confidence. Remember, it’s all about growth and exploration. I believe you’re on your way to building those lasting connections and enhancing your skills. How do you feel now compared to when we started?

User: I feel much better and more confident! I’m excited to write and see where it goes.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear, Xiaoyan! I’m very proud of the progress you’ve made today. As we conclude, keep in mind that you can always reach out whenever you need support. You've got this!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I feel much more prepared to tackle my next writing project!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your adventures in writing next time. Have a wonderful week ahead, and take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyan! I'm really glad to see you for our session today. You've made some great progress since we last talked! How are you feeling about everything?

User: Hi! I’m feeling pretty good overall, especially after my project went well. But I’m a bit worried about how to keep these positive feelings. I don’t want to lose my confidence.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear you’re feeling good after your project! It sounds like your confidence has been boosted. Let’s explore that a little more. What does it feel like for you to experience this confidence, and how do you think you can maintain it moving forward?

User: I feel more outgoing and like I can participate more in class discussions. I want to keep this momentum, but I’m unsure how to stay engaged with my classmates and teachers.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Feeling more outgoing is a positive sign. I wonder, what specific actions or strategies do you think could help you maintain that engagement with your classmates and teachers?

User: Maybe I could start by inviting some classmates to work on projects together or just hang out more. I think that would help strengthen our connections.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Taking the initiative to invite others can definitely help reinforce your relationships. What specific steps do you think you could take when reaching out to them?

User: I could ask them if they want to study together or work on the next project. I feel like that might give us a chance to bond more outside of just schoolwork.

Consultant: Absolutely! That proactive approach can really nurture those connections. How do you feel about taking that step? Is there anything that makes you hesitant?

User: I guess I worry they might not want to spend time with me. What if they say no?

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. Sometimes, we fear rejection, but it’s important to remember that many people appreciate being invited. What do you think could help you reframe that thought about their potential response?

User: Maybe I could think of it as just offering a chance to connect, and if they say no, it’s not a reflection of my worth.

Consultant: That's a fantastic perspective! Framing it as an opportunity rather than a rejection can ease some pressure. How does that make you feel about reaching out to them now?

User: It actually makes me feel a little more relaxed. If I think of it that way, it doesn’t seem so scary.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It sounds like you’re already finding ways to approach this positively. As you think about these interactions, what positive contributions do you feel you bring to your team or group?

User: I think I’m good at listening to everyone’s ideas and trying to find a way to make them all fit. I like making sure everyone feels included.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strength to have! Being a good listener and fostering inclusion is vital in teamwork. How might you use this strength to enhance your conversations while inviting classmates to study or collaborate?

User: I could remind them that I value all their ideas and would love to hear what they think! I guess that would make them feel more comfortable.

Consultant: Exactly! I believe that approach will create a welcoming environment. Now, looking ahead, what do you hope for your relationships with your classmates as you continue to engage with them?

User: I hope to build friendships where we can rely on each other, not just for schoolwork but also for sharing experiences, too.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful goal! Building those friendships can enrich your school experience and provide support. Let’s reflect on any small, actionable steps you can take this week to begin fostering those relationships.

User: I think I’ll try reaching out to one or two classmates this week and suggest we work on homework together. I can see how that goes!

Consultant: Wonderful plan! Taking those small steps can lead to significant developments over time. Let’s also consider how you’ll feel after taking that action. What would success look like for you after this week?

User: Success would be making at least one plan with a classmate to study. I feel like that would give me more confidence!

Consultant: I love that benchmark! Celebrating these small victories is crucial to maintaining confidence. As our session comes to a close, how can you remind yourself of these positive experiences as you move forward?

User: I think I’ll keep a little journal to write about my experiences whenever I invite someone or we have a good discussion. That might help me reflect on my growth.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent idea! Journaling can be a powerful tool for reflection. Remember, every step you take is part of building your confidence and connections. How are you feeling as we wrap up today?

User: I feel really good! I’m excited to try these new steps and keep building those connections.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’re making great strides, Xiaoyan. Remember, you’re capable of fostering those relationships and maintaining that positive energy. If you encounter any challenges, you can always reflect and adapt. I'm here for you when you're ready for our next session. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate it. I’m looking forward to sharing my progress next time!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I can’t wait to hear about your experiences. Take care and have a wonderful week ahead!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyan! It's great to have you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. I think I’ve adapted well to school life. I even organized a class event that went really well, and my classmates and teachers appreciated my efforts.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Organizing an event is a big achievement. How did you feel when you received recognition from your classmates and teachers?

User: I felt really proud and happy. It was nice to see everyone enjoying the activity. I didn't think I could do it, but I did!

Consultant: It sounds like you really surprised yourself in a positive way. Reflecting on your adaptation to school life over the past weeks, what changes have you noticed in yourself?

User: I’ve become more outgoing. At first, I was nervous about making new friends, but now I feel more comfortable talking to others. I think it’s because I’m opening up more.

Consultant: That's a significant transformation! It’s excellent that you're feeling more comfortable and social. What strategies or behaviors do you think helped you become more outgoing?

User: I guess I just started participating more in class and in group activities. I also tried to be more friendly and approachable, which made it easier to connect with others.

Consultant: It sounds like you're actively engaging with your peers, which is key to building relationships. How do you think these interactions have impacted your overall feelings about school?

User: My feelings have improved a lot! I look forward to going to school every day now. At first, I wasn’t sure how I’d fit in, but now I feel more at home.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Your positive outlook on school is a great sign of your adaptation. Is there anything that still concerns you, or do you feel everything is going smoothly?

User: I still worry about keeping up with my studies along with my social life. Sometimes, I feel stressed about exams coming up.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way, especially with exams approaching. How do you currently manage that stress when it arises?

User: I try to study in shorter sessions and take breaks, but sometimes it doesn’t feel enough. I worry that I might forget things or not do well.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel pressured about exams. Let’s explore that fear a bit. What specific thoughts come to mind when you think you might not do well?

User: I think things like, "What if I fail?" or "Everyone will judge me if I don’t get good grades." It makes me really anxious.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like those thoughts create a lot of pressure for you. Can we challenge those thoughts together? What evidence do you have that failing would mean that you are a failure as a person?

User: I guess I don’t have much evidence. I know I’ve done well in other subjects, but somehow it still feels daunting.

Consultant: That’s a very insightful realization. Remember that one exam doesn’t define your worth or your intelligence. If a friend came to you with the same worry, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably say that it’s just a test and that it’s okay to make mistakes. Everyone struggles sometimes.

Consultant: Exactly! You are being very compassionate towards your imaginary friend. Now, let’s work on applying that same kindness to yourself. How can you reframe the way you think about your upcoming exams?

User: Maybe I can think of it as a chance to learn rather than just a test of my worth. If I make mistakes, I can still learn from them.

Consultant: That’s an excellent shift in perspective, Xiaoyan! Viewing challenges as opportunities for growth can reduce anxiety. How do you think you can apply this mindset moving forward?

User: I could set realistic study goals and remind myself that it’s fine to ask for help if I need it. I think I need to trust the process more.

Consultant: Trusting the process is a vital step. Would you like to set a few study goals for the upcoming weeks that align with this new mindset?

User: Yes, I want to create a study schedule that includes breaks and also some time for relaxation and fun. 

Consultant: That sounds like a balanced approach! Remember to celebrate your achievements along the way, no matter how small. How do you feel about everything we've discussed today?

User: I feel relieved and more optimistic. It’s nice to know that it’s okay to struggle and that I can manage it better.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s important to recognize your progress and ability to cope. As we wrap up today, what do you think is the biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I think it’s learning to be kinder to myself and understanding that I can grow from challenges. That makes me feel more confident.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization! Remember that you are capable of facing challenges. As we finish today, do you have any final thoughts or concerns you'd like to share?

User: No, I feel good about our discussion. Thank you for helping me! 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaoyan! I'm proud of the progress you've made. Remember, I’m here whenever you need support. Good luck with your studies, and take care until next time!
