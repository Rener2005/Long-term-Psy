Consultant: Hello Brian! Welcome to today’s session. I know you’ve been feeling anxious about the upcoming presentation. Can you share more about what’s been on your mind regarding this event?

User: Hi. I just can’t shake off this intense fear about the presentation. The idea of speaking in front of my colleagues makes me incredibly anxious. I worry that I’ll stumble over my words, sweat too much, and just embarrass myself.

Consultant: It sounds like the thought of performing poorly is causing you a lot of distress. Let’s explore that a little deeper. What specific thoughts run through your mind when you think about the presentation?

User: I keep thinking that everyone is going to judge me harshly, and what if I forget what I want to say? It’s like I can already feel the pressure building up in my chest.

Consultant: That sounds really overwhelming, Brian. It’s understandable to feel that way when you anticipate judgment from others. Can you recall a situation in the past where you felt similarly before a presentation or speaking engagement?

User: Well, I’ve never really had to do public speaking before. In college, I avoided it as much as possible. But I did have to present some projects in a small group, and I remember feeling really nervous back then too. 

Consultant: It’s important to recognize that you have faced similar situations before, even if they were in smaller groups. What were the outcomes of those experiences?

User: I managed to get through them, but I was incredibly anxious the whole time. I remember overheating and feeling like everyone was staring at me. 

Consultant: It seems like while you were anxious, you ultimately completed those presentations. What do you think contributed to your ability to finish them despite your anxiety?

User: I think I was just focused on getting it done, even though I felt terrible. Maybe I was just lucky that no one seemed overly critical afterward.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Brian. Focusing on the completion rather than the perceived judgment is an important aspect. What if we could shift that focus to what you can control, like your preparation and practice for this upcoming presentation?

User: That makes sense. If I prepare well, I might feel a bit more confident. But I still can’t help but feel that fear, especially of forgetting my lines.

Consultant: Yes, that fear is valid. But let’s challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that you would forget your lines during this presentation?

User: I don’t have specific evidence. I guess I just assume that I'll get too anxious to remember anything.

Consultant: It’s common to make these assumptions when we are anxious. If you were to advise a friend in your position, what would you suggest to help them manage that fear?

User: I guess I'd tell them to practice and maybe even try to visualize success. 

Consultant: Exactly! Visualization can be a powerful tool. How about we incorporate that into your preparation? You can practice visualizing yourself successfully delivering the presentation. 

User: That sounds helpful. I could definitely picture myself being calm and composed.

Consultant: Great! Alongside visualization, would you be open to practicing your speech in a safe environment, like with a friend or even in front of a mirror?

User: I think I could manage that. Practicing out loud might help me feel less overwhelmed.

Consultant: Absolutely! It will allow you to become more familiar with your material and lessen the anxiety associated with speaking. Let’s also touch upon some relaxation techniques you could use before the presentation. Have you ever tried deep breathing exercises?

User: I haven’t, but I’ve heard of them. Do they really work?

Consultant: They can be very effective! Deep breathing helps calm your nervous system. Would you like to learn a simple breathing technique that you can use before your presentation?

User: Yes, I would like that! 

Consultant: Perfect! A simple technique is to inhale deeply for four counts, hold for four counts, and exhale for four counts. You can repeat this a few times to help ground yourself. 

User: I can try that. I just feel like no matter what, I’ll still be really nervous.

Consultant: That’s a completely normal feeling, Brian. Remember, many people experience anxiety before public speaking. It doesn’t mean you can’t manage it. What strategies resonate with you so far?

User: I think the visualization and practicing in front of someone will really help. It feels a bit more manageable.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’re building a toolkit for facing this challenge. Is there anything else you’d like to talk about today regarding this situation?

User: I still worry about the audience’s reactions. What if they seem uninterested or disengaged?

Consultant: That is a common concern, but consider this: you cannot control how others react, only what you present. Focusing on your efforts and preparation can help redirect your energy in a more positive way. 

User: I see your point. I’ll work on shifting my focus.

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s set a goal for you to practice your presentation in front of someone this week and try out the breathing exercises. How does that sound?

User: That sounds doable. I’ll give it a try.

Consultant: Fantastic! I believe in your ability to manage this, Brian. Remember, every small step you take is progress. How are you feeling about everything we discussed today?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It doesn’t seem as insurmountable as it did before.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! You’ve made some meaningful steps towards overcoming this fear. Just remember, it’s okay to feel anxious, but you have the strategies to help you cope with it. 

User: Thank you for your help. I’ll do my best this week.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Brian! I look forward to hearing how the practice goes in our next session. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello Brian! I'm glad you're here today. I know you've been feeling a lot of pressure about your upcoming speech. Can we start by discussing how you've been feeling lately regarding this situation?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been really anxious about the whole thing. I worked on my speech, but the thought of actually standing in front of people and presenting is overwhelming. I've had sleepless nights, and I just can't eat properly. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Brian. The anxiety and sleeplessness must be difficult to cope with. What specific thoughts do you experience when you think about the speech?

User: I keep thinking that I am going to mess it up. It's like I can't shake off the worry that I'll forget everything or that people will judge me harshly.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re really worried about how others will perceive you and the potential for failure. These thoughts can create a heavy burden. How do those thoughts make you feel in your day-to-day life?

User: They make me feel really stressed, and I find it hard to concentrate on anything else. I feel trapped because I know I have to do it, but the anxiety just keeps building.

Consultant: I can see how these feelings of stress and being trapped could impact your daily life. Have you noticed any physical symptoms that come along with this anxiety, aside from difficulty sleeping and eating?

User: Yes, I sweat a lot when I think about it, and my heart races. It's like my body is reacting even before I have to speak. 

Consultant: These physical reactions you’re experiencing are quite common, especially in high-stress situations. They can feed into your anxiety even more. Have you had a chance to try any strategies to manage this anxiety so far?

User: Not really. I feel so overwhelmed that I haven't been able to think of what to do. I just dread the whole situation.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Sometimes it can be hard to take the first step when you’re feeling so overwhelmed. Would you be open to learning some relaxation techniques that could help mitigate these physical symptoms and calm your mind?

User: I guess I could try that. What kind of techniques are we talking about?

Consultant: One effective technique is deep breathing, which can help reduce your heart rate and create a sense of calm. It involves taking slow, deep breaths, focusing on your breathing to help ground you. Would you like to practice this together now?

User: Sure, I’d like that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s try this. Find a comfortable position, and if you’re comfortable, close your eyes. Inhale deeply through your nose for four counts, hold for four counts, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for six counts. Let’s do this a few times together.

User: Okay, I’m ready.

Consultant: Let’s begin. Inhale... 1, 2, 3, 4... hold... 1, 2, 3, 4... and exhale... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Good. How does that feel?

User: I feel a bit better. It’s nice to take a moment to just focus on my breathing.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s a simple yet effective way to manage immediate anxiety. Now, we can also work on recognizing your negative thoughts. When you think “I will mess up,” can you identify what that thought does to your feelings?

User: It definitely makes me feel more anxious and self-critical.

Consultant: That’s a very clear connection. What if we challenged that thought a bit? Can you think of any evidence that might suggest you won’t mess up?

User: I’ve practiced my speech a lot. There were times I felt confident about it, especially when rehearsing alone. 

Consultant: That’s excellent evidence! You have prepared well. What would you say to a friend who had similar thoughts about their presentation?

User: I guess I would tell them to trust in their preparation and focus on doing their best.

Consultant: Exactly! You can use that same encouraging perspective towards yourself. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. How does that shift in thinking feel to you?

User: It feels a little more manageable. I just need to keep reminding myself of that.

Consultant: Precisely! And practicing these thoughts can really help. Moving forward, let’s explore how we can implement a plan for the actual day of your speech. What do you think could help you the most when you start feeling anxious?

User: Maybe a reminder to breathe deeply and focus on one person in the audience instead of worrying about everyone staring at me.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Focusing on one person can indeed shift your perspective. Let’s also consider setting small goals during your preparation. What is one small step you could take before the actual event?

User: I could do a rehearsal in front of a friend next week. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Practicing in front of someone can help simulate the experience. After that, let’s reflect on how you felt and what worked. How do you feel about that plan?

User: I feel more prepared just thinking about it. It’s relieving to have a plan.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Brian! It’s all about taking one step at a time. Remember, you are capable and have put in the work. As we wrap up today’s session, how confident do you feel about implementing these strategies moving forward?

User: I feel more confident than when I walked in today. I definitely want to practice deep breathing and challenge my thoughts.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! You’ve made great progress today. As you approach your speech, keep using those strategies, and try to maintain a positive mindset. If you need additional support, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you so much. I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Brian! Remember, you’re on the right track. I look forward to hearing how everything goes in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Brian! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better about the whole public speaking thing. Talking to my friends helped, but I'm still anxious about how things will go on the day of the speech.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling better and that sharing your thoughts with friends was helpful. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you anxious about the day of the speech?

User: I worry about the audience's reaction, what if they don’t respond well or look bored? That thought just makes my heart race.

Consultant: It sounds like you're concerned about receiving negative feedback from the audience. Can we explore what specific thoughts come to your mind in those moments of anxiety?

User: I often think that I will embarrass myself or that people will judge me harshly. It’s like I can’t shake the feeling that I’m going to fail.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite challenging to manage. When you think about embarrassing yourself or being judged, how does that make you feel physically or emotionally?

User: I feel tightness in my chest and my palms get sweaty. It's an overwhelming feeling of fear. 

Consultant: I understand. It sounds quite uncomfortable. Let’s focus on reframing those thoughts. What evidence do you have that you’ll embarrass yourself or that the audience will judge you harshly?

User: Well, I don't have any real evidence, I just… assume that’s how it will be because I haven’t done public speaking before.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, Brian. Your worries stem from uncertainty rather than reality. If a friend were feeling this way about a speech, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone gets nervous and that the audience is likely supportive and not there to judge harshly.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve recognized that the audience is likely there to support you. We can work on altering your thought pattern to reflect that. Would you be open to practicing how you might respond to these negative thoughts when they arise?

User: Yes, I think that could help me.

Consultant: Great! Let’s role-play a situation where you’re about to start your speech. Imagine standing in front of the audience. What might you say to counter the negative thoughts that pop up?

User: I could remind myself that I’ve prepared and that the audience is interested in what I have to say.

Consultant: That's a powerful affirmation. You’re focusing on your preparation and the audience's interest. Next, let’s practice managing those physical sensations. What are some grounding techniques you could use if you start feeling anxious?

User: I could take deep breaths and remind myself to stay present. Maybe also visualize a supportive audience.

Consultant: Excellent strategies! Deep breathing and visualization can really help anchor you. Can we try a quick exercise together now, practicing deep breathing?

User: Sure, let’s do it.

Consultant: Alright, take a deep breath in through your nose… hold it for a moment… and then breathe out slowly through your mouth. Let’s repeat that a few times together.

User: Okay, I feel a bit calmer now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear. With more practice, this can become a helpful tool for you during the speech. As we wrap up our session today, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway?

User: I think I’ve realized that my fears are mostly assumptions and that I can prepare myself both mentally and physically for the speech.

Consultant: That's a significant insight, Brian! You have the tools to manage your anxiety effectively. For our next session, let’s focus on any further techniques you want to develop or any specific situations you want to role-play. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds perfect! I want to be fully prepared.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, you’ve already made great strides in managing your anxiety. Keep practicing your techniques, and I believe you’ll feel more in control on the day of your speech. If you need any support before our next session, don't hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Brian! I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Brian! It's great to see you today. I'm looking forward to our session. How have you been feeling regarding your upcoming presentation?

User: Hi. I've been working hard on preparing for my presentation. I feel a bit more in control now, but I'm still worried about how my body will react during the actual event.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel this way before a presentation. It sounds like you’ve made progress in your preparation, which is wonderful. Can you tell me more about those physical reactions you're concerned about?

User: Well, I sometimes worry about sweating or my heart racing while I'm speaking. I hope I can manage those reactions better when the time comes.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Preparing mentally for these reactions is a good step. What strategies have you been using to manage your anxiety so far?

User: I've been practicing with cue cards and even rehearsing with my dog, which helps me get comfortable with the material.

Consultant: Practicing in a supportive environment can be very beneficial. How do you feel about the rehearsals? Do they help reduce your anxiety in any way?

User: Yes, they do. I feel a bit more confident each time I practice, but there's still this nagging worry about how it will go on the actual day.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that practice helps boost your confidence. Let’s explore that anxiety a bit more. When you think about the day of your presentation, what specific thoughts come to your mind that make you feel anxious?

User: I keep thinking about the possibility of forgetting my lines or messing up, and those thoughts make me feel even more nervous.

Consultant: Those thoughts can create a spiral of anxiety. How would you feel if you viewed mistakes as a normal part of the presentation process rather than something to fear?

User: That sounds easier said than done. I just want everything to go perfectly, but I know that’s unrealistic.

Consultant: You're absolutely right, perfection is often an unrealistic expectation. Let’s challenge that thought. Can you think of examples of times when a presentation didn't go perfectly, but it still turned out okay?

User: Yes, I remember a colleague who stumbled over her words, but she recovered well, and everyone still appreciated her effort.

Consultant: That’s a perfect example! It shows that even when things don’t go as planned, there can still be a positive outcome. What if we look at ways to prepare for those unexpected moments?

User: I suppose having a plan for what to do if I forget a part of my speech could help. Maybe practicing recovery techniques?

Consultant: Absolutely! Having those techniques ready can reduce your anxiety. Would you like to work on a couple of specific strategies for recovery during your speech?

User: Yes, that would be really helpful. 

Consultant: Great! One technique could be pausing to take a deep breath if you lose your place. This can also give you a moment to gather your thoughts. Would you like to practice that?

User: Sure, I can try that now.

Consultant: Perfect, let’s take a moment and practice taking a deep breath together. Inhale slowly… and exhale. How does that feel?

User: It feels calming. I can see how taking a moment like that could help me refocus.

Consultant: Excellent! Another strategy is to have a few key points you can refer to if needed. What do you think might work best for you?

User: I think having a small outline in my notes could be helpful. As long as I don’t rely on it too much. 

Consultant: That sounds like a balanced approach! Having an outline can serve as guidance without becoming a crutch. How are you feeling about managing your physical reactions now?

User: I do feel a bit more equipped. I'm starting to think I can handle it if I stay calm and stick to my strategies.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset to have, Brian! As we prepare for our next session, what’s one action you’d like to commit to that will help you progress with your anxiety management?

User: I’ll make it a point to practice those breathing techniques every day leading up to my presentation.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! Regular practice can reinforce those techniques. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today before we wrap up?

User: Actually, I’d like to know how to effectively use my support system leading up to the event. 

Consultant: Excellent question! Seeking support can be very effective. You might consider sharing your strategies with friends or family members and asking for their encouragement. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I think talking to someone about it could help relieve some pressure.

Consultant: Definitely! Remember, sharing your concerns can lighten the emotional load you’re carrying. As we conclude today’s session, reflect on the progress you've made and remember to indulge in self-compassion. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance today. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Brian. I'm looking forward to hearing how your strategies work for you next time. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything before then.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Brian! I’m glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session regarding your upcoming public speaking?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more stable emotionally, but I still have concerns about the unknown details of the speech and whether I'll be able to manage everything during the presentation.

Consultant: I see. It's great to hear that your emotions are stabilizing. Those concerns are common when preparing for a significant event like this. Can you tell me more about what specifically you're worried about regarding the speech?

User: I'm worried that I might forget what I need to say or that I won't engage the audience effectively. It just feels like a lot of pressure.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling the pressure of wanting to perform well and connect with your audience. How do you usually cope with feelings of pressure in your daily life?

User: I usually try to organize things or talk to friends about it, but I'm still unsure if that's enough for something like this.

Consultant: Talking to friends can be a great support. How about creating a structured plan for reaching out to them before the speech? This might help you feel more prepared and supported.

User: That sounds like a good idea. What should I include in that plan?

Consultant: In your plan, consider outlining specific topics you want to discuss with your friends, like sharing your speech content or asking for their feedback. It could also help to practice your speech in front of them for additional support. How does that sound to you?

User: Practicing in front of friends could help a lot! I think I’d feel more confident getting their input.

Consultant: Exactly! Getting input from trusted friends can build your confidence. What else do you think would help you feel more at ease before your speech?

User: I guess having a clear routine before the presentation could help, like reviewing my notes or visualizing success. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Visualization is a powerful tool. Let’s think about how you could incorporate a visualization exercise into your routine. What scenarios would you like to visualize before your speech?

User: I’d like to visualize walking on stage confidently and seeing the audience smiling, engaging with what I'm saying.

Consultant: Perfect! Visualizing positive outcomes can significantly impact your mindset. How about committing to such an exercise every day leading up to the speech?

User: Yes, I can do that. It’s all about getting into the right headspace.

Consultant: Absolutely! And remember, it’s okay to acknowledge those feelings of anxiety; just don’t let them define your experience. Have you thought about how you'll remind yourself of this when anxiety creeps in?

User: I guess I could put some motivational quotes around my workspace, something to ground me.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Surrounding yourself with positive reminders can serve as a great anchor. Are there any specific quotes that resonate with you?

User: I like, “Feel the fear and do it anyway.” It reminds me that fear is just part of the journey.

Consultant: That's a powerful reminder! How about incorporating that quote into your visualization practice? 

User: I love that idea. I can visualize myself overcoming the fear while reciting that quote in my head.

Consultant: That’s a strong mental image! I trust that it’ll serve you well. As we approach your speech date, how often do you want to check in on your progress and feelings?

User: Maybe once or twice a week? I want to ensure I stay on track and adjust if necessary.

Consultant: That sounds very reasonable. Remember, the more you prepare and practice, the more confident you’ll feel. How are you feeling about everything we've discussed today?

User: I feel pretty optimistic! Breaking things down and having a plan makes it feel more manageable.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Just remember to lean on your support system and trust the process. Is there anything else you wish to tackle before our next session?

User: No, I think we covered everything. I’m feeling much better about how to go forward now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Brian! I believe you’re going to do great. Before we wrap up, let's recap your main strategies. You’re going to reach out for support, practice visualizations, and have reminders for positivity, correct?

User: Exactly! That sounds good. I feel equipped now.

Consultant: Fantastic! I’m really proud of your progress. Keep implementing these strategies, and we can discuss how it went next time. Remember, you’ve got this!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and encouragement.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Brian! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Best of luck with everything, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything in between sessions. Goodbye for now!

User: Goodbye!
###################
Consultant: Hi Brian! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite good actually. I successfully completed my recent presentation and got some really positive feedback. It was a big relief!

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Completing the presentation and receiving positive feedback must have been a huge boost for your confidence. How did it feel to perform well?

User: It felt amazing! I was really nervous at first, but once I started speaking, I felt more in control. The positive reactions from the audience helped a lot.

Consultant: It sounds like the positive feedback truly validated your efforts. That’s a wonderful experience. What specific strategies or techniques do you think contributed to your success during that presentation?

User: I practiced a lot beforehand and tried to visualize myself doing well. I also reminded myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that the audience is supportive.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies, Brian. Visualization can be a powerful tool, alongside self-compassion. How do you feel about using these strategies for future presentations?

User: I feel more confident about applying them again. I think they really helped me this time, so I’d definitely want to keep using them.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Maintaining that confidence is key. As we discuss long-term strategies today, what would you like to focus on regarding your presentation skills moving forward?

User: I want to improve my speaking skills further and become more comfortable in front of larger audiences. I want to make this a continuous journey.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! We can create a long-term plan together to help you gradually build on your skills and confidence. Are there any specific areas of public speaking that you find particularly challenging?

User: I think handling unexpected questions from the audience is a bit intimidating for me. I often struggle to think on my feet.

Consultant: That’s a common concern. We can explore techniques to manage that anxiety and improve your impromptu speaking skills. How do you feel about doing some practice exercises for that?

User: I think that would be helpful! I’ve never really practiced that before, so I’d be open to it.

Consultant: Excellent! We can incorporate some role-play scenarios where I ask you questions on the spot. Additionally, working on developing a flexible mindset can help you respond more comfortably. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I’d love to try it out. I think it will help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Absolutely. Let's start by identifying some common questions you might encounter during presentations. What types of questions do you think could come up regarding your topics?

User: Probably questions about the data and analysis I present. Also, maybe inquiries about my recommendations.

Consultant: Good identification. We can simulate those kinds of questions. Let’s start with a question about your analysis—what do you think is the most critical finding from your last presentation?

User: I think the key takeaway was about the importance of diversifying investments to minimize risk. 

Consultant: Great! Now, imagine I’m in the audience. I might ask, “How do you suggest someone diversify their investments effectively?” How would you respond?

User: I would likely explain that they should consider different asset classes like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds and perhaps provide specific examples. 

Consultant: That’s a solid response! Now, if you encounter a question you didn’t expect, give me your current thoughts on how you might respond.

User: Honestly, I’d probably panic a bit. But I could try acknowledging it first and maybe say that I can follow up with more detailed information later.

Consultant: Acknowledging the question and offering to provide more info later is a good approach! It shows transparency and keeps the conversation flowing. How does that idea make you feel compared to your initial anxiety about unexpected questions?

User: It feels more manageable! I think I can learn to handle it that way without feeling too pressured.

Consultant: That’s wonderful progress! Recognizing that you can adapt your responses is a huge step. We can continue to work on building that comfort level. Is there anything else you would like to explore today related to your public speaking journey?

User: I think I’d like to talk about how to maintain my confidence over time. I don’t want to revert back to being anxious.

Consultant: That’s a smart focus. Maintaining confidence is crucial. We can explore regular practice routines or even joining public speaking groups to keep pushing your comfort zone. What do you think about that idea?

User: Joining a group sounds like a good plan! I think being around others would motivate me to improve.

Consultant: Absolutely! Being in a supportive environment can really help reinforce your skills. I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize the strategies we’ve discussed to help you maintain your momentum.

User: Alright! We talked about practicing visualization, managing unexpected questions, and possibly joining a speaking group.

Consultant: Exactly! Those are our key focuses moving forward. Remember, the progress you’ve made is tangible and there’s no need to rush. You have the tools to continue this journey. 

User: Thank you! I feel more equipped now. I really appreciate your guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Brian! I'm excited about your growth. If you ever feel the need for support or guidance again, don’t hesitate to reach out. I wish you all the best!

User: Thank you! I will definitely keep that in mind!
