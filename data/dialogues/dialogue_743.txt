Consultant: Hello, You Li! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I still feel quite anxious and overwhelmed. I've been struggling with my studies and feeling really disconnected from my classmates. It’s been hard to focus, and I feel like I’m sinking into a pit of negativity.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure and loneliness. Can you tell me more about what’s been bothering you in your studies and your interactions with classmates?

User: Well, I regret my choice of major. I was really excited about it at first, but now I feel stuck. I often think about switching back to my original major, but then I worry I might not get in or that it's too late. These thoughts just keep swirling in my mind, making me more anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like you're caught between wanting to explore the original path and your current feelings of regret. What thoughts come to your mind when you think about your current major versus your original one?

User: When I think about my current major, I feel lost and frustrated. I keep thinking I’m not good enough, while my original major felt more like me, like I could succeed there. But I worry about the logistics and what others might think if I switch. 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy, and it's understandable that they weigh you down. Let's explore the thought that you’re not good enough—what evidence do you have to support that belief? And can you think of any counterexamples?

User: I don’t know... I just feel that way when I struggle with assignments or hear my peers talk confidently. I guess I did well in my original major, but it feels irrelevant now.

Consultant: It makes sense that hearing others talk positively could heighten your worries. You've had success in your original major, which indicates you have strengths. Could it be that your feelings are more about the new environment rather than your abilities?

User: Maybe... but it still hurts to see others doing well while I feel lost. I think about switching, but what if I fail again?

Consultant: It’s tough to see others succeed, especially when you’re feeling unsure. It’s important to acknowledge those fears, but let’s challenge the belief of failing if you switch. What’s the worst that could happen, and is it really the end of the world?

User: I guess the worst would be struggling again. But I suppose I could learn and adapt if I fail. It’s just scary.

Consultant: Absolutely, it is scary. Change often brings fear of the unknown. However, adapting and learning from setbacks is part of growth. Have you thought about small steps you could take to explore your original major again?

User: I haven’t really considered that. I tend to freeze up and not take action. 

Consultant: That’s completely normal. Taking small, manageable steps can help. For example, maybe you could reach out to an old professor or look into some of your previous courses. What do you think about that idea?

User: That sounds like a step I could handle. I think reaching out would help me at least clarify my thoughts.

Consultant: Great! Incorporating that as a step can be very empowering. Also, while you're navigating these feelings, how are you managing your social connections with classmates?

User: Honestly, I feel really isolated. I don't know how to approach them, and sometimes I feel like they don’t want to talk to me. 

Consultant: Feeling isolated can be very difficult. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of assumptions about their thoughts and feelings toward you. Have there been specific situations that made you feel this way?

User: Just little things. Sometimes they laugh or chat together, and I feel like an outsider. I avoid approaching them because I'm afraid they won’t include me.

Consultant: It’s painful to feel left out, which can lead to a cycle of avoiding social situations. Perhaps we could brainstorm ways for you to engage with them gradually. How would that sound?

User: I think I’d like that. I want to improve, but I just need a starting point. 

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s think about a few simple scenarios. For example, you could join in on a group discussion or ask if someone wants to study together. What do you feel is doable for you?

User: I think I could try asking one person to study with me. I just have to muster some courage.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic first step! Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous. Taking this action, however small, can help you feel more connected. 

User: Yes, it would. I’ve just been feeling so inadequate about it all. 

Consultant: It’s perfectly valid to feel that way, but stepping out of your comfort zone can really challenge those negative beliefs. Keep reminding yourself of your strengths and the success you've achieved before.

User: You're right. I need to be kinder to myself and recognize the progress I've made, even if it feels small.

Consultant: Absolutely! Self-compassion is vital, especially during challenging times. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the strategies we've discussed for tackling your studies and social interactions?

User: I feel more hopeful. The small steps seem manageable, and I like the idea of challenging my negative thoughts. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s important to hold onto that hope. Embracing these small changes can lead to more confidence in both your studies and social life. Before our next session, reflect on your experiences and try these strategies—let's see how they work out for you.

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to trying them out and sharing my experiences next time.

Consultant: You’re welcome, You Li! Remember, each step you take is a victory. I’ll see you next time, and we can explore how things have progressed. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, You Li! I'm really glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! Honestly, I've been feeling increasingly lonely and anxious. My relationships with classmates haven’t improved, and I still find it hard to connect with them. I feel like I'm on the outside looking in, which makes me really frustrated.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds really tough to feel isolated like that. Let’s try to explore those feelings. Can you share a bit more about what happens when you interact with your classmates?

User: Whenever I try to join in, I feel nervous and out of place. It’s like they have their friendships already formed, and I don’t know how to break in. I've even gotten this feeling of hostility towards them, which just confuses me more.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of anxiety and frustration, which is understandable. When you feel hostility towards them, what kinds of thoughts go through your mind?

User: I think things like “They don't want me around” or “I'm not good enough to fit in.” Those thoughts just make me feel even worse.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really powerful and can shape how you feel. Let's try to challenge those thoughts together. What evidence do you have that your classmates don’t want you around? 

User: Well, they often seem busy with their own groups, and they don’t reach out to me much, so I assume they don’t want me there.

Consultant: I see why you might think that. But it’s also possible that they might not be aware of how you feel, or they could be shy. If a friend of yours were in your situation, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably tell them to just keep trying to talk to people and not take it personally.

Consultant: That’s a helpful perspective! It sounds like you recognize that it's important to keep trying. What do you think would happen if you attempted to reach out to them more, despite feeling nervous?

User: It’s scary to think about, but I guess I wouldn’t know unless I try. Maybe I could start with small conversations.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Starting with small interactions could help ease that anxiety. Do you have any specific ideas on how to approach them?

User: Maybe I could ask them about assignments or join in on discussions during class. That seems less intimidating.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! It’s a natural way to start a conversation without feeling pressured. Let's talk about how you might feel when you do reach out. What types of feelings do you expect to experience?

User: I worry I’ll feel rejected or awkward, but maybe there will be some relief if it goes well.

Consultant: Absolutely, there’s a chance for both outcomes. It’s important to prepare for different scenarios. We can also practice some of those interactions if you'd like. Would that help you feel more ready?

User: Yes, practicing could help me feel less nervous!

Consultant: Great! Let’s role-play a situation where you ask a classmate about an assignment. How about we start there?

User: Okay! I’ll try to approach as if I’m about to ask about an assignment.

Consultant: Go ahead whenever you're ready!

User: Um, hey! I noticed you seem really focused in class—do you understand what the professor meant by that last assignment?

Consultant: That was a good start! You asked a clear question, which opens the door for dialogue. How do you feel now that you've practiced that?

User: I feel a bit less anxious, like I might actually be able to do this.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Remember, small steps can lead to significant changes. What do you think your next step could be after practicing?

User: I could try to actually say that to someone next class and see how it goes.

Consultant: Yes, taking that step can really help build your confidence! How do you think you can cope with the feelings of anxiety that might come up in the moment?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s okay to feel nervous and that the outcome doesn’t define me.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy—acknowledging your feelings without being overwhelmed by them is key. Let’s talk about other ways you can support yourself. Are there any activities or practices that help you feel better?

User: Sometimes I write in my journal or listen to music. That can help lift my mood a bit.

Consultant: Those are great coping strategies! Incorporating them regularly can create a foundation of support for you. How about we set a goal for the week related to reaching out to classmates and using your coping methods?

User: I’d like to try initiating at least one conversation and also commit to journaling afterward to reflect on how it went.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid and achievable goal! Reflecting on your experience can help to process your feelings and track your progress. As we wrap up today, what’s one positive takeaway you have from our session?

User: I feel like I have some ways to approach my classmates and that it's okay to be nervous about it.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway! Remember, it’s all about small steps towards building connections. I’m here to support you, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time! You're doing great, and I believe in your ability to navigate this.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, You Li! I'm looking forward to our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Youli! I'm glad you're here for our session today. I remember from our last meeting that you've been feeling quite anxious and self-doubting about your studies and future direction. Can you share how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling really lost. The pressure from studies is overwhelming, and I still don't like my major. I just feel confused and unsure about what to do with my life.

Consultant: It sounds really tough right now, feeling overwhelmed by your studies and uncertain about your major. Let's explore this a bit more. What do you think is causing you the most stress regarding your studies?

User: I think I'm not really interested in the subjects we're studying. I feel like I’m just going through the motions, but I don't have any real passion for it.

Consultant: I understand. Not feeling passionate about what you're studying can definitely contribute to that overwhelming sensation. If you could change one thing about your current studies or situation, what would it be?

User: I wish I could find something that I'm genuinely excited about. I feel like I have no direction, and it's frustrating.

Consultant: Wanting to find something that excites you is completely valid, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. Let’s think about what interests you outside of your current studies. Are there any subjects, hobbies, or activities that you genuinely enjoy or have wanted to pursue?

User: Well, I love drawing and sometimes I think about studying art, but I worry that it won’t lead to a stable career.

Consultant: That’s a really important observation. It’s great that you have a passion for drawing. Let's unpack this worry about stability. What are some of the thoughts that come to your mind when you think about pursuing art as a career?

User: I often think that there isn’t much security in art, and I see so many people struggling to make it. What if I don’t succeed and end up disappointed?

Consultant: Those thoughts make a lot of sense. Fear of failure can be overwhelming, especially with something you care about. But it sounds like your passion for drawing is significant. What evidence do you have about artists who have succeeded? Have you seen people in that field who have found fulfillment?

User: I guess I do know some people who have been able to make it work, but they all seem so talented. I don’t know if I’m good enough.

Consultant: It’s common to compare ourselves to others, especially in fields like art. Let’s challenge that thought a bit. If a friend were in your position and felt unsure of their abilities, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that they need to practice and that their unique style is valuable, even if they don’t think they’re as good as others.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective! You already recognize that improvement comes with practice. So why not give yourself that same kindness? What small steps could you take to explore your interest in art without overwhelming yourself?

User: Maybe I could start drawing more regularly, like dedicating a little time each week to it, just to see how I feel.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Setting aside time each week to draw could help reclaim that joy and allow you to explore your skills. How does that prospect make you feel?

User: I feel a little excited at the thought of actually making time for something I love. I think it might help with my stress, too.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Recognizing what makes you feel excited is a great step forward. As you venture into this drawing practice, how could you also maintain a balance with your studies so it doesn’t feel overwhelming?

User: I could set a schedule for both my studies and my drawing time. That way, I don’t neglect one over the other.

Consultant: Excellent! Having a balanced schedule can really help manage both your studies and your passion for art. When you manage to create that balance, how do you think it might feel to you emotionally?

User: I think it might make me feel more accomplished and satisfied, knowing that I’m doing something I love while still keeping up with my schoolwork.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful insight! Feeling accomplished in different areas can build your confidence. As we think about this plan, what’s one small goal you could set for the week to start this practice of drawing?

User: I could aim to draw at least once this week, even if it's just for half an hour.

Consultant: That sounds completely doable! Focusing on just one session of drawing gives you a tangible goal to aim for. As you work towards this, how can you celebrate that achievement, no matter how small it may seem?

User: I guess I could treat myself to something special or just take a moment to appreciate that I took time for myself.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach! Celebrating your efforts, big or small, can foster a positive mindset. If you notice that self-doubt creeps in this week, remember to reflect on your progress and the joy you gain from drawing. How do you feel about setting this goal and plan for the week ahead?

User: I feel motivated! I’ll try to stick to this plan and see how it goes.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, this is a process and it’s perfectly okay to take small steps. As we wrap up today’s session, is there anything else on your mind that you'd like to discuss before we finish?

User: No, I think we covered a lot! Thank you for listening and guiding me through my thoughts today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Youli! I appreciate your openness and courage in exploring these feelings. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember, you’re taking significant steps forward. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better, but I still struggle with participating in class. I want to express myself, but I constantly fear failing.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re in a bit of a tug-of-war with your desire to participate and your fear of judgment. Can you tell me more about a specific moment in class where you felt this way?

User: Well, last week, there was a group discussion, and I wanted to share my thoughts. But I hesitated and ended up not speaking at all. I felt so disappointed with myself afterward.

Consultant: That sounds really frustrating, especially when you wanted to share but felt held back. What were the thoughts running through your mind at that moment?

User: I was thinking, "What if I say something stupid?" or "What if they laugh at me?" It made me freeze.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really powerful. It seems they contributed to your hesitation. What feelings did those thoughts create for you in that situation?

User: I felt anxious and embarrassed, like I just wanted to disappear.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. You want to avoid discomfort, which is a natural response. However, let's explore—if a friend were in your position, how might you advise them?

User: I would probably tell them to just try speaking up, that it’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: That's a compassionate perspective! You seem to have some good insights about how to support others. What if you applied that same advice to yourself? 

User: I guess I could try telling myself that it’s okay to make mistakes too. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about shifting those critical thoughts into something more supportive. Would you be willing to set a small goal for yourself for the next class?

User: Maybe I could aim to share at least one point during the discussion.

Consultant: That sounds like a great goal! It’s small and manageable. How do you feel about trying that? 

User: I feel a bit nervous just thinking about it, but also hopeful.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous about trying something new. Let’s remember—this is a practice, and every small step counts. How might you celebrate that effort, regardless of the outcome?

User: I suppose I could treat myself afterward, maybe a snack or a little break.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Rewarding yourself can reinforce positive feelings linked to participating. What could be a way to remind yourself of this goal before class starts?

User: Maybe I could write it down and keep it on my desk.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Having a visible reminder can help reinforce your intention. As you prepare for class, practice replacing those fear-based thoughts with more positive ones. 

User: I’ll try that. It makes sense to challenge my negative thoughts.

Consultant: Definitely! How about we check in after your next class and discuss how it went? 

User: Sure! I’d like that. 

Consultant: I'm looking forward to hearing about it. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. This is a learning experience. 

User: Yes, I understand. Thank you for the encouragement!

Consultant: You’re welcome, Liu! I’m proud of your willingness to face these feelings. 

User: I’m learning to be more open with myself about my fears.

Consultant: That’s such a vital step toward building your confidence. How do you think you’ll feel if you manage to share your point next class?

User: I hope I’ll feel proud, and maybe more relaxed about speaking up in the future.

Consultant: Exactly! The sense of accomplishment can help build that confidence over time. Just remember, it’s okay to feel a mix of emotions during this process. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more at ease talking about this now. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! This conversation is a safe space for exploring your thoughts and feelings. 

User: I appreciate that. It helps me think more clearly about my challenges.

Consultant: That’s wonderful, Liu! Having clarity is a crucial part of the process. Let's keep building on this progress next time. 

User: Yes, I’d like that. 

Consultant: Before we end today, can we summarize what we discussed? What are your main takeaways?

User: I need to challenge my negative thoughts and set small goals for class participation, and I can reward myself afterward.

Consultant: Perfect summary! You’re on a great path. Remember, it’s about consistent practice. 

User: I will, and thank you for believing in me.

Consultant: Always! I believe in your ability to create positive change. See you next time, Liu! 

User: See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again, Youli. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, especially after resolving that small conflict with my roommate. I think I’m starting to communicate more actively and trying to make new friends.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Youli! It sounds like you’re making positive steps in your relationships. How do you feel about your ability to connect with others now compared to before?

User: I feel more confident, actually. I'm not as scared to approach people as I used to be. But sometimes I still worry about what they think of me.

Consultant: It's great to see you gaining confidence! It’s perfectly normal to have concerns about others' perceptions. Can you share a specific situation where you felt this way recently?

User: Well, I met some classmates during a study group. I was nervous talking to them at first, but I tried to join the conversation. I kept thinking that they might find me awkward.

Consultant: Joining a new conversation can be challenging. What thoughts crossed your mind while you were trying to engage with your classmates?

User: I just kept thinking they might not be interested in what I have to say. I felt like I was going to embarrass myself.

Consultant: I understand that feeling. You were worried about being judged. Have you noticed if these thoughts were based on any evidence or past experiences?

User: Not really. I guess it's just my usual negative thinking. Most of them seemed friendly, but I couldn't shake off that anxiety.

Consultant: That makes sense. It sounds like those automatic thoughts about embarrassment are still strong for you. What do you think could happen if you challenged those thoughts and looked for evidence against them?

User: Maybe I’d find out that people are more accepting than I think. I could try to remind myself that not everyone is judging me harshly.

Consultant: Exactly! If you were to adopt that perspective, how might that change your approach in social situations?

User: I think I’d feel more relaxed and willing to participate. It might even lead to better connections with them.

Consultant: That's an excellent insight, Youli! Relaxing your expectations can really help. Are there other situations where you think this approach might be useful?

User: I suppose anytime I meet new people or join group activities. I often hesitate to participate because of what I might think others would say about me.

Consultant: Preparing yourself to challenge your negative thoughts could be beneficial. What steps can you take to reinforce these new, more positive thoughts?

User: I could practice reminding myself that everyone has their insecurities and that I’m not alone in feeling this way. Maybe I could even set small goals for interaction.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Setting small goals can help you gradually build confidence. What would be a small goal for your next social interaction?

User: I think my goal could be to initiate a conversation with someone new in class this week, maybe ask about a topic we’re studying.

Consultant: That sounds like a great goal! Initiating a conversation about a shared interest can make it easier. How do you plan to approach that interaction?

User: I might start by commenting on the lecture and asking for their opinion. That feels like a simple way to engage.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Starting with a comment can help ease you into the conversation. How do you think you’ll feel after making that effort?

User: I believe I might feel proud of myself, regardless of how it goes. Just trying would be a step forward.

Consultant: Absolutely! Acknowledging even the smallest progress is important. Reflecting on your feelings after the interaction will help reinforce your positive growth.

User: Right. I should also remember that it’s okay if things don’t go perfectly. I’ll learn from every experience.

Consultant: Exactly! Learning from each situation helps reduce pressure. Let’s work on reinforcing your self-acceptance and validating your efforts. 

User: I like that idea. I need to remind myself to be kinder to myself during these processes.

Consultant: That’s an essential part of building self-confidence. As you continue to practice your social skills, how do you envision your relationships evolving?

User: I hope they become deeper and more meaningful. I want to have friends I can really connect with and share experiences.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful goal, Youli. As you engage more and develop these connections, you'll likely feel a greater sense of belonging. How does that make you feel about the future?

User: It makes me feel excited! I’m looking forward to experiencing more positive interactions and building friendships.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You’re on a positive path, and I believe that as you keep pushing those limits, you’ll continue to grow. Let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today. 

User: Sure! We talked about my growing confidence in social situations, the need to challenge my negative thoughts, and setting small goals for interaction.

Consultant: Exactly! You've made remarkable progress, Youli. Keep focusing on those goals and remember to practice self-compassion along the way. How do you feel about wrapping up for today?

User: I feel good about it! I’m motivated to work on my goals and try to stay positive.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Youli! Remember, you’re capable of managing these challenges. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, You Li! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling much better, honestly. I've been gaining a lot more confidence since participating in the campus volunteer activities. It feels good to be recognized and appreciated. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Building confidence through your participation is such a positive step. Can you share more about how these experiences have made you feel about yourself and your future? 

User: I feel like I'm beginning to see my own value. For a long time, I felt invisible and unimportant. Now, I'm feeling more optimistic and excited about what lies ahead.

Consultant: It sounds like you're starting to embrace your self-worth, which is an incredible achievement. What specific goals do you have now that you're feeling this way?

User: I want to keep this positive momentum going. I'm thinking about getting involved in more activities, maybe even take up a leadership role in one of them. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Engaging in more activities can definitely reinforce your self-confidence. What might be some small steps you could take to get started on that?

User: I guess I could attend some meetings for different clubs or organizations. Maybe I could volunteer to help organize an event or something like that.

Consultant: Those are great steps! Attending meetings and volunteering to help organize events could definitely position you as an active member of the community. How does that make you feel thinking about taking those steps?

User: It makes me feel a bit nervous, to be honest. But at the same time, I feel excited. I want to push myself out of my comfort zone.

Consultant: Feeling nervous is perfectly normal, especially when stepping out of your comfort zone. What strategies do you think could help manage that nervousness as you move forward?

User: Maybe I could focus on my breathing before going into an event. Also, reminding myself of the positives from the last volunteer experience might help.

Consultant: Those sound like effective strategies! Focusing on your breathing can help ground you, and reflecting on positive past experiences can definitely motivate you. Have you considered writing down your thoughts or reflecting on them after each event?

User: That sounds like a good idea! I usually have a lot going on in my mind, and writing it down might help clarify my feelings.

Consultant: Absolutely! Journaling can be a powerful tool for reflection and growth. What do you think you might write about after an event?

User: I could write about what I did well, what I could improve on, and how I felt during and after the experience. 

Consultant: That’s a solid plan. Reflecting on your experiences this way can help you recognize your growth and celebrate your successes. How do you plan to integrate this into your routine?

User: I could set aside some time every week for reflection. Maybe Sunday evenings, to review my week.

Consultant: Establishing that routine sounds beneficial—it gives you a dedicated time to reflect and prepares you for the week ahead. How do you feel about this idea?

User: I feel good about it! It gives me something to look forward to each week and helps me stay connected with my progress.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Staying connected to your progress will reinforce your self-esteem. As you work through these reflections, how can you remind yourself to stay positive during challenging moments?

User: I think using positive affirmations might help. Like telling myself that I am capable and worthy of good experiences.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Positive affirmations can help shift your mindset, especially during tough times. Would you like to establish a few affirmations that resonate with you? 

User: Yes, I think I would like to say things like “I am enough,” and “I bring value to those around me.” 

Consultant: Those are powerful affirmations! Repeating them regularly can really help solidify your new mindset. How do you feel about incorporating them into your daily routine?

User: I can start each day with those affirmations! It could set a positive tone for the day ahead.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea, You Li! Beginning each day with affirmations can mentally prepare you for the challenges ahead. As we wrap up our session, what are your key takeaways today?

User: I feel like I have a solid plan to maintain my confidence and positivity. The idea of reflecting regularly and using affirmations really resonates with me.

Consultant: Those are great insights! It seems you have developed actionable strategies to reinforce your positive changes. How do you feel about your ability to manage these strategies moving forward?

User: I feel very hopeful! Knowing that I have tools to help me stay positive makes me feel more in control.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! I'm confident that you’ll continue to thrive with these new strategies. Remember, you can always come back for support if you ever feel overwhelmed. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate all your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, You Li! It’s been a pleasure working with you, and I wish you the best on your continued journey. Take care!
