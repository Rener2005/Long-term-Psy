Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I don't know... things have been rough. School is just so overwhelming. I feel like I can't keep up, and the criticisms from my teacher just make it worse.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're feeling quite stressed and frustrated with your school situation. Can you tell me a bit more about what’s been happening lately in your classes?

User: Well, I haven't been handing in my assignments on time, and my teacher keeps pointing it out. It makes me feel like I'm failing, and I don't even know how to fix it.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when receiving that kind of feedback. Let’s explore together why these assignments have been challenging for you. What do you think is making it difficult to complete them?

User: I don't know. Sometimes, I just sit there in class and daydream instead of paying attention. When I get home, I can't find the motivation to start my homework.

Consultant: It seems like your mind wanders a lot during class. That can really impact your motivation when it's time to do your homework. Can you identify what’s on your mind when you're daydreaming?

User: It's just... I worry about getting into trouble or about what my grades will be like. I feel like I'm not good enough, and that just makes me want to give up.

Consultant: It sounds like you're carrying a lot of pressure and self-doubt. A lot of students feel this way, but it's important to recognize that these thoughts can hold you back. Have you thought about what a successful day would look like for you in school?

User: I guess I'd like to finish my assignments on time and not feel so stressed about them. But it just seems so hard to even think about that right now.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel that way. We can take this step by step. Let’s implement a small goal together. What if we set a goal for just one assignment this week? How do you feel about that?

User: That sounds possible, I guess. But I’m worried I won’t stick to it.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, but we can put strategies in place to help you stay on track. Would having a set time each day to focus on that assignment help you feel more secure?

User: Maybe... If I had a routine, it might help me not forget and get distracted.

Consultant: Establishing a routine can definitely provide a sense of structure. Let’s discuss what time works best for you. When do you feel you have the most energy to work on your assignments?

User: I think after dinner might work. I’m usually awake and not too tired then.

Consultant: Great! How about we start with 30 minutes a day after dinner, focusing just on your assignments? Would you feel comfortable trying that?

User: Yeah, I think I could try that. I just hope it helps.

Consultant: It’s completely okay to have those hopes and doubts. What’s important is that you’re willing to try! How about we check in during our next session to see how it’s going? We can make adjustments if needed.

User: That sounds good. I’d like to see if it actually helps.

Consultant: Perfect! It’s all about finding what works best for you. Remember, it’s okay to take small steps. Let’s also talk about how you’re feeling about the criticisms from your teacher. Do you think these comments affect your motivation?

User: Definitely. I feel like they're genuinely disappointed in me, and I hate letting them down.

Consultant: That feeling can be really tough to deal with. It’s important to remember that your worth isn’t defined by one person's opinion. How do you think you might respond to your teacher next time, especially when you feel criticized?

User: I guess maybe I could ask them for help instead of just feeling upset about it.

Consultant: That’s a powerful approach! Asking for help can show that you’re willing to improve. Perhaps we could also discuss how to frame that request so it feels comfortable for you?

User: Yeah, I think I could say something like “I’m really trying, but I'm struggling.” 

Consultant: That’s an excellent way to express your feelings! Being open about your struggles can foster understanding. How does it make you feel to think about doing that?

User: It feels a bit scary, but also like it might help.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel that way. Stepping outside of your comfort zone can be daunting, but it can also lead to positive change. Would you like to consider this technique as part of our goal moving forward?

User: Sure, I think that makes sense. 

Consultant: I'm proud of you for being open to change! Let’s wrap up today’s session by summarizing what we’ve discussed. We have a plan for your assignments, a new routine, and an approach to communicating with your teacher. Does that sound good?

User: Yes, I think those are all great steps.

Consultant: Fantastic! Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. I believe in your ability to make these changes. We’ll continue this journey together. Take care until we meet again!

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful. See you next time!

Consultant: Hi Xiaozhang! I'm glad to see you for our session today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty down, to be honest. With schoolwork piling up and not hearing much from my parents, I feel kind of lost. 

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're feeling a lack of support from your parents, and that's making it tough for you, especially academically. Can you tell me more about how that affects your daily life?

User: Well, I just sit in class and zone out. When I get home, I can’t find the motivation to study, and sometimes I just sleep instead of doing my homework. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of frustration regarding your studies. You also mentioned feeling lost. What do you wish was different in your relationship with your parents?

User: I just wish they would check on me more or call me to see how I’m doing. Sometimes, I feel like they don't care, and that makes me feel really alone.

Consultant: That must be really tough for you, feeling alone in this situation. It's completely understandable to want more involvement from your parents. Do you think their absence affects how you view your studies and school life?

User: Definitely. I feel like if they cared more, I would study harder. But since they’re not around much, it makes me think, what's the point? 

Consultant: It sounds like their absence creates a negative belief about your motivation to study. Let’s try to examine that a bit more. Can you think of any evidence that supports or contradicts the idea that their absence means you shouldn't even try?

User: Well, there have been times when I actually managed to do well in some subjects when I made an effort. But then I just get discouraged again.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! It shows that when you put effort in, you can achieve positive outcomes. What do you think stops you from making that effort consistently?

User: I guess sometimes I feel overwhelmed, and I think it won’t change anyway, so why bother? 

Consultant: It's understandable to feel overwhelmed, especially when you're unsure about the support from your family. Have you considered trying to change that internal narrative? Perhaps exploring small steps that could help you feel more in control of your studies?

User: I’ve thought about it but I don’t know where to start. 

Consultant: Let’s start small. How about creating a simple study schedule? Planning a few short study sessions throughout the week could help you feel more organized and less overwhelmed. What do you think?

User: That sounds doable. I think I could try that. 

Consultant: Great! And while you’re doing that, how about jotting down your feelings? It might help you process them better. What do you think you would write about?

User: I could write about how I feel when I study or when I think about my parents. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Expressing your feelings can provide clarity. Remember, it’s a safe space for you to explore these emotions without judgment. 

User: Yeah, I like that. It might help to get those feelings out of my head. 

Consultant: Exactly! By writing down your feelings and thoughts, you can start to see patterns and how they impact your actions. Let’s also think about your interactions with peers. How do you feel about socializing with classmates?

User: I don’t know... I’m not really good at talking to them. I feel shy, and I worry they won’t understand me. 

Consultant: That’s a common concern, and it’s okay to feel shy. How about we tackle this step by step? What if you started with small conversations with classmates about schoolwork? 

User: I could try that, but what if they don’t respond well?

Consultant: It's possible, but remember that everyone has their ups and downs. If they don't respond the way you hope, it doesn’t reflect on your worth. You’re simply trying to connect. What would help you feel more confident in starting those small conversations?

User: Maybe if I practiced what I wanted to say first, I wouldn’t feel so nervous.

Consultant: Practicing is a great strategy! You could even role-play with someone you trust. This could help boost your confidence for when you approach your classmates. 

User: That sounds like a good idea! I think I could do that. 

Consultant: Wonderful! So, to summarize, you want to create a study schedule, express your feelings through writing, and practice having small conversations. Does that sound like a plan?

User: Yes, it does! I feel a bit excited thinking about it. 

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! It seems like you're starting to feel more in control of your actions. Remember, it’s all about taking one step at a time. How do you feel about continuing this momentum next time we meet?

User: I’m really looking forward to it. I think this could really help me! 

Consultant: I'm excited for you too, Xiaozhang! Reflect on your experiences, and next time we can discuss how your efforts went. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support before our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially regarding your social activities at school?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling better. I've started joining some group activities, and it's been quite fun. I'm still a bit nervous, but it's nice to connect with others.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It sounds like you're starting to enjoy participating in those activities. Can you tell me more about what you find fun, and what parts still make you feel nervous?

User: I like playing games with some classmates, but I get really anxious before starting. I worry they won’t want to play with me or that I might embarrass myself.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious before social interactions. Let’s explore that anxiety a bit. When you have those thoughts before a game, what specific things go through your mind?

User: I think about how awkward I might look or that I might say something stupid. It just makes me want to avoid it altogether.

Consultant: I see. Those thoughts can be really overwhelming. It sounds like there’s a lot of pressure you put on yourself. What do you think would happen if you let go of those worries for a moment? How might that change your experience?

User: I guess if I didn’t worry so much, I could actually enjoy the game. I might even make a few friends.

Consultant: Exactly! Enjoyment and connection are powerful motivators. Let's try to challenge those negative thoughts together. Can you think of any evidence that supports or contradicts those worries? 

User: Well, I did play a game the other day, and everyone seemed to have fun. No one made fun of me, actually!

Consultant: That’s a great example! It shows that your worries don’t always reflect reality. What if you focused on that positive experience next time? How might that help you approach future activities?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that I’ve had fun before and that it's okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: Absolutely! Positive reminders can really help. What else could you do to prepare yourself before joining an activity to alleviate some of that anxiety?

User: I could try to talk to someone beforehand, maybe ask if they want to play. That might help me feel less alone.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Reaching out to someone can create a sense of comfort and connection. What do you think might be a good first step to make that happen?

User: I think I could just say hi when I see them next time or ask about the game they’re playing.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Starting with small steps can make a big difference. How do you feel about setting that as a goal for yourself this week?

User: I feel a bit excited but also nervous. What if they don’t respond positively?

Consultant: It’s natural to feel nervous, but remember your positive past experiences. If they don’t respond as you hope, it doesn’t take away from your effort or value. What strategies could you use if that happens?

User: Maybe I could just let it go and try again later. I shouldn’t take it personally, right?

Consultant: Exactly! It's not a reflection of your worth. Letting go is a great strategy. You’re building resilience by continuing to try. How does it feel to think you can approach this challenge in multiple ways?

User: It feels good! I feel like I have a plan now. It's less intimidating.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! Establishing a plan helps reduce anxiety. As we work towards your social goals, how do you think this newfound confidence could impact other areas of your life, such as your studies?

User: I think if I’m more confident socially, I might feel more comfortable speaking up in class. It could help my grades too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Confidence in one area often translates into others. As you strengthen your social skills, they can positively influence your academic life. What would it feel like to continue building on that confidence both socially and academically?

User: It feels really hopeful! I want to improve my grades and talk more with my classmates. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic aspiration, Xiaozhang! Now, as we recap today’s session, what do you think has been your biggest takeaway or achievement?

User: I realized I can change my thoughts about socializing and that I have the power to try and connect with others. 

Consultant: That’s a significant insight! You’ve made wonderful progress. For our next session, let’s focus again on your experiences and perhaps set new goals for your studies as well. 

User: That sounds good! I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: I am too, Xiaozhang! Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and I’m here to support you. Keep practicing your new strategies. We’ll catch up soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! I'm glad to see you again. Let's start by discussing how you're feeling these days, especially with the improvements in your friendships and studies.

User: Hi! I'm feeling a bit more relaxed because I've made friends, and I'm happy to talk about my problems with him. But I'm still worried about my studies and my grades.

Consultant: It's great to hear you feel more relaxed and have formed a friendship! That support is really valuable. Tell me, what specifically worries you about your studies right now?

User: I’m afraid I won’t be able to keep up with my classmates, and I often don’t know how to tackle my assignments. Sometimes I just freeze and don’t know where to start.

Consultant: That feeling of being stuck can be really challenging. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed, especially when you’re trying to improve. What if we break your assignments down into smaller tasks? Do you think that could help you get started?

User: Yes, that sounds like a good idea. I usually get overwhelmed by the whole assignment, but smaller tasks might be easier.

Consultant: Exactly! Breaking tasks into smaller, manageable parts can make a big difference. Let's think about one of your assignments right now. What would be the first step you could take?

User: I could start by reading the instructions first. That seems manageable.

Consultant: That's a great first step! Once you read the instructions, what do you think you might do next?

User: I guess I could make a list of what I need to do for the assignment. That way I won’t forget anything.

Consultant: Perfect strategy! Creating a checklist can help guide you through the process. It might give you a sense of accomplishment as you check things off. How will you reward yourself once you complete tasks on your list?

User: I could allow myself to play a game or watch a video for a bit. That sounds like a nice reward.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Rewards can motivate you to stick with your tasks. How do you feel about using this approach for your other assignments as well?

User: I think it could really help. It makes things seem less scary. I just need to remember to do it.

Consultant: Remembering is key! We can even set reminders or create a schedule to help you stay on track. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds helpful! I could put it on my phone so I don’t forget.

Consultant: Great thinking! Using your phone can keep you organized. Let's also talk about your confidence. Can you recall a time when you tackled a task and felt proud of yourself?

User: There was a time when I finished a group project, and everyone liked my part. I felt really proud then!

Consultant: That's an excellent experience to reflect on! Recognizing your successes, like finishing that project, can bolster your confidence. How can you remind yourself of that victory when approaching future tasks?

User: I could write it down or think about it when I feel discouraged. 

Consultant: Writing it down is a fantastic idea! It can serve as a reminder of what you're capable of achieving. Do you feel ready to implement these strategies to help with your studies?

User: Yes, I feel more confident about it now. I think I can try these steps!

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Xiaozhang! As we get ready to wrap up today, let's summarize what strategies we've discussed. How do you foresee using them in the coming weeks?

User: I will break down my assignments, make a checklist, reward myself after finishing tasks, and remember my past success.

Consultant: Excellent plan! I believe these steps will help you progress in your studies. Remember, it's okay to reach out to your friend for support as well. How do you feel about meeting again to check on your progress?

User: I would like that! It helps to talk about these things and plan.

Consultant: I'm so proud of the progress you've made today, and I'm looking forward to our next session. Keep practicing those strategies, and don’t hesitate to celebrate even the small victories. Until next time!

User: Thank you! I feel happy about our discussion today.

Consultant: Hi, Xiaozhang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling about your studies since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really good! My grades have improved a bit, and my teachers even praised me. I feel more positive and excited about my future.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It's fantastic that you’ve received some positive feedback. Let's talk about your progress—what specific changes have you noticed in your study habits or learning?

User: I've started to pay more attention in class and even completed some of my homework. I used to zone out a lot, but now I'm trying to stay focused.

Consultant: Staying focused is a great achievement! Can you think of an example where you managed to concentrate better and how that made you feel?

User: There was this one math class where I actually understood the topic and participated. I felt proud of myself afterward.

Consultant: It's amazing that you felt proud after actively participating! How do you think this can motivate you for the next semester?

User: I think if I keep this up, I can do even better. It makes me believe I can achieve my goals.

Consultant: Building that belief in yourself is key. What goals do you have in mind for the next semester's learning?

User: I want to improve in math and science, maybe even get a B in my report card. That would be nice.

Consultant: Setting a specific goal like that is very helpful! Let's break it down further. What steps do you think you can take to achieve that B in math and science?

User: I guess I could ask more questions in class and try studying with a classmate. Maybe I should also create a study schedule.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Asking questions helps clarify doubts, and studying with someone can make learning more enjoyable. How do you feel about creating that study schedule?

User: I think it would help me organize my time better. Sometimes I just don't know how to start studying.

Consultant: Organizing your time is definitely important. What subjects or topics do you think should be prioritized in your schedule?

User: Probably math first because I find it a bit challenging. Then I'll focus on science.

Consultant: Sounds like a solid plan! What kind of time slots do you think you could allocate for each subject during the week?

User: Maybe I can study math for an hour every day after school and science on weekends.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! Setting aside specific times can really make a difference. How do you think you can keep yourself motivated to stick to this plan?

User: I could reward myself after completing my study sessions, maybe with a video game or some time with friends.

Consultant: Rewards can be a great incentive! What kind of rewards would be meaningful for you after achieving your study goals?

User: I think playing my favorite game for an hour or hanging out with my friends would be really fun!

Consultant: Those sound like enjoyable rewards! It’s good to have something to look forward to. How do you feel about sharing your plan with your grandparents, so they can support you too?

User: I think I’ll tell them! They’ll probably be happy to hear I'm planning to study more.

Consultant: Involving your grandparents could provide you with additional encouragement. As we wrap up today, how confident do you feel about implementing this study plan?

User: I feel pretty confident! I have a clear idea of what to do now.

Consultant: That’s great to hear, Xiaozhang! You’ve made impressive progress, and your proactive approach is commendable. Remember to be patient with yourself and make adjustments as needed.

User: I will! Thanks again!
