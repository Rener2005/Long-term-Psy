Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you today. Before we dive in, I want to understand how you've been feeling since our last session. Can you share what's been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really anxious. Just thinking about going to class makes me panic. I still feel like everyone is judging me and I just can't stop worrying about what they think.

Consultant: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy weight of anxiety, especially in social situations like attending class. Let's explore that a bit more. Can you describe a specific thought that crosses your mind when you think about going to class?

User: I keep imagining that if I speak up or do something wrong, everyone will laugh at me. It’s like I’m just frozen in fear.

Consultant: That sounds very distressing, feeling as though you might be laughed at. When you have that thought, how does it make you feel physically and emotionally?

User: My heart races, and I feel so embarrassed. I just want to disappear. It’s hard to breathe sometimes. 

Consultant: Those physical sensations of racing heart and difficulty breathing can be really overwhelming. It's understandable why the thought of speaking up brings about such fear. Let's try to identify this thought a little further. Do you notice if there are certain times or situations in class when these feelings intensify?

User: Yes, it gets worse when the teacher asks questions. I feel like I have to answer, but what if I get it wrong?

Consultant: It makes sense that the pressure of being called on and potentially making a mistake would increase your anxiety. So, could we challenge that fear a bit? What evidence do you have that people would laugh at you if you got an answer wrong?

User: I don't know... I guess I've seen some classmates giggle before, but it might not be at me.

Consultant: That's a good insight! It's difficult to know for sure if they're laughing at you or if it's something else entirely. If a friend were in your position, how might you advise them to think about that situation?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and it’s okay. They shouldn’t worry too much.

Consultant: Exactly! You would be compassionate and understanding towards a friend. Now, I wonder if you could extend that kindness to yourself. What would it look like to remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes and it’s part of learning?

User: I guess I could try to be gentler with myself. It’s just hard to do that in the moment.

Consultant: It is indeed challenging to shift your thinking in the moment, but practicing self-compassion can be a helpful strategy. Let's also consider some gradual steps to ease you into participating more in class. Are there any small goals you could set for yourself regarding speaking up?

User: Maybe I could aim to answer at least one question each week, even if I'm nervous.

Consultant: That's a great goal, Li! Focusing on one answer each week gives you a clear target, and it’s manageable. What do you think might help you when that moment comes and you feel nervous?

User: I could take a deep breath before I speak. That might help calm me down.

Consultant: Deep breathing can definitely help activate your relaxation response. Would you be open to practicing a simple breathing technique together now?

User: Sure, that could be helpful.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four… hold for a count of four… and exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. We can repeat that a few times. How do you feel afterwards?

User: I feel a bit clearer. It helps to focus on my breathing rather than my thoughts.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Focusing on your breath will certainly help calm your nerves in anxious situations. As you continue to practice this, your confidence can build over time. Looking back at our session today, what strategies do you feel most excited about using?

User: I think the breathing and trying to answer questions are the most helpful. I’m a bit less afraid now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Li! You’re taking important steps towards managing your anxiety. As we start to wrap up, what are some strategies you can remind yourself of when you feel that anxiousness creeping back in?

User: I can tell myself that everyone makes mistakes and to breathe before speaking. 

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve made great progress today in understanding your feelings and developing strategies. As you move forward, remember it's okay to feel nervous; just remind yourself of the skills you've learned. 

User: Thank you! I feel a little better already.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. We're nearing the end of our time today. Remember, it’s entirely fine to experience ups and downs. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out. You’ve got this, Li! 

User: Thank you so much. I really appreciate your help today. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better, but I still struggle with social situations. I tried to speak in a group activity, but I got so nervous that I couldn't express myself properly. It left me feeling very frustrated.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you’re still encountering some challenges despite making some progress. That feeling of frustration can be quite tough to handle. Can you share more about what thoughts were going through your mind during that group activity?

User: I kept thinking that everyone would judge me if I messed up. I thought they would see me as a failure.

Consultant: Those thoughts of being judged and feeling like a failure can create a lot of pressure. How did those thoughts make you feel in that moment?

User: I felt really anxious and embarrassed. I just wanted to disappear. 

Consultant: I understand; that must have been really difficult for you. It's common for those feelings to arise in social situations, especially when we fear judgment. Let's explore that further—do you notice any patterns in your thinking when these feelings come up?

User: Yes, I tend to think the worst. If I stumble over my words, I assume everyone thinks I'm stupid.  

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Li. That sounds like a tough mindset to navigate. Let’s think about it together—how much evidence do you think supports that thought that if you stumble, everyone thinks negatively of you? Could there be alternative ways to interpret people's reactions?

User: I guess I don't really have strong evidence for that. It's just what my mind tells me.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, Li. It’s great that you can identify the lack of evidence there. What about if a friend stumbled over their words—how would you perceive that situation?

User: I would probably think they were just nervous and it’s okay. I wouldn’t judge them harshly.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a more compassionate perspective. It seems like you can be kinder to others than to yourself. Let’s challenge that negative thought you have about yourself: if you were to replace that thought with a more balanced one, what could it be?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s part of learning.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful alternative thought. By recognizing everyone’s humanity, you might feel more at ease. How would you feel if you tried to think that way in your next group activity?

User: It sounds calming. I could focus on participating rather than worrying about how I sound.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive approach! To support this new thinking, let's think about creating some small, manageable steps you could take in future social situations to help build your confidence. What could be a small step you feel comfortable trying?

User: Maybe I could start by joining a small group discussion where the stakes feel lower.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Starting with a smaller setting can definitely help ease some anxiety. How would you prepare yourself to feel more comfortable in that situation?

User: I could remind myself of that new thought, and maybe even practice what I want to say beforehand.

Consultant: Practicing sounds like a great strategy, and those reminders can help ground you in the moment. As we move forward, let’s also consider how to celebrate any progress, no matter how small. How might you celebrate after that small group discussion?

User: I could treat myself to something fun, like watching my favorite show after.

Consultant: I love that idea! Celebrating your efforts is essential. As we wrap up today, let's think about how far you’ve come. What do you feel has been the biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I feel more aware of my negative thoughts and have some strategies to counter them now. 

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear, Li! Awareness is a crucial step toward change. Remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time, and each small success counts. I look forward to hearing about your experience in the next session. Keep practicing those strategies!

User: Thank you! I appreciate the support. I'll definitely try to implement what we discussed.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s always a pleasure to support you. Remember, you’re making progress, and I’m here to help you on this journey. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm so glad to see you today, Li. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. That project presentation in class gave me some confidence. But I still feel nervous when I think about socializing with new people.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you felt confident after your presentation! That’s a positive step. Could you tell me more about the feelings you experience when you think about socializing with new people?

User: I feel anxious and sometimes start imagining worst-case scenarios. Like, what if they don't like me or what if I embarrass myself? 

Consultant: Those thoughts are quite common when facing new social situations. You mentioned feeling anxious; how do those thoughts impact your desire to engage with others?

User: They make me avoid situations where I might have to talk to someone new. I end up just staying in the background during group activities.

Consultant: I understand how that can be frustrating. Avoiding those situations might temporarily relieve your anxiety, but it can also make it harder to feel confident in the future. Have you noticed any situations where you felt more comfortable engaging?

User: Yes, during the group project, I felt okay talking to my teammates because we were all working towards the same goal. But outside of that, it’s tough.

Consultant: It sounds like having a shared purpose helped ease your anxiety. We can build on that experience. What if we planned to simulate some social situations today? It might help you practice and feel more prepared.

User: That sounds interesting! But I’m a little nervous about role-playing. What if I mess up?

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about role-playing. Remember, it's a safe space for practice, and making mistakes is part of learning. What if we started small, with just a simple introduction?

User: I could try that. Maybe introducing myself wouldn’t be too bad.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s role-play that scenario. You can start by saying: “Hi, my name is Li. It’s nice to meet you.” Whenever you’re ready!

User: Okay… *takes a deep breath* Hi, my name is Li. It’s nice to meet you.

Consultant: Great job, Li! How did it feel to say that?

User: It felt a bit scary, but also kind of liberating. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent insight! Let’s build on that feeling of liberation. What do you think could be a good follow-up question you can ask after introducing yourself?

User: Um, maybe asking what their name is or what they study?

Consultant: Those are great options! Would you like to practice that follow-up?

User: Sure! *smiles* Hi, my name is Li. It’s nice to meet you. What’s your name? 

Consultant: Wonderful! Now, how did that feel?

User: It felt better! I actually enjoyed it a bit.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Li! Enjoying the interaction is a positive sign. Based on this experience, how could you apply these techniques in real social settings?

User: I could try to remember to introduce myself first and maybe prepare a few questions to ask.

Consultant: Absolutely! Preparing some questions can make you feel more confident. Is there a specific social event coming up where you could practice this?

User: There’s a student mixer next week. I wasn't sure if I should go, but maybe I could give it a try.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! What small goal could you set for yourself at the mixer?

User: I think I could aim to introduce myself to at least two people.

Consultant: That’s a great and achievable goal! As you prepare for the mixer, think about the positive experiences you've had in our session today. How can you remind yourself of that confidence?

User: I could write it down or maybe even practice what I want to say the night before.

Consultant: Excellent ideas! Writing it down and practicing will reinforce your confidence. Remember, even if things don’t go perfectly, every step counts. How are you feeling about your upcoming interaction now?

User: I feel a little bit excited, actually! Like I have something to look forward to.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Li! Feeling excited can replace some of the anxiety. Let’s take a moment to reflect on your progress today. What do you think was your biggest takeaway?

User: I think realizing that I can actually enjoy socializing and that practice helps me feel better about it.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! And it's important to remember that it's okay to feel some anxiety. With practice, you'll become more comfortable. Let’s summarize your strategies for the mixer: introduce yourself, prepare questions, and enjoy the process. How does that sound?

User: Sounds like a solid plan! I like the idea of focusing on enjoyment.

Consultant: Exactly! Enjoying the moment can reduce pressure. As we wrap up today’s session, how do you feel about your social skills moving forward?

User: I feel more confident and aware of what I can do to improve. I’m ready to give it a shot!

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember, it's a journey, and you're taking great steps. I believe in your ability to keep growing. If you ever need support again, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care and have fun at the mixer!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I’m really glad to see you again. Last time, we talked about your efforts in introducing your work to strangers and the positive feedback you received. How have you been feeling about that experience since then?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better about reaching out to others. The positive feedback gave me some confidence, but I still feel anxious when I think about doing it again.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more confident, even if the anxiety is still present. Can you share more about what specifically makes you anxious when you consider approaching someone new?

User: I worry that I might sound awkward or that they won't be interested in what I have to say. I guess I just fear being rejected or judged.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable, Li. Feeling worried about how others will perceive us is something many people experience. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come to mind when you're feeling anxious about these interactions?

User: I often think things like “What if they don’t care?” or “What if I embarrass myself?”. Those thoughts really make it harder to approach people.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite distressing. Let’s explore them together. For instance, how much evidence do you think there is to support the idea that people won’t care or that you’ll embarrass yourself?

User: I suppose I don't have much evidence for that. Most of the time, people have been kind and responded positively when I shared my work.

Consultant: That’s a great observation! It seems like there’s a disconnect between your worries and your actual experiences. What if you reframed those thoughts to be more positive or realistic? For example, instead of thinking “What if they don’t care?”, you might consider “They might actually be interested in what I have to say.” How does that sound to you?

User: That makes sense. It feels more hopeful. I think I’ll try to remind myself of the positive responses I’ve had before.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Now, let’s think about some small steps you can take to keep building on this progress. Are there any upcoming social events on campus where you could practice this new way of thinking?

User: Yes, there’s an art exhibition coming up, and I thought about attending. It could be a good opportunity to talk to others about my work.

Consultant: Attending the exhibition sounds like a fantastic idea! How might you feel about setting a goal for yourself during that event, like introducing yourself to at least three new people?

User: That sounds a bit challenging, but I think it’s doable. I could try to prepare a few things to say beforehand to ease my nerves.

Consultant: Preparing in advance is a great strategy! It can help boost your confidence. How about we work together on crafting a few opening lines or questions you could use when meeting new people?

User: Yes, I would appreciate that! I could use something simple to start a conversation.

Consultant: Absolutely! A simple introduction like, “Hi, I’m Li. I’ve been working on a project related to this exhibition. What do you think about it?” can open the door for conversation. Would you feel comfortable using something like that?

User: Yes, that feels manageable! I like that it’s casual and gives them a chance to respond.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It sounds like you’re on the right track. Let’s also think about how you can celebrate small successes after trying out these social interactions, no matter how they go. What could that look like for you?

User: I could treat myself to something nice, like a favorite snack or maybe hang out with a friend afterwards to talk about the experience.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely idea! Celebrating your efforts, regardless of the outcome, can reinforce positive experiences. How do you feel about your upcoming goal after discussing it today?

User: I feel more excited than anxious now. It’s nice to have a plan and a way to celebrate afterwards.

Consultant: That’s great to hear, Li! Remember, every small step you take is a victory. As we continue to work together, we’ll keep building on these social strategies. Would you like to set up a follow-up appointment to discuss how the exhibition goes?

User: Yes, let’s do that! I want to keep working on this and share my progress.

Consultant: I look forward to hearing about it! You're making wonderful strides toward your goals. Just remember, it’s okay to feel a little anxious. What matters is how you choose to respond to it.

User: Thank you! I feel more confident just talking about it. I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li! Remember, every experience is a chance to learn. I believe in your ability to navigate these social situations. Until next time!

User: Until next time! I’ll work on my plan and look forward to sharing my experience.

Consultant: Take care, Li! I'm excited to hear how it all goes.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling much better. I’ve made a new friend on campus, and I've started enjoying social interactions. It’s a bit strange, though; I'm not used to this feeling.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Making new friends can be a big step forward. Can you tell me more about how this friendship has been beneficial for you?

User: Well, we’ve been hanging out a lot, and it feels nice to talk to someone who understands me. I don’t feel as anxious about social situations anymore, which is a huge relief.

Consultant: It sounds like your new friend has provided you with some valuable support. What specific changes have you noticed in your feelings towards social situations?

User: I feel less scared about going to places where there are a lot of people. I actually look forward to joining in activities now, which is a complete change from before.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift! It shows that you’re gaining confidence. Have you been in situations where you needed to push yourself a little more socially?

User: Yes, I attended a study group last week. At first, I was really nervous, but it turned out fine. I even contributed to the discussion.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Li! Being part of a study group can be a great way to build more connections. How did it feel to participate and share your thoughts?

User: It felt empowering! I realized that my opinions matter, and I actually know more than I thought. I’m proud of myself for stepping out of my comfort zone.

Consultant: You should be proud! Recognizing your own worth is an important step. Moving forward, what are some social situations you would like to explore more?

User: I’d like to join some clubs or activities that interest me. I think it would help me meet more people and develop my social skills further.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Engaging in clubs can not only expand your social circle but also provide you with shared interests. What specific clubs or activities are you considering?

User: I’ve been thinking about joining the art club or the book club. Both sound interesting to me.

Consultant: Those are excellent choices! Art can be very expressive, and book clubs offer great opportunities for discussions. How do you feel about approaching these groups?

User: I feel a bit anxious about it, but I’m excited too. I know I need to just take the first step.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel that mix of excitement and anxiety. What if we brainstorm some ways to make that first step feel more manageable?

User: That would be helpful! Maybe I could start by attending a meeting just to observe, without participating at first.

Consultant: That’s a wise approach! Observing can help you build comfort before diving in. What are your thoughts on how to engage with people once you feel ready?

User: Maybe I could prepare a few questions or topics to discuss in advance. That might help break the ice.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Having some prepared topics can ease the pressure. Would you like to practice how you might introduce yourself or start a conversation?

User: Yes, I think that would help. I often freeze up when trying to introduce myself.

Consultant: Let’s practice it together. How would you say your name and something about your interests?

User: Alright, I’d say, “Hi, I’m Li. I love painting and reading fantasy novels.” 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! You’re sharing a bit about yourself, which invites others to respond. How do you think someone might reply to you?

User: They might ask about my favorite book or what kind of painting I enjoy.

Consultant: Exactly! This could lead to a natural conversation. How do you feel about trying this out when the opportunity arises?

User: I feel more confident just thinking about it. I think I can do it!

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Li! Building confidence takes practice, and you’re on the right track. Let’s also discuss ways you can manage any overwhelming feelings that might come up when you face these situations.

User: I could use some tips on that, especially when I start feeling anxious again.

Consultant: One effective method is deep breathing. Taking slow, controlled breaths can help calm your nerves. Would you like to try a short practice together now?

User: Sure, I’d like to try that!

Consultant: Alright, let’s take a deep breath in together for a count of four… and now exhale slowly for a count of four. How did that feel?

User: It felt calming. I think I can use this during stressful moments.

Consultant: Great! Using deep breathing can provide you with a quick tool to help center yourself. As we near the end of our session, let’s reflect on your progress. What do you feel has been your biggest achievement since we started our sessions?

User: I think my biggest achievement is feeling less scared of social interactions and actually enjoying them. I’m really grateful for this change.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! Recognizing and celebrating your progress is important. What strategies do you think you can use to maintain this positive change moving forward?

User: I’ll keep reminding myself that it’s okay to feel anxious and that I can still take small steps to engage with others.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Li. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. You’re doing amazingly well, and I believe you can continue to thrive in social settings.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. I feel much more prepared to face social situations now.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! As this wraps up our sessions for now, remember, you have everything you need to manage your social interactions. If you ever feel the need for support again, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: I will! Thank you so much for everything. I feel much more confident now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li! Best of luck with all your upcoming social adventures. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Li! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite good actually. Leading the project presentation and receiving recognition from my classmates really boosted my confidence. I still have moments of anxiety, but they seem to be less frequent now.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like the project presentation was a significant achievement for you. Can you share more about how you felt during the presentation and how it impacted your self-esteem?

User: During the presentation, I felt nervous at first, but as I spoke and saw my classmates engaged, I started to feel proud. It was nice to feel accepted and appreciated for my efforts. I think it's helped reduce my fear of social interactions a lot.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience was a turning point for you. Overcoming the initial nervousness and feeling proud is an amazing step forward. In what ways do you think you can maintain this newfound confidence in your day-to-day life?

User: I guess I can try to interact more with my classmates and join group activities. It's still a bit intimidating, but I want to keep pushing myself.

Consultant: That’s a great approach, Li! Gradually stepping out of your comfort zone can help reinforce your confidence. What specific situations or settings do you think you would feel comfortable starting with?

User: Maybe I can start by participating in some study groups. I feel like I could benefit from collaboration, especially since I need to study for finals soon.

Consultant: Joining study groups sounds like an excellent plan! Collaboration can help you feel more connected with your classmates. What steps can you take to initiate or join these study groups?

User: I could reach out to a few classmates that I know are in my classes and see if they're planning any study sessions. That feels doable.

Consultant: Perfect! Reaching out to classmates is a great way to ease into social interactions. How do you feel about making that first contact?

User: I feel a bit anxious just thinking about it, but I know it’s important. I don't want to retreat back into my shell.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious about taking that step. Acknowledge those feelings but don’t let them hold you back. What could you say to yourself to counter that anxiety before you reach out?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to feel nervous and that my classmates may feel the same. Plus, we’re all there to help each other succeed.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a very healthy way to frame it. Focusing on mutual support can help ease the pressure. If you find those feelings overwhelming at any point, we can explore strategies to cope with them together.

User: That would be helpful. I don’t want to feel like I’m losing progress.

Consultant: Your awareness of wanting to maintain your progress is a positive sign. Reflecting on times of growth can also be motivating. Can you think of a few moments recently when you felt you overcame fear or anxiety?

User: Definitely, leading the project was huge, and there have been a couple of times I spoke up in class. I used to hesitate but now I find it easier.

Consultant: Those are significant accomplishments to celebrate! Recognizing these victories reinforces your capability. Let's make a plan to incorporate more of these experiences into your daily routine. How can we set some goals for you?

User: Maybe I could set a goal to speak up in every class next week? Just one comment or question per class.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent goal! It’s specific and manageable. How would you feel about tracking your progress after each class?

User: I think tracking would help, so I can see how I'm improving. Plus, it keeps me accountable.

Consultant: Exactly! Keeping track can enhance your confidence as you notice your advancements over time. Let’s also look at how you can reward yourself for achieving these goals. What would motivate you?

User: I like the idea of treating myself to something nice, like a new book or an outing after the week is over.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic incentive! Having something to look forward to can energize your efforts. As we wrap up, let's summarize what we've discussed today. 

User: Sure! I plan to reach out to classmates for study groups, aim to speak up in class next week, and track my progress. I also want to reward myself after a successful week.

Consultant: You've outlined a clear and positive plan, Li. This balanced approach will help maintain your progress. It’s wonderful seeing your growth, and remember, it's okay to seek support if you need it. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel good! I’m excited about my plans and grateful for your support. 

Consultant: I’m thrilled to hear that! You've made remarkable strides, and I have confidence you'll continue on this path. This session is our concluding one for now, but remember that you're always welcome to come back if you need assistance in the future. 

User: Thanks a lot! I appreciate everything. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li. I wish you all the best with your plans and continued progress. Take care!
