Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm really glad you came in for this session. Before we start, can you tell me how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really down about myself. I keep thinking about how I'm not good enough, especially since my parents say I’m timid and lack confidence. That hurts a lot.

Consultant: It sounds like you're dealing with some tough feelings. A lot of young people can feel pressure from what others say about them, especially from family. Can you share a bit more about what specific thoughts or situations make you feel this way?

User: Well, like when we took the group photo at school, I wouldn't take off my mask. I was so scared of what everyone would think of me. I just wanted to hide.

Consultant: I understand. Wanting to hide can be a way of protecting yourself when you feel insecure. What do you think was going through your mind at that moment? 

User: I thought if I showed my face, everyone would judge me. I felt ugly and awkward compared to my classmates. 

Consultant: That sounds really painful, feeling like you had to hide because of those thoughts. Can you tell me what specific beliefs about yourself were at play during that moment?

User: I just kept thinking, “No one will want to be friends with me because I’m not like them.” It feels like I’m always comparing myself to others.

Consultant: Comparing ourselves to others can create a lot of unnecessary pressure. How do you feel these thoughts impact your ability to make friends or participate in activities?

User: It makes me too scared to join in. I just want to be liked and fit in, but I feel like I’ll just embarrass myself. 

Consultant: That fear of embarrassment can be overwhelming. Have you ever thought about how these ideas could be challenged? What if someone you know was feeling this way? What would you tell them?

User: I guess I would say that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. But it’s hard to believe that for myself.

Consultant: It is tough to shift those beliefs about ourselves. Let’s try reframing your thoughts a bit. If you consider the things you do well or the qualities that make you special, what would they be?

User: Hmm... I like that I’m kind to others, and I’m good at helping my younger brothers. But I don’t think that really matters in terms of fitting in.

Consultant: Those are truly valuable qualities, Li! Being kind and supportive are traits that many people admire. Let’s explore how you can focus more on these strengths when thinking about yourself. 

User: I'm not really sure how to start doing that. It feels so ingrained to think negatively.

Consultant: A good start could be keeping a journal of your positive traits, or even a gratitude list reflecting on moments you felt proud of yourself. Would that be something you'd try?

User: Maybe. It sounds a bit strange, but I guess I could try it.

Consultant: It may feel unusual at first, and that's perfectly okay! Remember, this is just for you, and it can help shift your focus. Are there small steps you could take in a social situation to practice being more open about yourself?

User: I could perhaps join a club or activity that interests me. That might help me meet new people.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Finding activities you enjoy can create opportunities to connect with others. What do you think you might want to try?

User: I really like drawing. There’s an art club at school. I could join that!

Consultant: Joining the art club sounds like a fantastic step! It allows you to express yourself and meet others with similar interests. As you think about this, what are your feelings about trying it out?

User: I feel a bit scared, but excited too. Maybe it’s a way to make friends without stressing about fitting in.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel both scared and excited when stepping out of your comfort zone. Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. We can also explore how to manage those feelings of anxiety if it arises.

User: That would be helpful. I do feel really anxious around new people.

Consultant: Together, we can come up with some strategies to manage that anxiety. For instance, deep breathing techniques could be useful before entering social situations. Would you like to practice that?

User: Yes, I’d like to try that. I think it could help me calm down.

Consultant: Great! Let's take a moment to do some deep breathing exercises. Focus on taking a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a little while, and then slowly release it through your mouth. 

User: Okay, I’m trying that now. 

Consultant: How did that feel for you?

User: It feels a little calming. I think I could use this before going into the art club.

Consultant: Absolutely! Using this breathing technique could help ease those anxious moments. As we continue our sessions, we’ll work on building your confidence and self-acceptance. 

User: I really hope that can happen, but I still worry I won’t change.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. Change takes time, and it’s okay to have doubts. Remember, small, consistent efforts can lead to significant improvement. What do you think you can focus on for our next session?

User: I’d like to reflect on my strengths and maybe try to join the art club before we meet again.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! We’ll discuss your experiences and feelings about it next time. You’re doing great work by just being here and wanting to make changes. 

User: Thank you! It feels nice to share all this. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Li! I look forward to hearing about your progress. Remember, change is a journey, and each step you take matters. See you next time!

Consultant: Hi there! I'm really happy to see you today. How have you been feeling about your interactions lately?

User: Hi! Honestly, I've been feeling a bit nervous about talking to my classmates. I want to join more in class activities, but I still worry about being rejected.

Consultant: That's completely understandable. You're feeling nervous about social interactions, but you also have a desire to participate more. Can you tell me a bit about what specifically makes you feel anxious when you're in a social setting?

User: Well, I often think that no one will want to talk to me. Sometimes I feel like I don't have anything interesting to say. 

Consultant: It sounds like you might be having some negative thoughts that are affecting your confidence. Have you noticed how those thoughts make you feel? 

User: Yeah, they make me feel really shy and want to just keep to myself. I want to change that, though! 

Consultant: It's great that you want to work on that! Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. What do you think could happen if you tried to join in on activities, despite your fears?

User: I guess I could have fun and maybe make some new friends, but I’m still scared they won’t like me. 

Consultant: You’re open to the possibility of fun and friendships, which is very positive! But it seems like the fear of rejection is really strong. If a friend felt the same way, what would you tell them about joining activities?

User: I’d tell them to just go for it! Maybe they’d find out that they fit in and have a good time.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! You’re actually offering kind advice to your friend. How about we try to apply that same advice to yourself? What if you viewed social interactions as opportunities rather than potential rejections?

User: That makes sense. I guess thinking of it that way could help me. 

Consultant: Absolutely! How about we set a small goal for you this week? Maybe you could try to say hi to a classmate or join in on a group activity, just to test out how it feels.

User: I could try saying hi to a couple of kids during recess! 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! It’s a small step, and you might discover that things go better than expected. How do you feel about that idea?

User: I feel a bit excited but still a little scared. 

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel a mix of emotions. Remember, it’s about taking small steps. After you try it, you can reflect on how it went. What could you write down about your experience afterward?

User: I could write about how I felt before and after saying hi, and if they responded nicely or not! 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Reflecting on your feelings will help you understand your experiences better. What if you remind yourself that it's okay if it doesn’t go perfectly, and that each attempt is a valuable experience?

User: Yeah, that would probably help me not worry so much about how it goes. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s all about learning and growing. Let’s also think about some positive things you could say to yourself before approaching someone. What are some encouraging thoughts you could use?

User: Maybe something like, "It’s okay to be nervous, but I can do this" would work for me. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful affirmation! It combines self-compassion and encouragement. I support you to use that thought before your interactions. How does it feel to think about using that in your daily life?

User: It feels nice! I think it will help me. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, let’s recap your plan. You’ll practice approaching classmates, take notes about your experience, and use your encouraging thought to support yourself. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I feel a little more confident just talking about my plan. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress! Remember, it’s completely fine to take your time with this. I’m looking forward to hearing about how it goes next time. You’re doing wonderfully, and I believe in you!

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful now. I see that I can improve little by little.

Consultant: You absolutely can! Keep in mind that every small step counts. It was great talking today, and I’m looking forward to our next session. Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself!

User: Thanks! I feel ready to try my best!

Consultant: Hello, Little Li! I'm so glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better. I started talking more with my classmates, especially with one friend. It makes me feel happier, but sometimes I still worry that I'm not good at talking. 

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've been talking with your friends! That shows you're making progress. Can you share what thoughts come to your mind when you feel worried about talking? 

User: I think about what I should say, and then I worry they won't like it. Sometimes I feel like I might say something silly. 

Consultant: I understand. Those worries can be pretty tough. Let's explore those thoughts together. What evidence do you have that they won’t like what you say? 

User: Well, I don't actually know. I just imagine they might laugh or get bored. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're imagining a negative outcome without any real evidence. If a friend said something similar, how would you advise them? 

User: I would probably tell them that their friends should accept them for who they are and that it’s okay to make mistakes. 

Consultant: That's very kind advice! Now, let's apply that to your situation. What if you remind yourself that your friends are likely to appreciate you just as you are? 

User: I guess that makes sense. It’s just hard to remember that when I’m nervous. 

Consultant: That’s completely normal. It takes practice. Why don’t we try setting a small goal for your next interaction with friends? Something like sharing one thought or joke, even if it feels a bit uncomfortable. 

User: That sounds doable! I could try telling them about a funny video I saw. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Sharing something funny can lighten the mood and spark conversation. How do you feel about this approach? 

User: I feel excited! But also a bit scared. 

Consultant: It's normal to feel both excitement and fear before trying something new. Can you think of a way to handle that fear when it comes up? 

User: Maybe I could take a deep breath and remind myself that it’s okay to be myself. 

Consultant: Exactly! Deep breathing is a wonderful tool. Just remember to be gentle with yourself. What positive outcome would you like to focus on after sharing your story with your friends? 

User: I hope they laugh and we talk about it more. 

Consultant: That’s a lovely outcome to aim for. Now, let’s think about the experiences you’ve had in the past when sharing stories. How did you feel afterward? 

User: Usually, I felt relieved and happy when my friends laughed or responded well. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Those positive experiences can help reinforce your confidence. As we continue, why not take a moment to write down a few of those positive interactions you’ve had? 

User: I can do that. I think it would help me remember those good times. 

Consultant: Great! Reflecting on those moments can remind you that you have already succeeded before. Is there anything else you want to explore today? 

User: I think I want to practice talking with you. Can we role-play a scenario where I talk to my classmate? 

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s set up a scenario. Imagine you are approaching your friend during recess. What would be your opening line? 

User: I could say, "Hey, did you see that video about the cat?" 

Consultant: That’s a great start! It’s light and relatable. How do you think your friend would respond? 

User: I think they would probably say yes and want to talk more about it. 

Consultant: Perfect! Now, if your friend engages you, how do you plan to keep the conversation going? 

User: I could ask them if they have any favorite videos or what they think is funny. 

Consultant: That sounds excellent! You're building on the conversation naturally. It’s important to stay curious about what they enjoy too. How does practicing this scenario make you feel? 

User: I feel a bit more confident! It seems easier when we talk about it. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Confidence often comes from practice and preparation. Before we finish today’s session, let’s summarize what you will focus on moving forward. 

User: I will try to share something funny, remember to breathe when I feel scared, and write down positive interactions. 

Consultant: Exactly! You've created a solid plan for yourself. Before we end today, what’s one thing you feel proud of accomplishing during our sessions? 

User: I’m proud that I started talking to my friends more. It feels good! 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic achievement, Little Li! Remember, every step counts. Keep practicing, and you can maintain this progress. If you ever feel unsure again, just think of the positive times you’ve had. 

User: Thank you! I feel excited to keep talking more and remember to write things down. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You're doing an amazing job. I look forward to our next session where we can talk more. Remember, you can always reach out if you need support. 

User: I will! Bye for now! 

Consultant: Bye for now, Little Li! Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Li! I'm so glad to see you today. It seems like you've been feeling more confident lately. Can you share some experiences that have made you feel this way?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling better about myself. Recently, I raised my hand in class to answer a question, which I've never done before. It felt really good!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Raising your hand is a big step. How did you feel before and after you did it?

User: Before I raised my hand, I was really nervous. I thought I would get the answer wrong, but after I answered, I felt proud of myself. My classmates even clapped!

Consultant: It sounds like that experience was quite rewarding for you. What do you think made you decide to raise your hand this time?

User: I guess I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it. I've been trying to change how I see my abilities.

Consultant: That's a great mindset, Xiao Li! It's good to challenge your self-perception. What are some positive things you can say to yourself when you doubt your abilities?

User: I could remind myself that I actually know the answers and that it's okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: Exactly! Emphasizing that it's okay to make mistakes can help relieve some of the pressure. Can you think of any other situations where you might try to speak up or showcase your abilities?

User: I think I could share my ideas in my art class. I love drawing, but I usually keep quiet about what I create.

Consultant: Sharing your artwork sounds like a fantastic opportunity to express yourself! What would it feel like to share your drawings with others?

User: It would be scary but also exciting! I really want people to see what I've made.

Consultant: That's a wonderful goal! What support do you think you might need from me to prepare for sharing in art class?

User: Maybe you can help me practice what I want to say about my drawings.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can role-play that together. First, can you tell me about one of your favorite drawings and what it means to you?

User: I have a drawing of a sunset that I made for my mom. It shows all the colors blending together. I think it represents hope.

Consultant: That sounds beautiful! It’s impressive to convey such a meaningful message through your art. How would you explain this sunset drawing to your classmates?

User: I could say, "This sunset shows how colors come together, and I think it represents hope for new days."

Consultant: That’s a lovely explanation! It's simple yet powerful. How do you feel about saying that in front of your class?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also proud of what I’d say.

Consultant: Those feelings are perfectly normal. It shows that you care about your work and how it's received. What can you do to ease your nerves when it's time to share?

User: I could take deep breaths and remind myself that my drawing is important.

Consultant: Great strategy! Deep breathing can help calm you down. Remember, it's about sharing your perspective, and it's okay if not everyone has the same reaction. How do you plan to celebrate this achievement after you share your drawing?

User: Maybe I’ll treat myself to ice cream if I do it!

Consultant: That sounds like a delicious way to celebrate! It's important to acknowledge your bravery. Are there any other steps we can take today to help you prepare for this art class sharing?

User: I think practicing my explanation a couple more times would help me feel ready.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s practice that together now. Remember, each time you share, you're building your confidence. How about we take turns, and you go first?

User: Okay! "This sunset shows how colors come together, and I think it represents hope for new days."

Consultant: That was wonderful, Xiao Li! You delivered it beautifully. How do you feel after practicing?

User: I feel more confident! It makes me excited to share it now.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! You're making great progress. Remember, significant changes take time and practice. What's one thing you can do this week to keep boosting your self-confidence?

User: I’ll try to raise my hand again in class and maybe share my drawing afterward.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! You've got this, Xiao Li. I believe in you! Before we wrap up today, is there anything specific you’d like to focus on next time we meet?

User: I just want to keep getting better at sharing my thoughts and maybe even my art more! 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal. We can definitely keep working on that. Today, you’ve made valuable strides towards recognizing your abilities—please carry that feeling with you. If you ever feel uncertain, remember these accomplishments. I'm looking forward to our next session, and I can’t wait to hear how it goes in art class!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xialili! I’m really glad to see you today. I’d love to hear about how you’ve been feeling since the drawing competition. It sounds like you received some praise from your teacher, which is wonderful!

User: Hi! Yes, I felt so happy when my teacher said my drawing was great. But now I’m a bit scared that I won't be good enough next time. What if I don’t get praised again?

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a little nervous after experiencing success. You’ve achieved something amazing, and it’s natural to have some worries about keeping that up. Can you tell me more about what you think might happen if you don't receive the same kind of praise next time?

User: I guess I think maybe people will see me as not talented or that I just got lucky this time. I don’t want my classmates to think I’m not good at art anymore.

Consultant: I hear you, Xialili. It sounds like you’re concerned about how others might perceive your talent based on one experience. Let’s explore that thought—you mentioned feeling lucky this time. What makes you think it was luck instead of recognizing your hard work and talent?

User: Well, sometimes I think the other kids are really good at drawing, and maybe I just had a good idea. What if next time my drawing isn’t as good?

Consultant: It’s understandable to compare yourself to others, especially when you have friends who draw well. However, let’s focus on your feelings and abilities. What if we think about the skills you used in creating the drawing that got praised? What do you think contributed to its success?

User: I was really excited about the theme, and I spent a lot of time on it. I liked choosing the colors and making it look nice. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It sounds like your excitement and effort played a huge role in creating something special. Recognizing that you put in the hard work and had fun can help boost your confidence! How does remembering those feelings change your concerns about future competitions?

User: I guess if I remember that I enjoyed drawing and tried my best, it might help me feel better. 

Consultant: Absolutely, Xialili! Focusing on your enjoyment and effort can be a great source of confidence. Let’s think about how you can showcase that during your next drawing event. What kind of artwork would you like to create next?

User: I want to try something new, maybe a landscape. I love nature.

Consultant: That sounds like a beautiful idea! A landscape involves so many colors and details you can express. What steps do you think you could take to prepare for this landscape drawing? 

User: I think I could go outside and look at the trees and flowers to get ideas. Maybe even take pictures!

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Gathering inspiration from nature will help you connect with your drawing. How do you think going outside and taking pictures will make you feel about your art?

User: I think it will be fun, and maybe I’ll feel more inspired. 

Consultant: Fun and inspiration are both great motivators! As you prepare, remember to celebrate your efforts. How about sharing your new artwork with friends, or maybe even your teacher again when it’s done?

User: That sounds nice! I’d love to share it. 

Consultant: Sharing your work with others can be a great way to build your confidence further! What do you feel when you think about showing your new landscape drawing to them?

User: I feel excited! I hope they will like it.

Consultant: That excitement is a wonderful sign! Even if they have different preferences, what matters is that you enjoyed creating it and shared your passion. How about setting a goal to show your artwork to at least one person? 

User: I can do that! Maybe I’ll show it to my mom or one of my friends.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! It can help you see how your creations are received and build your confidence. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on your feelings and any strategies you've gained. What do you think has been the most helpful today?

User: Talking about my feelings and planning my next drawing really helped. I feel much better about showing my art now.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Xialili! Recognizing your feelings and having a plan can make a big difference. Remember, your experiences and efforts matter, and I believe you can achieve great things. How do you want to carry this positive feeling into your day going forward?

User: I want to remember to enjoy drawing and not worry too much! 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach! Focusing on enjoyment can truly enhance your creativity and confidence. Remember, it’s all about your expression and having fun. I look forward to hearing about your next drawing adventure next time. Have a fantastic day, Xialili!

User: Thank you! I feel really good about this. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Li! I’m so delighted to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling really good. I joined a new interest group at school and I’m trying more new activities. It feels exciting!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made some positive changes and are feeling more confident. Can you tell me a bit more about your experience in the interest group?

User: Sure! We do a lot of fun activities together, and I’ve made some new friends. At first, I was a bit nervous, but now I feel like I can just be myself.

Consultant: It’s great that you were able to overcome your nerves and be yourself around new friends. How does that make you feel about your social skills now?

User: I feel much better about them! I used to think I wasn’t good at making friends, but now I believe I can connect with others.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift in your mindset. It’s so important to feel confident in social situations. How do you think this change is impacting your day-to-day interactions?

User: I’m more willing to talk to people and even raise my hand in class. It’s a nice feeling!

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress! It seems like your confidence has really benefited you in various areas. As we discuss your growth, what would you say has been the most valuable insight for you during our sessions?

User: I think realizing that it’s okay to be myself and that I can try new things without being perfect has been a big deal for me.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful realization, Li. Embracing your authentic self is key to building lasting confidence. Now, let’s talk about how we can maintain this positive change. Do you have any thoughts on what additional support you might need moving forward?

User: Maybe I could talk to my parents or teachers about what I've learned, so they can understand me better.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea. Communicating with your parents and teachers can provide you with more encouragement. How about we work on some strategies for those conversations?

User: Yes, that would help! I’m a little nervous about talking to them about it.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous. We can role-play the conversation, so you can feel more comfortable. What would you like to share with them first?

User: I’d like to tell them about my new friends and how joining the group has helped me.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! Sharing your excitement is a great way to help them understand your progress. You could say something like, “I’ve made new friends, and it makes me happy to join activities.” 

User: I could do that! It sounds less scary when you put it that way.

Consultant: Exactly! Often, breaking things down into smaller, manageable parts can make them less overwhelming. How do you think your parents would react to hearing about your positive experiences?

User: I think they’d be happy, but I also worry they might still think I’m not good enough.

Consultant: That’s a common worry. Remember, their perceptions might not reflect your worth or abilities. We can prepare for that by emphasizing your growth and achievements. Would you find it helpful to remind yourself of these positives before the conversation?

User: Yes, that could help! I’d like to focus on the good things.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on your successes can empower you in those discussions. How would you like to document those achievements?

User: Maybe I could write them down or make a little chart to track my progress.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Creating a visual representation of your progress can not only serve as a reminder but also help you articulate your journey better. Would you like to set a goal for this documentation?

User: Yes! I can start this weekend and maybe share it with my parents next week.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! How are you feeling about everything we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel really positive about it. I’m actually excited to talk to my parents now!

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Li! You’ve shown impressive growth, and it’s wonderful that you’re looking forward to sharing it with your family. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to discuss?

User: No, I think we’ve covered everything. Thank you for all your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure to see your progress. Just remember, you have the skills to maintain your confidence and keep shining. If you ever feel you need support again, don’t hesitate to reach out. Good luck with your conversations!

User: Thank you! I will. I’m looking forward to seeing where this goes!

Consultant: Take care, Li, and keep embracing your journey. See you next time!
