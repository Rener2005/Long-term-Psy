Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad to see you here today. I know you've been through a challenging time recently. How are you feeling now, and what’s on your mind?

User: Hi. I still feel quite anxious, especially about the military training. The incident where I lost my vision really shook me. I don't want that to happen again, but I feel so overwhelmed sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden right now. The fear of that experience repeating itself can be really debilitating. Let's take a step back and talk about what happened during that incident and how it made you feel.

User: Well, during training, everything was so intense, and I just felt this pressure to keep up with everyone. When I suddenly couldn’t see, I felt so helpless and panicked. It’s like my body reacted before my mind could.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly frightening. It's understandable that such a strong reaction would leave you feeling vulnerable. Can you share a bit about what thoughts went through your mind leading up to that moment?

User: I kept thinking that I had to prove myself, to not let my classmates down. There was this voice telling me that I was weak and that I needed to be stronger. Then suddenly, I just couldn't see anymore.

Consultant: It seems like there was a lot of pressure you were placing on yourself to perform. That internal dialogue of feeling weak likely contributed to your overwhelming feelings. Let’s talk about that—what do you think when you call yourself "weak"?

User: I guess it makes me feel ashamed, like I’m not good enough. I want to be strong and capable, especially in front of my classmates. 

Consultant: Shame can be a powerful emotion that often leads to anxiety, especially in high-pressure situations. How do you think these feelings of shame impact your emotional state when you're in training?

User: I think it makes my anxiety worse. The more I try to push through, the more anxious I get, and I worry about failing or not being able to keep up.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. The fear of failure can create a cycle of anxiety. Let’s explore this a bit further—when you feel that anxiety rising, what kind of thoughts tend to come to your mind at that moment?

User: I worry that I’ll humiliate myself or that people will think less of me. It feels like there’s no room for mistakes.

Consultant: That's a lot of pressure to carry. When considering this fear of humiliation, can you think of any times when you were able to handle a situation despite feeling anxious?

User: Yes, there were moments in class when I felt nervous but managed to participate anyway. I guess those moments weren't as bad as I imagined they would be.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you have experienced success despite your anxiety. What if we could use those instances to create a new narrative? For example, what if you reframed those situations to see them as opportunities to learn rather than potential failures?

User: That sounds helpful. I could remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that they’re part of learning. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Remembering that mistakes are a normal part of growth can help lessen the pressure you feel. Alongside this, we can develop some strategies to manage your anxiety in real-time during training. How does that sound to you?

User: I would really like that. I want to be prepared for the situations that trigger my anxiety.

Consultant: Wonderful! One technique that might help is practicing deep breathing when you begin to feel anxious. By focusing on your breath, you can ground yourself and create a sense of calm. Would you be open to trying that?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. Just some breathing exercises to help me relax sounds manageable.

Consultant: Great! We can also incorporate self-talk, like reminding yourself that you are capable and resourcing past successes when anxiety hits. How do you feel about pairing those techniques with your breathing exercises?

User: That could really help. I feel like having a little mantra might encourage me to push through the anxiety during training.

Consultant: Absolutely! Creating a positive affirmation that resonates with you can be empowering. What might that affirmation be for you?

User: Maybe something like, "I am strong, and I can handle this." 

Consultant: That's a beautiful affirmation! It reinforces your strength and capability. How do you think repeating this affirmation could affect your mindset during training?

User: I think it could really help shift my focus from the fear of failing to embracing the challenge. 

Consultant: That's a solid realization! It sounds like you're gaining a clearer understanding of how to manage these feelings. As we come to a close today, let’s summarize what we've discussed. You now have strategies such as deep breathing and affirmations to help manage your anxiety in training. How do you feel about that?

User: I feel more hopeful now. I have a plan to tackle my anxiety and I’m looking forward to trying these techniques.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Zhang! Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. If any challenges arise, we can always revisit these strategies together. You’ve made significant progress today, and I believe you can adapt to this military training environment.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support and guidance. I feel more equipped to deal with my emotions now. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m proud of the steps you've taken today. If you ever need to talk again, I’m here for you. Take care, and remember to practice your techniques! 

User: I will, thank you! I’ll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang. I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been managing, but honestly, the military training has been really tough for me. I find myself getting anxious about the pressure and worries about my eyesight coming back.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. The pressure from military training can be overwhelming, especially with your concerns about your eyesight. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel anxious during training?

User: Well, during physical activities, I can't help but think about how I felt when I lost my sight before. It just creeps in, and I get really scared that it could happen again.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially given your past experience. Let's work through those feelings together. When you have those thoughts about losing your sight again, what specific thoughts come to your mind in those moments?

User: I keep thinking that if I push myself too hard, I might collapse again, and I can't bear the thought of going through that again.

Consultant: It sounds like you're connecting the effort and intensity of training with the fear of collapsing. What evidence do you have that pushing yourself now would lead to a repeat of your previous experience?

User: Well, I guess there isn't any solid evidence. It’s just that my mind jumps to the worst-case scenario every time I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Many people experience similar thought patterns, where the mind defaults to negative scenarios. We can work on recognizing these thoughts as they come up. If a close friend were in your situation, what would you say to them about pushing through their fears?

User: I would tell them to take it step by step and not to overthink things. But when it comes to me, it's harder to follow that advice.

Consultant: That's a common experience. It’s easier to give advice than to take it ourselves. We can try to implement that idea of taking it step by step for your own situation. How about we plan some small goals for your training sessions that might feel more manageable for you?

User: That could help. I think if I focus on small achievements instead of everything at once, it would be less stressful.

Consultant: Great idea, Zhang! Breaking it down can really lessen the pressure. What’s a small goal you could set for yourself for the next training session?

User: I think I can focus on just one of the exercises and not worry about the rest. Maybe just the running portion.

Consultant: That sounds like a reasonable and achievable goal. Focusing on one thing can help ground you. How do you feel about this plan? 

User: I feel a bit relieved, actually. It feels less daunting when I think about it this way.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Along with setting those smaller goals, we can also practice some relaxation techniques. Would you be open to trying some mindfulness exercises to help you manage anxiety during training?

User: Yes, I think that would be really helpful. I need to learn how to calm my mind.

Consultant: Absolutely! Mindfulness can help you stay present and reduce anxiety about the future. Let’s explore some breathing techniques that you can use before and during your training sessions. How does that sound?

User: It sounds good. I often forget to breathe deeply when I’m anxious. 

Consultant: That’s quite common. Just taking a moment to focus on your breath can make a difference. Let’s practice it now together. Slowly inhale through your nose, hold for a moment, and then exhale through your mouth. How does this exercise feel for you?

User: It feels nice. I can feel my heart rate slowing down a bit.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! This can be a useful tool for you to incorporate into your daily routine. When you notice anxiety creeping in, you can use this breathing technique to help calm your mind.

User: I’ll definitely try to remember that. Sometimes I just feel so overwhelmed that it’s hard to think straight.

Consultant: I completely understand. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes. Recognizing those feelings is the first step. How about reflecting on your progress after each session to see how far you've come with your goals?

User: That sounds like a good plan. I think that can help me stay motivated.

Consultant: Absolutely! Celebrating small achievements can boost your confidence over time. Are there any other strategies you think would support you in managing your anxiety during this military training?

User: Maybe talking to my peers about how I feel. I feel like they might understand what I'm going through.

Consultant: Reaching out to friends for support can be incredibly beneficial. It creates a sense of community and can alleviate feelings of isolation. Have you had a chance to share your thoughts with anyone yet?

User: I haven’t yet, but I’m thinking I might talk to one of my teammates soon. 

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive step, and I'm glad to hear it. Remember, sharing your feelings can lighten the burden significantly. How are you feeling about the upcoming training now, with the strategies we've discussed?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I actually feel like I have some tools to handle the pressure better.

Consultant: I'm really pleased to hear that, Zhang. It sounds like you're on a positive path. Before we wrap up, let’s quickly summarize what you’ve learned today and how you'll apply these strategies moving forward.

User: I’ve learned to set smaller goals, practice mindfulness, use breathing techniques, and reach out to friends for support. 

Consultant: Exactly! Those strategies will be effective in managing anxiety and pressure. Remember, it's a process, and you’re making great progress. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today. I feel more equipped to face my training now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of you for taking these steps. Remember, if you ever feel overwhelmed again, you can always reach out. 

User: I will! Thank you for everything.

Consultant: Take care, Zhang, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!

Consultant: Hello, I'm glad you're here today. To start, how have you been feeling lately, especially regarding the pressures you mentioned?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite overwhelmed, especially after I withdrew from training recently. I can't shake the worry about what my classmates and instructor might think of me.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're facing a lot of pressure from both yourself and the expectations from others. Can you share more about what thoughts go through your mind when you think about their possible judgments?

User: I often think they’ll see me as weak or not committed. It makes me feel anxious and frustrated with myself for not being able to push through.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but it’s important to recognize that those thoughts might be influenced by fear rather than reality. Have you noticed how these thoughts affect your emotions or actions?

User: Yes, definitely. When I think that way, I feel really anxious, and it becomes hard to focus on anything else. I even question if I belong in this program at times.

Consultant: Feeling like you don't belong can be really tough. Let’s explore those beliefs a bit more. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're weak or that you don't belong?

User: I guess I don’t really have solid evidence. It’s just how I feel based on my recent decision to step back from training.

Consultant: It’s common to feel that way after making a choice that seems contrary to our goals. If a close friend were in your situation, how would you advise them to think about their choice?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to take a step back and that everyone has different limits and that's normal.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective! It shows that you know it’s okay to acknowledge your limits. How could you apply that same kindness and understanding to yourself?

User: I think I could try to remind myself that I’m doing my best and that I shouldn’t be so hard on myself when I need to take a break.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive shift in thinking. Let's practice this kind of self-talk more often. What are some affirmations or statements you can tell yourself to counter those negative thoughts?

User: I could say something like, "I am doing my best, and it’s okay to take breaks when I need them." 

Consultant: That’s a great affirmation! It can help you create a healthier perspective. Let’s build on that. In what situations do you find it most challenging to remember this affirmation?

User: Mostly during training or when I see my classmates pushing through. I just feel so pressured to keep up.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially in a competitive environment. Would you be open to trying some techniques, like mindfulness, to help you stay grounded in those moments?

User: Sure! I’ve heard mindfulness can help, but I’m not really sure how to start.

Consultant: Mindfulness involves being present and accepting your thoughts and feelings without judgment. We could try a simple breathing exercise together, which can help you cultivate a calm mind in stressful situations. Would you like to try that?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful!

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose… now hold it for a moment… and gently release it through your mouth. As you breathe, focus on how the air feels coming in and going out. How does that make you feel?

User: It feels calming. I can feel the tension easing up a bit.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Incorporating these simple breathing exercises can help you manage anxiety in those challenging situations. How do you feel about practicing this before your next training session?

User: I think I’d like that. It sounds like a good way to calm my nerves before I go in.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing this can help you face those situations with more confidence. Now, let’s consider how you can connect with your classmates. What steps do you think you could take to foster connections despite these feelings of isolation?

User: I could try to engage more during group activities or even just chat with them more casually, even though I feel nervous about it.

Consultant: That’s a proactive step! Start small, maybe by complimenting a classmate on their work or asking about their interests. It can help create a friendly atmosphere. How does that feel to you?

User: It sounds a little intimidating, but I think it could help me feel more involved.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. Each small step you take can strengthen your confidence. When could you start trying this approach?

User: I could try it in our next group project meeting. I think that might be a manageable setting to start.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Remember to be kind to yourself regardless of the outcome. Let’s check in about how that goes in our next session. 

User: Alright! I’ll do my best, and I hope to make some progress.

Consultant: I believe in you! It’s all about taking those steps at your own pace. Before we wrap up, is there anything else on your mind that you’d like to share or discuss today?

User: Not really. I feel like we’ve covered a lot, but I’m still feeling a bit anxious about the training.

Consultant: That’s completely valid. It's okay to feel anxious; it's part of the process. Keep practicing the self-compassion and mindfulness we discussed. Over time, you’ll notice a shift in how you respond to those feelings. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and understanding today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to be here for you. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I’m glad you’re here today. I know you've been feeling a bit anxious and isolated lately. Can you tell me more about how you’ve been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! After that argument with my classmate, I’ve been really anxious. I feel like I don’t belong with my peers, and it’s making me question if they even like me. It’s just been overwhelming.

Consultant: It sounds tough to feel that way, especially after a conflict. Feeling unaccepted can really impact your sense of belonging. Can you share a bit more about what specifically has been going through your mind when you think about that argument?

User: Well, I keep replaying our argument in my head. I think maybe I shouldn't have said what I did, and now I'm worried that everyone sees me as someone difficult. It feels like they are all judging me.

Consultant: I understand why those thoughts would make you anxious and unstable emotionally. It seems like you’re really critical of yourself after the argument. What emotions come up for you when you think about those judgments?

User: I feel sad and alone. It’s like there’s this weight on my chest. I really want to be liked but I feel like I messed it up.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel sad and heavy under such circumstances. Let’s try to explore those thoughts. Can you identify any specific negative beliefs you have about yourself in relation to what happened with your classmate?

User: I guess I think that I’m not as good as everyone else in the group. Maybe they all think I’m annoying or don't want to be associated with me.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very challenging to cope with. Let's try to examine them together. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that your classmates think you’re annoying or don’t want to be around you?

User: I don’t have concrete evidence, but it just feels that way. I notice they don’t interact with me as much anymore.

Consultant: It’s understandable to interpret their behavior as rejection, especially when you’re feeling vulnerable. Sometimes, our minds can fill in the blanks with negative interpretations. Would you be willing to think of alternative explanations for their behavior?

User: Maybe they’re just busy or dealing with their own issues? I suppose it’s possible that I’m overthinking it all.

Consultant: Absolutely, that’s a great insight! It’s common to assume people are reacting negatively towards us when, in reality, they might be preoccupied with their own lives. How might this shift in perspective feel for you?

User: Thinking about it that way does lighten the burden a bit. It makes me feel like I have some control over how I perceive their actions.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! Gaining control over your perceptions can greatly ease your anxiety. What steps do you think you could take to engage more with your classmates again?

User: I guess I could try initiating conversations or joining group activities. That might help me feel more included.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Taking small steps to engage can be very beneficial. How about we explore some strategies you could use to start those conversations?

User: Sure. I often feel nervous when approaching others. Maybe having some topics in mind could help?

Consultant: That's a smart approach! Having specific topics or questions prepared can ease anxiety. What are some interests or topics you think others in your class might enjoy discussing?

User: We all seem to love art. Maybe I could start by asking about their favorite artists or current projects they’re working on.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Starting with shared interests can help spark engaging conversations. How would you feel about trying this out in a safe social setting, like a class group project or an informal gathering?

User: I feel excited and a bit scared, but I think it’s worth a try. I really want to make connections.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful attitude to have, and it's completely normal to feel some fear. Remember that every small step counts. Let’s also talk about how you can handle any awkwardness that might come up during those interactions.

User: I guess I could remind myself that everyone feels awkward at times. It doesn’t have to be perfect!

Consultant: Absolutely! Acknowledging that everyone has their moments of awkwardness is key. It builds empathy and can help you feel more relaxed. What might you say to yourself to encourage yourself when those nerves kick in?

User: Maybe something like, “Everyone is just trying to connect, and it’s okay to be a little awkward!”

Consultant: That’s a fantastic affirmation! Reminding yourself that connection is a shared human experience can help reduce anxiety. Let's create a plan. How many times do you think you could try reaching out to classmates this week?

User: I think I could aim for at least two times. I’ll start small.

Consultant: That sounds like a very achievable goal! Remember to celebrate those small successes, no matter the outcome. How are you feeling about our session today?

User: I feel more hopeful. I’m realizing that I can take steps to change how I feel about myself and my relationships.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’ve made incredible progress. Let’s recap the positive strategies you’ve identified today. What will you take away from this session for your next steps?

User: I will try to challenge my negative thoughts, reach out to classmates using shared interests, and remind myself that it's okay to be awkward.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! I believe you have the skills to implement these changes. Just remember, it’s a journey, and every step counts. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Keep up the great work!

User: Thank you! I'm feeling more prepared, and I appreciate your help. I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad to see you again today. How are you feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I'm feeling a bit better actually. Being acknowledged for my contribution during the campus activity helped boost my self-esteem.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like that recognition had a significant impact on your self-worth. Can you tell me more about how you felt during and after that event?

User: During the event, I was really excited and a bit nervous, but when I received the acknowledgment, it felt great! I realized that I am capable and that people see my efforts.

Consultant: It's lovely that you gained that insight about yourself. It seems like your feelings of capability have strengthened. How do you think you can carry this positive feeling into your daily life and activities?

User: I think I can start by being more confident in my abilities and maybe even try to take on more responsibilities in different activities.

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive approach! Let's build on that confidence. What specific small goals do you think you could set for yourself to gradually challenge yourself?

User: Perhaps I could join a club or volunteer for a role in a future event? It might be a good way to push my boundaries a bit.

Consultant: Joining a club and taking on roles in events are excellent goals! They can provide you with experiences to further boost your confidence. How do you feel about starting with a club?

User: I feel excited but a little anxious as well. What if I don't do well or let others down?

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel a bit anxious when trying something new. Let’s explore those thoughts together. What evidence do you have that suggests you might not do well?

User: I guess I just worry about not being as good as others or being judged.

Consultant: That’s a common concern, but have you considered that everyone starts somewhere? What would you say to a friend who felt the same way about joining a club?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s about trying and learning, not just being perfect.

Consultant: Exactly! It's about growth and experience. Let's reframe your thought: instead of focusing on possible judgment, what if you viewed this as an opportunity to learn and connect with others? How does that feel?

User: That sounds better. I like the idea of learning rather than just performing perfectly.

Consultant: Great! What steps can you take to remind yourself of this mindset when you're feeling anxious about taking on new challenges?

User: I could write down these new thoughts, maybe create a little reminder for myself to read before the event.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Writing it down can reinforce that positive mindset. Do you have a plan for when you’d like to start looking for a club?

User: Maybe by the end of this week? I can do some research on the options available.

Consultant: That sounds like an achievable timeline! It's positive to see you taking action. How will you celebrate this small step once you’ve made progress?

User: I could treat myself by getting a nice coffee or hanging out with friends to share the news!

Consultant: Celebrating those steps is so important! It will help solidify the connection between your efforts and your achievements. Reflecting on these successes can further build your self-esteem. 

User: Yes, I can see how that could help boost my confidence.

Consultant: Absolutely! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed. You’re going to look for a club by the end of the week, remind yourself of the learning aspect, and take time to celebrate your progress. Does that sound good?

User: Yes, it does! I feel more motivated now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. I believe in your ability to take these steps. You’ve been doing great work. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm here for you. As you continue on this path, know that you can reach out whenever you need help or encouragement. 

User: I will. Thank you for the reminder!

Consultant: It's my pleasure, Zhang. I'm looking forward to hearing about your club exploration in our next session. Take care and stay positive! 

User: Thank you! I will! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang. I'm glad to see you today! How have you been feeling after our last session? 

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling really supported lately. I had a video call with my parents, and they were really proud of my achievements at school. It felt great to hear that from them.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like that recognition from your parents really made a positive impact on your mood. How did it feel to share your accomplishments with them?

User: It felt amazing! I was a bit nervous at first, but seeing their smiles made me feel confident. Their support means so much to me.

Consultant: It’s great that you could experience that joy and confidence. How do you think that support from your family affects your daily life and studies?

User: I think it really motivates me. When I feel their support, I find it easier to focus on my studies and handle challenges. It’s like I feel less alone.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight. It sounds like the connection with your parents helps you face difficulties more readily. Are there specific moments that stand out where you felt this support helped you, particularly with your studies?

User: Yes, there was a time when I struggled with a project. I was about to give up, but I shared my frustrations with them during our call. They listened and encouraged me to keep going. That pushed me to finish it on time.

Consultant: That’s a powerful example of the impact of support. It seems like your parents’ encouragement is a source of strength for you. How do you think you can maintain this level of connection and support from them moving forward?

User: I guess I can keep communicating more often. Sharing not just my accomplishments but also my struggles could help us stay close and maintain that support.

Consultant: Absolutely! Open communication is key. Do you have any plans to share your current experiences with them soon, or are there ways you feel you can enhance that communication?

User: I want to have regular calls, maybe once a week. I also want to ask them about their days and really be engaged in our conversations.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! By being engaged and showing interest in their lives, you strengthen your bond. How do you feel about reaching out to them this way?

User: I feel excited about it! It makes me think that our conversations will be deeper and more meaningful. 

Consultant: That’s a positive outlook. Remember that these conversations can also be a platform for you to express any challenges you face. Has there been anything recently that you felt could use your parents' support, aside from your studies?

User: I sometimes feel overwhelmed with my emotions, especially when I’m stressed about school. I think talking to them about that could help, too.

Consultant: It’s important to share those feelings as well. You might find relief in expressing them. If you feel comfortable, perhaps you can tell them when you’re feeling anxious or overwhelmed. How does that idea resonate with you?

User: That sounds good! I think sharing that will help them understand what I’m going through. They can support me better that way.

Consultant: Exactly! Opening up about your emotions can create even stronger ties. It might also reduce the burden you feel. What are some ways you could practice managing those overwhelming emotions while continuing to communicate with them?

User: Maybe I can try writing down my feelings before the calls, so I know what to share. And I could practice some breathing exercises when I start feeling anxious.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Writing can help clarify your thoughts, and breathing exercises are an excellent way to manage anxiety. How do you feel about implementing these strategies in your routine?

User: I feel hopeful! I believe that this way, I can express myself better and maybe even get used to dealing with my emotions more positively.

Consultant: That’s a healthy approach! It seems like you’re becoming more aware of your feelings and how your family can support you. Let’s talk about how you can maintain this emotional awareness going forward.

User: I could keep a journal to track my emotions and thoughts regularly. That way, I can reflect on my progress and see how I feel over time.

Consultant: A journal is a fantastic tool! It can help you gain insights into your emotional patterns and give you something to refer to when you talk with your parents. How do you feel about starting this journaling practice?

User: I think I’ll start it this week! It feels like it will really help me sort through my feelings. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful commitment! I’m proud of you for taking steps toward better emotional management. Do you have any concerns about starting this new practice or your communication with your parents?

User: Not really. I think I’m ready to give it a try and see how it goes!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Embracing this change will lead to more growth. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize the key takeaways from our conversation. 

User: Sure! I’ll stay connected with my parents, communicate openly about my feelings, keep a journal, and practice managing my anxiety.

Consultant: Perfect! Those are actionable steps toward maintaining a healthy emotional state and keeping that family connection strong. It’s been a pleasure talking with you today, Zhang. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance and support.

Consultant: You’re welcome! Remember, I’m here if you need to talk again. Keep making progress and stay connected with your emotions. Take care!

User: I will! See you next time!
