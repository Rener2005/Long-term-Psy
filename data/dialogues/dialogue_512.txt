Consultant: Hello, Xiaokun! I'm glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi, I've been feeling a bit down. I still can't shake off the feeling of disappointment from not being selected as one of the outstanding students last year. It really makes me doubt myself.

Consultant: I understand, it's very tough to deal with disappointment, especially when you've put in a lot of effort. Can you share more about how this situation has been affecting your thoughts and feelings?

User: Well, I think I just keep telling myself that I'm not good enough. My mom always pushes me hard to do well, and when I mess up, I feel like I disappoint her too.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a lot of pressure on yourself, both from your own expectations and from your mom’s. What kind of thoughts go through your mind when you think about this disappointment?

User: I often think that no matter how hard I try, I’ll always fail. Sometimes I just want to give up because it feels like there's no point.

Consultant: That sounds quite overwhelming. Let's take a moment to explore those thoughts. You mentioned feeling like you'll always fail. Can we look for evidence of times when you succeeded or did well? 

User: Hmm, I guess there were times when I did well, like my math exam last year, but they feel so far away now. 

Consultant: That's a good start! Recognizing past successes can be really helpful. That math exam shows that you are capable. What do you think contributed to your success then?

User: I studied hard for it and felt confident during the test. 

Consultant: Exactly! You prepared and faced the challenge. What if we take that confidence and apply it to other situations, like participating more in class?

User: I wish I could feel that way. But when I think about speaking in class, I panic.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel anxious about it. What happens in your mind when you think about speaking in class?

User: I just worry that I'll say something wrong or that everyone will laugh at me.

Consultant: It seems like you're anticipating negative outcomes. Let's identify those fears together. Is it true that everyone in class is likely to laugh at mistakes? 

User: Not really. I see my friends make mistakes, and they just laugh it off.

Consultant: That's a great observation! It’s often easier to show compassion to others than to ourselves. Would it help to remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes and that learning is part of the process?

User: I guess I could try to think that way.

Consultant: Absolutely! And we can create a plan for you. How about setting small goals for speaking up in class, like answering one question per session?

User: That sounds doable. 

Consultant: Perfect! Taking small steps can build your confidence over time. Let's also think of one positive thing about yourself to focus on before our next session. What do you think that might be?

User: Maybe that I’m good at drawing. 

Consultant: That's wonderful! Your drawing skills are a great strength. Focusing on your talents can help improve your self-image. How do you feel about setting a goal around your drawing as well? 

User: I can try to draw more often and even show my friends!

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Sharing your drawing with others could boost your confidence even more. How about we check in on how that goes next session?

User: Yeah, I like that plan.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! You’re making real progress in recognizing your strengths and tackling those negative thoughts. Is there anything else on your mind today?

User: No, I think I just need to focus on what we talked about. 

Consultant: That sounds great, Xiaokun. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. I'm here to support you through this journey. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next time!

User: Thank you! I feel a bit better now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad to hear you're feeling a bit better. Take care, and I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaokun! I'm really glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling about school and your studies lately?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling quite anxious. I really want to participate more in class discussions, but I feel so scared that I’ll mess up, especially in Chinese class. Sometimes I just want to hide when the teacher asks me something.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of fear and uncertainty when it comes to participating in class. It's completely understandable to feel that way. Can you tell me more about what happens when you feel anxious in those moments?

User: Whenever the teacher calls on me, I just freeze up. I get this overwhelming feeling and my mind goes blank. I feel like everyone is watching me, and I can't do it. I really want to speak up, but I just can’t.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiaokun. It's as if you’re caught in a cycle of anxiety when you're expected to speak. Let's think about your thoughts in those moments. What do you usually tell yourself that makes you feel so anxious?

User: I keep thinking that if I answer wrong, everyone will laugh at me or think I'm stupid. It makes me not want to try at all.

Consultant: I see. It seems like those thoughts are creating a lot of pressure for you. Let's take a closer look at that thought—how true do you think it is that everyone would laugh or judge you if you made a mistake?

User: I guess it's not really true, but when I'm up there, it feels so real. I just become so afraid of failing.

Consultant: That’s a common feeling, Xiaokun. Many people worry about being judged, especially when they’re facing challenges. If a friend were in your position, how would you support them or what would you say to reassure them?

User: I would tell them that everyone makes mistakes and it’s okay to try. I’d encourage them to just go for it.

Consultant: Exactly! You already know how to be supportive to others, and you can use that same kindness towards yourself. Let's set a small goal for your next class. How about aiming to participate at least once in a way that feels comfortable for you?

User: Maybe I could try answering one simple question? Just to get started?

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Practicing this small step can make a big difference in building your confidence. After you do it, we’ll talk about how it felt for you. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I really want to try and see if it’s not as scary as I think.

Consultant: Great! Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. After you participate, we'll reflect on it together and celebrate your effort. So, what’s something you can focus on to help yourself stay calm before you answer?

User: Maybe I could take a deep breath first? That might help me feel a bit more relaxed.

Consultant: Absolutely, deep breathing can be really effective in calming those nerves. I'm glad you’re willing to try these strategies. How do you feel about your goal now as we’ve discussed it?

User: I feel a little less anxious thinking about it now! I actually think I can do it.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiaokun! Feeling less anxious is an improvement in itself. Let’s make it a point to talk about your experience next time. Each time you try, you’re building your confidence. 

User: Yes, I see that! I want to keep working on this.

Consultant: Just remember, it's perfectly okay to make mistakes. Those can be our learning experiences. Focus on the effort, and the outcome will follow. I’m really proud of your willingness to tackle this.

User: Thank you! It feels good to know you believe in me.

Consultant: Of course, Xiaokun! I genuinely believe you have the ability to shine. As we wrap up today, think about what you’ve learned about yourself through this process. What do you think you’ll take away from our session today?

User: I think I’ve learned that it’s okay to be scared and that I should try even if I’m nervous. I feel like I have a plan for class now.

Consultant: That's a significant insight! You’re beginning to recognize your potential. Remember, the more you practice, the more confident you will feel. 

User: I will keep that in mind! I'm excited to try in class.

Consultant: I can’t wait to hear how it goes for you. Just to overview quickly, we talked about recognizing your fears, setting a small goal, and the importance of self-kindness. You’re making such progress, Xiaokun!

User: Yes, I feel like I'm on the right track now.

Consultant: You absolutely are! I am here for you anytime you need support. Let’s meet again to talk about your progress. You’ve got this!

User: Thank you so much! I can’t wait to share how it goes.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xiaokun! I believe in you, and I’m looking forward to our next session. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Kun! I'm really glad you are here today. Last time, we talked about your recent experience with the speech competition. How are you feeling about it now?

User: Hi! I feel proud that I completed the speech. It was really nerve-racking, but I did it! I realized I can do more than I thought.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You should definitely be proud of yourself. What specific feelings do you remember from the moment you finished your speech?

User: I felt a huge sense of relief and happiness. I was scared, but after I finished, it felt great to see my classmates applauding.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly rewarding! Applause from your classmates must have felt very validating. How do you think this experience has changed the way you see yourself?

User: I think I'm starting to believe that I can actually speak in front of people and that maybe I’m not as bad at it as I thought.

Consultant: That's a fantastic realization! Building confidence through such experiences is really important. Can you recall any positive thoughts you had during or after your speech that stood out to you?

User: I remember thinking that I really wanted to do well and that it was okay to be nervous. I tried to focus on sharing what I had prepared.

Consultant: That's a great mindset! Accepting your nerves and focusing on your message can really help. How can you remind yourself of this positive experience when facing new challenges in the future?

User: Maybe I could think about how good I felt after the speech whenever I feel nervous again. I could also write it down or talk about it with my mom.

Consultant: Writing it down or sharing it with your mom sounds like a solid plan. It can help reinforce those positive feelings. What do you think are some other situations where you might apply this new confidence?

User: I guess in class discussions or even small group projects at school. I usually hold back because I’m worried about saying the wrong thing.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. But remember this moment! Using this positive experience can help you engage more fully. What would it take for you to feel comfortable speaking up in those situations?

User: I think if I remind myself of my speech and that it’s okay to make mistakes, I’d feel less scared. Maybe if I practiced beforehand too.

Consultant: Practicing beforehand is an excellent strategy! How about setting small goals for yourself, like contributing one idea in your next class or group project?

User: That sounds doable! I could aim to share at least one thought and see how it goes.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking small steps can lead to big changes over time. Plus, each time you share, you’re building more confidence. How do you think you’ll feel after you take that first step?

User: I think I would feel proud again and a bit more comfortable. It might be easier the next time too.

Consultant: Exactly! That sense of accomplishment can create a positive cycle. Let’s reflect on what you’ve learned today. What’s one key takeaway you’d like to remember from our conversation?

User: I want to remember that it’s okay to feel nervous, and that I can still do well. I can use my speech experience to help me next time.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic takeaway, Xiao Kun! You’ve made great progress today. As we wrap up, how do you feel about your ability to engage in social activities moving forward?

User: I feel a lot more curious now. I actually look forward to talking more in class and maybe even joining more activities.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Curiosity is a great feeling to have, especially when it comes to making new connections. Trust in your abilities, and remember, you have experiences like your speech to lean on. If you’d like to continue this journey, I’ll be here for support.

User: Thank you! I appreciate the guidance. I definitely want to keep working on this.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiao Kun! Remember, it’s all about progress, and you’re doing amazing. I look forward to our next session. Have a great day!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Kun! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling about joining the reading club that your mom suggested?

User: Hi! I’m actually kind of excited about it. I’ve never been in a club before, and I hope to make some new friends.

Consultant: That sounds like a great opportunity to connect with others! What specifically makes you feel excited about making new friends?

User: I think it’s because I’ve always wanted to meet people who like the same things I do, especially reading. But at the same time, I feel a little nervous about how to start conversations.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel a bit nervous before starting something new. Starting conversations can be challenging. What kind of thoughts come up when you think about talking to new people?

User: I often worry they might not want to talk to me, or that I’ll say something silly.

Consultant: I hear you. It seems like you're concerned about how others may perceive you. Can you think of times when you felt confident talking to someone? What did that look like?

User: Well, I remember when I talked to my classmates about a book we all read, I felt comfortable because we shared the same interest.

Consultant: That’s a great example! Sharing a common interest can really help. Thinking about the reading club, what do you think would help you feel more confident in starting conversations there?

User: Maybe if I prepare a few questions about the books we’re reading, it might help me start discussions.

Consultant: Preparing questions is a fantastic idea! It gives you a starting point. How would you feel about setting a small goal for your first session at the club?

User: I think I could aim to ask at least two questions during the meeting.

Consultant: That sounds like a reasonable goal. How do you feel about that? 

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also a little more confident knowing I have something to say.

Consultant: It’s great to recognize those feelings. Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous; it shows that you care about connecting with others. When you think about your goal, how might you celebrate achieving it afterward?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to some ice cream if I manage to ask my questions!

Consultant: That sounds like a delicious reward! It’s important to recognize your achievements. As you prepare for the club, what thoughts can you remind yourself of to help ease your nerves?

User: I could tell myself that everyone is there to enjoy the same thing and that it’s okay to be a little shy.

Consultant: Absolutely, focusing on shared interests can help you relax. As the club meets, remember that everyone is there to have fun and enjoy reading. How do you think it would feel to go into the meeting with that mindset?

User: It would make me feel much less pressured. I think I could enjoy my time more.

Consultant: That's a wonderful insight! Shifting your perspective can truly change your experience. During our next session, we can discuss how your first meeting went and any feelings that came up.

User: I’m looking forward to it. I think it will be good to share my experience.

Consultant: I’m here to support you through this process, Xiao Kun! It sounds like you’re making great strides. For this week, try to remind yourself of the excitement of making new friends and the things you enjoy about reading.

User: I will! Thanks for your help. It feels good to talk through this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Remember, it's all about small steps. Did you have any other thoughts or questions today before we wrap up?

User: No, I think that covers it for now. I feel more ready to give it a try!

Consultant: That's fantastic! I’m proud of you for being proactive about this. Just remember, it’s a learning experience, and I’m excited to hear all about your adventures in the reading club next time!

User: Thank you! I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Looking forward to it, Xiao Kun! Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaokun! I'm glad to see you today. It sounds like you’ve made some great progress lately. Can you tell me how you’ve been feeling about your social interactions?

User: Hi! I feel more confident now, especially after speaking up in the book club discussion. My classmates seemed to appreciate my input, which felt really nice.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you enjoyed that experience and received positive feedback from your peers. How do you think this has affected your confidence in social situations?

User: I think it's made me want to participate more. Before, I was nervous about speaking up, but now I feel like I can share my thoughts without worrying too much.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re feeling more comfortable expressing yourself. Participating more can really help solidify that confidence. Are there any specific situations where you still feel a bit anxious?

User: Sometimes when I’m around new people, I still feel a bit shy. I worry about what to say or if they will like me.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable! Meeting new people can be intimidating. Let’s try to explore this feeling. What thoughts come to mind when you find yourself in those situations?

User: I often think that I’ll say something silly or that they won’t be interested in what I have to say. 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite challenging. It sounds like they might be making you feel anxious. What if we looked at those thoughts together—do you think there are other ways to think about those social interactions?

User: I guess I could try to focus on the fun parts of talking to new people, like learning something new or making a friend.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! Focusing on the positive aspects can really help. Let’s try a little exercise: when you feel anxious about meeting someone new, can you remind yourself of that fun aspect you just mentioned?

User: Yes, I want to remind myself of the enjoyment rather than the pressure. 

Consultant: Perfect! It can also help to prepare a few open-ended questions or conversation starters. This way, you’ll feel more equipped in the moment. How do you feel about trying that before meeting new people?

User: I think that could work. Having something to say would help my mind not go blank.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s all about feeling prepared and reducing pressure. Do you have any upcoming social events where you can practice this?

User: Yes! There’s a school project group coming up, and I’ll get to work with some classmates I haven’t talked to much yet.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic opportunity! How would you like to apply what we’ve discussed in that setting?

User: I’ll try to remember to focus on having fun and maybe bring a few questions to start conversations. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Xiaokun! Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous, but you’re also building connections and sharing experiences. How do you feel about your preparation?

User: I feel more excited about it than before. I want to see how it goes now.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Embracing the experience can be so rewarding. After the group project, we can discuss how it went, and reflect on what you learned about your experience. 

User: Yes, I’d like that! I want to see what works for me.

Consultant: Wonderful! It’s essential to reflect on these experiences. As we approach the end of our session today, let’s summarize what you want to focus on moving forward.

User: I want to work on remembering to enjoy socializing, ask questions, and be more confident when meeting new people.

Consultant: That’s a great take-home message, Xiaokun. You’ve made significant progress, and I believe you’ll continue to grow in these areas. What do you think will be your biggest challenge in applying these strategies?

User: It might be just remembering everything when I get nervous, but I’ll try my best!

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Maybe creating a small note with reminders can help you when you feel anxious. How does that sound?

User: Yes, I can do that! A little note would help me keep focused.

Consultant: Fantastic! You’ve done an excellent job today. Before we end our session, do you have any final thoughts or questions?

User: No, I think I’m good! Thanks for the help today!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaokun! You should be proud of the progress you’re making. Remember to keep practicing your new strategies, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaokun! It's great to see you today. I hope you're feeling well after your recent success at the arts festival. How have you been since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I felt really good after receiving praise for my painting. It made me feel more confident about my abilities. But sometimes, I still worry that I'm not good enough, especially when thinking about schoolwork.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that the praise helped boost your confidence! It's natural to have worries about your performance in school too. Can you share more about what specifically causes those feelings of not being good enough?

User: Well, sometimes when my mom points out mistakes in my homework, I feel like I've disappointed her. Even though she wants the best for me, it can be really stressful.

Consultant: It sounds like you care a lot about your mom's opinion, and it’s understandable to feel that pressure. Let's explore this a bit. When those thoughts come up, what kind of feelings do they create in you?

User: I guess I feel anxious and a bit sad. I try hard, but it feels like no matter how much I do, there’s always something more to improve.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiaokun. It's important to recognize that you are putting in a lot of effort. Can we look at what happens when you receive feedback? How do you usually react to it?

User: I sometimes get defensive and just want to avoid talking about it. I want to show her that I can do it, but it’s overwhelming.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel overwhelmed. Facing feedback can be hard, especially when it feels critical. What do you think would happen if you viewed feedback as a way to learn rather than a judgment on your worth?

User: That would probably help me not take it so personally. I could see it as a way to get better instead of feeling sad about my mistakes.

Consultant: Exactly! Shifting your perspective can make a big difference. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about handling feedback positively?

User: I would tell them to keep trying and not to give up, and that everyone makes mistakes. It’s part of learning.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective, Xiaokun! It sounds like you really understand the learning process. How might you apply that same advice to yourself when you receive feedback in the future?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that making mistakes is okay and focus on how I can improve instead of just feeling bad.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! By reframing those moments, you can lessen your anxiety. Have you had any recent experiences where you successfully used this mindset?

User: When I presented my painting to the class, I was really nervous. But I reminded myself that I was there to share what I love, and it felt good to express myself! 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It seems like you’re already applying positive strategies. How did it feel to share your painting, knowing it was a reflection of your creativity?

User: It felt amazing! I got a lot of positive feedback and it made me smile. I felt proud of what I created.

Consultant: Pride in your achievements is such an important feeling to nurture. How can you keep building on that success moving forward, especially in school?

User: I guess by setting smaller goals for my assignments and celebrating little victories, like finishing them on time or trying something new.

Consultant: Absolutely! Setting small, achievable goals can lead to consistent progress. What might be one small goal you’d like to set for this week?

User: I’ll try to finish my math homework a day early. That way, I won't feel rushed or stressed.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic goal, Xiaokun! How would that early completion make you feel?

User: I think I’d feel relieved and more prepared for class. Plus, it would give me some free time to do things I enjoy.

Consultant: It’s essential to carve out time for activities you love. Let’s keep focusing on these strengths and strategies. Is there any area where you feel you'd still need support?

User: Sometimes, I worry about balancing everything—like schoolwork, my hobbies, and spending time with friends.

Consultant: Balancing all those aspects can indeed be challenging. Perhaps we can develop a plan to prioritize your spending time with friends and hobbies while managing your schoolwork effectively. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I think having a plan would help me avoid getting overwhelmed.

Consultant: Great! We can work on a simple schedule together. We'll incorporate study time, hobbies, and social activities. How does that sound for our next meeting?

User: That would be really helpful! I’m excited to have a plan.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It shows you're taking proactive steps. Lastly, as we wrap up, what would you say has been your biggest takeaway from today's session?

User: I feel like I have tools to handle feedback better and that it's okay to make mistakes. I want to keep being proud of my achievements.

Consultant: That's a wonderful realization, Xiaokun! Remember, it's all about progress rather than perfection. I believe in your ability to stay confident. If you ever feel uncertain, you can always return to these strategies we've discussed today.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. I’ll keep working on my goals.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!
