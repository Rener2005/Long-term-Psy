Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for today's consultation. How are you feeling about discussing your experiences with public speaking?

User: Hi. I'm really nervous about talking in front of others. Even though I've had some improvement, I still feel an overwhelming anxiety. I want to overcome this fear when I have to speak in class.

Consultant: I understand. It's great that you've noticed some improvement, but it's also normal to feel anxious. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts go through your mind when you're about to speak in front of others?

User: Well, I often think that I might embarrass myself or that others are judging me. Sometimes, I just freeze up and forget what to say.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite distressing. It sounds like you’re worried about judgment and fear of embarrassment. How do those thoughts make you feel physically and emotionally in those moments?

User: I start to feel really shaky, and my heart races. It's like a rush of panic, and I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: It sounds like those feelings are quite intense. Can you recall a specific instance where these thoughts and feelings came up, perhaps during a recent class?

User: Yes, during my elective last semester, the teacher called on me to summarize. I felt so nervous before it. I managed to get through it, but it was really hard.

Consultant: It's impressive that you were able to push through that experience despite your nerves. What do you think helped you get through that moment, even when your anxiety was high?

User: I think I just told myself to breathe and that it was okay to feel nervous. But I still felt like I could have done better.

Consultant: Recognizing that you can manage some of your anxiety is a positive step. Let’s explore those feelings of inadequacy further. What specific thoughts did you have about your performance afterward?

User: I kept thinking that I didn’t speak clearly and that others might have thought I was unprepared.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but let’s challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that others thought you were unprepared? Could there be other explanations for how they perceived your performance?

User: I suppose I don't really have concrete evidence. But I just assumed that since I was nervous, others must have noticed it too.

Consultant: It’s common to think that way when we're anxious. However, it’s possible others might not have focused on your anxiety as much as you did. If a friend was in your position, what would you tell them about their performance?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s normal to be nervous and that they did well just by trying.

Consultant: Exactly! That's a kind and supportive perspective. Let’s consider how you can apply that same compassion to yourself. What if you were to view your performance through that lens? 

User: That makes sense. I guess I should be a bit gentler with myself. 

Consultant: Absolutely. By practicing self-compassion, you're also helping to create a more supportive mindset. Moving forward, how about we work on small steps to gradually expose yourself to speaking in front of others? 

User: That sounds good. I think starting small might help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: Let’s think of a low-pressure setting where you could practice speaking. Perhaps participating in group discussions with classmates? How does that sound to you?

User: That actually sounds manageable. I could try sharing my thoughts in smaller groups first.

Consultant: That would be a great start! Setting small, achievable goals can boost your confidence over time. How about we also outline some comforting strategies you can use when you start to feel anxious during these discussions?

User: Yes, I would definitely like that. I want to have something to rely on when the nerves kick in.

Consultant: One helpful technique is to focus on your breathing. Taking slow, deep breaths can help calm your nervous system. Another might be to visualize a positive outcome before speaking. How do those ideas resonate with you?

User: I think they could help. I often forget to breathe when I'm nervous.

Consultant: That's very common. Practicing those techniques can be beneficial. By incorporating these strategies, you'll be giving yourself tools to manage your anxiety more effectively. 

User: I really appreciate those suggestions. It makes me feel a bit more prepared.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, every little step counts. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think I’ve learned to recognize my negative thoughts and how they affect my feelings. Also, I need to be kinder to myself.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization, and it could significantly impact how you approach public speaking. It seems like you’re making progress toward feeling more confident. 

User: I hope so. It feels good to recognize that I'm improving, even if it’s just a little.

Consultant: Absolutely! Acknowledging even the small wins can lead to bigger changes over time. Remember, you’re taking active steps toward your goals. 

User: Thank you for today. I’m looking forward to trying these techniques.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm here to support you as you implement these strategies. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need more guidance. 

User: I will. I'm hoping to report some good progress next time!

Consultant: I believe you can do it! Let's keep working together to build your confidence. Until next time, take care!

Consultant: Hello! I'm really pleased to see you here today. I understand you've been making some efforts to express yourself more in group discussions. How are you feeling about that?

User: Hi! I'm feeling a bit nervous, but also a little proud of myself for trying to speak up in class discussions. It's still challenging for me, but I think I’m making progress.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of emotions—both anxiety and accomplishment. Can you share a specific moment or experience when you spoke up in a group recently?

User: Sure! During our last group discussion, I tried to share my opinion about the topic we were discussing. I felt my heart racing, but I managed to get my thoughts out there. It was tough, but I felt good afterward.

Consultant: That’s a great example! You were able to push through the anxiety, and it led to a positive feeling afterward. What thoughts were running through your mind before you spoke up?

User: I was worried that my ideas wouldn’t be good enough or that my classmates would judge me. I kept thinking about those negative outcomes rather than focusing on what I wanted to contribute.

Consultant: It's completely natural to have those worries. Those thoughts can be quite convincing. Can we explore how those thoughts made you feel during the discussion? What emotions did they evoke in you?

User: I felt anxious and hesitant. There was a part of me that wanted to speak, but the fear of judgment was really strong.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially in a group setting. Let's examine those negative thoughts a bit closer. What evidence do you have that supports those thoughts about judgment from your classmates?

User: I don’t have any solid evidence. I guess it’s just how I assume others might react based on my past experiences.

Consultant: That’s insightful! It appears that these thoughts might not be based on current reality but rather on assumptions. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their thoughts?

User: I’d probably tell them not to worry too much about what others think and to focus on their own ideas. Everyone has a right to share their thoughts.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! It’s clear that you understand the importance of self-acceptance. Let’s try to reframe your thought. How could you express your feelings about speaking up in a more positive way?

User: Maybe I can tell myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that sharing my thoughts is valuable, regardless of others’ opinions.

Consultant: Absolutely! That shift in mindset can significantly reduce anxiety. What would it feel like to remind yourself of that during your next group discussion?

User: It would definitely help me feel less pressure. I think I would be more relaxed and open to sharing.

Consultant: That's a fantastic realization! Now, let’s think about tangible steps you can take next time you’re in a group. How about practicing your thoughts before the discussion? Would that be something you find helpful?

User: Yes, absolutely! I think if I practiced what I wanted to say beforehand, I would feel a lot more confident about sharing.

Consultant: Excellent! Preparing in advance can certainly build your confidence. Let's also talk about possible successes. Can you recall any situation where you felt you communicated well?

User: Yes! In our last presentation, I spoke clearly and I could see my teammates were engaged. That gave me a boost of confidence.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant achievement! Recognizing your successes is essential. How about keeping a record of such experiences to motivate you during challenging moments?

User: That’s a good idea! I could write them down to remind myself how well I’ve done before.

Consultant: Perfect! Keeping track of your successes will reinforce your ability to communicate effectively. Before we end today’s session, let’s think about what you want to focus on progressing further in your ability to speak in groups.

User: I want to continue challenging myself. I aim to feel more confident and comfortable actively participating, even in larger groups.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Your recognition of your progress shows how far you’ve come. As you move forward, remember that it’s a gradual process, and you’re not alone in this journey. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I feel like I have some effective strategies to build my confidence now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’ve made significant strides today. Remember to celebrate your small victories, as they will lead to greater confidence in the long run. If challenges arise, just remind yourself of how far you’ve come. 

User: I will! Thank you for everything. It feels good to share and reflect on all this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It was a pleasure working with you today. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need to discuss your progress or any new challenges. 

User: I will definitely keep that in mind. 

Consultant: Great! Take care, and I look forward to our next session. 

User: Thanks! See you next time!

Consultant: Hello! I’m glad you’re here today. How have you been feeling lately regarding your recent achievements?

User: Hello! I’m a bit surprised by my progress in class. Although I feel more confident, I’m also anxious about joining the campus association. I worry that I won’t meet expectations.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a mix of excitement and anxiety, especially when facing new opportunities. Can you describe what specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about joining this association?

User: I keep thinking that I might not be good enough or that I’ll let others down. It’s like I have this voice in my head questioning my abilities.

Consultant: That inner voice can be quite challenging. What feelings do those thoughts provoke in you? 

User: I feel nervous and sometimes even a bit inadequate. It’s hard to shake off that feeling, especially when I try to imagine myself in that new role.

Consultant: I understand that these feelings can be overwhelming. Let’s explore this a bit more. When you think about those past successes that led you to this opportunity, how do those experiences resonate with you now?

User: Well, I did get good grades and received positive feedback from my professors, which made me feel capable. That’s probably why I’m confused about my self-doubt now.

Consultant: It sounds like you have evidence of your capabilities. What if we challenge that voice of doubt together? Can you think of a time when you succeeded, even when you felt uncertain?

User: Yes, I remember when I presented in class. I was terrified, but I ended up receiving compliments from my classmates and teachers afterward.

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement! What emotions did you experience right after that presentation?

User: I felt relieved and proud, almost like I had overcome a huge hurdle.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve faced a challenge before and came out on the other side feeling proud. How can you apply that experience to your current situation with the association?

User: I guess I could remind myself that I’ve succeeded before, and I can do it again. I could try to approach this new role as another opportunity to grow.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! What small steps can you take to prepare for this new role while keeping that mindset of growth?

User: Maybe I can reach out to some current members and ask them about their experiences. That way, I can better understand what’s expected and how to fit in.

Consultant: Great idea! Connecting with others can provide valuable insights and support. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: It feels a bit daunting, but I think it could help ease my anxiety. I mean, if I know what to expect, I might feel more prepared!

Consultant: Absolutely! Preparation often reduces anxiety. Would you be willing to set a goal for this week to reach out and have a conversation with someone?

User: Yes, I can aim to contact someone by the end of this week. It gives me something to focus on.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! As you work on this, remember to celebrate your progress, no matter how small. What can you do to acknowledge your efforts after that conversation?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to something nice or spend time doing something I enjoy afterward.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Rewarding yourself helps reinforce the positive behavior. Now, let’s talk about the feelings that might arise when you engage in this conversation. How do you think you might manage any anxiety?

User: I think I could practice some deep breathing beforehand and remind myself that it’s okay to feel nervous.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a fantastic technique! It can really help ground you. I want you to remember that it’s completely normal to feel nervous in new situations. What affirmations can you tell yourself to boost your confidence?

User: I think I could say, "I am capable and I have successfully navigated challenges before." 

Consultant: That’s perfect! Let’s work on reinforcing that affirmation together. How would it feel to repeat that to yourself each day leading up to your conversation?

User: I think it would help a lot! It would remind me that I’ve got what it takes.

Consultant: I’m glad you’re feeling more empowered. As we wrap up today, let’s take a moment to reflect. What do you feel you’ve learned about yourself in this session?

User: I’ve learned that I have the ability to face challenges and that reaching out for support can really help. I just need to remind myself of my strengths.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! Focusing on your strengths and seeking support are key steps. As we continue our sessions, we can keep building on this foundation. 

User: Thank you! I feel more confident now and have a clearer plan to follow.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’ve enjoyed our conversation today. Remember, you’re capable of handling these challenges, and I believe in your potential. If you ever feel anxious again, just recall this conversation. 

User: I appreciate that. I’m looking forward to our next session! 

Consultant: Me too! Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
###################
Consultant: Hello! It’s great to see you today. I understand you've had some positive experiences recently. How are you feeling about everything?

User: Hi! Yes, I actually hosted a small meeting for our association and got some good feedback on my presentation skills. It boosted my confidence, but I still experience anxiety sometimes.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful accomplishment! It’s completely normal to still feel some anxiety even when you’re gaining confidence. Can you tell me more about the situations that trigger your anxiety?

User: I find that when I'm about to speak in front of a group, even if I know the material, my heart races, and I start doubting myself. 

Consultant: I see. So, even with positive feedback, those moments of self-doubt can creep in. What thoughts go through your mind just before you speak in public?

User: I often think I might forget what to say or that people will judge me harshly for any mistake I make.

Consultant: Those are very common thoughts. Let's explore them a little deeper. When you think that people might judge you, how does it make you feel emotionally?

User: I feel really anxious and it makes me want to avoid speaking altogether, even if I know I can do it.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are really influencing how you feel and behave. What would it look like for you if those thoughts weren’t there? 

User: I think I would feel more relaxed and could focus on sharing my ideas rather than worrying about making mistakes.

Consultant: That’s a great vision! Let’s challenge those negative thoughts together. When you think "people will judge me," what evidence do you have that supports or contradicts this belief?

User: I guess most of the feedback is positive, and people usually ask questions afterwards. That should mean they're interested.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like there may be more positive support than you realize. If a friend came to you with the same worry about being judged, what advice would you give them?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on their message and not worry about what others think.

Consultant: That’s excellent advice! Let’s consider applying that same approach to yourself. How might you change your thought process before speaking?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that the audience is generally supportive. 

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Let’s also introduce some relaxation techniques. Have you ever tried any breathing exercises when you start to feel anxious?

User: Not really, I usually just try to power through it.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Let’s practice a simple breathing technique. You can inhale slowly for a count of four, hold for four, and then exhale for six. Would you like to try it together?

User: Sure, I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in... one, two, three, four... hold... one, two, three, four... and exhale... one, two, three, four, five, six. How did that feel? 

User: It actually felt calming! I think I could use that before speaking.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Practicing this technique can help ground you in those anxious moments. As we continue our sessions, we can keep working on reinforcing your confidence and addressing those feelings of anxiety. 

User: That sounds good. I definitely want to feel more confident and less anxious going forward.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve already made progress in recognizing your strengths. What are some other situations where you would like to apply this newfound confidence?

User: I think I want to participate more in class discussions and maybe even lead a workshop someday.

Consultant: Those are fantastic goals! As you keep practicing speaking out, we can reinforce your progress with more positive experiences. How do you feel about tackling class discussions next?

User: I feel excited but a bit nervous too. 

Consultant: That’s normal! Let’s build a plan together. What steps do you think you could take to prepare yourself for class discussions?

User: I could prepare some points ahead of time and practice speaking them out loud. 

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Practicing will help reinforce your confidence. Would you like to set a specific goal around this for next week?

User: Yes, I’d like to share at least one thought in each class next week.

Consultant: That's a fantastic goal! Sharing just one thought each class is a great way to gradually increase your comfort. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the progress you've made?

User: I feel good! I’m encouraged and ready to apply these techniques.

Consultant: I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. Remember to practice those breathing exercises and embrace those small victories. We’ll continue to build on this in our future sessions.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and look forward to our next session. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm excited to hear about your progress. Take care and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm so glad you're here today. It seems like you've been doing quite well lately, especially with your participation in the debate competition. How are you feeling about that achievement?

User: Hi! Yes, I'm feeling really satisfied with my performance. It's nice to see that my effort is paying off, and I've even started to enjoy speaking in public more. But I’m also a bit anxious about keeping up this positive momentum.

Consultant: That’s great to hear that you’re enjoying public speaking and feeling satisfied with your progress. It’s completely normal to feel a bit anxious about maintaining your success. What does maintaining this positive momentum look like for you?

User: I guess I want to keep improving my confidence when speaking and maybe aim for even bigger debate competitions. I don't want to go back to how I felt before, where I was really nervous.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a clear vision of wanting to build on your confidence and aim for greater challenges. Let's explore what specific fears or concerns you might have about this. Are there any thoughts that come to your mind when you think about challenging yourself further?

User: I sometimes worry that I might not perform as well next time, or maybe I'll embarrass myself in front of others.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It’s common to have thoughts like that when facing new challenges. When you think about that possible embarrassment, what feelings arise for you?

User: I feel a mix of fear and self-doubt, like I’m not good enough to compete at a higher level.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It’s important to acknowledge those feelings. Now, let's try to identify if there are any patterns in your thinking. Do you think there might be any irrational thoughts contributing to your self-doubt?

User: Maybe. I often tell myself that if I don’t win, it means I'm not capable or I’ve failed.

Consultant: That’s a critical observation. It seems like you might be engaging in all-or-nothing thinking—believing that winning is the only measure of your ability. What alternative ways can you frame your successes or participation that could be more balanced?

User: I suppose I could think about how much I've improved rather than just the outcome of the competition. It’s about learning and growing too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing improvement and growth is a key part of your journey. How can you celebrate your progress without strictly comparing it to winning or losing?

User: I could reflect on how I felt during the debate, the feedback I received, and just being proud that I pushed myself to participate.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! By celebrating your effort and improvements, you can maintain motivation and reduce anxiety. What steps can you take to incorporate this reflection into a regular practice?

User: I could keep a journal where I note my experiences after each competition or practice session. This way, I can track my growth over time.

Consultant: Writing in a journal is a fantastic idea! It will help you process your experiences and recognize your development continuously. How can you ensure you commit to this journaling practice?

User: I can set aside time after each debate practice or competition specifically for journaling, maybe every Saturday.

Consultant: That sounds practical and manageable. Establishing a routine will help turn it into a habit. As you progress, how will you measure your confidence and ability to handle speaking engagements?

User: I could rate my level of anxiety before and after each event and note any compliments or positive feedback I receive from others.

Consultant: That’s an insightful approach! Monitoring your anxiety levels and gathering positive feedback will help you track your growth and reinforce your confidence. What are your thoughts on setting specific goals for your next steps in public speaking?

User: I’d like to aim for at least one bigger competition each semester, plus joining a public speaking workshop to continue improving my skills.

Consultant: Those are ambitious yet achievable goals! Enrolling in a workshop will also give you further tools and techniques to manage anxiety and boost your confidence. How do you feel about committing to those goals?

User: I feel excited! It’s good to have a clear direction to follow. I also feel less pressure now that I talk through it all.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s amazing how discussing these goals can alleviate that pressure. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize your progress and the steps you've planned to maintain your positive state. How do you feel about everything we’ve talked about today?

User: I feel more empowered. I see the importance of focusing on my journey rather than just the outcomes. 

Consultant: Absolutely! This positive mindset will serve you well. Remember to celebrate your journey, reflect on your experiences, and keep pushing your boundaries. How do you think you'll handle any self-doubt that arises along the way?

User: I’ll remind myself of my improvements and the joy I find in participating. I’ll also keep referring to my journal entries for encouragement.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant strategy! You’re setting yourself up for continued success. This will help you significantly in managing any challenges or self-doubts in the future. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. I'm proud of what you've accomplished. If you ever need support, I’m here for you.

User: Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. This session has been incredibly helpful!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad I could support you today. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. Let's begin by discussing how you're feeling since our last meeting. What progress have you noticed in your communication and confidence lately?

User: Hi! I actually feel more at ease in social situations now. I used to get really nervous when speaking with others, but now, I find it easier to participate in conversations.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant improvement! It's wonderful to hear that you feel more comfortable in those social interactions. Can you share what you think contributed to this change?

User: I think I've been practicing more and consciously reminding myself that it's okay to make mistakes. I’ve also been focusing on listening more during conversations, which has helped me relax.

Consultant: That’s a very proactive approach! Acknowledging that making mistakes is part of communication can really reduce pressure. How do you feel about listening more? Has it changed your experience in conversations?

User: Yes, definitely! Listening helps me to engage better with the person I am speaking with. I feel less anxious because I’m not constantly worrying about what I’m going to say next.

Consultant: It’s fantastic to hear that. Engaging in active listening can significantly enhance communication. Moving forward, can we discuss some specific instances where you felt particularly confident in recent interactions?

User: Sure! Just the other day, I participated in a group discussion for a project, and I contributed my ideas without feeling overwhelmed. It felt rewarding!

Consultant: That’s excellent! Contributing your ideas is a great step. What do you think made that experience different from previous discussions?

User: I think it was because I was well-prepared and reminded myself to breathe and stay present. I wasn't focused on how others might perceive me.

Consultant: It seems like your preparation and mindfulness made a big difference! How can we incorporate that same preparation and presence in other areas of your life, such as studying or future social situations?

User: I could start applying those techniques when studying, like breaking tasks into smaller parts and focusing on one at a time. I think that would help reduce my anxiety about not getting everything done.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid strategy! Breaking tasks down and taking things step by step can really help manage feelings of being overwhelmed. Do you have any specific goals in mind for your study sessions moving forward?

User: I’d like to create a weekly study schedule that allows for breaks and leisure time. Also, I want to challenge myself to speak up more during group projects, even if I feel a bit nervous.

Consultant: Creating a balanced schedule is an excellent idea. It’s important to include breaks for relaxation. And facing your nervousness in group projects is a brave goal! How do you plan to encourage yourself to speak up?

User: I think I’ll set small goals for each group meeting, like sharing at least one idea. I’ve also thought about preparing a few points in advance, so I feel more ready.

Consultant: That’s a thoughtful approach. Preparing points is a great way to feel more confident. How do you think you’ll feel after accomplishing those small goals in your group work?

User: I hope I’d feel proud and more confident in my abilities. Achieving these small goals will also motivate me to keep pushing myself.

Consultant: Absolutely! Celebrating those small victories is crucial for building confidence. As we move forward, it’s also important to reflect on how you can maintain this positive momentum. What can you do to ensure that you stay focused on your growth?

User: I think regular self-reflection would help. Maybe keeping a journal about my experiences and feelings could reinforce my progress and remind me of my achievements.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Journaling can be a powerful tool for self-reflection and tracking your growth. It can help you identify patterns and celebrate your successes. Is there anything specific you would like to include in your journaling practice?

User: I’d like to write down my feelings before and after social interactions, along with any challenges I faced. I think this will help me better understand my growth and areas I want to improve.

Consultant: That sounds very insightful! By analyzing your feelings in those situations, you can gain valuable insights into your progress. As we approach the end of our session today, what do you feel is the most important takeaway from our conversation?

User: I’ve realized that my recent practices and techniques really support my confidence and help lessening my anxiety. Having a plan for continuous improvement feels exciting.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Acknowledging the progress you've made and having a plan for the future is very empowering. Remember, it’s about gradual growth, and you’re on the right track. Do you feel ready to implement these strategies in your daily life?

User: Yes! I feel motivated and ready to take these steps. I appreciate your guidance.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You've made impressive strides, and I believe you’ll continue to succeed. Feel free to reach out whenever you need support. This marks the end of our session today, but I'm confident you have the tools you need. Best of luck on your journey, and remember to celebrate your progress!

User: Thank you! I’m grateful for your help. I’ll keep working on my goals and reach out if I need anything.
