Consultant: Hello, D! I'm glad you're here today. I’d like to start by understanding how you've been feeling lately, especially after your mid-term exams. What's been on your mind?

User: Hi. Well, I’ve been really worried about how well I did on my exams. I feel like there’s so much pressure, especially from my mom. I want to do well, but sometimes I just don't know if I can meet her expectations.

Consultant: I hear you, D. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to perform and are concerned about meeting your mom's expectations. Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you about your performance and your relationship with your mom?

User: I think my mom really wants me to be top of my class, and I want that too, but what if I don’t achieve it? I feel like I might disappoint her. It's like I can't fail, or I’m letting her down.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, D. It’s understandable to want to make your mom proud, but it sounds like this giant expectation is making you feel anxious. What thoughts cross your mind when you think about possibly disappointing her?

User: I just feel like I’m not good enough. It’s like my worth is tied to my grades, and if I don't do well, she might love me less or think I'm not trying hard enough.

Consultant: It seems like you’re dealing with a lot of pressure and painful thoughts about your worth being linked to your grades. Let’s explore these thoughts. Can you share a specific moment from your exams that made you feel this way?

User: During the exams, I felt really nervous. I kept thinking about all the things my mom said before, like how she believes in me. But I also wondered, what if I let her down? Those thoughts just made it harder to focus.

Consultant: It's interesting how your mom's belief in you can feel like a source of pressure instead of support at times. When you were feeling nervous and having those thoughts, how did it affect your emotions at that moment?

User: I felt really anxious and overwhelmed. I wanted to do my best, but then I’d just freeze and couldn't think clearly. It was like my brain was saying, "You have to get this right," and that made it worse.

Consultant: It sounds like your desire to succeed and the pressure you're feeling created a cycle of anxiety that made it hard for you to perform. That's a challenging situation. If you could turn those thoughts around, what would you want to believe instead about your worth and your ability to succeed?

User: I wish I could believe that my mom would still love me even if I don’t do well. I want to think that trying my best is what really matters, not just the grades.

Consultant: That’s a great realization, D. Focusing on your effort rather than just the outcome might help you ease some of that pressure. How can we start challenging those thoughts that link your worth to your grades together?

User: Maybe I could write down my achievements and efforts, not just the grades. It could remind me that I’m trying my best.

Consultant: I love that idea! Keeping a list of your achievements can help you reflect on your efforts rather than just the grades. What other strategies might help you when those anxious thoughts start to creep in during times like exams?

User: I think practicing relaxation techniques could help, like deep breathing or just taking a moment to pause when I start feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: Absolutely! Those are powerful strategies. Let’s practice some deep breathing techniques together now, so you can use them when you're feeling anxious next time. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I think having a way to calm down while I'm studying could be really helpful.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment together. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold for four, and exhale gently through your mouth for four. Shall we try it a few times?

User: Yes, let's try it! 

Consultant: Beautiful! Breathing like this can really help center you in moments of stress. Now, as we move forward, I want to talk about your family dynamics a bit more. How do you feel about your dad being away often? 

User: I feel kind of sad about it. I wish I could spend more time with him, and it makes me feel lonely sometimes because my mom is busy too.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, D. A missing parent can bring about feelings of loneliness, especially when you want their support. What do you think you’re missing most from your dad’s presence?

User: I miss having someone to talk to who understands me. I think having him here would make me feel more supported, especially when I’m anxious about school.

Consultant: That’s a very real need, D. Support from parents, especially during stressful times, is very important. Have you had a chance to express your feelings about this to him or anyone else in your family?

User: Not really. I feel like they might not understand how I feel, so I keep it to myself.

Consultant: It can be tough to open up, especially when there’s a fear of misunderstanding. What if we brainstorm some ways you could share your feelings with your dad in a gentle way?

User: Maybe I could write him a letter or talk to him when he’s not too busy. That might help.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Writing a letter can help articulate your feelings without the pressure of a face-to-face discussion. How do you feel about making that plan?

User: I feel a bit relieved thinking about it. Writing seems less scary than talking face to face.

Consultant: Perfect! Remember, expressing your feelings can help you connect more with your dad, and it may also relieve some of that emotional burden. As we wrap up today, I want to ask you: what’s one key takeaway you’d like to remember moving forward?

User: I think I want to remember that my worth isn’t just tied to my grades and that it’s okay to express how I feel. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway, D. You’re learning to balance your feelings about school and family, and that’s an important step. As we close today, remember that you have strategies to manage your anxiety and communicate your needs. I believe in your ability to work through this.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate it. I feel a bit more hopeful now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, D! I’m glad to hear that. Remember, I’m here whenever you need support. Take care, and I look forward to hearing how your strategies work for you when we meet next time!

Consultant: Hello D! I’m glad you’re here for our session today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really disappointed with my mid-term exam results. I was hoping for better grades. I also wish my dad could be around more and help me with my studies, but he's hardly ever home, and it makes me feel sad.

Consultant: I see how much you desire your father's presence and support, especially when you're feeling down about your exam results. It’s perfectly normal to want that connection. Can you share more about how his absence has affected your mood and your ability to study?

User: Well, I just feel stressed and a bit lost without him here. I wish he would spend more time with me, maybe help me with my homework or just talk to me about my day. I sometimes feel like I’m facing everything alone.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re carrying a significant weight on your own. Not having your dad around when you need support can be really tough. How do you think you might approach expressing this need for more connection with him or perhaps with someone else in your life?

User: I haven’t really said anything to him. I just keep hoping he would notice I need him. But I guess I could talk to my mom. She’s around more often, but I don’t want to bother her since she’s busy too.

Consultant: Talking to your mom could be a great step. She might not realize how much you're feeling this way. It’s important to communicate your needs, and it also might help to relieve some of your feelings of loneliness. What might you say to her to express how you’re feeling?

User: Maybe I could tell her I miss Dad and that I need someone to talk to about school. I just don’t want her to feel overwhelmed or think I’m just complaining.

Consultant: That makes sense; you’re being really considerate of her feelings. Remember, sharing your thoughts isn’t complaining; it's about seeking support. It’s okay to ask for help. Would you feel comfortable trying that this week?

User: Yeah, I think I could try that. I really want to feel better about everything and not just keep it bottled up.

Consultant: That’s a positive step, D. Speaking up can really help you feel less alone. Now, aside from talking to your mom, do you have any other strategies in mind that might help you cope with your feelings about school and your dad’s absence?

User: I think I could also try focusing on my dance classes and spending time with friends. They usually help me feel better when I'm down.

Consultant: That sounds fantastic! Engaging in activities you enjoy, like dancing or hanging out with friends, can really lift your spirits. Do you feel comfortable making more time for these activities, especially when you’re feeling stressed or anxious?

User: Yeah, I can definitely do that. It always makes me feel happy and distracts me from my worries.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, D! Finding joy in your interests is important. Let’s also consider what realistic expectations you have for your exam results next time. How do you feel about setting achievable goals for yourself?

User: I think I need to be more realistic. I can’t always expect perfect grades since I do have a lot going on. Maybe I should focus on improving a little bit each time instead.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! By setting smaller, more achievable goals, you can feel a sense of accomplishment without overwhelming yourself. What would be a realistic goal for your next exam, considering all that’s happening?

User: Maybe I can aim to raise my math grade by a few points. That feels doable.

Consultant: That’s a great goal that feels attainable. This also gives you room to acknowledge your efforts without adding too much pressure. Let’s think about how to support that goal. Are there specific study techniques or routines you could incorporate leading up to the exam?

User: I could try making a more structured study schedule or maybe start studying a little each day instead of cramming all at once.

Consultant: A structured study schedule sounds really effective! It’s a proactive way to manage your time and reduce anxiety. How do you feel about starting this approach for your upcoming exams?

User: I feel good about it. It sounds much less stressful than my usual way of studying.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, taking small, consistent steps can help build your confidence and make studying feel more manageable. As we finish up today, how are you feeling about everything we’ve discussed?

User: I feel a little lighter after talking about it. I think I have some ideas to try, and I hope it helps.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, D. You’ve made some great insights today, and it seems like you’re on the right path. As a final takeaway, remember to express your feelings to your mom, make time for things you love, and set realistic goals for yourself. You’re capable of navigating these challenges!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I’ll try to focus on these steps.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, D! I look forward to hearing how things go in our next session. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello D! I'm glad you're here for our session today. Before we dive in, I’d love to hear how you’ve been feeling lately, especially with the upcoming dance competition.

User: Hi. I’ve been really anxious about the dance competition. I've been practicing a lot, but the closer it gets, the more nervous I feel. I can't seem to sleep at night because I keep worrying about whether I'll do well.

Consultant: It sounds like there's a lot of pressure on you as the competition approaches. You want to perform well, but that pressure is making it hard for you to relax and sleep. What are some specific thoughts that come to your mind when you think about the competition?

User: I keep wondering if I’ll mess up on stage. What if everyone laughs at me? I feel like I have to be perfect, and that thought just makes me more anxious.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling you have to be perfect can create a lot of stress. It’s understandable to feel worried about performing. When you think about messing up, what emotions do you experience?  

User: I feel scared and embarrassed. I just want everyone to be proud of me, especially my mom. She puts so much into helping me with my practice.

Consultant: That's completely natural; wanting to make your mom proud can add to the pressure you feel. It sounds like there’s a lot of expectation you're carrying. Can you recall any moments during practice where you felt confident or enjoyed dancing?

User: Sometimes, when I nail a tricky move during practice, I feel great! But those moments seem to fade when I think about performing in front of everyone.

Consultant: Those confident moments are important and can remind you of your capabilities. Let’s explore that further. What evidence do you have that you will mess up during the competition? Have you made mistakes in practice before?  

User: Not really—I tend to do well during practice, but I just fear that performing will be different. 

Consultant: It’s not uncommon to feel that way. Just because performing is new and different, it doesn’t mean you won’t do well. What if we tried to reframe how you think about the performance? Instead of worrying about being perfect, what if you see it as an opportunity to enjoy sharing what you've practiced? 

User: That sounds nice! It just feels hard to let go of the pressure. 

Consultant: I understand letting go of that pressure takes effort. How about we work on some calming techniques together? These can help you manage those anxious feelings before the competition. Would you be open to that?

User: Yes, I think that might help. I’ve seen others do breathing exercises, but I’ve never tried them myself.

Consultant: Breathing exercises can be really effective! Let’s practice one together. When you feel anxious, remember to take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a moment, and then release it slowly through your mouth. Would you like to try that right now with me?

User: Sure, let’s do it. I’ll try to focus. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s inhale deeply... hold for a count of three... and now exhale slowly. How did that feel for you?

User: I think it helped a little. I feel a bit more relaxed, but I’m not sure it will always work. 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, and it’s all about practice. Each time you do it, it can become more effective. Can you envision using this technique when you're feeling overwhelmed about the competition?

User: Yes, I can see myself doing that during the performance. I just wish my mom understood how I feel. Sometimes I feel pressure from her too.

Consultant: It sounds like communication with your mom might be an important piece here. Let’s explore how you can express your feelings to her. What do you think would help her understand your perspective better?

User: Maybe I could tell her that I appreciate her support but that I’m also feeling a lot of pressure. 

Consultant: That sounds like a good start! Sharing your feelings can help open up a more understanding dialogue. How might you approach that conversation, do you think?

User: I guess I could say something like, “Mom, I really want to do well, but I’m feeling scared and stressed.” 

Consultant: That's very clear and honest! By expressing how you feel, you're allowing her to see your perspective. Would you feel comfortable talking to her about this?

User: I think so, but I’m worried she might not get it and just push for more practice.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel uncertain about how she'll respond. If she doesn't quite understand, you could also ask her how she feels about your dance journey. Sometimes asking her perspective can create a better bond.

User: That makes sense! I could try to understand her expectations too while sharing mine.

Consultant: Exactly! It's about finding that balance. Remember, it’s okay to express your needs and for her to express hers. Communication is key. How are you feeling about this approach?

User: I feel a bit more empowered! I hope she can understand and we can have a productive conversation.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, D! Feeling empowered is a great step forward. Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. Do you believe you can take this step before the competition?

User: Yes, I really want to! I’ll try to talk to her soon.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! And as you prepare for the competition, keep practicing those breathing techniques and remind yourself of your strengths. Before we end today, is there anything else you want to discuss or any questions you have?

User: I think I’m okay for now. I really appreciate your help!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, D! Remember, you are capable and you’ve got this. If you ever want to chat or if something comes up before or after the competition, don’t hesitate to reach out. You’re doing great!
###################
Consultant: Hello D! I'm glad to see you here today. I know you've been feeling a bit overwhelmed with communication issues, especially with your mother. Can we start by talking about how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi! Yes, I'm really stressed about my conversations with my mom. It seems like no matter what I say, she just doesn’t understand me. I feel like I’m letting her down.

Consultant: It sounds frustrating to feel misunderstood, and that pressure can be quite heavy. Can you share a recent example of a conversation that left you feeling this way?

User: Recently, I tried to explain how busy I’ve been with school and activities, but she just seemed disappointed. She kept saying I should manage my time better and that I’m not living up to her expectations.

Consultant: That must have been difficult for you. When she expressed disappointment, what thoughts went through your mind at that moment?

User: I thought that I was failing her somehow. It made me feel like I wasn’t good enough, and I just wanted her to see that I’m trying my best.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you’re putting in effort. Let’s explore this sensation of not being good enough together. How often do these kinds of thoughts come to your mind?

User: Quite often, especially when I think about school or when my mom talks about things I should improve on. It makes me anxious about things.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me, D. When you think about not being good enough or feeling anxious, what emotions do you experience? 

User: I feel sad and a bit angry, too. Sad because I want my mom to be proud of me, and angry because I feel like she doesn’t understand how hard I’m trying.

Consultant: It’s completely valid to feel both sadness and anger in this situation. It’s challenging when you feel your efforts aren’t recognized. Have you noticed any specific thoughts about your abilities that come up when you're feeling this way?

User: I often think that I should just be able to handle everything. I feel like everyone else does, and I should too.

Consultant: That sounds like a lot of pressure you’re putting on yourself. What evidence do you have that others handle everything perfectly? Are there examples where they also struggle?

User: Well, I see my friends sometimes look stressed too. I guess they’re not always perfect either. 

Consultant: That’s a great observation! It’s important to remember that everyone faces challenges, even if it seems otherwise. What if you considered talking to your mother about how you feel and sharing that you also struggle sometimes?

User: I think that might help, but I don’t know how to start. What if she gets upset again?

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry about that. How about we come up with a way to express your feelings that shows you want her to understand your perspective? 

User: Maybe I could say something like, “I feel overwhelmed sometimes, and I need your support.” Does that sound okay?

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful start! By expressing your feelings directly, you can open up a line of communication. How do you think your mother might respond to that?

User: I hope she’d be more understanding. Sometimes I just think she doesn’t recognize how much I do.

Consultant: It could be a chance for her to see your efforts better. Would you like to practice how you might approach this conversation before you have it with her?

User: Yes, I would like that. I want to make sure I don’t get too emotional.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s role-play this. You can start by saying how you feel, and I’ll respond as your mother. Ready? 

User: Okay... “Mom, I feel overwhelmed sometimes, and I need your support.”

Consultant: “I see. I thought you were not managing your time well. Can you explain what’s been overwhelming?”

User: I feel like I have so many assignments and activities, and I want to do well in everything, but it can be too much. 

Consultant: “I understand. It's hard to balance everything. How can I help you with that?” 

User: I think that would be great! Maybe we could work out a schedule together?

Consultant: That sounds like a productive idea! Planning together can strengthen your relationship too. How did it feel to practice this?

User: It felt good! I think if I say it like this, she’ll see where I’m coming from.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Practice and preparation can make a big difference. Moving forward, how can we ensure you feel more confident in these conversations?

User: Maybe I need to remind myself that it’s okay to ask for help and express my feelings.

Consultant: That's a very healthy thought! Reminding yourself of your need for support is crucial. What skills do you think you could practice to maintain this confidence during discussions?

User: I guess I could write down how I feel before talking, like a reminder. 

Consultant: Great idea! Writing things down can clarify your thoughts. Would you feel comfortable sharing your feelings with friends or a trusted adult as well?

User: Yes, I think having their support would also help me feel less alone.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Support from friends and others can lighten the load. As we prepare to wrap up our session, what do you feel you've learned today?

User: I learned that it’s okay to talk about my feelings and that I can practice how to say things to my mom. I feel more prepared to communicate.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway! You’ve made great progress in understanding your emotions and building your communication skills. Remember, it’s okay not to be perfect. How do you hope to apply this when you speak with your mom?

User: I will try to be open and honest with her and not feel scared to show my feelings.

Consultant: I believe you can do this! You’ve shown a lot of growth today. Keep practicing, and remember that you have the support you need. If you find yourself struggling again, don’t hesitate to reach out. You've done really well today, D!

User: Thank you! I feel more confident now and appreciate your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of you for taking these steps. I look forward to hearing how your next conversation goes. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello D! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling recently, especially with your interactions at school?

User: Hi. I've been feeling kind of anxious. I keep getting into arguments with my classmates over small things. I wish I could handle those situations better and be more confident.

Consultant: I see, so you're experiencing anxiety during social interactions and want to improve your confidence and conflict resolution skills. Can you tell me more about a recent situation where you felt this way?

User: Sure. Just last week, there was a misunderstanding over a group project, and I ended up raising my voice. I felt really embarrassed afterward and worried that my classmates don’t like me.

Consultant: It sounds like that situation was quite stressful for you. What were you thinking during that argument? Sometimes our thoughts can influence how we feel and react.

User: I thought that if I didn’t stand up for myself, people would think I'm weak. But raising my voice didn’t help at all; it just made everything worse.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, D. It seems like you felt caught between wanting to assert yourself and not wanting to escalate things. Do you often find yourself thinking that standing up for yourself means being loud?

User: Yeah, I guess I believe that to be taken seriously, I have to be assertive, even if it means being aggressive.

Consultant: It’s understandable that you want to be taken seriously. However, there's a different way to assert yourself without letting the situation escalate. How would you feel about exploring a few different ways to express your feelings calmly when conflicts arise?

User: I think that would help. I really want to learn how to communicate better without getting upset.

Consultant: Great! One technique we can try is practicing role-playing different scenarios. This way, we can explore how you might respond in those situations. What kind of situation do you think would be helpful to practice first?

User: Maybe the group project situation again? I'd like to think of a better way to express what I needed.

Consultant: Perfect choice! Let’s imagine you’re in that scenario again. What would you say to your classmates at the beginning to express your feelings without getting defensive?

User: I could start by saying something like, “I feel uncomfortable with the way things are going, and I'd like us to find a solution together.”

Consultant: That’s an excellent opening! It shows you’re addressing the issue while inviting collaboration. How do you think your classmates would respond to that?

User: I think they’d be more willing to listen because I’m approaching it calmly rather than yelling.

Consultant: Exactly! By sharing your feelings without blame, you foster a more open dialogue. Let’s practice that approach a bit more. How would you handle a situation if a classmate interrupts you while you’re speaking?

User: Hmm… I could say, “I’d like to finish my thought first, and then I’d love to hear your input.”

Consultant: Wonderful! That keeps the conversation respectful while asserting your need to be heard. Do you feel more confident about handling such interruptions now?

User: Yes, I do! I think I can practice that in my next group setting.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s also helpful to prepare for potential conflicts, like thinking ahead about what you want to communicate. What other situation do you think you might encounter in school that you could prepare for?

User: Maybe if someone criticizes my work. I often take that really personally.

Consultant: That's a common feeling, D. When you receive criticism, it’s important to separate the feedback from your self-worth. How can you remind yourself that feedback is meant to help you improve, not to define you?

User: I could tell myself, “This is just one person’s opinion, and it can help me grow.” 

Consultant: That’s a great affirmation! Let’s also think about how you can respond to criticism positively. What might you say in response to a classmate’s feedback?

User: I could say, “Thank you for your thoughts! I’ll consider them for my next assignment.” 

Consultant: Perfect! This approach shows openness to improvement while maintaining your composure. How are you feeling about these strategies we’ve discussed so far?

User: I feel more hopeful! These techniques might really help me in my interactions. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, D. Remember, it’s all about practice. What steps can you take to start implementing these strategies in your daily interactions?

User: I can start using them in my group discussions and even at home when I talk to my family.

Consultant: Excellent plan! Practicing at home can really reinforce your skills. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about your ability to maintain these improvements moving forward?

User: I feel confident. I don’t want to go back to how I was before. 

Consultant: That’s a strong commitment, D! It sounds like you’ve made significant progress today. If you ever feel challenged, just remember these strategies, and don’t hesitate to reach out for support. 

User: Thank you so much! I’ll do my best to remember them. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. I look forward to hearing all about your experiences next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hi D! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello! I've been feeling a lot lighter since my relationship with my mom has improved. We've been communicating better, especially with the letters we started writing to each other.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful, D! I'm glad to hear that. How do you feel about the effectiveness of using letters to communicate with her?

User: I think it really helps! I can express my thoughts clearly, and I feel like she understands me better now. It’s nice to have that connection.

Consultant: It’s encouraging to hear that you’ve found a way to express yourself and to feel understood. What do you think makes the letter-writing so effective for both of you?

User: I guess writing gives me time to think about what I want to say. Sometimes, when I talk directly, I can't find the right words, and I just get anxious.

Consultant: Exactly, writing can be a great tool to manage those feelings. It allows you to organize your thoughts without the immediate pressure of a conversation. Would you like to explore how you can further enhance this communication strategy?

User: Yes, I’d love that! I want to keep it going, but I’m also worried I might forget to write regularly, or what if she stops responding like before?

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those worries. Let’s think about creating a routine or a special agreement around your letter writing. How would you feel about setting specific times to exchange letters together?

User: That sounds good! Maybe we can decide on a day every week to write to each other. It would be easier to remember that way.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Setting a specific day can help keep the momentum going. Do you want to start with a trial period and see how it feels for both of you?

User: Yeah, maybe we can try it for a month and then talk again about how it’s going.

Consultant: Perfect! After a month, we can review how things are going and make adjustments if needed. How do you feel about discussing the content of your letters? Is there anything specific you want to write about?

User: I want to share more about my day-to-day feelings and also hear about her day. I think that would really help us connect.

Consultant: That’s a great approach—sharing daily experiences can deepen your understanding of each other. You can also include questions in your letters to prompt her to share more. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds really nice! I could ask her about her work and how she feels about it. I think she would like that.

Consultant: Absolutely! That would show her that you care about her experiences, too. What do you think would be the key takeaway after you write your letters?

User: I hope to feel closer to my mom and keep understanding her better. I just really want to maintain this bond we’re building.

Consultant: That’s a lovely goal, D. Fostering that connection will benefit you both. Remember, maintaining open communication is essential. How do you think you can keep the excitement alive in your letters?

User: Maybe I can share fun things I did during the week or even little drawings! That might make her happy.

Consultant: What a creative idea! Personal touches like drawings or sharing fun moments can make your letters even more special. Would you like to set specific goals for your letters, like introducing a new topic each week?

User: Yes! That would help keep things fresh. I could plan to write about school one week and my hobbies the next. 

Consultant: Excellent! Planning topics in advance can definitely help keep you engaged. Do you feel that making this plan gives you more confidence in your communication with your mom?

User: Yes, it does! I feel excited about this new way of connecting. It gives me something to look forward to.

Consultant: Fantastic, D! It’s wonderful to see your enthusiasm. How about we check in during our next session to see how things have progressed with your letters?

User: That would be great! I’m looking forward to sharing my experiences and how my mom responds to the changes.
