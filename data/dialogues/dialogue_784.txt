Consultant: Hello! I'm really happy to see you today, L. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, things have been tough. I still feel really lonely at school. The other girls don’t seem to want me in their groups, and it makes me really angry.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of frustration and loneliness right now, especially with how your classmates are treating you. Can you tell me more about what happened during your physical education class recently?

User: Well, during a group activity, I noticed that everyone else was paired up, and I was just left standing there. I felt completely invisible.

Consultant: That must have been a really painful experience, feeling overlooked like that. How did that situation make you feel at the moment?

User: I felt really embarrassed and hurt. I wanted to shout at them, but I held back because I didn't want to make things worse.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel angry and hurt in that situation. It sounds like you had a strong emotional response. Can we explore what thoughts went through your mind when you found yourself being excluded from the group?

User: I thought that no one likes me and that I’ll always be alone. Those thoughts just kept running through my head.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite heavy and negative. They can make you feel even more isolated. Let’s look at the evidence behind those thoughts. Do you think there might be other ways to interpret what happened in that situation?

User: I guess I could think that maybe they just didn't notice I was alone. But it seemed so intentional.

Consultant: It’s perfectly valid to feel that way, especially when emotions are high. Could trying to see it from another perspective help reduce some of that frustration? For example, what if you imagined how you might react if a friend was left out?

User: I would probably want to include them and make sure they feel welcome. 

Consultant: That’s a compassionate response! It shows that you understand how important connection is. So, what do you think about your own situation? How might others perceive your feelings of being excluded, given that you’re a kind person yourself?

User: I guess they might not realize how their actions affect me. I wish I could tell them, but I don’t want to seem needy or weak.

Consultant: It’s brave of you to want to express your feelings. Communicating your emotions doesn’t mean you’re weak at all; it can actually help build connections with others. What are some ways you could share your feelings without feeling vulnerable?

User: Maybe I could try talking to them after class, when it’s less tense. But I often freeze up and can’t think of what to say.

Consultant: That’s a common experience, feeling stuck when wanting to communicate. Would you like to practice or brainstorm some phrases that could help ease into those conversations?

User: Yeah, that might help. I really want to make some friends and feel less alone.

Consultant: That's a great goal, L. Let’s explore how you might open up a conversation. You could say something like, “Hey, I noticed I’ve been left out during group activities. It made me feel a little lonely. Can we work together next time?” How does that sound to you?

User: That actually sounds okay. It’s honest but not too aggressive.

Consultant: Exactly! It communicates your feelings without blaming anyone, making it easier for them to respond positively. How do you feel about trying to express this in your next class?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I want to try. I think if I can say it once, it might get easier.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset to have! Allowing room for nerves while being willing to try shows courage. Remember, even if the response isn’t perfect, you’re advocating for yourself, which is a crucial step. 

User: Right, I definitely want to be able to speak up for myself without feeling ashamed.

Consultant: That's an important realization! As we work on this together, we can also find ways to handle those moments of anger and frustration. What do you think might help you calm down when you start feeling overwhelmed?

User: Maybe I could take a few deep breaths or step out for a minute. I usually just stay angry.

Consultant: Taking deep breaths is a fantastic strategy! It can provide a moment to pause and collect your thoughts. Would you like to try practicing that technique together now?

User: Yes, I think that would help!

Consultant: Let’s do it. Take a deep breath in through your nose... and now slowly exhale through your mouth. Let’s do that a couple more times together. How do you feel physically after doing that?

User: I feel a bit lighter and less tense. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Remember, using breathing techniques can help you regain a sense of control when emotions run high. It’s also okay to feel angry; it’s part of being human. Have you noticed any other patterns in your emotions related to these experiences?

User: I do get angry a lot more since I feel left out, and I think I snap at people unexpectedly. I don’t mean to.

Consultant: Recognizing that is a significant insight. It seems like those feelings of exclusion might be causing you to react more strongly than you’d like. Let’s work on strategies that can help you process those feelings without lashing out. How about we discuss ways to express your emotions more healthily?

User: Yeah, I’d like that. I don’t want to hurt anyone with my anger.

Consultant: That’s a great attitude, L. We can look into journaling your feelings first or finding a safe space to vent, like talking to a trusted friend or family member. What resonates with you?

User: I think journaling could work for me. It might help to write things down instead of holding on to them.

Consultant: Absolutely! Journaling can be a powerful tool to express and understand your emotions. I’m glad you see its potential. As you think about this, how do you feel about taking some actions toward improving your relationships moving forward?

User: I want to be more proactive. That sounds like a plan!

Consultant: That's an excellent approach, L! Remember, every step counts, no matter how small. As we wrap up today’s session, what specific actions do you feel ready to take before we meet again?

User: I’ll try to talk to my classmates and practice breathing. I’ll also start journaling my feelings.

Consultant: Those are fantastic goals! I believe you can achieve them. I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support a lot.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, L! I’m grateful for your openness today. Just remember, you’re taking important steps toward managing your emotions and improving your relationships. If you need me, I’ll be here. Take care until we meet again!

Consultant: Hello Li! I'm glad you're here today. I know you've been feeling a lot of anger and isolation lately. Can you tell me more about what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really misunderstood, especially after the argument with my classmates. It just feels like nobody gets me, and I’m so frustrated.

Consultant: It sounds like that situation has made you feel even more isolated. Anger can be tough to navigate, especially when you feel alone. What specifically about the argument made you feel misunderstood?

User: I was just trying to express my opinion, but it escalated quickly. I felt like they weren’t listening at all, and it just made me really upset. I don’t want to keep feeling this way.

Consultant: I see how that would be frustrating. It’s hard when you feel like your voice isn’t heard. What do you think contributed to your feelings during that argument?

User: I think I was already on edge. I’ve been feeling overwhelmed with school and my grades. It’s like everything is piling up, and that argument just tipped me over.

Consultant: It makes sense that the stress from school and your grades could heighten your emotions. Let’s focus on identifying those triggers. Can you share what specific thoughts you had during the argument and how they made you feel?

User: During the argument, I thought things like "They don't care about me" or "I’m always the odd one out." Those thoughts made me feel more angry and hurt.

Consultant: Those thoughts reflect a lot of deep feelings of isolation. It’s important to recognize how these thoughts can influence your emotions. How do you think those thoughts might have affected your behavior during the argument?

User: I guess I just reacted without thinking. I was so angry that I said things I didn’t really mean. I didn’t want to create more distance between us, but I ended up doing just that.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight, Li. Recognizing how thoughts influence reactions is a crucial step. What do you think would help you communicate differently in the future when those feelings arise again?

User: I’m not sure. Maybe if I take a moment to breathe before responding… I just sometimes feel like I can't control my reactions when I'm angry.

Consultant: Taking a moment to breathe is an excellent idea! It can help you manage those intense feelings. We can also work on some strategies to help you communicate more effectively. Would you like to explore those together?

User: Yes, I’d like that! I really want to change how I interact with them, but I don't know where to start.

Consultant: Let’s start by practicing expressing your feelings calmly. How about we think of a simple way you could phrase how you felt during the argument, without escalating the situation?

User: Maybe I could say something like, “I felt ignored when I was trying to express my opinion, and it made me upset”?

Consultant: That’s a great start! Sharing your feelings using “I” statements can often help reduce defensiveness in others. How do you feel about trying this approach next time you're in a difficult conversation?

User: I think that sounds good. I feel a little more confident about it, but I worry it might still be hard in the moment.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel uncertain, especially when emotions run high. Practicing this technique will build your confidence. Would you like to develop a plan for practicing these skills?

User: Yes, I’d like to practice more. I don’t want to feel this way anymore.

Consultant: Wonderful! We could role-play some scenarios or even write down some possible phrases to use. What kind of situation would you like to practice first?

User: Maybe a simple conversation with a classmate about a group project? That seems like a good place to start.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Let’s envision a scenario where you can express your thoughts and feelings during a group project. How would you approach your classmate?

User: I could start by asking for their opinion on how to tackle the project, then share my ideas calmly.

Consultant: Exactly! That initiates a positive dialogue and shows you value their input. What would be your next step if they disagreed with you?

User: I’d remind myself to stay calm and listen to their perspective before responding. 

Consultant: Perfect! Staying calm and listening are key components. Remember, it’s about finding a balance between sharing your feelings and being open to others. How are you feeling about these strategies now?

User: I feel more optimistic. I think I can improve my communication and maybe rebuild some relationships.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Li! It’s a journey, but you’re already taking the right steps. In our next session, we can review how applying these strategies worked out for you and go deeper if you’d like.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I'm looking forward to trying this out.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in your ability to manage your emotions and improve your interactions. Remember, be patient with yourself as you practice these new skills. You’re doing great!

User: Thanks! I’ll keep that in mind. I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: See you next time, Li! Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you’re here today. I remember from our last session that you were feeling misunderstood and isolated. Can you tell me more about how you’ve been since then?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling a bit stuck, to be honest. After the incident in class where I was criticized by my teacher, I felt even more frustrated and alone. I don't know how to talk to my classmates without feeling awkward.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Li. It’s understandable to feel frustrated when situations like that happen. You mentioned feeling more awkward in conversations; can you share what specific thoughts go through your mind during those interactions?

User: I often think that no one likes me, or that I'll just embarrass myself again. Sometimes I feel like I don’t belong at all, and that makes me want to just stay quiet and not interact.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite heavy for you. Thoughts like "no one likes me" can really affect our confidence. Let's explore that a bit—how do you feel when those thoughts arise? 

User: I feel really anxious and want to just disappear sometimes. The anxiety just makes it harder for me to reach out to anyone.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. It’s a cycle where anxiety makes it hard to engage, and then the lack of interaction reinforces those negative thoughts. What would it feel like, Li, if you were able to challenge those thoughts when they come up? 

User: I suppose it would feel like a relief. But I’m not sure how to change my thoughts. 

Consultant: Absolutely, it can be difficult to shift our thinking. One way to start could be to gather evidence against those negative thoughts. For example, can you think of any moments when someone did acknowledge you positively?

User: Well, there was this one time in class when I answered a question correctly, and my teacher praised me. But it feels like that isn’t enough compared to all the times I’ve felt bad. 

Consultant: It sounds like you have evidence that you're capable, at least in that moment. It’s important to recognize that even small successes count. How about we try an exercise? Let’s think of a time coming up where you could apply a different way of speaking to your classmates. How could you approach it? 

User: Perhaps I could just greet them or ask a simple question? I don’t have to make it too complicated. 

Consultant: That's a great idea! Starting with a simple greeting is a wonderful way to open up communication. What do you think might hold you back from doing that? 

User: I worry they’ll ignore me or just think I’m awkward. 

Consultant: It’s natural to have those worries. What if we visualize a situation where you greet them and they respond positively? How would that feel for you? 

User: I can imagine it feeling nice, and maybe I wouldn’t feel as scared if they smiled back.

Consultant: Exactly, and it’s a way to practice experiencing a positive interaction. Situations like that could challenge your belief that these interactions will be negative. Would it help to set a small goal for yourself to try this in the coming week? 

User: Yes, I think I could aim to say hi to at least one classmate each day. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan, Li! Remember to focus on how it feels to make that effort rather than worrying about how they might respond. It’s also a step towards becoming more comfortable. 

User: I’ll try that! But I still feel nervous just thinking about it. 

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about trying something new. It’s a sign that you’re pushing out of your comfort zone. How can we prepare you for that nervousness when you go greet someone? 

User: Maybe I could practice what to say beforehand, so I don’t freeze up in the moment.

Consultant: That sounds like a good strategy! Practicing can reduce the anxiety you might feel. Would you like to role-play a scenario together? 

User: Yes, I think that could help. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s say I’m a classmate. You can start by greeting me. 

User: Hi. Um… do you have time to talk about the homework? 

Consultant: Hi, Li! Sure, I’d love to chat about that. How does it feel to say that? 

User: It feels a bit more manageable now that I’ve practiced it. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s okay to start small and build up your confidence. After trying it out, we can discuss how it felt during our next session.

User: I’m looking forward to that! I really want to improve my communication skills.

Consultant: I’m proud of you for wanting to take these steps, Li. Remember that it’s a process, and every little effort counts. Before we end today, what do you hope to take away from this session? 

User: I want to feel more empowered to initiate conversations, even if I’m a little nervous. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway! You are already making progress by identifying that desire. Keep practicing, and we’ll keep building on it. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate the support.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li! I’m here to help. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. 

User: Me too! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you today. Last time we spoke about your experiences with the group project. How have things been going for you since then?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit anxious about socializing. I tried to participate more in the group project, but I still feel like I don’t fit in. It’s frustrating.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re still feeling some pressure when it comes to interacting with your peers. Let’s talk about what happened during the group project. What specific moments made you feel out of place?

User: Well, I suggested some ideas, but they didn’t seem very interested. I felt like I was just trying too hard to get involved, but I wasn't really connecting with them.

Consultant: I understand that can be disheartening. It takes a lot of courage to put yourself out there. How did that experience impact your feelings during the discussions?

User: I think I felt embarrassed and anxious afterward. I started to doubt whether my ideas were good enough for the group. 

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those feelings, especially when you’re trying something new. Can we explore what thoughts were going through your mind during that situation?

User: I kept thinking, “They're not listening to me; my suggestions don’t matter.” It felt like I was just invisible.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy. It’s important to recognize that these thoughts might not reflect reality. What might you say to a friend who was feeling the same way in a group setting?

User: I’d probably tell them that their ideas are valuable and that they should keep trying to share. 

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! What if you tried to apply that same kindness to yourself? How would it feel to acknowledge that your ideas matter too?

User: It would probably help, but it's hard to believe that sometimes.

Consultant: I understand. It can be challenging to overcome those negative thoughts. Let’s think about some positive experiences you’ve had in the past when you successfully communicated with others. Can you recall any moments that felt good?

User: Well, there was that time I actually made a joke in class, and everyone laughed. It felt nice to connect like that.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful memory! It shows you can connect, and humor is a great way to bond. Perhaps we can explore how you could incorporate more of that light-heartedness into your interactions with the group.

User: That sounds good! I guess I just worry about saying the wrong thing again.

Consultant: It’s totally understandable to worry, but remember, everyone makes mistakes. What if instead of focusing on the possibility of “wrong” things, you focused on the fun of sharing ideas, just like with your joke?

User: That might help me relax a bit. I can see how being more playful could ease the tension.

Consultant: Exactly! Let’s practice some scenarios where you could use humor or light comments to engage with your classmates. How does that sound?

User: I’d like that. I think it could make me feel more comfortable.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you’re back in that group setting. How might you introduce a new idea with a light touch or a bit of humor?

User: Maybe I could say something like, “Okay, bear with me, but what if we tried this idea?” I think that could ease the mood.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! By framing it that way, you invite others to engage with you without the pressure. How do you feel about trying this out next time?

User: I feel a bit more confident now. I think I will give it a shot!

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Li! Confidence comes from practice and self-compassion. As we wrap up, what do you think you can do to maintain this positive shift in your interactions?

User: I think I'll remind myself that my contributions matter, and I’ll be more forgiving of myself if things don’t go perfectly.

Consultant: That’s a powerful strategy. It shows how much you’ve grown and learned. Remember, every step forward is progress. I believe you can keep building on this!

User: Thank you! This session helped me see things differently. I feel lighter.

Consultant: I’m happy to hear that. Keep practicing your new skills, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support. You’re doing wonderfully, and I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. 

User: Thanks! I appreciate your guidance.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li! This will be our last session for now, but remember that you have the tools and understanding to manage your interactions. I wish you the best as you continue to grow. You can come back anytime you need!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you again. It seems like you've been experiencing some positive changes recently. Can you tell me a bit about how you've been feeling in terms of social interactions since our last session?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel a bit more relaxed about socializing. I recently joined a class discussion for the first time, and it was actually fun. I enjoyed sharing my ideas and listening to others.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you experienced some joy in connecting with your classmates. What do you think contributed to this positive experience?

User: I think I was just more open to the idea of sharing and interacting. I realized that it wasn't as intimidating as I thought it would be, which surprised me.

Consultant: It's great that you were able to challenge that initial fear of socializing. How did it feel to share your thoughts during the discussion?

User: It felt really good! I was nervous at first, but once I started talking, I felt like I belonged more. It was nice to see my classmates responding positively to my comments.

Consultant: That sense of belonging is important. It sounds like you made a meaningful connection during that discussion. Have you thought about how you could explore more social opportunities like that in the future?

User: Yes, I was thinking about trying to participate more in our class activities and maybe even joining a club or something. 

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Joining a club could provide even more chances to connect with others. What type of clubs interest you?

User: I’m interested in something related to art or maybe a literature club. I enjoy drawing and reading, so it would be nice to meet people who share similar interests.

Consultant: Those are fantastic choices! Engaging in activities you enjoy can help build connections with others. Based on your interests, would you be willing to set a small goal for yourself regarding joining one of those clubs?

User: I could try to find out when the next club meeting is and actually attend it. That makes sense.

Consultant: Exactly! Setting that goal will help you gradually increase your engagement without overwhelming yourself. How do you feel about the idea of attending that meeting?

User: I feel a bit nervous just thinking about it, but I also feel excited about the possibility of meeting new people.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel both nervous and excited. Those feelings often go hand in hand. What might help you ease that nervousness before the meeting?

User: Maybe I could write down some conversation starters or questions to ask. That might make me feel more prepared.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Preparing ahead can boost your confidence. What kinds of questions or conversation starters do you think would suit the club you're interested in?

User: I could ask about their favorite books or if they have any favorite artists. Those seem like good topics to start with.

Consultant: Those are excellent conversation starters! They open up the floor for discussions and allow you to share more about your interests. How about we also think of some positive affirmations you could tell yourself before attending?

User: Positive affirmations? Like, telling myself that I’m capable of making friends?

Consultant: Exactly! You could say things like, “I am capable of making new friends,” or “I have interesting things to share.” These affirmations can help shift your mindset in a positive direction.

User: I like that idea. I’ll make a list of those affirmations to remind myself.

Consultant: Perfect! It's great to have that reminder. As you continue to practice social interactions, notice how you feel each time. What benefits do you think you might notice from these experiences?

User: I hope I’ll feel more confident in expressing myself and maybe even improve my mood overall. I think my anxiety will lessen too.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! Engaging more socially can indeed contribute to a more positive mood and reduced anxiety. Over time, these experiences can significantly enhance your confidence. 

User: I really hope so! I’m looking forward to seeing how it goes.

Consultant: I'm excited to hear about your progress in our next session. Remember to celebrate your small victories along the way! Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?

User: I think that covers it for now. I feel more motivated and ready to take on these challenges.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Li! You've made great strides, and it’s important to recognize that. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember, you have the tools to make positive connections.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you back for our session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting, especially regarding your studies and interactions with classmates?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling more confident lately. I’ve been able to manage my attention better while studying, and I even got some help from a classmate on a recent assignment.

Consultant: That sounds fantastic! It's great to hear that you're feeling more confident and getting support from your classmate. How has this change impacted your study habits and your feelings about school?

User: It feels like I can focus for longer, and I'm not as overwhelmed as I used to be. I think having someone there to help has made a real difference.

Consultant: It sounds like building that connection is beneficial for your focus and emotional state. How do you envision continuing this positive momentum in your studies and friendships?

User: I think I want to keep reaching out to classmates for help and maybe even study together more often. It helps me stay motivated.

Consultant: That's a wonderful strategy! Collaborating with others can definitely enhance your motivation and create a support system. What specific goals do you have in mind for your studies and social interactions going forward?

User: I’d like to aim for improving my grades in the next few exams and perhaps make a couple of close friends along the way.

Consultant: Setting those goals is a great start! Improving your grades and making friends can significantly enhance your high school experience. What steps do you think you can take to achieve these goals?

User: For my studies, I could create a study schedule and stick to it, and I guess I could invite my classmates to join me for study sessions. As for friendships, maybe I could sit with someone new at lunch.

Consultant: Those are excellent steps, Li! A study schedule can help you maintain focus, and reaching out at lunch could open doors for new friendships. What challenges do you anticipate in making these changes?

User: I guess I might feel nervous reaching out to new people or if I struggle with my studies again. 

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel nervous about new interactions or uncertainties in studying. When those feelings come up, how might we reframe those thoughts to help you feel more comfortable?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone is learning and that it's okay to ask for help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reminding yourself that asking for help is a natural part of learning can ease that pressure. Let's think about how to reinforce that mindset. How can you practice this when you feel anxiety creeping in?

User: I could take deep breaths and tell myself it's okay to be a beginner in everything. 

Consultant: That's a great technique! Deep breathing can help calm you, and practicing self-affirmation will support your growth mindset. Would you like to role-play how you might initiate a study session or a conversation with a classmate?

User: Sure! Let’s pretend I’m talking to someone in my class.

Consultant: Fantastic! You can start, and I’ll respond as your classmate. 

User: “Hey! I’m trying to study for the upcoming exam. Would you like to join me? I could really use some help.” 

Consultant: “Sure! That sounds great! I could use some help too. When do you want to study?”

User: I feel like that was pretty easy! 

Consultant: It was! Practicing this kind of conversation can really build your confidence. How do you feel about initiating similar scenarios in real life?

User: I feel more prepared now and less scared about asking for help.

Consultant: That’s excellent! It shows that you're making progress. As we wrap up today, let's revisit your goals. How can you track your progress towards them and make adjustments if needed?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal to reflect on what’s working and what isn’t, both for studying and for my social life.

Consultant: A journal is a wonderful tool! It can help you gain insights into your experiences and keep track of your progress. Before we conclude, is there anything specific you’d like to tackle in our next session?

User: I think I’d like to focus on how my study schedule is working out and any new social interactions I have.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. I look forward to hearing about your progress! Remember, you have the skills to navigate these changes. 

User: Thank you! I feel much more positive about everything now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It's been wonderful to see your growth. Keep believing in yourself, and I look forward to our next session. Take care!

User: Goodbye! I will.
