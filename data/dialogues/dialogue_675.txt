Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. I understand that you've been dealing with some challenges lately. Can you tell me a bit about how you've been feeling?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious since starting university. Everything feels so new and overwhelming. I keep worrying about my speaking issues and how I come across to others. It's exhausting.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure from this new environment, especially with your speaking difficulties and social interactions. What specifically about these situations makes you feel anxious?

User: I just can't help but think everyone's judging me when I stutter. And sometimes, I can't even speak in certain social situations. It makes me feel so alone and scared.

Consultant: I can see how that would be very difficult for you. It must be frustrating to feel so isolated in these moments. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that run through your mind when you start to feel anxious in social situations?

User: Yeah, I often think that people will just laugh at me or that I won't be able to make any friends. It feels like this big weight on my chest.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy. It's understandable to feel that way given your past experiences. Do you think those thoughts reflect the reality of what others might think, or could there be other perspectives?

User: I guess I don't really know. I just assume the worst will happen. It's like a habit now to think negatively about myself.

Consultant: It can be tough to break those habits of negative thinking. Let's try to examine one of those thoughts more closely. You mentioned worrying that people will laugh at you. What evidence do you have that supports that thought?

User: Well, I remember being teased when I was younger, and it still feels like that could happen again.

Consultant: I understand that past experiences can haunt us. However, can we think about times when people supported you or didn't react negatively? Is there evidence against your worst fears?

User: I suppose there have been instances when people were kind. But those memories feel so distant compared to the others.

Consultant: It's normal to focus more on the negative experiences. Perhaps we can work to create a more balanced view. If a friend were in your position, what advice would you give them about their worries?

User: I would probably tell them not to worry too much and that people can be nice. I’d encourage them to try talking to others.

Consultant: That's a compassionate viewpoint. Let's try to apply that to your situation. If you were to approach social interactions as you would advise a friend, what would that look like for you?

User: I guess I would try to remind myself that not everyone is judging me and that it’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: That's a great step! Accepting that making mistakes is part of being human can relieve some pressure. What small action could you take this week to practice that mindset in a social situation?

User: Maybe I could join a study group. That feels manageable for me, and I could focus on the task instead of just talking.

Consultant: Joining a study group sounds like a wonderful idea! You’ll be involved in a common goal, which can help ease the pressure of socializing. How do you feel about that plan?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also hopeful. It could be a good way to meet people without too much pressure.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about stepping into new situations! Remember, even small interactions can help with building connections. How might you prepare for that first meeting?

User: I could think of a few topics to discuss in advance, so I’m not caught off guard. That might help me feel more confident.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Preparing some topics can definitely help ease anxiety. As we move forward in our sessions, what other aspects of your experience would you want to explore further?

User: I think I need help with my confidence, especially when I feel overwhelmed in social settings.

Consultant: Building your confidence is a key aspect of our work together. We can look into strategies that help boost your self-esteem and make you feel more at ease. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I want to feel stronger and less afraid of what others think.

Consultant: That's a powerful goal. Remember, it's a journey, and taking it one step at a time is perfectly okay. In our next sessions, we'll work on some techniques for that. Is there anything else you need to discuss today?

User: I think I’ve shared a lot already. I just want to feel better about myself and not be so scared all the time. 

Consultant: Absolutely, and it's great that you recognize this desire. We’ll continue to work on this together. Before we finish today, what is one takeaway you would like to remember from our conversation?

User: I want to remember that it’s okay to make mistakes and that others might be more understanding than I think.

Consultant: That's a wonderful takeaway! Remember, you’re not alone in this, and progress takes time. I'm looking forward to our next session. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling pretty lonely and anxious. It’s hard to communicate with my roommates. I feel isolated and avoid social activities altogether.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds really tough to navigate those feelings. Let's talk more about what’s been going on with your roommates. Can you share a specific situation that made you feel particularly anxious?

User: Well, just the other day, I wanted to join them for a movie, but I couldn't find the right words to express my interest. So, I just stayed in my room. I felt embarrassed and frustrated.

Consultant: I understand that it must be frustrating when you want to connect but feel blocked in expressing yourself. How did that situation make you feel afterward?

User: I just felt worse—like I'm not meant to be part of their group. It's like I'm stuck in my own bubble, and it really hurts to feel that way.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel hurt in such situations. Your desire to connect with others is valid. Let’s explore what thoughts come to mind in those moments when you’re in those social settings. What do you think when you hesitate to join in?

User: I often think that they wouldn't want me there or that I would embarrass myself if I speak up. Sometimes, I even doubt my speaking abilities. 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite heavy to carry. It seems like they're contributing to your anxiety. Let's challenge those thoughts a bit—how accurate do you think those beliefs are? Do you have any evidence that your roommates wouldn’t want you around?

User: I guess there’s no real evidence. They invited me, after all. But I still can’t shake the feeling.

Consultant: That's a good point. It’s important to remember that just because those feelings are strong doesn’t mean they reflect reality. If a friend was in your position, what might you advise them?

User: I would probably tell them to go for it and that their friends would be happy to have them join. 

Consultant: Exactly! You would encourage them because you recognize their value. You deserve that same encouragement. Would you be open to setting small goals to help ease into those situations? 

User: I think I could try that. Maybe I could aim to say just one thing when I'm with them or even join them for something simple first.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Starting small can help reduce that pressure. What’s one small step you’d like to take before our next session?

User: I could try to ask them about their favorite movies when we’re all hanging out. It seems manageable.

Consultant: That’s an excellent choice! Initiating that conversation could help build your confidence gradually. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel a little nervous, but also hopeful, like I might actually manage to do it.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! Feeling nervous is completely normal. Just remember that it’s a step forward. What thoughts are you experiencing about that nervousness?

User: I guess I'm wondering if I will still struggle to get words out. But I’m also trying to convince myself it’s okay to be nervous.

Consultant: It’s completely okay to be nervous. It shows that you care about the interaction! Remember, it’s all about practice. Every time you engage, even if it’s challenging, you’re building your skills. Would it help to remind yourself that it’s a learning experience?

User: Yeah, I think that would help. I just need to keep reminding myself that it's okay to mess up sometimes.

Consultant: Absolutely! Everyone makes mistakes, and often people don’t even notice them like we do. Let’s also think about how we can reframing your view of those mistakes. What if instead, you see them as opportunities to learn?

User: That makes sense. Viewing it that way might take off some pressure. 

Consultant: Exactly! And how would that change your approach to future situations if you perceived them as opportunities for growth instead of potential failures?

User: I think I would be more willing to try and not focus too much on being perfect. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! And remember, every interaction is a step toward building your confidence. How do you envision your interactions looking once you put this into practice?

User: I imagine that if I keep practicing, I might eventually feel like I belong. It’s a nice thought.

Consultant: That’s a powerful vision! Envisioning a positive outcome can help motivate you to take those steps. As you practice, I’m here to support you through the challenges. 

User: Thank you. I really appreciate that. I feel a bit more confident about reaching out now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, progress may take time, and every effort counts. Before we wrap up today’s session, what will be your biggest takeaway?

User: That it’s okay to be nervous, and that I can take small steps to improve my interactions. 

Consultant: That’s a great takeaway! I'm excited to hear how it goes next time. You’ve taken an important step today by being here. If you need support or guidance before our next meeting, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: I will. Thank you for your help today. It really means a lot.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to our next session. Take care of yourself!

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. I want to start by checking in on how you’ve been feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling pretty anxious, especially after failing to join a club I wanted to be a part of. I was really excited at first, but when I had to speak up, I just couldn’t do it. Now, I'm feeling even more uncertain about my social skills.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of pressure and anxiety around social situations right now. Can you tell me more about what you felt during that moment when you were supposed to speak up?

User: I felt my heart racing and I just froze. It was like everyone was watching me, and I thought they would judge me or laugh at me like they did back in school. I didn’t want to embarrass myself.

Consultant: I can see why that would be really overwhelming for you, especially given your past experiences. It’s completely understandable to feel anxious in situations where you have to speak up. Let’s explore this further—what kind of thoughts went through your mind just before you decided not to join?

User: I kept thinking, "I can’t do this," and "What if I stutter or mess up?" Those thoughts were so loud that I couldn’t think of anything else. I felt trapped.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem to carry a lot of weight, and it's clear they're impacting how you feel about participating in social activities. Can we try to identify specific beliefs tied to those thoughts? For instance, do you believe that not being perfect will result in negative outcomes?

User: Yes, definitely. I believe if I don't perform perfectly, people will judge me. It’s as if I have to be flawless to be accepted.

Consultant: That belief can be very heavy to carry. Let’s challenge that thinking for a moment. How true do you think it is that others would reject or judge you harshly for not being perfect? Have you seen evidence of that in your own experiences?

User: Not really. Most of my friends are supportive and kind. I guess I blow things out of proportion sometimes.

Consultant: Exactly. It sounds like there’s room to adjust your thinking. What if you considered the possibility that making mistakes is a normal part of learning and growing? How do you think that might change your feelings about social situations?

User: I guess it would make it less scary because I wouldn’t feel as pressured to perform perfectly.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Let's work on some strategies that can help ease that pressure. How about rehearsing what you might say before attending social events? This can help you feel more prepared.

User: That sounds like a good idea. Maybe practicing will make me less anxious.

Consultant: Absolutely! You could also try positive affirmations. For instance, telling yourself, “It’s okay to make mistakes,” or “I’m doing my best, and that’s enough.” How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds helpful. I’ll try to remind myself of that before I go out.

Consultant: Great! Now, let’s also think about small steps you can take to gradually increase your comfort in social situations. What’s a small, manageable goal you can set for yourself this week?

User: Maybe I could try to join a smaller social gathering instead of a big one? Just to ease into it?

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Attending a smaller gathering can create a more manageable environment. What can you do to prepare for that gathering, so you feel ready?

User: I could plan a few conversation starters ahead of time. Just simple things to break the ice.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Having a few topics in mind can make it easier to engage with others. How do you feel about trying this at the next group activity?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but hopeful too. It’s a start.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous, but remember that hope is a positive first step. Let’s discuss ways to reflect on the experience afterward so you can notice what's working for you and what isn’t. How does that sound?

User: Yes, I could write down my thoughts after the gathering to see how I felt and what I could improve on.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent strategy. Reviewing your experiences will help you identify progress and areas to focus on. Remember, it’s about small victories. We’ll continue to build from there. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel a bit relieved, like I have a plan now. It’s nice to talk about these things.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’re taking meaningful steps, and it’s okay to take your time. Before our next session, keep practicing those techniques we’ve discussed. How do you feel looking towards our next meeting?

User: I’m looking forward to it, but I am also a little anxious about whether I'll be able to do what I said I would.

Consultant: That’s understandable, but remember that progress isn’t always linear. Every attempt you make counts, regardless of the outcome. We can talk about what you experienced next time. Until then, feel free to remind yourself that you are capable of facing these challenges.

User: Thank you, I’ll try to keep that in mind. I really appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to our next session. Take care and be kind to yourself in the meantime!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, not very well. I still feel really anxious, especially thinking about classroom presentations. I avoided several opportunities to speak out loud, and it just adds to my stress.

Consultant: I understand how tough that must be for you. Avoiding those situations can create a cycle of anxiety. What do you think makes you feel most anxious when you think about presenting in class?

User: I think it's the fear of being judged or laughed at again. It feels like everyone is watching, waiting for me to mess up. That moment in class where I couldn't speak just made it worse.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It’s understandable to feel that way given your past experiences. Could you tell me a bit more about what goes through your mind in those moments of anxiety?

User: In those moments, I often think things like "What if I embarrass myself?" or "Everyone will see that I’m struggling." These thoughts make me want to run away.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite overwhelming. It appears as though you’re experiencing something called cognitive distortion, where your mind jumps to the worst possible outcome. How do you feel when these thoughts come up?

User: I feel a heavy weight on my chest and my heart races. I just want to escape. I also worry about disappointing my grandparents since they care about my education.

Consultant: It seems like there's a lot of pressure coming from various places, and that’s completely valid. Let’s take a moment to challenge some of those distressing thoughts. How likely do you think it is that something truly embarrassing would happen during a presentation?

User: I guess the chances aren’t very high, but it just feels real in the moment. It’s like my brain tricks me into thinking something bad will happen.

Consultant: Exactly, your brain is responding based on fear and past experiences rather than the actual situation. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about the likelihood of embarrassment during a presentation?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s not the end of the world and that everyone has off days. They shouldn’t be so hard on themselves.

Consultant: That's a wise perspective! Let’s see if we can apply that understanding to your own feelings. What alternative thoughts could you adopt when you start to feel that anxiety about presenting?

User: Maybe I could think, “It’s okay to be nervous; I can still do my best,” or “People are more supportive than I think.” 

Consultant: Those sound like positive and empowering alternatives! To help you better manage these feelings, would you be open to practicing some relaxation techniques together, such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I’ve heard about deep breathing but never really practiced it.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start with deep breathing then. Find a comfortable position, and we’ll try inhaling deeply through your nose for a count of four, holding for four, and then exhaling through your mouth for a count of four. Ready to try?

User: Sure, I’m ready.

Consultant: Let’s do it together. Inhale... 1, 2, 3, 4... hold... 1, 2, 3, 4... and exhale... 1, 2, 3, 4. How does that feel?

User: It feels calming actually. I can feel my heart rate slowing down a bit.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! Practicing this regularly can help you in those anxious moments. Let’s also think about some small steps you could take to gradually expose yourself to public speaking situations without feeling overwhelmed. What could be a first step for you?

User: Maybe I could practice speaking in front of a mirror or record myself talking about something I’m passionate about.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Start small and build your confidence. How do you feel about committing to this practice before our next session?

User: I think I can manage that. It feels less intimidating than speaking in front of a group right away.

Consultant: Perfect! It’s all about progressing at a comfortable pace. As we wrap up, let’s reflect on what you've learned today and how it can help you. What stands out to you?

User: Well, I’ve realized that my thoughts can be so exaggerated. I also feel like I have some tools now to manage my anxiety, which is reassuring.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic insight! Remember, recognizing those thoughts is a big step. How do you plan to maintain this progress moving forward?

User: I’ll try to practice deep breathing and focus on my alternative thoughts. And I’ll commit to practicing in front of the mirror. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan. You’ve made impressive strides today! I believe you can continue to build your confidence. Remember, if you need support, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help and understanding.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to our next session. Take care and keep practicing those techniques.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've felt a bit better, actually. I completed my first classroom presentation successfully, and while I was a bit nervous, I managed to speak without too much trouble. It was a small achievement, but it meant a lot to me.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It sounds like that experience gave you a bit of a confidence boost. What did that achievement mean for you in terms of facing future situations?

User: It made me feel like maybe I can handle these situations. But I still worry about how I’ll perform next time. I guess I just want to keep improving and not slip back into my old habits.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to have those worries. You've taken a significant step forward, and it's natural to want to maintain that progress. Can you tell me what specific aspects of public speaking or expressing yourself you feel you still need to work on?

User: I often feel nervous when I talk in front of others. I think about my stutter and how people might react. Sometimes, I just freeze, and it’s really frustrating. I want to be able to speak freely without worrying so much.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds really challenging to manage those feelings of anxiety and the fear of judgment. Let’s explore some of those thoughts together. When you find yourself starting to feel anxious about speaking, what kind of thoughts cross your mind?

User: I often think, "What if I stutter?" or "What if they laugh at me?" Those thoughts make me freeze up even more.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It seems like those thoughts are quite intense for you. What kind of feelings do those thoughts bring up when they occur?

User: They make me feel really anxious and defeated. It’s like I can’t breathe properly, and all my confidence just disappears.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly tough. It's no wonder that you're struggling to express yourself when those thoughts arise. Can we look at whether there might be other perspectives or ways to challenge those thoughts? For example, what if instead of thinking, "What if they laugh?" you thought, "What if they support me?"?

User: I guess I never really thought of it that way. It’s hard to imagine them being supportive when I’m focused on my fear.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s common to fixate on fears, especially when anxiety is involved. But acknowledging the possibility of positive support can help. Can we try a little exercise? The next time you feel that anxiety creeping in, could you challenge yourself to replace a fear-based thought with a supportive one?

User: I can try that. It sounds like it could help. I just have to remember to do it in the moment.

Consultant: Absolutely, practice is key. Would it also help to think of small, achievable goals for your next speaking opportunity? Like setting a goal to express one idea confidently?

User: Yes, that sounds manageable. It would be good to focus on something specific rather than the overall pressure to perform.

Consultant: Great! Let’s make that a plan. Setting those smaller goals can make progress feel more attainable and less overwhelming. What other opportunities do you think you could practice your speaking in the coming weeks?

User: There’s a group project coming up, and maybe I could take the lead on presenting our findings. That would be a good chance to practice.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent opportunity! It’s exciting to have a chance to apply what you’ve been working on. Remember, it's about your progress, not perfection. How do you feel about that plan?

User: I feel a little nervous but also excited! It’s nice to have a goal to work towards. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful response; feeling nervous is normal, especially when stepping out of your comfort zone. Just remind yourself of the small wins. What do you think you can do to help calm your nerves before the presentation?

User: Maybe I can practice a few times beforehand or do some deep breathing exercises. That might help me feel more confident.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent strategies. Practicing can help solidify your confidence, and deep breathing is a great way to manage anxiety. Can we also discuss how you could reward yourself after the presentation, regardless of the outcome?

User: I think treating myself to something nice or maybe a fun outing with friends would be great. 

Consultant: I love that idea! Positive reinforcement can really help in keeping you motivated. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed. Can you share what you feel like your biggest takeaways are?

User: I think my main takeaway is that I can challenge negative thoughts and set smaller, achievable goals for speaking. 

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve made great progress in recognizing how to manage those feelings. Also, acknowledging that connection with others can be beneficial. As we move forward, how are you feeling about your ability to navigate these speaking situations?

User: I feel more hopeful now, knowing I have strategies and support. I’m looking forward to practicing them.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You’ve truly made significant strides, and I believe you’ll continue to grow. Remember, I’m here whenever you need support, and I can’t wait to hear how your next presentation goes.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help and guidance. I feel more prepared to take on this challenge now.

Consultant: You’re most welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Just keep in mind how far you’ve come and keep challenging yourself. Until next time, take care!
###################
Consultant: Hi there! It's great to see you again. Today, I’d like to reflect on your journey so far and discuss your future goals. How do you feel about your recent progress?

User: Hi! I feel really proud of myself. Participating in the speech competition was a big deal for me, even though I didn’t win. I was able to speak in front of everyone, and it felt like a significant step forward.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Recognizing your achievements is important, especially when they require courage. What emotions did you experience during the competition?

User: I was definitely nervous at first, but as I started talking, I felt more connected with the audience. It was exhilarating, even if I stumbled a bit. 

Consultant: It sounds like you experienced a blend of anxiety and excitement. That connection with the audience seems to have changed the way you perceive public speaking. Can you tell me how that feels compared to your previous experiences?

User: It’s completely different. Usually, I feel overwhelmed and worried about being judged, but this time, I felt supported. It makes me want to try more.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift in perspective! Feeling supported can really help ease anxiety. What do you think contributed to this new feeling of connection?

User: I think it’s the practice I’ve been doing during our sessions. You helped me see that I could express myself without fear of judgment. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that our sessions have helped! Let’s take a moment to reflect on what specific skills or strategies you found most helpful in overcoming your fears.

User: I remember practicing my speech and visualizing a supportive audience. Focusing on the message rather than my nerves really helped.

Consultant: Those visualization techniques are powerful tools. You’ve gained the ability to refocus your thoughts. How do you think you can apply this strategy in future situations?

User: I guess I could visualize my classmates encouraging me or just focus on the content more than my anxiety.

Consultant: Exactly! And as you continue to practice this, it might help solidify your confidence. What are your thoughts on your next steps for practicing this new approach?

User: I’d like to set some small speaking goals, maybe participate in more group discussions or presentations in class.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Setting small, achievable goals can really help maintain your progress. How do you feel about facing those opportunities?

User: I’m feeling more optimistic! It still scares me a bit, but I think I can handle it now. 

Consultant: That’s a brave mindset to have! Remember, each time you step out of your comfort zone, you’re reinforcing your growth. Is there anything specific you want to focus on to prepare for those opportunities?

User: Maybe I could work on managing my anxiety in the moment, like practicing breathing techniques when I start to feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Great idea! Practicing those techniques can help ground you when anxiety strikes. Let's also think about how to keep track of your progress. What do you think would help you see your improvements?

User: I could keep a journal to note my experiences and feelings after each speaking situation. That way, I can reflect on my progress.

Consultant: A journal is an excellent idea! Reflecting on your experiences will help you recognize how far you’ve come. How do you feel about writing in it after each speaking engagement?

User: I think it will be helpful. It’ll give me a chance to process everything and celebrate the small wins.

Consultant: Absolutely! Celebrating those wins is essential. As we wrap up, let’s summarize what you've achieved and your plans moving forward. How do you feel about the tools and skills you've developed?

User: I feel empowered. I’ve learned to focus on what I want to say, not on my fears. And I know I have strategies to help when I feel anxious.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! It sounds like you’ve made tremendous strides. As we conclude, how will you remind yourself of these skills to prevent any setbacks in the future?

User: I’ll keep reminding myself of these moments and my progress. I’ll also refer to my journal regularly.

Consultant: Great plan! I believe you have the tools you need to maintain this progress. Thank you for sharing your journey with me today. Feel free to reach out if you ever need support in the future. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help and guidance. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad to have been part of your journey. Take care!
