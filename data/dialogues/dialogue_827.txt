Consultant: Hi Xiaoqi, welcome back to our session! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. Honestly, I'm still feeling really anxious about school. Everything just seems overwhelming, especially with the tension I have with my roommate. I don’t really want to go back.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like the situation with your roommate is making your school experience really difficult. Can you tell me more about what's been happening between you two?

User: Well, she often ignores the rules we agreed on for the dorm, and it's frustrating. I feel like I have to do everything myself. I just want things to be smoother, but it seems impossible.

Consultant: That does sound frustrating, especially when you’re trying to create a peaceful environment. How has this affected your feelings towards school itself?

User: I just feel detached from school. I was always good at my studies, but now I don’t want to go, and I can't focus on my work at all. It’s like I’m stuck in a loop of negativity.

Consultant: It sounds like you're in a tough spot. You mentioned feeling stuck in negativity. What specific thoughts cross your mind when you think about your school life or your roommate?

User: I keep thinking that no one understands how I feel and that things won’t change. I feel like I’m a burden to my family if I talk about it, and that makes it worse.

Consultant: That feeling of being a burden can be really heavy. It seems like you’re currently believing that your feelings won’t change and that you’re alone in this. Let’s explore those thoughts further. What evidence do you have that your situation cannot improve?

User: I guess nothing really. It just feels that way because I’ve tried talking to her, but it didn’t help. I just assumed that it would stay this way forever.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel stuck when efforts to improve a situation don’t seem to work. If a friend were in your shoes, what advice might you give them about this situation?

User: I would probably tell them to keep trying and not give up. But I find it hard to follow my own advice.

Consultant: It's tough to practice what we preach. Let's try to consider, what small steps could you take that might lead to a better interaction with your roommate? 

User: Maybe I could try talking to her again, but maybe in a different way? Like approaching her casually instead of directly addressing the issues.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach! Casual conversations might open doors for better communication without it feeling too confrontational. How would you feel about trying that?

User: I think it might help, but I’m still nervous. I'm afraid she won't be receptive, and then I’ll have to deal with more conflict.

Consultant: Your nerves are totally valid, especially given your past experiences. We could frame it as an opportunity for a better relationship rather than something to fear. What might it feel like to go into this conversation with an open mind?

User: I guess it would feel good if it worked out. I really just want a peaceful resolution.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset. Focusing on that possibility can help ease some of the anxiety. What are some other positive outcomes you could imagine if you initiate that conversation?

User: If it goes well, maybe we could actually enjoy our time in the dorm and support each other with schoolwork. That would be nice.

Consultant: Absolutely! Supporting each other could significantly improve your experience. Let’s also think about how you can reinforce your confidence going into that conversation. What might help you feel more assured?

User: I could remind myself that I have the right to express how I feel and that it’s okay to seek a better living situation. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful reminder. Positive self-talk before the conversation could make a difference. How can we practice that self-talk together right now?

User: I can say something like, “I deserve to feel comfortable in my space, and it's okay to ask for that.” 

Consultant: Exactly! That affirmation could serve as a helpful mantra for you. How does practicing that feel right now?

User: It feels empowering, actually. I haven’t thought of it that way before.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiaoqi! Empowering thoughts can gradually shift your emotions and behaviors. As we wrap up, what are the next steps you feel motivated to take before our next session?

User: I’ll try to approach my roommate casually and practice that positive self-talk. If it gets too overwhelming, I can reach out regarding how to handle it.

Consultant: Those sound like solid steps forward. Remember, it’s perfectly okay to take your time. I believe in your ability to navigate this. We’ll explore how it went in our next session. Don’t hesitate to jot down any thoughts or feelings that come up. 

User: I will! Thank you for your support.

Consultant: You're welcome, Xiaoqi. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Qiqi! I'm glad you're back for another session. Last time, you mentioned trying to communicate with your roommates. How did that go for you?

User: Hi. Well, it didn't really work out as I hoped. I feel even more uncertain about my social skills now. I tried to talk to them, but it felt awkward, and they didn’t really respond well. 

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like that experience was frustrating for you. You hoped it would strengthen your relationships, but instead, it has made you doubt your abilities. What specific thoughts went through your mind during that conversation?

User: I kept thinking that maybe I'm just not good at making friends, and I worried they wouldn’t like me. It made me feel really anxious and helpless.

Consultant: It’s quite common to worry about being accepted in social situations, especially with roommates. Those thoughts of not being good at making friends can feel very heavy. Can you identify how those thoughts affected your feelings during and after the conversation?

User: I felt really anxious during the conversation, like my heart was racing. Afterward, I felt kind of embarrassed and more alone, like I was a failure.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Qiqi. It’s understandable to feel embarrassed when things don't go as planned. Let’s explore that thought of being a "failure." What evidence do you have that supports this idea? 

User: I guess I don't have solid evidence, but I just feel like I keep messing up. I see others getting along well, and it makes me doubt myself.

Consultant: It’s tough when you compare yourself to others. Do you think it would help to consider what you would say to a friend who felt this way about their social skills? 

User: If it were a friend, I would probably tell them that everyone struggles sometimes and that it doesn’t define who they are. But it’s so hard to believe that for myself.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective to hold for a friend, and it’s great that you can see that! Let's practice applying that same kindness to yourself. Can you think of some strategies or steps you could take to improve your communication, focusing on small, achievable goals? 

User: Maybe I could start with small talk, like asking about their day or something simple?

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Small talk can be a great way to connect with others. How about we role-play that scenario? I can be your roommate, and you can practice starting that conversation.

User: Okay, let's try that. 

Consultant: Great! So, I’m your roommate, and I'm just sitting there. Go ahead and start!

User: Um, hey! How was your day?

Consultant: Oh, hi, Qiqi! My day was pretty good, thanks for asking! I had a math test and got a good grade. How about you?

User: That’s great! I... had a pretty normal day, just studying. 

Consultant: Nice to hear! It seems like you’re doing well with this. How do you feel trying this out?

User: A little nervous but not too bad. I think I can do it.

Consultant: That's the spirit! Remember, it's all about practice. Trying out these small interactions can help build your confidence over time. Would you like to set a goal for how often you want to practice this with your roommates?

User: Maybe I can try it a couple of times this week and see how it goes?

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! And remember, it's okay if it doesn’t go perfectly — each attempt is progress. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel a bit hopeful. It feels nice to have a plan instead of just feeling stuck.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It's a step in the right direction. Now, let's explore any thoughts that might come up if things don’t go as expected. How can we reframe those negative thoughts?

User: I guess if they don't respond well, I could remind myself that it's just one attempt and not a reflection of my worth.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about learning and growing. How can you remind yourself of this in the moment?

User: Maybe I could write it down and keep it with me, so I can look at it if I feel upset.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Having a reminder can help you stay grounded. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about your progress in managing these concerns?

User: I feel a bit more confident and less anxious. It's good to have practical things to try.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Qiqi! Remember, the goal is to keep building on these small steps. If you ever feel overwhelmed, know that you can always come back to talk. How would you like to reflect on today’s session in the future?

User: I think I’ll remember that it's okay to feel anxious, and that I can improve with practice. 

Consultant: I love that insight! You've made great progress today. Remember to be kind to yourself along the way. I look forward to hearing about how your practice goes in our next session!

User: Thank you! I’m excited to try it out. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care until we meet again.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Qi! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty overwhelmed. I’ve been trying to focus more on my studies, but it’s just so hard. The pressure is really getting to me.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like the pressure from school is weighing heavily on you. Can you tell me more about what specifically feels overwhelming right now?

User: It’s mainly the exams coming up. I want to do well, but I can’t seem to get myself to study. I just feel paralyzed sometimes.

Consultant: That sounds challenging. Feeling paralyzed can make it really hard to get started. What kind of thoughts come to your mind when you think about studying?

User: I often think that no matter how much I study, it might not be enough. I end up feeling like a failure before I've even tried.

Consultant: That thought sounds quite heavy. What emotions do you experience when you have those thoughts about studying and feeling like a failure?

User: It makes me feel anxious and even a bit hopeless. I start thinking, "What’s the point?"

Consultant: I understand how those thoughts can create such strong feelings of anxiety and hopelessness. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit. Do you think there could be any different perspectives on your study efforts?

User: I guess I sometimes wonder if I’m setting my expectations too high, but it's hard to let go of that desire to be perfect.

Consultant: It’s understandable to strive for perfection, especially when you care about your performance. What do you think would happen if you allowed yourself to have more flexible expectations?

User: I think I would probably feel less stressed, but I’m also scared that I would then not try my best.

Consultant: That's a common concern. Balancing effort with acceptance can be tricky. What if we tried to reframe the way you think about your effort? Instead of focusing solely on perfection, we might emphasize progress and learning.

User: That makes sense. I can see how focusing on improving could take some pressure off.

Consultant: Exactly! Let’s try to identify one specific study goal that focuses on progress rather than perfection. What’s one area you’d like to improve in your studying?

User: I think I need to improve my time management. I often sit down to study but then spend an hour scrolling on my phone instead.

Consultant: It's a great insight to identify time management as an area to work on. How about we brainstorm some concrete steps you can take to create a better study routine?

User: I like that idea. Maybe I could set a timer to study for 25 minutes and then take a break?

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Using a timer can help create a balanced approach to studying, allowing for focused work and breaks. How do you feel about implementing that?

User: I think I can try it. It sounds manageable.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As you start using the timer, what thoughts or feelings might you notice while studying?

User: I guess I'll feel more in control of my time, but I might still have moments of doubt if it’s enough.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to have doubts. When those thoughts come up, let’s try to remind yourself that it's okay to make progress rather than aiming for perfection. How does that sound?

User: I’ll try to remind myself that. It’s definitely a different way to think.

Consultant: That's a great step forward! Would you like to discuss any strategies for when those doubtful thoughts arise?

User: Maybe if I can write down some positive affirmations to remind myself that I’m doing my best.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Writing down affirmations can help reinforce a more positive mindset. What might be a few affirmations that resonate with you?

User: How about “I am capable of improving” and “I can learn from my mistakes”?

Consultant: Those are empowering affirmations! Keeping those in mind can support your journey as you navigate through your studies. How do you feel about integrating those into your routine?

User: I feel good about that! Maybe writing them down and placing them on my study desk could help.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Visual reminders can be very effective. Before our session ends, do you have any thoughts on how you would like to measure your progress?

User: I could keep track of my study time and see if I’m improving my focus over the next week.

Consultant: That’s a great way to see tangible progress! Looking back next time, we can review how things went and adjust your strategies as needed. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds motivating! I’m looking forward to seeing if I can make these changes.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiao Qi! It sounds like you’re gaining a bit of hope and determination. Remember, it’s okay to take this one step at a time. If doubts arise, you now have strategies to challenge them.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I feel a bit more hopeful about managing my studies now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It's been great talking today. Remember that progress takes time and patience. I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time we meet. Take care, Xiao Qi!

User: Thanks! I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're here today, Xiao Qi. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying out some of the new study methods, but I feel like I'm not making much progress. Sometimes I just feel so frustrated with myself.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're putting in effort but not seeing the results you hope for, and that’s understandably frustrating. Can you tell me more about the study methods you've been trying?

User: I've been using a planner to organize my tasks and setting small goals, but it feels overwhelming. I thought it would help, but I still can't focus.

Consultant: It’s great that you're trying to use a planner and set goals. However, feeling overwhelmed can be a big challenge. What specific part of the process feels most overwhelming or unmanageable for you?

User: I think it's the amount of tasks. I look at my planner and see too many things to do, and that makes me anxious. I end up not wanting to start at all.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. When you see a lot of tasks, it can create pressure. Let's explore this a bit. Can you think of a time when you managed to tackle tasks successfully? What did that look like for you?

User: Once, I had a big assignment, and I broke it down into smaller steps. That helped a little, but I'm struggling to do that now.

Consultant: That’s a valuable strategy you’ve used before! Breaking tasks into smaller steps can really help manage feelings of overwhelm. Let’s think together—what if you started with just one small step today? What could that be?

User: Maybe I could just outline my next project instead of trying to get the whole thing done?

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect start! Outlining the project allows you to take action without the pressure of completing it all at once. How does that idea make you feel?

User: It feels a bit better! Just focusing on the outline seems less scary than the whole project.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Reducing the scope can really shift how we view the task. Once you outline, how about celebrating that small win? What kind of reward could you give yourself?

User: I like that idea! Maybe I could take a break and watch an episode of my favorite show afterward.

Consultant: That sounds like a fun way to reward yourself! It’s important to recognize your hard work, no matter how small. Tell me, how do you feel about setting a goal for outlining by our next session?

User: I think I could do that! I’ll aim to have the outline done for our next session.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal, Xiao Qi. Committing to that gives you something to work towards. How do you envision staying motivated while you work on this outline?

User: I could remind myself that it's just an outline and not the final project. And I can think about how nice it will be to enjoy my show afterward!

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Keeping the end reward in mind can be a strong motivator. How are you feeling about the new methods you're trying overall? Any doubts you want to talk through?

User: I still feel a bit unsure if these methods will really work for me in the long run. Sometimes I think what if I end up back where I started.

Consultant: It’s normal to have those doubts, especially when trying something new. Let's challenge that thought—what evidence do you have that this method could fail? Have there been small successes that suggest otherwise?

User: I guess I did manage to work on the last project with some of the new techniques. I just need to trust the process more.

Consultant: Exactly! You've already seen some success. Trusting the process can be challenging, but focusing on those moments of achievement can help strengthen your confidence. What do you think would help reinforce that trust in the process?

User: Maybe I could reflect on my progress weekly. Writing down what worked and what didn’t might help me see improvements.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea, Xiao Qi! Reflecting can provide clarity and help you appreciate your progress, and it can also reveal patterns to adjust your methods. How are you feeling about our conversation today?

User: I feel a lot lighter! I think having a plan makes me less anxious.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’ve set some achievable goals, and it's wonderful to see your mood lightening. Let’s keep building on this progress. For our next session, let’s discuss how the outline went and reflect on your progress.

User: I really appreciate that! It helps to have a plan to follow.

Consultant: You’re doing great, Xiao Qi. Remember, every small step counts. Stay positive, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoqi! I'm glad you're here today. It sounds like you've been making progress and feeling more stable in your emotions. Can you tell me about your recent experiences with school and learning?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling better overall. I discovered some new interests in learning, and it's like a light bulb went off. But I still find myself struggling to adapt sometimes, especially with the new learning methods.

Consultant: That's great to hear that you've found new interests! It's completely normal to struggle a bit when adjusting to new methods. What kind of new interests have you discovered, and how do they make you feel?

User: I've started to enjoy art and history more. When I paint or explore historical events, I feel much more engaged and less stressed about my other subjects.

Consultant: Engaging with art and history sounds wonderful! It's amazing how these subjects can provide a creative outlet and reduce stress. Do you think incorporating more of these activities into your daily routine could help with your overall adaptation to school?

User: Yes, I think so! But I'm also worried about keeping up with my other subjects while exploring these new interests. I don't want to fall behind.

Consultant: That's a valid concern, Xiaoqi. Balancing new interests with your existing studies can be challenging. Let's explore how we can create a schedule that allows you to enjoy those interests while still keeping up with your academic responsibilities. What does your current study schedule look like?

User: I usually study for long hours in the evening, but I feel exhausted by then. I think I could use some breaks to do something enjoyable, like painting.

Consultant: It sounds like incorporating breaks for painting or exploring history could be a refreshing way to recharge your mind during your study sessions. How about we brainstorm a plan where you set specific times for these activities alongside your studies?

User: That sounds helpful! Maybe I could study for an hour, then take a break to paint for half an hour before getting back to studying.

Consultant: That's a great idea! That way, you'll have structured study time followed by enjoyable activities. How do you feel about this plan? Does it feel manageable for you?

User: Yes, it feels manageable, and I'm excited to try it out! I think it will help relieve some pressure.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Xiaoqi! Feeling excited about a plan can increase your motivation. Also, as you try this new routine, pay attention to how it affects your mood and focus. We can check in on that during our next session. Would you like to discuss anything else today?

User: I'm curious about how to stay motivated even when I hit a bump in the road. What if I start feeling overwhelmed again?

Consultant: That's an important question. When challenges arise, it's essential to have strategies ready to help you cope. One idea is to remind yourself of your achievements and the enjoyment you find in your new interests. What are some past accomplishments that have made you proud?

User: I did well in my last art project, and my history presentation was also well-received. Those moments give me a boost.

Consultant: Those are wonderful accomplishments to reflect on! Keeping reminders of your successes can motivate you during tougher times. We can also develop coping strategies together next time you start to feel overwhelmed. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I’d love to have some tools ready for those moments.

Consultant: Perfect! We’ll work on those strategies together. Remember, it’s a process, and it’s okay to seek support whenever you need it. What other thoughts do you have about your journey with school and your interests?

User: I want to remember to be kind to myself during this process. It’s easy to feel discouraged sometimes.

Consultant: Absolutely, self-compassion is key. Being kind to yourself can make a big difference in how you navigate challenges. How do you think you can practice self-kindness when things get tough?

User: Maybe I could take time to journal my feelings or talk to someone when I'm feeling low, rather than just bottle it up.

Consultant: That's an excellent plan! Journaling can be a powerful tool for processing your feelings. Talking to someone also helps alleviate the burden. Who do you think you could reach out to when you need support?

User: I have a close friend who is really understanding. I think I could talk to her when I need to.

Consultant: That sounds like a supportive relationship. Having someone to talk to can really help when you're feeling overwhelmed. As we wrap up, how do you feel about the progress you've made today?

User: I feel more confident and motivated to pursue my interests while keeping up with my studies. I'm excited to try this new plan!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiaoqi! Your confidence and excitement are clear indicators of progress. As you implement these strategies, remember the importance of self-compassion along the way. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don't hesitate to reach out for support. I’m proud of the growth you’re showing, and I believe you can keep moving forward!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support and guidance. I feel more equipped to tackle everything now.

Consultant: You’ve done incredibly well today, and I’m here for you whenever you need assistance. Let’s catch up next time and see how your new plan is working out. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey!

User: Thank you so much! I’m looking forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaoqi! I'm glad you're back for our session. Today, I’d like to start by reflecting on your progress since our last meetings. How have you been feeling about your experiences in school?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling much better, actually. I’m more confident in communicating with my classmates and I think my motivation to study has improved too. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made significant strides in both your social interactions and your motivation. Can you share a specific example of when you felt this confidence in your communication?

User: Sure! Last week, I spoke up in class during a group project. I shared my ideas without feeling too anxious, and my classmates responded positively. It felt great!

Consultant: That’s an impressive achievement, Xiaoqi! It’s great to see you taking the initiative. What emotions did you experience during and after speaking up in class?

User: I felt a bit nervous at first, but once I started talking, I felt more relaxed. Afterward, I was really happy and proud of myself.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel nervous initially, but it’s fantastic that you were able to push through that. Let’s explore how these positive experiences can help reinforce your confidence further. What strategies did you use to prepare yourself for that moment?

User: I practiced what I wanted to say before class and reminded myself that it was okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: Practicing ahead of time is a great strategy! Acknowledging that it’s okay to make mistakes also helps reduce pressure. How do you think you can continue to use these strategies in future situations?

User: I could keep practicing before speaking up, and maybe try to remind myself again that everyone makes mistakes. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Continuous practice and self-compassion will serve you well. Now, thinking about your motivation to study, have you noticed any changes there?

User: Yes, I’ve started to create a schedule to manage my study time better. I feel more in control.

Consultant: That’s excellent progress, Xiaoqi! A study schedule can really help in maintaining focus and reducing stress. Have you found this schedule effective? 

User: Yes, I've been sticking to it mostly, and I feel like I’m using my time more wisely. 

Consultant: Great! It’s a positive step towards reinforcing your effective study habits. As you move forward, what do you think could help you maintain this level of motivation and focus?

User: I think having a reward system might help. If I complete certain tasks, I could treat myself to a break or something fun.

Consultant: A reward system can be a powerful motivator! It not only reinforces positive behavior but also makes studying feel more enjoyable. Could you outline what types of rewards you’d like to incorporate?

User: Maybe I could watch an episode of my favorite show or go out with friends after I finish my studying for the day.

Consultant: Those sound like fantastic rewards! They provide a nice balance between work and leisure. Now, let’s also consider your interactions with classmates. Are there particular scenarios where you feel challenging, and how do you think we can address those?

User: Sometimes, I still feel shy when it comes to joining group activities. I worry that I might embarrass myself.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel shy in those situations. Could you share a specific instance when you felt that way? 

User: Last week, I was invited to join a study group, but I hesitated to join because I was afraid I wouldn’t fit in.

Consultant: That’s a common concern. What do you think are some possible outcomes of joining that group, even if things don’t go perfectly?

User: I guess I could learn a lot from my peers or even make new friends. 

Consultant: Those are great insights! Focusing on the potential positives can help mitigate anxiety. How can we develop a small plan for you to gradually engage with group activities?

User: Maybe I could start by joining just one group activity next week. If it doesn’t go well, I won’t pressure myself too much.

Consultant: That’s a very sensible approach. Starting small can greatly ease pressure and build your confidence over time. How does that idea make you feel?

User: It makes me feel more reassured, knowing that I won't have to dive into too many activities at once.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, every small step counts. Looking back on our session today, what do you feel has been your biggest takeaway or achievement?

User: I think I learned how to better manage my feelings and actions regarding studying and communicating. I feel more prepared to face my challenges.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization, Xiaoqi! You've developed valuable skills that can help you navigate future challenges. Now, as we conclude today, let’s discuss how to maintain these strategies. Do you feel equipped to tackle any upcoming challenges with what you've learned?

User: Yes, I do! I feel like I can apply what I've learned to my studies and social interactions.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! You've worked hard to achieve this. If you ever feel the need for more support in the future, remember that I’m here for you. Keep practicing your strategies, and I’m confident you’ll continue to thrive.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaoqi. It has been a pleasure working with you. Best of luck, and remember to celebrate your progress!
