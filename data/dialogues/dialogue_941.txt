Consultant: Hello, Liu. I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been really struggling lately. The breakup with my ex has hit me hard, and I just feel so insignificant and anxious all the time. 

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's understandable to be affected by a breakup, especially when you cared for that person deeply. Can you tell me more about how this breakup has been impacting you?

User: I just feel like I’m not good enough anymore. It’s like I’ve lost my identity. I can’t concentrate on my studies and my sleep has been terrible. 

Consultant: That sounds incredibly tough, Liu. Losing someone close to us can shake our self-esteem and identity. You mentioned struggling with concentration and sleep—how do these issues weigh on you daily?

User: I feel overwhelmed. My mind races at night, and even during the day, I can’t focus on anything. It just feels like I’m stuck in this negative spiral.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Let's take a moment to explore your thoughts when you’re feeling anxious or unable to focus. What kinds of thoughts tend to come up during those moments?

User: I often think I'm a failure. Then, it just spirals into thoughts like, "I’ll never be happy again" or "I’ll always be alone." It feels so heavy.

Consultant: Those thoughts can feel really heavy and overwhelming. It’s important to recognize how these negative thoughts affect your feelings and behaviors. Do you notice if they make your anxiety worse?

User: Yes, definitely. When I think those thoughts, I feel even more anxious and sad. It’s like they just keep feeding into each other.

Consultant: It seems like this cycle of negative thinking is quite strong for you. How do you feel when you reflect on those thoughts? 

User: Honestly, it makes me feel even more hopeless. I wish I could stop thinking like that, but it’s like a default setting for me now.

Consultant: It sounds like you really want to break this cycle. Let's try to challenge those thoughts together. For instance, what evidence do you have that supports these thoughts? Are there any moments or experiences that contradict them?

User: Well, sometimes I do well in class, and my friends are still there for me. But then I just dismiss those moments... 

Consultant: That’s an important recognition! You have evidence that can contradict some of those negative beliefs. If a friend were to say they felt like a failure just because of a breakup, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s not their fault and that they have so much to offer. 

Consultant: Exactly! You are just as worthy as your friends are, and you have strengths too. It’s important to remind yourself of those strengths. What small steps could you take to nurture that belief in yourself?

User: Maybe I could try to focus on my studies more actively and connect with my friends. Just remind myself that I’m not alone.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan, Liu! Engaging with friends and focusing on your studies could help shift your mindset. Have you considered setting small, achievable goals for yourself this week?

User: I could try to set a goal to study for a couple of hours a day and reach out to friends for support. 

Consultant: That’s a great start! Remember, it doesn’t have to be perfect; just taking the step to engage can help. How do you feel about moving forward with this plan?

User: I feel a bit hopeful. I just hope I can stick to it and not fall back into those negative thoughts.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have that concern. How about we also talk about some coping strategies you can use when negative thoughts arise? 

User: Yes, that would be helpful.

Consultant: Great! One technique is to write down your negative thoughts and then corresponding positive thoughts next to them. It helps in seeing a more balanced perspective. Would you be willing to give it a try?

User: I think I could manage that. 

Consultant: Excellent! It’s all about practice, Liu. As we wrap up today’s session, is there anything specific you want to take away from our conversation?

User: I want to remind myself of my value and not get lost in my negative thoughts. 

Consultant: That's a powerful takeaway, Liu. Believe in your worth, just as we've discussed today. Before we finish, how are you feeling about our session and the plan we’ve created together?

User: I feel lighter, and I have a bit more clarity. It’s nice to have a plan to work on.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! Remember, it’s okay to take this process one step at a time. You’re not alone in this journey. Let’s meet again soon to check on your progress. 

User: Yes, I’ll see you next time. Thank you for your help!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Liu. Take care until we meet again!

Consultant: Hello Liu! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been struggling a lot with my feelings of worthlessness and anxiety, especially with the upcoming exams. I still can't get my thoughts straight while studying, and I often feel like giving up.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of pressure. You mentioned feeling inadequate and lacking motivation. What specifically makes you feel this way when you're studying?

User: I keep thinking that if I don’t do well, I’ll disappoint my parents and myself. It feels overwhelming. Sometimes, I just stare at my books and can't concentrate at all.

Consultant: That’s a heavy burden to carry. It’s understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed. Let's explore those thoughts a bit. What are some specific thoughts that run through your mind when you try to study?

User: I often think, “I’m just not good enough” or “I won't do well no matter how hard I try.” It makes me feel defeated right from the start.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem really harsh. It’s crucial to recognize how they impact your mood and motivation. When you have these thoughts, how do they affect your feelings about studying?

User: They make me feel anxious and frustrated. Instead of studying, I sometimes just end up scrolling through my phone. I know I should be studying, but I can’t bring myself to do it.

Consultant: It makes sense that feeling anxious can lead you to avoid studying. Let’s challenge those thoughts a bit. Can you think of any past experiences where you succeeded, despite having doubts?

User: Well, there were times when I got good grades on assignments, but I usually brush those off as luck. I always feel like my success isn’t really mine.

Consultant: It’s common to downplay our achievements, but they are indeed yours. What if we try acknowledging those successes as evidence that you are capable? How might that change how you feel about studying?

User: I guess if I viewed my past successes as proof of my abilities, maybe I wouldn’t feel so hopeless about the exams. It just feels hard to switch my mindset.

Consultant: It can be a challenge, but it’s also a skill you can develop. Let’s practice rephrasing those negative thoughts into more balanced ones. Instead of “I’m not good enough,” how about trying “I have succeeded before, and I can do it again”?

User: That sounds a bit better. But what if I still struggle during the exams?

Consultant: It's okay to feel that way. Exams are stressful for many students. Let’s create a plan to help you manage that anxiety when studying. How do you usually prepare for your exams?

User: I just try to read and memorize everything, but that approach hasn’t been working for me lately.

Consultant: Would you be open to exploring a more structured study plan? Breaking your study tasks into smaller, achievable goals can make it feel less overwhelming.

User: Yeah, that sounds more manageable. I might be able to stick to it better. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s develop a simple study schedule. How many hours a day do you want to dedicate to studying?

User: Maybe about three hours on school days? But I often get distracted.

Consultant: That’s a good start. We can also include short breaks within those three hours to help you stay focused. How about we try a 25-minute study session followed by a 5-minute break?

User: That seems doable. I’ll try it out. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Also, how about incorporating some relaxation techniques before you start studying? It could help calm your mind and increase your focus.

User: I’ve heard of deep breathing exercises. I could try that before studying.

Consultant: Absolutely! Deep breathing can be very effective. Just take a moment to inhale deeply, hold, and then exhale slowly. Practicing this could help you feel more centered.

User: I’ll give that a shot. I really want to feel better about studying.

Consultant: It’s a step in the right direction. Remember to be kind to yourself during this process. How do you feel about the strategies we discussed today?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. The idea of having a plan and acknowledging my achievements sounds helpful.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Let’s continue building on that hope. In our next session, we can discuss how these changes worked for you and any feelings that arise.

User: Thank you. I’m looking forward to trying these out and talking about them next time.

Consultant: You're welcome, Liu! I appreciate your openness today. Keep practicing those strategies, and I look forward to our next session. Remember, you're not alone in this.

User: Thanks! That really means a lot to me. I’ll do my best.

Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I’ve been trying to engage more with my friends and participate in group activities. But sometimes, I still feel a bit lonely and anxious when I try to socialize.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've made some progress in engaging with friends! Those feelings of loneliness and anxiety can still be challenging, especially when you're stepping out of your comfort zone. Can you share a recent experience where you felt anxious in a social situation?

User: Sure. I went to a group study session last week. At first, I was excited to join, but when I got there, I felt really nervous and unsure of myself. I ended up mostly just listening and not contributing much.

Consultant: I can understand how that must have felt. You were excited to join but then anxiety took over. What thoughts were going through your mind when you felt nervous in that situation?

User: I kept thinking that I would say something stupid or that everyone else was going to judge me. It made me want to avoid speaking up.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very self-critical. It seems like you were worried about negative judgment from others. Can we explore how those thoughts made you feel in that moment? 

User: I felt really small and embarrassed. It made me want to leave the room, but I didn’t want to seem rude.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It's like you were caught between wanting to participate and feeling scared. What if we could challenge those thoughts together? Would you be open to that?

User: Yes, I think that could help. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s look at those thoughts about saying something stupid. On a scale from 1 to 10, how much evidence do you feel supports that belief?

User: I’d say it’s maybe a 7 because I have made mistakes in conversations before.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like there have been a few times where things didn't go as planned, but mistakes are a part of learning. What about moments where you've contributed positively in social settings? 

User: I guess there have been times when I shared an idea, and people seemed to appreciate it. I remember during a class discussion, I shared my thoughts and it went well.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful experience to reflect on! It sounds like there was a positive outcome when you shared. How could you use that memory to remind yourself that you can contribute effectively when you feel anxious?

User: Maybe I could think about that time to boost my confidence before I speak up next time.

Consultant: That's a solid strategy! Remembering those positive moments can really help shift your mindset. What about practicing some responses or topics you could bring up in future group settings? 

User: That sounds helpful. I could come prepared with a few points to share, so I feel less pressured to think on the spot.

Consultant: Absolutely! Preparation can ease some of that anxiety. How do you feel about trying this approach in your next group session?

User: I think I’d feel more confident having something ready to say. 

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! We’re building your confidence step by step. Let's also consider your feelings of loneliness. Can you identify a moment recently where you felt connected with others?

User: After I started going to the group study, I felt good when they all invited me for a coffee afterwards. I felt included.

Consultant: That’s a lovely moment! It shows that you’re making connections. How can you remind yourself of this feeling when loneliness creeps in again?

User: I could write it down or maybe even talk to one of my friends about it. 

Consultant: Writing it down is a great idea! It gives you something tangible to revisit. As we move forward, how can we ensure you continue feeling this sense of connection and belonging?

User: I guess I could keep joining those study groups and maybe try to reach out more to my friends outside of those sessions.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive plan! It’s about building those connections and allowing yourself to feel part of those groups. Remember, it’s okay to take small steps. How do you feel about your goals as we wrap up today?

User: I feel good. I’m hopeful about approaching social situations differently and practicing more.

Consultant: That’s wonderful, Liu! Your openness to trying these new strategies is powerful. Let’s keep building on these feelings of hope and connection in our next sessions. Remember that progress takes time, and you're doing great. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad you're feeling hopeful. I'm looking forward to our next session. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again, Liu. I hope you've had a meaningful week. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling a bit better. Participating in the school club has been nice, and I've met some new friends. But there are still moments when I think about my past relationship, and it makes me feel sad.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear you’ve made some new connections! It sounds like the club participation has positively impacted you. When you think about your past relationship, what kinds of thoughts or feelings come up for you?

User: I often feel like I’ve failed in love, and it brings up a lot of sadness. It's hard to shake those thoughts away, especially when I'm alone.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Liu. It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you're reflecting on past experiences. Let’s explore those feelings together. Can you tell me more about the specific thoughts that come to mind when you feel sad about your past relationship?

User: I keep thinking that I’m not good enough or that I’ll never find someone who appreciates me. It's like a loop that keeps playing in my head.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re caught in a cycle of negative thinking about yourself. Let’s try to unpack this a bit. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you’re not good enough? 

User: To be honest, I can’t really think of any. It just feels that way sometimes, especially when I read about other people being in happy relationships.

Consultant: It's insightful that you recognize there isn’t solid evidence for that belief. Have you observed any times recently when you felt appreciated or valued by others, perhaps in your new friendships?

User: Yes, actually! My new friends have been really supportive and fun to be around. I felt valued when they invited me to join their activities and included me in conversations.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It seems that people in your life do appreciate you. Let’s consider how you can strengthen this positive feedback. How can we remind yourself of these positive interactions when you start to feel down?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal to write down those moments when I feel valued or happy. It could help me remember that not all experiences are negative.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent idea! Journaling can be a powerful tool to help shift your focus away from negative thoughts. Would you be willing to commit to writing down at least one positive experience each day for the next week?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. It might help me focus on the good things.

Consultant: Great! Along with journaling, I encourage you to continue engaging with your friends from the club. These communities can provide a lot of support. Do you feel comfortable reaching out to them when you have moments of sadness?

User: I think so. I’ve started to feel more comfortable with them, so reaching out shouldn’t be too hard.

Consultant: That’s a positive step! Building a network of support is crucial. Let’s also think about how to handle those moments when you start feeling inadequate. What strategies can you use to challenge those negative thoughts when they arise?

User: I could remind myself of the good things I've experienced. And maybe I could also talk to one of my friends if it gets too overwhelming.

Consultant: Those sound like effective strategies! It's good to have someone to talk to when the negative feelings come up. Remember, acknowledging those feelings is important, but it’s equally important to challenge them. Is there a particular thought that often triggers feelings of inadequacy for you?

User: Usually, it’s when I see pictures of my ex or hear about someone in a happy relationship. It makes me feel like I’ve missed out.

Consultant: That’s a common trigger for many people. Let’s consider how you can reframe those moments. When you see something that triggers that sadness, how could you challenge the thought of having “missed out”?

User: I could tell myself that each relationship taught me something valuable and that I’m now in a better place, growing and making new connections.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a healthier way to view your experiences. Each relationship contributes to who you are today, and that growth is significant. How does that reframing make you feel?

User: It feels empowering, actually. It makes me realize that my past doesn’t define my future.

Consultant: Yes! That’s the spirit! Your past can offer lessons but does not dictate your worth or what lies ahead of you. As we wrap up our session today, how are you feeling about the progress you’re making?

User: I feel more hopeful and less burdened by my past. I believe I can manage my feelings better now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. Let’s continue working together to reinforce these strategies in our next session. Remember to journal your positive experiences and lean on your friends for support. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! Thank you for your help. I’m really looking forward to our next session!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Liu! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad you are here for today's session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better overall. My confidence has increased a little, and I’ve started to get back into my studies, but I still have some ups and downs with my expectations for myself.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling some improvement and engaging more with your studies. Can you tell me what specific moments or achievements contributed to this boost in confidence?

User: Well, I recently worked really hard on a project, and I received positive feedback from my professor. It felt validating and made me realize that I can still succeed.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful achievement! It's important to recognize your hard work. How did that positive feedback affect your thoughts about your abilities?

User: It made me feel like I can indeed succeed, but then sometimes I worry that it was just a fluke and that I might not be able to keep it up.

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some self-doubt despite your success. Could we explore the thoughts that come to mind when you worry about it being a fluke? What do you typically tell yourself?

User: I often think, "What if I can’t replicate this success?" Then I get anxious about failing next time.

Consultant: That’s a common concern. Let’s take a moment to challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that suggests you can't replicate your success? Can we think of any past experiences where you've succeeded more than once?

User: Actually, I’ve done well in a couple of other projects too. I guess I’m just not always confident in myself.

Consultant: It seems like you have a pattern of success but are struggling with maintaining that belief in yourself. What if you considered looking at each challenge as an opportunity to learn rather than a pressure to perform?

User: That might help. I think I put a lot of pressure on myself to always get good results rather than focusing on my growth. 

Consultant: That’s a very insightful realization! Shifting the focus from results to growth can reduce pressure. How do you think that change in perspective could influence your daily activities or studies?

User: Maybe I could feel more relaxed when studying and actually enjoy the process rather than just worrying about the grades.

Consultant: Exactly! Enjoying the process could make learning more rewarding. Let’s brainstorm some small steps you could take to incorporate this mindset into your routine. What might you start with?

User: I could set aside time for just reading something interesting related to my major, without worrying about whether it will help my grades.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Setting aside time for enjoyment can help create a more positive association with studying. How about we set a specific goal for that?

User: I could try reading one chapter a week for fun. That feels manageable.

Consultant: Great! A manageable goal is key. What other aspects of your life would benefit from this more relaxed approach to expectations?

User: I think it would help in my interactions with friends, too. I often feel tense trying to be perfect in social settings.

Consultant: That's a valuable insight. Reducing the pressure on yourself in social situations can lead to more authentic connections. How can you apply this when interacting with friends?

User: Maybe I could focus on just having fun rather than worrying about what they think of me.

Consultant: Absolutely! What might be a good way to remind yourself of that during gatherings with friends?

User: I could tell myself before going to relax and just enjoy the moment, and remember that it’s okay to be myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! It’s important to be kind to yourself. Reflecting on what you've learned today, how confident do you feel about implementing these changes?

User: I feel pretty hopeful! I think making these small adjustments can really help.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. As we move forward, let’s also plan to touch upon any challenges you face while applying these new strategies in our next session. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good to me! I think it will be helpful to talk about any difficulties I run into.

Consultant: Excellent! I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences. Before we wrap up, let’s summarize the progress you’ve made and the strategies you plan to implement.

User: Sure! I’m going to focus on enjoying the learning process without putting too much pressure on grades, and I’ll also try to relax and be myself around friends.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Liu. I believe these steps will not only enhance your confidence but also balance your academic and social life. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel really good about it! I appreciate your guidance. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it's completely normal to have ups and downs, but you're on a positive path. If anything comes up before our next session, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I will keep that in mind. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Liu. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel much better, actually. I'm really starting to look forward to my internship this summer. I think it will be a great opportunity for me.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear that you're feeling optimistic about your internship. What are some specific things you're looking forward to in this experience?

User: I'm excited to learn new skills and meet new people. I think the work environment will be different from school, and that excites me. 

Consultant: It sounds like you have a positive attitude going into this opportunity. As we reflect on your journey, can you share how you think you've changed since we started working together?

User: I believe I've become more self-aware and more comfortable with my emotions. I used to just suppress them, but now I’m learning to express them more.

Consultant: That's such an important development! Being able to express your feelings can really enhance your emotional well-being. How do you think that self-awareness will help you during your internship?

User: I think it will help me communicate better with my colleagues and manage stress more effectively. I know I often get anxious in new situations, but I feel more equipped to handle it now.

Consultant: That's a great realization, Liu. Having tools to manage anxiety can make a big difference in a new setting. What are some strategies you plan to use if you start feeling anxious while interning?

User: I’m going to try deep breathing exercises that we talked about. I think taking a moment to breathe and center myself will help a lot.

Consultant: Deep breathing is an excellent strategy. Just taking a few moments to focus on your breath can really help calm your mind. Is there anything else you want to incorporate to support your mental health during your internship?

User: I think I want to keep a journal. Writing my thoughts and feelings down could help me process everything I'm experiencing.

Consultant: That sounds like a valuable idea! Journaling can be a great way to reflect on your experiences and feelings. How do you feel about your ability to maintain a routine that includes journaling?

User: I feel pretty motivated. It’s nice to have a way to express myself, especially since I’ve struggled with it in the past.

Consultant: It's wonderful to see that motivation! You’ve made significant progress. In terms of your long-term goals, what are some aspirations you have beyond the internship?

User: I’d like to explore more into my field and possibly pursue further studies. I want to feel more secure about my future career.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Exploring your field can help you discover what truly excites you. What steps do you think you could take to explore these opportunities more?

User: I think I could network with professionals in my field during my internship and maybe seek advice from them about further studies or career paths.

Consultant: Networking is a brilliant strategy! Learning from others can provide you with insights and inspiration. How do you feel about initiating those conversations with professionals?

User: I’m a little nervous, but I know it’s important. I think I can remind myself that they were once in my position.

Consultant: That's an excellent mindset! Many professionals appreciate it when someone reaches out. Do you have any concerns about networking that we could address together?

User: I’m mainly worried about making a good impression and not saying the wrong thing.

Consultant: It's natural to feel that way. What if you prepare some questions in advance? This way, you can feel more confident and focused during your conversations.

User: That sounds very helpful! Preparing questions would definitely ease some of my nerves.

Consultant: Great! It’s all about finding what works best for you. As you continue to grow and pursue these opportunities, remember to be kind to yourself. Reflection is key. How do you plan to keep track of your progress?

User: I think I will set small goals for myself during the internship and check in with my journal regularly to see how I’m doing.

Consultant: That sounds like an effective plan! Small goals can make tasks feel more manageable. Before we wrap up today, what has been your biggest takeaway from our sessions so far?

User: I would say it’s the importance of expressing my feelings and being proactive about my mental health. It’s empowering to feel in control.

Consultant: Absolutely! Empowerment is a crucial aspect of growth. It's wonderful to hear that you're taking ownership of your mental well-being. As we conclude today, what are some final thoughts you have about your journey so far and your future?

User: I feel hopeful and excited. I know challenges may come, but I feel equipped to handle them now. 

Consultant: That's such a healthy perspective, Liu. Remember, you've built a solid foundation. If challenges arise, you have the skills to navigate through them. Thank you for sharing your journey with me. You’ve made remarkable progress, and I’m confident you will continue to thrive. If you ever need support, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate all your help. It’s been really beneficial for me.
