Consultant: Hello, Wang! Welcome to our session today. Before we begin, I’d like to know how you’re feeling right now and what’s been on your mind lately.

User: Hi. I've been feeling really overwhelmed. With schoolwork piling up and that recent exam result, I just can’t seem to focus on my studies. I know I should study, but my mind feels so chaotic.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure and difficulty concentrating, which is completely understandable. Can you share more about how you felt after receiving your exam results?

User: I got the ninth place in my class, but I was really disappointed. I expected so much more from myself. I keep thinking that if I can’t do well now, what hope do I have for the future?

Consultant: I hear you, and it’s okay to feel let down when you don’t meet your expectations. Let's explore what "doing well" means to you. What specific thoughts are coming to your mind when you think about your performance?

User: I just keep dwelling on the idea that I’m falling behind. Sometimes, I feel like nobody else struggles as much as I do, and I start to question if I’m even capable of achieving my goals.

Consultant: It seems like there’s a lot of negative self-talk happening. Let’s take a closer look. When you think, “I’m falling behind,” what emotions does that bring up for you?

User: It makes me feel anxious and hopeless. I sometimes break down and cry because it feels so heavy. I want to escape those feelings, but then I know I have to study.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling trapped between wanting to escape and knowing you need to focus. Let's try to break this cycle. What are some things you do that help you feel a little better when you’re feeling anxious or overwhelmed?

User: I used to listen to music or draw, but I haven’t done those things recently. I feel like I don’t have time for them anymore.

Consultant: Engaging in activities you enjoy is actually very important, especially when you’re feeling this way. It seems like you may need to carve out some time for those activities. Can we brainstorm together ways to incorporate a little bit of relaxation into your routine?

User: Yeah, I think that could help, but I also worry it’ll take time away from studying.

Consultant: It's understandable to be concerned about that. However, taking breaks can often lead to greater productivity and focus. Let’s think about it this way: If you have a structured study routine that includes short breaks for activities like listening to music or drawing, how might that impact your focus and tension levels?

User: I guess it would help me clear my mind a bit, but I still feel guilty for taking breaks.

Consultant: It’s common to feel that way, but remember, breaks are an essential part of maintaining productivity. Could we create a study plan together that incorporates those breaks? This way, you can feel more balanced and less guilty about taking some time for yourself.

User: That sounds like a good idea! I’d like to see how that works.

Consultant: Great! Let's set short, focused study sessions, followed by breaks that include things you enjoy. This can help relieve anxiety while keeping you productive. How much time do you think you could dedicate to studying before taking a break?

User: Maybe I could try studying for 25 minutes and then taking a 5-minute break. That seems manageable.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! The Pomodoro Technique has been shown to help with focus. This way, you can work systematically while allowing your mind to recharge regularly. After a few sessions, we can evaluate how it’s working for you. 

User: Okay, I can give that a shot. But what if I still feel overwhelmed during study times?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. We can implement some relaxation techniques you can use during those study breaks. Simple breathing exercises or even a quick walk outside can help. Would you like me to guide you through a breathing exercise we can use together?

User: I think that would be helpful. I often feel nervous when I try to study.

Consultant: Let’s do a simple one together. Take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four... hold it for a moment... and now breathe out slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Let’s try this three times. Ready?

User: Okay, let's try it. (User participates in the breathing exercise.)

Consultant: How do you feel after that exercise? 

User: I feel a little calmer. I think I could use this when I start feeling anxious.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Using this technique can help you find a sense of calm amidst the chaos. Going forward, whenever you find your mind racing, remember you have the tools to bring yourself back to a calmer state.

User: Yes, I think I need to remind myself to pause more often.

Consultant: Definitely! It's all about finding that balance. Before we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve talked about. You’re going to try the study plan with short breaks, incorporate some enjoyable activities, and use breathing exercises to manage anxiety. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds really good. I feel a bit more hopeful about managing my time and stress now.

Consultant: I'm happy to hear that progress! Remember, it’s a journey, and taking these small steps can lead to big changes over time. If you encounter any challenges, we can discuss them in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today. I feel less burdened.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Wang! Keep being gentle with yourself. I look forward to our next chat to see how you’re doing. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've still been pretty anxious. School feels overwhelming, especially with so many assignments and the pressure to perform well. I keep doubting my abilities and feel like I'm falling behind my classmates.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure and uncertainty about your capabilities. Let's talk about that. Can you describe a specific moment recently when you felt that anxiety rising?

User: Well, during my last study session, I just couldn't concentrate on my homework. My mind kept wandering, and I felt frustrated with myself. I ended up giving up and crying a bit because I felt so lost and overwhelmed.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that it felt so tough for you. It’s completely valid to feel that way when you’re under so much stress. Can you share what thoughts were going through your mind during that moment?

User: I kept thinking that I’m not smart enough to keep up with my classmates. My thoughts went to “What if I can’t get into a good college?” It just made the situation so much worse.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy and discouraging. It’s important to recognize them. How did those thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: They made me feel really hopeless and anxious. I couldn’t shake off that feeling of failure. It seems like no matter how hard I try, I’m still not making progress.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are really affecting your emotions and motivation. Let’s take a closer look at them. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're not smart enough or that you're failing?

User: I don’t know...Maybe it’s just that I struggle to finish my assignments on time, and my grades haven’t been great lately. 

Consultant: It's understandable to feel discouraged when grades don’t meet your expectations. But do you think there might be other factors at play, like your studying environment or stress levels? 

User: Yes, I guess I haven't been studying in a good environment. I often try to work in my noisy room, and I get easily distracted.

Consultant: That’s a good observation, Wang. Sometimes our environment can significantly impact our focus. How about we brainstorm some strategies that could help improve your concentration when studying?

User: That would be helpful. I really want to focus better. 

Consultant: Great! Let's think about setting a study routine in a quieter space, perhaps at a library or a designated study area at home. What do you think about that?

User: That sounds like a good idea. I just need to find a time when it's less noisy. 

Consultant: Right, finding that quieter time is key. Also, have you considered breaking your study sessions into smaller, more manageable tasks? That might help reduce the feeling of overwhelm.

User: I haven’t really thought about that. I usually try to tackle everything at once, which is probably why I feel so stressed.

Consultant: Breaking tasks into smaller pieces can make them feel less daunting. What's one task you could break down right now? 

User: I have a history assignment I’ve been dreading. I could maybe separate it into different sections to work on each part instead of trying to finish it all at once.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! And remember, when you complete each section, take a moment to recognize your accomplishment. How does that sound?

User: It sounds good. I think that might help me feel less pressured.

Consultant: Absolutely! It can reinforce a sense of progress. Also, let’s talk about your self-talk. What are some positive affirmations you could remind yourself of when those negative thoughts pop up?

User: I could tell myself that everyone struggles and that it's okay to not be perfect all the time.

Consultant: Yes, that's a wonderful affirmation! It’s so important to remind yourself that struggling doesn’t define your abilities. Let’s practice that thought for a moment—say it out loud.

User: I can remind myself that it’s okay to struggle and that I’m doing my best.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on your effort rather than solely on outcomes can build resilience. Now, what small steps can you take this week to practice these strategies?

User: I’ll try to study in a quieter place, break my assignments into sections, and practice my positive affirmations daily. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Wang! I'm proud of you for taking these steps. How do you feel about what we've discussed today?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It’s nice to have a plan and to think about my challenges differently.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it's a journey, and we’re here to explore and grow together. As we wrap up today’s session, keep those strategies in mind and be gentle with yourself. 

User: Thank you for your support. I appreciate it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Wang! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress at our next session. Take care and remember, you’re not alone in this.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang. It’s great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've had some better days, but I still find myself terrified of failing. My grades aren't matching my expectations, and I'm losing motivation.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like there's still a lot of pressure you feel regarding your academic performance. Let’s discuss that fear of failure a bit. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts go through your mind when you start to feel this way?

User: I keep thinking that if I don’t get into a good university, my future will be ruined. Sometimes I feel like I’m at the bottom, and it’s hard to see a way up. 

Consultant: That sounds really heavy and distressing. You’re attaching a lot of significance to your university choice. How do those thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: They make me anxious and sometimes hopeless. It feels like I’m stuck between what I want and what I can achieve, and I'm scared I’ll never reach my goals.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel this way when you’re striving for high standards. It sounds like you have a fear of not being enough. Do you notice any specific situations that trigger these thoughts?

User: It mostly happens when I study or prepare for exams. I constantly compare myself to others and feel like I'm just not measuring up.

Consultant: Comparing yourself with others can create a lot of negative feelings. Can you recall a recent moment when you compared yourself to someone else? What thoughts crossed your mind?

User: Last week, a classmate shared her scores, and I couldn't help but think about how much lower mine are. I felt embarrassed and worried that everyone would see me as a failure.

Consultant: That’s a tough position to be in. When you have these thoughts, what feelings do you notice in your body? 

User: I feel a tightness in my chest and sometimes even short of breath. It’s like my anxiety takes over. 

Consultant: Physical responses like that are really common in anxiety. It can feel overwhelming. Have you tried any techniques to manage those feelings when they arise?

User: I’ve been using some relaxation techniques, which help a little. I also try to manage my time better, but I still find it hard to stay focused because I get so anxious.

Consultant: It's great that you're trying those relaxation techniques—it shows your effort to cope. Let’s work together on your thoughts when you feel that tightness in your chest. When you think about your grades compared to others, how would you challenge that thought? 

User: I guess I could remind myself that everyone has different strengths and weaknesses. But it’s hard to hold onto that thought when I’m feeling down.

Consultant: That’s a really healthy thought! It can be difficult to remember when anxiety kicks in. Maybe we can create a supportive mantra for you to use in those moments. What do you think would help you feel more grounded?

User: Maybe something like "My worth isn’t based on my grades." But I’m not sure I can really believe it.

Consultant: That’s a strong statement. Sometimes, challenging your belief is just as important as believing it. What if we explored some evidence for and against that thought together? 

User: Okay. For evidence against, I know I’m hardworking and have good qualities outside school. But for evidence supporting it, I just think of my grades and how they don’t measure up.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize your strengths! While grades are a part of your journey, they don’t define who you are. How do you think you would feel if you accepted one less perfect outcome in your studies?

User: I think I would feel a bit freer. But I worry that if I don’t push myself, I won’t reach my goals.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Finding a balance is key. What if we looked at your goals and standards together? Could there be room for flexibility? 

User: I suppose I could set smaller, more achievable goals instead of focusing solely on the big picture.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step. Smaller goals can provide a sense of accomplishment and help manage anxiety. What kind of smaller goals can you think of that would feel more achievable?

User: Maybe I could aim to study for just 30 minutes without distractions each day instead of trying to cover everything at once.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea, Wang! Focusing on a short period can reduce pressure. How do you feel about implementing that this week?

User: I feel good about starting small. It sounds less daunting than the usual study marathon.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Small steps can lead to big changes. To wrap up this session, let’s talk about some strategies to remind yourself of your worth that’s independent of grades. How will you reinforce that thought this week?

User: I think I’ll write down the qualities I appreciate about myself and revisit it whenever I feel down. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Keeping a reminder of your value will help. Thank you for sharing today, Wang. You’ve made some strong insights regarding your thoughts and feelings.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I feel a bit lighter walking away with these ideas. See you next time!

Consultant: You're welcome! I'm proud of the progress you’re making, and I look forward to our next session. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Wang! I’m glad to see you for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last conversation? 

User: Hi! I think I’ve made some progress in talking more in group study sessions. But I still feel lonely sometimes and the pressure from school is overwhelming. 

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've made some progress in engaging with your classmates. Feeling lonely is common, especially when navigating school stress. Can you tell me more about those feelings of loneliness? 

User: Sometimes, even when I’m with my classmates, I feel like I don’t quite belong. I’m also worried that I might not get into a good university, and that makes me anxious. 

Consultant: That sense of not belonging can be really tough. You're also facing the pressure of academic expectations. What do you think would help you feel more connected to your classmates? 

User: I think if I could just be more confident in speaking up during discussions, it might help. But I often feel that my thoughts aren’t as good as theirs. 

Consultant: It's normal to feel that way, but remember that your opinions matter too. How would you feel about practicing some scenarios today where you can express yourself confidently? 

User: That sounds useful, but I’m not sure how effective it will be. What if I still freeze up? 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. We can take it slow and start with small role-plays. This way, you'll have a safe space to practice without pressure. If you freeze up, we can talk about it and adjust as needed. How does that sound? 

User: Okay, I’m willing to try that. I hope it makes things easier for me. 

Consultant: Let’s start with a simple situation: imagine you’re in a group study session, and a colleague asks for your opinion on a topic. What might you say? 

User: I would probably just nod and let someone else talk. But I wish I could say something meaningful. 

Consultant: I understand that. Let’s try to identify a few key points you might want to share. What ideas do you think are valuable enough to contribute? 

User: I guess I could suggest some study techniques I’ve found useful. 

Consultant: That's a great start! How about we practice how you would introduce that idea in a group? 

User: Okay, I could say, "I have a study method that helped me with my last exam. Would anyone be interested in hearing about it?" 

Consultant: That sounds very engaging! Now, if someone responds positively, how would you continue? 

User: I think I would explain the method and maybe share my experience. But I’m still nervous about speaking in front of everyone. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous speaking in front of others. Remember, you are sharing something valuable. Let's think of ways to help calm your nerves before speaking. 

User: Maybe I could take a deep breath and remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Breathing techniques can really help. It sounds like you’re developing strategies to manage your anxiety. Can we practice that breathing technique together now? 

User: Sure, that sounds like a good idea. 

Consultant: Great! Let's take a deep breath in through the nose... hold it for a moment... and then slowly exhale through the mouth. How does that feel? 

User: It feels a little calming. I think I could use this before speaking. 

Consultant: That's excellent! With practice, these techniques can become part of your routine. Let's move to the next step—what feedback would you want to hear from your peers after sharing your ideas? 

User: I would like them to say it was helpful or that they appreciated my perspective. 

Consultant: That's a positive affirmation! It can be reassuring. Imagine experiencing that response; how would it make you feel? 

User: I think I would feel more confident and maybe more willing to share next time. 

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a lovely way to build confidence. We can keep exploring more situations where you can practice this. How about setting small social goals until our next meeting? 

User: Like what? 

Consultant: You could aim to share your opinion in at least one group discussion this week. Does that sound achievable? 

User: Yes, I can do that. It’s a good start. 

Consultant: Perfect! It's all about taking small steps forward. When we meet again, we can discuss how it went and adjust our strategies if needed. 

User: Thank you! I’m feeling hopeful. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s completely normal to feel nervous, and you’re making progress. Keep practicing, and I believe you’ll continue to feel more at ease in your interactions. 

User: I will. Thank you for your support! 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello! I'm so glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling a bit better. I've started recognizing some small achievements in my studies and daily life, which has helped me feel less overwhelmed.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant improvement! It's encouraging to hear that you're starting to notice those positive changes. Can you share some examples of these small achievements?

User: Well, I managed to complete my assignments on time this week, and I even participated in a group discussion in class. It felt good to contribute.

Consultant: That's fantastic! Completing your assignments on time and participating in class are great steps towards your goals. How did you feel during and after those experiences?

User: I felt a sense of relief and happiness. It's like these small victories are slowly building my confidence.

Consultant: Building confidence through these experiences is important. It shows that you are capable of progress. What would you like to focus on today to continue this positive momentum?

User: I want to make sure I can keep this positive feeling and not fall back into feeling overwhelmed. I also want to set some realistic goals for the upcoming weeks.

Consultant: Maintaining that positive feeling is indeed key. Let's explore how you can set realistic goals. What areas of your life or studies do you feel most motivated to improve right now?

User: I think improving my study habits would be beneficial. I want to be able to manage my time better to avoid last-minute stress.

Consultant: That’s a great focus. Good study habits can help reduce stress significantly. Have you thought about any specific strategies or methods you could try to enhance your time management?

User: I’ve heard about making a daily planner or to-do lists. I think that might help me stay organized.

Consultant: Using a daily planner and to-do lists is a wonderful strategy! It can help you visualize your tasks and prioritize better. Would you like to set a specific time to review your planner daily?

User: Yes, maybe in the morning when I wake up, I can take a few minutes to plan my day.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Starting your day with a clear outline can set a positive tone. How would it feel for you to implement that routine?

User: I think it would help me feel more in control and less anxious about my tasks.

Consultant: Feeling in control is essential. Let’s also think about how to address any feelings of anxiety that may pop up while you're adjusting to this new routine. Do you have any stress-relief techniques that you currently use?

User: Sometimes, I listen to music or journal when I'm feeling stressed. Those help me feel better.

Consultant: Those are effective techniques! Music and journaling can be great outlets for processing feelings. Would you want to incorporate those activities as a reward after completing tasks?

User: That sounds like a good idea! I can reward myself with music or some journaling time after finishing my study sessions.

Consultant: Perfect! Rewards can motivate us to complete tasks. As we wrap up our session, let's take a moment to summarize what you’ve learned today. What do you see as your next steps?

User: I will start using a daily planner and set aside time each morning to organize my tasks. I’ll also reward myself with some music or journaling after finishing my studies.

Consultant: Those are fantastic next steps! You’ve made excellent progress. Remember to celebrate those small victories. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel great! I have a clear plan and I’m excited to put it into action.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've worked hard to reach this point. Always remember that you can return if you need support. I’m confident you’ll do well. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and I look forward to our next session to hear about your progress. Goodbye for now!

User: Goodbye!
