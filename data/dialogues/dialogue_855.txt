Consultant: Hello, Yang! I'm glad to see you for today’s session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I'm still feeling quite isolated and anxious. It's tough for me to connect with my classmates, and I often feel like I don't belong.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds really challenging to feel that way, especially in a new environment. What specific experiences have made you feel this isolation more lately?

User: Well, there are times during lunch when I sit by myself because I’m not sure how to start a conversation or even if anyone would want to talk to me.

Consultant: That must be really tough, sitting alone while others are socializing. What thoughts cross your mind in those moments?

User: I think that maybe people don’t like me or that I’m not interesting enough. It makes me feel even worse.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite heavy for you. Let’s break that down a bit. When you think "people don’t like me," what evidence do you have that supports this thought?

User: I guess I don’t have solid proof. It’s just a feeling I have because I’m not making connections.

Consultant: That’s important to recognize. These feelings of isolation can warp our perceptions. If a friend expressed a similar worry, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably tell them not to assume things and that they might just need to find the right people to connect with.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s much easier to see things from an outside perspective. What would happen if you challenged that thought you have about not being interesting enough?

User: I suppose I could think of things I like and share them. Maybe some people would find them interesting?

Consultant: That's a great start! Focusing on your interests could open up avenues for conversation. Let’s try to think of some topics you’d be comfortable sharing. What are some things you enjoy?

User: I like playing video games and reading manga. Sometimes I find it hard to talk about those because I worry others won’t relate.

Consultant: Those are great interests! Many people relate to gaming or manga. Perhaps you can start with someone who has an interest in those areas. What if you approached someone and asked if they play games?

User: That sounds doable, but I still feel a little anxious about it.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious about approaching someone. Instead of focusing on the outcome, we could take small steps. How about practicing what you might say beforehand?

User: Okay, I can practice saying, “Do you play any video games?” Sounds simple enough.

Consultant: Exactly! Simple and direct. Practicing can help ease the anxiety. Have you thought about how you might feel after making that attempt?

User: I guess I might feel proud for trying, even if the conversation doesn’t go as I hoped.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset to have! Celebrating the attempt itself is vital. How do you feel about setting a goal to try this conversation at least once before our next session?

User: I’d be willing to try that!

Consultant: Great! And remember, whatever the outcome, it’s an opportunity to learn. We can explore how it went next time. Before we wrap up, let’s also think about a way to process your feelings if it doesn’t go as planned.

User: Maybe I can journal about it afterward? That helps me sometimes.

Consultant: Journaling sounds like an excellent strategy. Reflecting on your feelings will help you understand yourself better and process your experiences. 

User: Yeah, that makes sense. I’ll give it a try!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Yang. It seems like you’re motivated to make a change. Remember, it’s okay to feel uncomfortable—it's part of the growth process.

User: Thanks, I appreciate your support. I’ll focus on these small steps.

Consultant: You're welcome! Just take it one step at a time, and we’ll discuss your experiences in our next meeting. You're strengthening your resilience. I look forward to hearing how it goes!

User: Me too. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Yang! I'm glad you're here for our session today. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed. I tried to talk to some classmates during an activity, but it didn't go well. I keep doubting myself and feeling anxious about social situations.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're facing a lot of uncertainty and anxiety about social interactions, especially after your recent experiences. What do you feel has been the most challenging part for you?

User: I think it's the fear of being judged. Even when I try to talk, I'm constantly worried that I'm saying the wrong thing or that nobody really wants to listen to me.

Consultant: That fear of judgment can be really tough to deal with. It makes sense why you would feel hesitant. Can you share a specific moment from your recent interactions that felt particularly difficult for you?

User: There was a moment when I tried to join a conversation about a game, but they just brushed me off. I felt so embarrassed and like I shouldn't even have tried.

Consultant: That sounds painful. Being brushed off can hurt our confidence. When that happened, what thoughts went through your mind afterward? 

User: I thought maybe I'm just not interesting enough, or that they don't like me. It felt like I just didn't fit in.

Consultant: Those are really distressing thoughts, and it's understandable that they would contribute to your anxiety. It seems like you're feeling a lot of pressure to fit in. Do you think there's any evidence that supports those thoughts about not fitting in?

User: Well, I think there are times when I do connect with others, but they seem so rare. Most of the time, I just feel awkward.

Consultant: It’s great that you can recognize those moments of connection, even if they feel rare. It sounds like there might be some cognitive distortions at play here. Would you be willing to explore those thoughts about yourself a bit more?

User: Sure, but I'm not sure how to do that.

Consultant: Let’s try identifying some of the negative thoughts you have during social interactions. For instance, when you felt brushed off, what exact thoughts did you have at that moment?

User: I thought, "They don't want to hear what I say," and "I'll probably mess it up again next time."

Consultant: Those thoughts may seem reasonable in the moment, but are they completely true? Let's think of alternative perspectives. For instance, is it possible that the response from your classmates had more to do with their mood that day rather than a reflection of your worth?

User: I guess that could be true. Maybe they saw me, but just weren't in the mood to chat, or something. 

Consultant: Exactly! Context matters a lot. It doesn’t define your value. Let’s also discuss how you might react the next time you want to join a conversation, keeping this alternative thought in mind. What could you say or do?

User: I might just try to jump in anyway, even if I'm scared. I could remind myself that it's okay if they don’t engage.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! Taking that step, despite the fear, could really help build your social resilience. Let's set a small goal for your next social interaction. What could be a manageable step for you?

User: Maybe I could aim to speak up at least once in our next group project meeting?

Consultant: That sounds like a great step! Speaking up once is a manageable goal. How would you prepare for that meeting so you feel more confident going in?

User: I could think of a couple of things to say in advance, maybe even practice what I want to say.

Consultant: Preparation is a powerful tool! Practicing what you want to say can help ease your anxiety. As you move forward, remember to be gentle with yourself. How do you feel about taking this step next week?

User: I’m a bit nervous, but I think I can do it. I just have to remind myself that it’s okay to try.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous. Acknowledging that feeling and moving forward anyway is a big accomplishment. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you’ve learned about yourself and your thoughts?

User: I learned that my fears might not be as true as I think they are. I can challenge those thoughts and take small actions to improve. 

Consultant: That’s a significant insight, Yang! Reflecting on your abilities to challenge those negative thoughts and take action will serve you well. Keep building on those successes, and remember to celebrate every step you take, no matter how small. When we meet again, we can discuss how the group meeting went. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’ll try to focus on what we talked about.

Consultant: You’re welcome! It’s been great talking to you today, and I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Just remember, it’s okay to take this journey one step at a time. See you soon, Yang!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. It seems like you’ve been going through some mixed feelings lately. Can you share more about what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling unsure about my self-worth, even though my teacher praised me in class recently. It's confusing because I expected to feel better about myself. 

Consultant: It sounds like you received some positive feedback but still feel hesitant about how you see yourself. Can you tell me more about how that praise made you feel and why it didn't seem to change your view in the group?

User: I felt happy for a moment when the teacher praised me, but then it faded. I guess I still doubt whether it was just a fluke, and that makes me question my skills. 

Consultant: That's understandable. It can be tough when positive experiences don’t lead to a lasting change in our self-perception. Let's explore that feeling of doubt a bit more. What thoughts were going through your mind after receiving the praise?

User: I thought, "Maybe the teacher was just being nice," or "I won't be able to keep up this performance." Those thoughts just make me feel worse about myself.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like those thoughts are influencing how you view your abilities. Would you be open to examining those thoughts together and exploring where they might be coming from?

User: Sure, that sounds okay. I just wish I could trust myself more.

Consultant: Trusting yourself is a crucial step. Let’s identify the specific thoughts that arise when you doubt your self-worth. When you think "I won’t be able to keep up," what emotions do you notice?

User: I feel anxious and frustrated. It's like I already expect to fail, and that scares me.

Consultant: That's a valid feeling, and many people experience similar thoughts. We can challenge that expectation of failure. How likely do you think it is that you will actually fail, based on your past experiences?

User: I guess I have done well before. It feels like I just focus on the negative times instead.

Consultant: That's an important insight. It’s common to fixate on past failures rather than successes. What would you say if a friend came to you feeling the same way—what would you encourage them to think?

User: I would probably tell them to remember the times when they succeeded and to not let one mistake define them. 

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! You seem to understand the importance of looking at the bigger picture. Shall we practice applying that to your situation? What would it look like if you started focusing on your past successes instead?

User: Maybe I would feel less pressure. If I remember my successes, I might feel more confident to take risks in class.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about shifting focus to what you’ve achieved rather than what you fear. Let’s incorporate this idea into your daily routine. How could you remind yourself of your successes?

User: I could keep a journal to write down positive feedback and good experiences. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Journaling can help reinforce positive thoughts. As you do this, how might you address feelings of self-doubt that arise?

User: I can challenge those negative thoughts by asking myself if they are really true and reminding myself of my journal entries.

Consultant: Precisely! By questioning and challenging those negative thoughts, you’re actively working to build your self-worth. How do you feel about taking this approach moving forward?

User: I feel hopeful. It seems like a practical way to tackle my negative thinking.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s a process, so remember to be patient with yourself as you work through these feelings. As we continue with our sessions, we can explore other areas of your life where you want to build confidence. 

User: Thank you! That sounds good. This is helping me see things differently.

Consultant: You’re welcome! Before we wrap up, let’s talk about any specific situations coming up where you might feel nervous. How can you prepare yourself to face those moments?

User: I have a group project coming up, and I feel anxious about working with others. I should remember my successes and use my journal.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember to communicate your thoughts with your group and trust in your abilities. You’ve got skills that led to success before!

User: I will try to remember that. It’s encouraging to hear.

Consultant: I’m glad it helps! As we conclude today’s session, what do you think your next steps will be to keep building this confidence?

User: I will focus on my journal, challenge negative thoughts and prepare for the group project by reflecting on my strengths. 

Consultant: That’s a proactive mindset! You've made significant progress today. I believe you can embrace those steps and keep moving forward. Always remember, it’s okay to feel uncertain at times; it can lead to growth.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing how things go in our next session. Remember, you’re not alone on this journey. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today's session. I'm glad you're here. Before we dive in, can you share how you've been feeling lately regarding your social activities?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit uncertain about joining new groups. I recently tried joining a club but didn't perform well, which made me hesitate about trying again. I really want to find the courage to engage more with others.

Consultant: I understand that you're feeling unsure after your recent experience. It's completely normal to feel this way when trying something new. What do you think made you feel most hesitant about rejoining a group?

User: I guess I’m just afraid of failing again. The embarrassment from the first attempt still lingers. 

Consultant: That makes sense. It's tough when past experiences keep us from moving forward. Let’s explore that feeling a bit more. What specifically do you think about when you remember your first attempt?

User: I keep thinking I could have done better, and I feel embarrassed about how I didn’t fit in with the group.

Consultant: It sounds like you're holding on to a lot of thoughts about how that experience went. Can you share what emotions come up for you when you think about that first attempt?

User: I feel anxious and maybe a little sad. It just makes me want to withdraw instead of trying again.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. Feeling anxious and sad is understandable. Let's try to reframe this. If you were to see that experience as a learning opportunity, what might you take away from it?

User: I suppose I could learn what I need to prepare better next time, maybe be more open about my feelings or ask for help.

Consultant: That's a positive shift in perspective! Acknowledging that you can learn from experiences can help reduce the sting of past disappointments. What small step do you think you could take to prepare for your next attempt?

User: Maybe I could start by just talking to one or two people in the group to get to know them better?

Consultant: Great idea! That's a manageable step that can help build your confidence. How do you feel about making that first move to connect?

User: I’m feeling a bit nervous but also excited at the thought of getting to know them.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mix of emotions! It shows you’re ready to take a step forward despite the nerves. How can you remind yourself of this positive feeling if doubts come up while reaching out?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to not be perfect and that everyone has their own struggles.

Consultant: Excellent! Remembering that others might also face challenges can really help ease the pressure. How would you like to celebrate this potential connection after you make it?

User: I think just acknowledging that I took the step, no matter how it goes, would feel like a win.

Consultant: Absolutely! Celebrating your efforts is important. Let's also discuss how we can handle any negative thoughts that may pop up during this process. How do you usually manage those feelings when they arise?

User: Usually, I just try to ignore them, which doesn’t always work.

Consultant: Ignoring them is a common approach, but it can lead to more frustration. Instead, we can practice recognizing those thoughts and challenging them. What negative thought comes to you when you think about approaching someone in the group?

User: I often think, "What if they don’t like me?" 

Consultant: That’s a powerful thought. Let’s challenge it together. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts that belief?

User: I don’t really have solid evidence. It’s more like a fear based on my previous experience.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s really based on fear rather than reality. What would you say to a friend who expressed the same worry about being liked?

User: I would tell them that they can't please everyone and that they just need to be themselves.

Consultant: Wise advice! You deserve to remind yourself of that too. Being yourself is key. As you prepare to reach out, what affirmations or positive reminders could you use?

User: Maybe I could say, “I am worth knowing, and it’s okay to be myself.”

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation! Repeating that can help reinforce your self-worth. As you move forward, what support do you think you might need from me? 

User: I’d like to talk again after I attempt to reach out to people so I can share how it went.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. I’m here to support you through that. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Let’s aim to check in after your first step. Would that work for you?

User: Yes, I like that idea. It feels good to have a plan.

Consultant: Fantastic! Keep building on that excitement and remember to celebrate each step. You’re doing great just by being here and opening up. I'll look forward to hearing how it goes!

User: Thanks! I feel much better about trying now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! I’m really proud of you for wanting to take these steps. Remember, I’m here for you. Let’s keep that positive momentum going.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I’m really glad you’re here today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially after that positive experience in your club?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling pretty good, actually! That feedback from my classmates really boosted my confidence. I find myself wanting to engage more in social activities now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like that experience has really had a positive impact. Can you share more about how you’ve been trying to engage socially since then?

User: Well, I’ve been trying to speak up more during group discussions and even suggested an idea for our next club project. I felt nervous, but everyone seemed to appreciate it.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re taking brave steps to participate more actively. What emotions did you experience while suggesting your idea?

User: I felt a mix of anxiety and excitement. But when they responded positively, I felt really proud of myself.

Consultant: That’s a great combination of feelings! It seems like the positive response reinforced your confidence. How do you want to maintain or build on this confidence moving forward?

User: I want to keep pushing myself to participate more, maybe even lead some activities. But sometimes I worry if I'll handle it well.

Consultant: It’s normal to have those concerns. Let’s explore that a bit. When you think about leading activities, what specific thoughts come to mind that might make you feel unsure?

User: I think about failing or not meeting others' expectations. I worry that if I mess up, it will ruin my confidence.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you’re putting a lot of pressure on yourself with those thoughts. Can we challenge these ideas together? Is there evidence to support that failing would mean you can’t continue to succeed?

User: I guess not really. I mean, everyone makes mistakes, right? 

Consultant: Exactly! Mistakes are part of the learning process. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about handling potential mistakes?

User: I’d tell them it’s okay to mess up as long as they learn from it and not to be too hard on themselves.

Consultant: That’s sound advice! It shows you have a compassionate perspective for others. How might you apply that same understanding to yourself?

User: I could remind myself that it's normal to make mistakes and try to focus on what I can learn rather than fearing failure.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Let’s talk about self-affirmations. What are some positive things you can tell yourself when you feel that anxiety creeping back in, especially before a social interaction?

User: I could say, "I am capable and my ideas are valuable." I like that.

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation! Using positive self-talk can help reinforce your confidence. How often do you think you could practice this before engaging in social situations?

User: I could try to do it every day, maybe even write it down or say it out loud before school or club activities.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Writing things down can help solidify those positive thoughts. How do you feel about setting specific social goals to tackle moving forward?

User: I think that’d be helpful. Maybe I could set a goal to initiate a conversation with someone new each week.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! It’s achievable and allows for gradual exposure to new social situations. We can also prepare you with some conversation starters if you’d like.

User: Yes, that would be great! I often struggle with knowing what to say.

Consultant: No problem! Simple questions about interests or opinions can be a great way to start. For example, you could ask about their favorite classes or hobbies. What do you think about that?

User: I like that idea. It sounds easier to approach someone with a simple question. 

Consultant: Exactly! It helps relieve some pressure and keeps the conversation flowing. How does all of this sound to you? 

User: It sounds really encouraging! I feel more equipped to handle social situations now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s summarize what you’ve learned today. You have your affirmations, a goal to initiate conversations, and tools to challenge negative thoughts. What’s your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is that I can build on my confidence by changing my mindset and taking small steps to interact more.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization! As we wrap up, remember that it’s a journey, and celebrating your small successes will help you maintain that confidence. 

User: I will keep that in mind. Thank you for your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m excited to see how you progress. If you ever feel stuck, remember that I’m here to help. Take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello Yang! I'm really glad you're here for this session. It's fantastic to hear about your progress. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I've been feeling much more confident lately. After my meeting with the homeroom teacher, I've been trying to engage more with my classmates and take on some social responsibilities.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re embracing new opportunities. Can you share any specific social interactions or responsibilities you’ve taken on recently?

User: Well, I volunteered to help organize a group project with my classmates. Initially, I was nervous, but I found it quite rewarding to lead discussions and gather everyone's input.

Consultant: It’s impressive that you took the initiative to lead. How did that experience make you feel about your abilities in social situations?

User: It felt great! I realized I can handle more than I thought. But sometimes I still feel a bit anxious in larger groups.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious in larger groups. We can explore that more. When you think about those larger groups, what kind of thoughts come to your mind?

User: I often worry that I might say something silly or that others won't listen to me. It makes me hesitant to speak up.

Consultant: Those thoughts can definitely be challenging. Let’s examine them a bit. Can you identify what specific evidence supports those worries? Have there been times when things turned out better than you expected in those situations?

User: There were times when I spoke up, and my classmates responded positively. But it’s like I immediately forget those moments when I'm about to speak again.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a pattern there. How would you describe the difference between those positive experiences and the anxious thoughts you have when you're in a group?

User: In those positive moments, I felt prepared and confident. But I guess when I’m anxious, I focus on my fear of judgment instead.

Consultant: That awareness is a valuable insight! What do you think could help you shift your focus back to those positive experiences before speaking up again?

User: Maybe reminding myself of my past successes could help. I could also practice what I want to say beforehand.

Consultant: Those sound like effective strategies! How do you feel about setting a small goal to practice speaking in a group this week? What’s one specific situation where you could try this out?

User: There’s a study group meeting coming up. I could prepare to share some of my ideas there.

Consultant: That’s a great choice! Preparing will likely boost your confidence. How can you remind yourself of your past successes during that meeting?

User: I could write down some notes of the positive feedback I’ve received and keep it with me. 

Consultant: Excellent approach! Having that reminder could really reinforce your confidence. After the meeting, how might you evaluate how it went for you?

User: I could reflect on what I did well and what I can improve, maybe even talk to a friend about it.

Consultant: Sharing your reflections with someone can provide support. As you think about the future, what new social goals would you like to set for yourself beyond the study group?

User: I’d like to join a club at school to meet new people. It feels a bit intimidating, but I want to try!

Consultant: Joining a club sounds like a fantastic goal! What steps can you take to make that less intimidating?

User: I could attend a few meetings as an observer first to see how it goes before joining actively.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Taking gradual steps can make a big difference. Reflecting on our conversation today, what do you feel are your biggest takeaways?

User: I think acknowledging my accomplishments is key and practicing will help me reduce my anxiety. I also feel more determined to face new challenges.

Consultant: I’m really proud of that realization! You’ve made significant progress. As we wrap up today, what are your commitments moving forward?

User: I’m committed to preparing for the study group, attending the club meetings as an observer, and reminding myself of my past positive experiences.

Consultant: Those are excellent commitments, Yang! Remember, it’s a process, and you’re doing great. If you encounter challenges, we can always revisit them together. 

User: Thank you! I feel more optimistic about everything. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time! 

User: See you next time!
