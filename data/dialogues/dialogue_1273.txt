Consultant: Hello, Yuuma! It's great to see you today. I want to help create a comfortable space for you. How are you feeling right now?

User: Hi. I don’t know… I just want to play with my train toys.

Consultant: That's perfectly fine! Playing with your train toys sounds enjoyable. Can you tell me what you like most about playing with them?

User: The trains go fast. I like watching them move.

Consultant: Watching the trains move quickly is exciting! It must feel nice to see them in action. How does playing with the trains make you feel inside?

User: I don’t really know. I just like it.

Consultant: It sounds like it brings you some joy. It's good to have things that make us happy. Are there any other activities or toys you enjoy besides trains?

User: No. Just trains.

Consultant: Trains are really special then! I appreciate you sharing that with me. Sometimes, having a favorite thing can be comforting. Do you feel comfortable playing with your trains when there are other people around, like your family?

User: Sometimes. But sometimes they make noise.

Consultant: I understand—sometimes noise can be distracting. It’s important to feel comfortable while playing. What would make it easier for you to play with your trains when it’s noisy?

User: I don’t know. I just want it quiet.

Consultant: A quiet environment sounds nice. Finding a calm spot can really help. Maybe we can think about even using headphones or finding a quiet room for you to play sometimes. Would that be something you'd like to try?

User: Maybe. 

Consultant: That’s a good start! Trying new things can help us feel better. Let’s explore your love for trains a bit more. Do you have a favorite train toy at home?

User: The blue one. 

Consultant: The blue train sounds special! It must be fun to play with. What do you do when you play with your blue train?

User: I make it go fast.

Consultant: Going fast must feel thrilling! Do you pretend your blue train is going on adventures?

User: Sometimes, it goes to the station.

Consultant: That sounds like a great adventure! Going to the station can be exciting. Can you tell me more about what happens at the station in your games?

User: Other trains are there. They come and go.

Consultant: It sounds like a busy place with lots happening! It’s wonderful that you can create your own stories with your trains. How does it feel to be in control of them?

User: It feels good.

Consultant: That’s excellent! Having control and creating your own fun is very powerful. I want you to know that it’s okay to share your feelings, even if they are a little unclear or simple. There’s no rush to express everything. Would you like to keep playing with your blue train in our next session?

User: Yes.

Consultant: Great! We can focus on your blue train and what adventures it goes on. I’m here to support you while you share those experiences. It's wonderful to start building a friendship here. Before we finish today, is there anything else you want to tell me about your trains or how you feel?

User: No. Just trains.

Consultant: That's perfectly fine, Yuuma! We can explore your trains more next time. Thank you for sharing your interests with me today; it’s really valuable. Remember, it’s safe to express yourself here. I look forward to seeing you again and having more train adventures together!

Consultant: Hello, Yuma! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling about the new toys you’ve been exploring?

User: (looks at the new toy) I like it. It spins.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It sounds like you find it interesting when it spins. What do you enjoy most about playing with it?

User: (slowly) It goes fast. (smiles slightly)

Consultant: It sounds like you really enjoy the speed! Do you feel happy when you see it spinning quickly?

User: (nods) Yes. Happy.

Consultant: That’s wonderful, Yuma! Happiness is an important feeling. Can you tell me if there are other toys or activities that make you feel happy too?

User: (thinks, then points to another toy) That one. It makes noise.

Consultant: So, the one that makes noise also makes you happy! How does the sound from that toy make you feel?

User: (pauses) Loud. (fidgets slightly)

Consultant: I understand that it’s loud for you. Sometimes loud sounds can be surprising. But it seems like you still enjoy it. Would you like to try playing with both toys together?

User: (looks back and forth between the toys) Maybe.

Consultant: It’s okay to take your time deciding. Trying new things can be fun. What would it feel like to play with both toys at the same time?

User: (concentrates) Busy. 

Consultant: Being busy can be exciting! Playing with both toys could give you a lot to do. Let’s imagine what that might look like together. How do you think they would work together?

User: (quietly) Spin and noise.

Consultant: Awesome! They could spin and make noise at the same time. That sounds like a lot of fun! Playing like that could help us see how you feel. Would you like to try it now?

User: (nods softly) Okay.

Consultant: Let’s start with the one that spins, then we can add the noisy toy as well. What do you think will happen when we play with both?

User: (concentrates) More fun.

Consultant: Yes, it sounds like it could really be more fun! I’m here with you to explore it together. Let’s see what happens!

User: (toys in hand, begins to play) Look!

Consultant: Wow! I see how excited you are about that! Are you feeling happy playing with them together?

User: (smiles) Happy!

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Yuma! Your smile shows that you’re having fun. Can you tell me what you like the most about playing with them now?

User: (points) They move!

Consultant: Yes! They move in different ways. How do you feel when they move together like that?

User: (giggles) Fast!

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear you laughing! It seems like the speed of the toys brings you joy. Let’s keep exploring this feeling. What do you think will happen next when you keep playing?

User: (thinking hard) More spin.

Consultant: More spinning sounds exciting! What do you think would happen if we try to make them spin faster together?

User: (enthusiastically) Yeah! I try!

Consultant: I love your enthusiasm! Let’s see if we can make it happen. While we play, I want you to know we can talk about how you feel at any time.

User: (playfully spins toys) Spin fast!

Consultant: Great job, Yuma! Those toys are spinning really well. How does that make you feel now?

User: (smiling widely) Good!

Consultant: That’s amazing! Feeling good is so important. As we continue playing, let’s remember how you felt with the toys. This is a wonderful experience for you.

User: (waves toys) Yay!

Consultant: Yay indeed! You’ve done a fantastic job exploring your feelings with these toys today. Can you tell me one thing you really enjoyed about our playtime?

User: (pauses, looking thoughtful) Spin toys together... happy.

Consultant: That’s an excellent insight, Yuma! Playing with the spinning toys made you feel happy. As we continue, we can use these happy feelings to explore even more together, okay?

User: (nods) Okay.

Consultant: I’m really proud of you today, Yuma. Let’s keep working on this in our future sessions. Remember, each time we play, we can discover new ways you can express your feelings. How does that sound?

User: (smiles softly) Yes!

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. Let's take a moment to talk about how you've been feeling lately. What would you like to share about your recent experiences?

User: (reflectively) I see some pictures… they make me happy sometimes. I want to show them, but… it's hard to say. 

Consultant: I understand that you want to share those pictures with me, and that's a great start. Images can express feelings in ways that words sometimes can't. Can you point to something you like about a picture when you have it?

User: (nods slightly) The colors... they are... good. 

Consultant: That's wonderful! The colors made you feel good. Let's explore that a bit more. When you look at those colors, what kind of feelings do they spark for you?

User: (pauses) Happy. Like... sunshine. 

Consultant: Sunshine is a beautiful feeling to associate with colors! It sounds like these images bring you a sense of warmth and joy. Can we use this feeling to help you express something you might want or need? 

User: (looks down) Need... to play. 

Consultant: Playing sounds very important! It can be a great way to express yourself. What kind of play or activity do you think you would like to do today?

User: (tentatively) Blocks... building. 

Consultant: Building with blocks sounds like a fantastic activity! It not only allows you to create but also encourages interaction. Would you feel comfortable showing me your blocks while we play together?

User: (slowly nods) Okay... yes. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine what we can build together. As we create, you can tell me about what you’re making or even just show me with your hands. How does that sound to you?

User: (a little brighter) Can... build a house? 

Consultant: Absolutely! Building a house together sounds fun. As we work on it, we can also think about the feelings it brings—like how happy you feel when you create something. What color do you want for the house?

User: (pointing) Blue! 

Consultant: Blue is a calming and lovely choice for a house. I can see that you're getting more engaged, and I really appreciate that. While we build, if you have any feelings or thoughts, you can share them or show me with your body language too.

User: (starts playing with blocks) Yes... building... happy… 

Consultant: I notice you’re expressing happiness through your actions! That’s wonderful. As you build, let’s also think about how it feels to create something with your hands. Do you feel any different when you focus on your blocks?

User: (concentrating) Yes... more... good. 

Consultant: That's great to hear! So, focusing on the blocks helps you feel good. Let's keep that feeling in mind. If at any point you want to tell me something about how you feel during our playing, feel free to gesture or point to the blocks, okay?

User: (smiles gently) Okay… 

Consultant: Fantastic! Can you also try to use a word or sound to express your joy while you continue to build? It could be anything that feels natural for you.

User: (quietly) Um... Yay!

Consultant: I love that! “Yay” is a perfect expression of joy. The more you share these feelings—through play, words, or sounds—the better you’ll communicate what you want. Would you like to try expressing how you feel with your blocks now?

User: (enthusiastically) Yes! Happy blocks!

Consultant: "Happy blocks" is such a wonderful phrase! It shows how the blocks and the activity make you feel. Let’s work together to make your happy blocks even more special. Perhaps we can add a garden or trees to your house?

User: (grinning) Trees… yes!

Consultant: Perfect! While we add those trees, let's remember how building and creating made you feel excited and happy. This is a step toward sharing your ideas without worrying, right?

User: (more animated) Yes! I want... show all! 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Sharing is such a beautiful way to connect with others. Remember, as we build and play together, you can share anything you’re feeling or thinking. How about you share this with me while we place the trees around our house?

User: (nods and places trees) Trees! 

Consultant: Wonderful! I can see you're gaining confidence in sharing your ideas. Can you tell me what the trees make you feel, or maybe even show me?

User: (pointing with excitement) Green! 

Consultant: Green is a lovely color! It represents life and energy, much like how you engage with your blocks and trees. It's fantastic to see you opening up and expressing more. What about using this energy to express how you want to play more often in the future?

User: (thoughtfully) Play… every day! 

Consultant: Playing every day sounds like a wonderful goal. It could help you express more and strengthen your connections with others. I believe we’ve made significant progress today—exploring your feelings through play is key. 

User: (smiling) Happy... play every day! 

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! As we wrap up today’s session, remember that you can carry these feelings into your everyday life. I can’t wait to see what you come up with next time. 

User: (nodding) Thank you! 

Consultant: Thank you for sharing today. You’ve done a fantastic job expressing yourself and building connections through play. If you ever feel unsure, remember you can always use your blocks or colors to help express how you're feeling. I'm looking forward to our next session together!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yuma! I'm glad you could join me today. It seems like you are gradually opening up, and that’s wonderful. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello. I’m not sure... I still feel kind of distant, but I am trying to play games with others more. It feels different, but I don’t know what to say.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel distant at times, and it's great to hear that you’re trying to engage with others in games. What has made you want to play games with others, and how does it feel when you do?

User: I think it’s fun, and sometimes I want to be part of what they are doing. But I don’t always know how to join in, or what to say.

Consultant: Feeling the desire to be part of the group is a significant step, Yuma. It sounds like you enjoy the fun, but joining in can be a bit challenging. Can you share what happens when you try to join in? 

User: Well, sometimes I just watch and smile, but I don’t say much. I want to play, but I’m stuck.

Consultant: Watching and smiling is definitely a positive sign! You're expressing interest, even if the words aren't coming out just yet. Could we explore some simple ways you might feel more comfortable saying something when you're playing?

User: Maybe... I could say just one word, like "play"? But I’m not always sure when to say it.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Starting with a simple word like "play" can make it easier to join in. Let’s think about some situations where you could say that word. When do you think it would be appropriate to jump in during the game?

User: If they are laughing or having fun, maybe I could say it then.

Consultant: Yes, that sounds perfect! Joining in during moments of laughter can create a friendly environment. How do you think you would feel if you said "play" at that moment?

User: I think maybe I would feel happy, but also scared... What if they ignore me?

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel scared about being ignored, Yuma. But remember, being brave to say something is already a big victory! If they do ignore you, it doesn’t mean you did something wrong; it might be they didn’t hear you. Would you like to practice how to say "play" with me now?

User: Okay… "Play!"

Consultant: Great job! That was clear and strong. Practicing like this can help you feel more confident. Let’s discuss some ways you can handle it if things don't go as you hope after saying "play." How would you respond if someone didn’t seem to notice you?

User: Maybe I could try again or say something else...

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Trying again shows determination, and saying something else might help you find a way back into the game. Let’s imagine a scenario: you say "play," and they don’t hear. What could your next step be?

User: I could wave my hand, maybe, or I could say "can I join?"

Consultant: Waving your hand is a great, visual way to catch their attention, and asking "can I join?" is a lovely way to express your interest! How do you feel about these strategies?

User: I feel a little bit better. It’s nice to think I can say something to them.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Yuma! Recognizing that you can communicate is a vital step. Over time, it might become easier to express yourself. Do you think we can visualize a time in the future where you successfully join in during a game?

User: Yes, that sounds good. I can see me playing with them and laughing.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful image, Yuma! Laughter and play often come together. As we continue, let’s remember that this moment where you see yourself playing happily can motivate your actions. What steps could you take toward this visualization?

User: Maybe I can practice in smaller games first?

Consultant: Absolutely! Starting with smaller games can help build your confidence before moving to larger ones. You can also find familiar friends to start with. How would you feel about trying this in your next game?

User: I’d like to try that. It seems easier with friends I know.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Choosing familiar friends makes it a safe space for you. Let's summarize what we’ve learned today so you can keep practicing these strategies.

User: Okay! I can start by saying "play," and if they don’t hear me, I can wave my hand or ask to join.

Consultant: Exactly! Remembering these strategies will help you express yourself better. How do you feel about reflecting on our conversation today? 

User: I think I did good. I feel like I can try, which is nice.

Consultant: I'm so proud of you, Yuma! You've made significant progress today. As we prepare to conclude our session, let’s think about how we can continue supporting you in your journey. What are some ideas for future sessions or practice you envision?

User: Maybe we can talk more about other games or how to talk to people?

Consultant: Those sound like excellent topics for our future sessions, Yuma! I look forward to hearing more about your experiences. Remember, you are always welcome here. If you ever feel unsure, know that reaching out for support is a brave thing to do. 

User: Thank you! I’ll try my best.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in you, Yuma. Keep practicing what we discussed, and I can’t wait to see how you grow. Take care until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yuma! I'm glad you're here with me today. How are you feeling since our last session, especially in your interactions with your mother?

User: Hello. I think I've been a little better. I can talk to my mom more during playtime. It's nice, but sometimes I still don’t know what to say.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear that you've been able to talk more! It sounds like you're making progress. Can you share a bit more about those moments when you interact with your mom? What do you enjoy during those times?

User: I like playing games with her. Sometimes I laugh, but I still feel shy to say a lot. 

Consultant: It’s great that you find joy in playing games! Feeling shy is natural, especially when you're trying to express yourself. Can you think of a moment when you felt comfortable laughing and maybe said something unexpected?

User: Yes, once we played with blocks, and I told her it looked like a tower. She smiled and built one too.

Consultant: That’s a lovely interaction, Yuma! Building and sharing ideas is a big step forward. What do you think helped you say that? 

User: I felt happy and wanted to show her my tower. 

Consultant: That happiness made it easier for you to share your thoughts! Let's explore a bit further—can you remember times when you felt shy or unsure and what that felt like?

User: Sometimes, I just stay quiet when I want to play, and it feels lonely. 

Consultant: I understand, Yuma. It can be lonely to keep things inside. What do you think might help you feel more confident to express yourself during those quiet moments? 

User: Maybe if we have more fun activities, I can try to talk more. 

Consultant: That's a great idea! Fun activities can open up chances for conversation. What kind of activities do you think could help you express yourself more?

User: More games, like drawing or pretend play. 

Consultant: Drawing and pretending sound exciting! They can also help you share your ideas without feeling pressured. Have you drawn something recently that you’d like to show your mom?

User: I drew a big dinosaur. I want to tell her it’s a friendly dinosaur! 

Consultant: That sounds amazing! A friendly dinosaur is a wonderful concept. How do you think your mom will react when you tell her about it?

User: She will probably laugh and like it! 

Consultant: Absolutely! That laughter can create a nice bonding moment. Would you like to plan a time to show her your dinosaur and share your thoughts about it?

User: Yes, I think I will do it this weekend!

Consultant: Perfect! Having a plan makes it easier. What do you hope to say when you show her your drawing?

User: I want to tell her that it's a friendly dinosaur that likes to play. 

Consultant: That’s a lovely message! It shows your creativity and your desire to connect. When you practice saying it in your mind, how does that make you feel? 

User: It makes me feel excited and a little nervous. 

Consultant: That excitement and nervousness are completely normal! Remember, your mom will likely appreciate your effort to share. How can you turn that nervous feeling into a fun experience? 

User: Maybe by thinking about how happy she will be! 

Consultant: Yes! Focusing on her happiness can help lessen the nerves. You’re doing a fantastic job thinking positively about it. Let’s talk about how we can continue to build on these interactions moving forward. How do you feel about practicing this regularly? 

User: I want to try! 

Consultant: That's a great mindset! Regular practice will help you feel more comfortable. What other ways can you think of to make these interactions easier and more enjoyable? 

User: I can ask her to play new games and talk about them. 

Consultant: Asking about new games is an excellent way to start conversations! It shows interest. As we prepare to wrap up today, what would you say is the most important thing you’ve learned during our sessions together?

User: I learned I can talk and share my ideas more. 

Consultant: That's a significant realization, Yuma! You’ve made great strides in expressing yourself. Let’s keep building on this progress. Remember, communication can be fun. I look forward to hearing more about your adventures with your mom in our next session!
