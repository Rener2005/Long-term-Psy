Consultant: Hello, little one! I'm glad you're here today. Let's talk about what’s been on your mind. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I feel really lonely. My parents are divorced, and sometimes I just wish they would get along so we could be a happy family again. I hate feeling like this.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really missing the connection between your parents and that it’s making you feel lonely. Can you tell me more about how this affects your daily life, especially at school?

User: At school, I don't feel like I fit in with other kids. I see them playing together, and I feel left out. Sometimes, I just want to go home and hide in my room.

Consultant: It must be tough feeling isolated like that. You mentioned wanting to fit in better. What would it be like for you if you felt more connected with other kids at school?

User: I think I would feel happier. I want to have friends I can talk to and share things with. Instead, I feel like no one understands me.

Consultant: Feeling misunderstood can be really painful. Let’s explore this a bit. When you’re around other kids, what thoughts go through your mind that might be making you feel that way?

User: I often think that no one wants to talk to me because of my family situation. Like they see me differently or something.

Consultant: Those thoughts about how others perceive you can be very hard to shake off. Can you think of any evidence or examples that contradict that belief? Maybe instances where kids were nice or friendly?

User: Sometimes kids do talk to me during lunch, but I just think they’re being nice out of pity. I can't help but feel they don’t really want me around.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Let’s challenge that thought a bit. If a friend told you they felt like others were only being nice out of pity, what would you say to them?

User: I guess I would tell them that maybe the kids just want to be friends, and it’s not about pity.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s often easier to see the positive in others’ feelings than in our own. How might it feel to shift that perspective about your interactions with your classmates?

User: I don’t know. It could be nice to think that they really want to be friends. But I still feel nervous approaching them.

Consultant: It’s perfectly okay to feel nervous. It could help to practice some small steps. What’s a simple way you could start a conversation with someone you want to befriend?

User: Maybe I could ask someone about the homework or a game they played during recess.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic start! Small interactions can open doors to deeper connections. How do you think you’d feel after trying that?

User: I’d probably feel a bit better if it worked. But what if they ignore me?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Remember, not every interaction will go perfectly, and that’s normal. What if you prepared yourself beforehand? For instance, what could you remind yourself to stay positive?

User: I guess I could tell myself that it’s okay if one person doesn’t want to talk. There are others, too.

Consultant: Wonderful! Focusing on the fact that there are many kids in class can lessen the pressure. Let’s also think about how you can express your feelings about your home situation. Would you feel comfortable sharing with a trusted teacher or a school counselor?

User: I never thought about that. Talking to someone could help me feel less alone.

Consultant: Yes, discussing your feelings might really help. It’s important to have support. How do you feel about exploring that option?

User: I feel more encouraged to try it now! Just the idea of not keeping everything bottled up feels good.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! It sounds like you’re starting to see some paths forward. As we wrap up today, let’s think about what you want to focus on until our next session. What is one thing you’d like to try?

User: I want to approach at least one person at school and ask about homework, and maybe talk to a teacher about how I feel.

Consultant: Those are great goals! Remember to be patient with yourself through this process. You’re working on building connections, and that takes time. I believe in you!

User: Thanks! I feel a little lighter sharing this. I can’t wait to see how it goes!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences. Remember, you’re not alone in this, and I’m here for you. Until next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Hong! I'm really glad you're back for our session today. I know you wanted to talk more about your feelings of loneliness and your experiences in social situations. How have things been for you since our last meeting?

User: Hi! Well, I’ve been trying to join more activities, but I still feel a bit lonely. Everyone else seems to have close friends, and I just don’t quite fit in. It makes me feel sad.

Consultant: I completely understand. It can be tough to feel like others have close friendships while you're still trying to connect. Can you share about a specific moment in one of these activities where you felt particularly lonely or out of place?

User: Yeah, during the last game we played, everyone was laughing and having fun. I tried to join in, but I felt like I was on the outside, you know? It was like I was there physically, but not really included.

Consultant: That sounds really hard for you. Feeling present but disconnected can be very painful. What thoughts went through your mind in that moment? Did you notice any specific feelings that accompanied those thoughts?

User: I thought maybe it was because I’m not fun enough or that they just don’t like me. I felt really sad and started thinking I would never have a close friend.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound pretty heavy. It’s common to think that way when feeling left out, but let’s take a moment to question them. Is there any evidence that supports the idea that you’re not fun enough or that people don’t like you?

User: I guess not. Sometimes, I can make jokes and people do laugh, but it doesn’t feel like I have that special connection with anyone.

Consultant: That's an important insight, Xiao Hong. So, there are moments when you connect and make others laugh. It might be worth exploring how to use those moments to foster deeper connections. What do you think could help you to reach out more and create those closer friendships?

User: Maybe I could invite someone to do something outside of school? Like hanging out or doing a fun activity together.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Inviting someone to share an experience can open the door to a closer friendship. Do you have someone in mind that you might want to invite?

User: There’s a girl named Lucy in my class. She seems nice and sometimes we laugh together. I could ask her to the park or something.

Consultant: Excellent! Lucy seems like a good candidate for a friend. How do you feel about reaching out to her? What thoughts are coming to mind as you consider this?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited at the same time. I really want to make a friend.

Consultant: Those feelings are completely normal and understandable. Let’s try to break it down. What’s the worst that could happen if you ask her to hang out? 

User: I suppose she could say no or it would be awkward.

Consultant: If she were to say no, how would that impact your overall feelings? Would it be as painful as you might think?

User: I think it would hurt a little, but it wouldn’t be the end of the world. I would probably just try again later.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! Remember, each time you reach out, you’re practicing and building your social skills. How about we set a goal for next week? Maybe you can prepare a way to invite Lucy to the park?

User: Yes, I can try to come up with something fun we could do there. That sounds good!

Consultant: Perfect! I’m excited for you. Let's review what you can say to make it feel more comfortable when inviting her. What might you say to her?

User: Maybe I could say, “Hey Lucy, do you want to go to the park and hang out this weekend?” Does that sound okay?

Consultant: That sounds just right! It’s friendly and straightforward. How might you feel after you invite her, regardless of her response?

User: I think I’d feel proud of myself for trying! It might help me feel a bit more confident too.

Consultant: Exactly! Just taking that action can boost your confidence. Remember that progress in building connections takes time and practice. As you continue to engage, you’ll likely feel more comfortable as well. How does that make you feel about moving forward?

User: I feel hopeful! I really want to work on this and get to know more people.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful attitude to have, Xiao Hong. It’s great to see this hopefulness. Before we wrap up, let’s think about other social tasks you could explore. How about we brainstorm a few fun activities you could join to meet new friends?

User: Maybe joining a club or sports team? That might help too!

Consultant: Absolutely! Clubs and teams are excellent for building connections and friendships. Remember, each small step you take is moving you closer to feeling more connected.  

User: I’ll try my best!

Consultant: I believe in you! We can touch base again soon to see how your invitations are going and plan the next steps. Thank you for today’s conversation, and keep taking those steps towards connection!

User: Thank you! I feel better after talking.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaohong! I'm glad to see you again today. Last time, we talked about your recent family activity and how it made you feel happy. Can you share more about that experience and how it has impacted you?

User: Hi! Yes, that family activity was really nice. I felt happy spending time with my mom and dad together. It made me wish we could have more of those moments, but I'm still confused about how to feel okay about everything since they are divorced.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you enjoyed the time with your parents! Wanting to experience more of those moments is completely normal, especially considering your family situation. How do you feel about your parents' separate roles in your life since the divorce?

User: I guess it's just really different now. I love my mom, and I enjoy the time with her. But with my dad, it's like I have to adjust every time we meet. I want to feel good about both relationships—I just don't know how.

Consultant: That makes sense, Xiaohong. Balancing relationships can be challenging, especially in a single-parent family. It sounds like you're striving for a sense of normalcy with both your mom and dad. What would make you feel more comfortable when you're with each of them?

User: I think if I could have more fun activities with both of them together, it would help. But sometimes I worry that they might feel awkward around each other.

Consultant: It's understandable to have those worries. Perhaps we can explore some activities that could create a more relaxed atmosphere for all of you. What kinds of activities do you think would be enjoyable for your family?

User: Maybe playing games or going to the park? That way, we can all just focus on having fun together, without too much pressure.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful ideas! Engaging in fun activities can definitely help ease any tension. How would you feel initiating such activities with both of them? What thoughts come to your mind when you think about doing that?

User: I think it would be really great, but I’m also a bit scared of their reaction. What if they don’t want to?

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel scared in those situations. Let’s take a moment to think about the possibility of them saying yes. What do you think could help you approach the idea with them?

User: Maybe I could just tell them how much I enjoyed that last activity? I could suggest we do more things together.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic approach! Expressing your feelings about the last family time can show them how much it meant to you. What emotions do you think you might experience when you share this with them?

User: I would feel happy if they agreed. But there’s still this little feeling of nervousness that maybe they won't feel the same way.

Consultant: It's okay to feel nervous; it's part of sharing your hopes with others. What if we considered how you might respond if they don’t feel the same way? How could you handle that?

User: I think I would try to understand why they feel that way. If they don’t want to do it, I shouldn't take it personally, right?

Consultant: Exactly, that’s a very healthy perspective! Understanding their feelings can help keep the lines of communication open. It's important to remember that your feelings are valid, regardless of their response. How does this idea of managing your feelings make you feel?

User: It makes me feel a bit more relaxed. I guess it means I can try to enjoy the moments we do have, even if things aren’t perfect.

Consultant: That's a wonderful insight, Xiaohong! Embracing the moments you can share, regardless of the circumstances, can certainly enhance your overall happiness. Would you like to set a goal for how to approach your parents about these family activities?

User: Yes, I think I’m ready to talk to them. Maybe I can bring it up during our next family dinner.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Having a set time can make it easier. How about we discuss ways to prepare for that conversation? What do you think you might say to start it off?

User: I’ll start by telling them how much I appreciate those moments we had and then suggest more fun times together.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Sharing your appreciation sets a positive tone for the discussion. After you bring it up, how would you like to reflect on how the conversation went?

User: I could write down my feelings after it, maybe even how I think they felt about it too. That way, I can see what went well and what I can do next time.

Consultant: That’s excellent thinking! Writing can help clarify your thoughts and feelings. After this conversation, we can discuss how it went and what you learned from it. Let’s make sure to keep nurturing that joy of family time together. 

User: I’m really looking forward to it! I feel like I have a better handle on everything now.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! You've made great progress in understanding your emotions and the dynamics of your family. Together, we'll keep building on that. Would you feel comfortable sharing any ideas about how you might engage with your friends about these experiences as well?

User: I think I would like to share my happiness with my friends! Maybe I can invite them to join us sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant initiative! Including your friends in family activities can open up new connections. It can also reinforce your positive feelings about your family. How does that prospect make you feel?

User: It makes me feel excited! I think it would be fun to have both my friends and family together.

Consultant: That excitement is truly infectious, Xiaohong! Combining family and friendship can create warm, memorable experiences. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize what you’ve gained and the steps ahead. What would you say are your biggest takeaways?

User: I learned that it’s okay to talk to my parents and express what I want. I feel more confident about the family activities, and I’m ready to share my feelings!

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Your confidence has grown, and you now have a clear plan moving forward. Remember to keep that open communication with your parents and enjoy the family moments. I’m really looking forward to hearing how it goes next time. You are doing so well, Xiaohong!

User: Thank you! I’m really grateful for your help. I feel happier about everything now!

Consultant: You are very welcome! It's been a pleasure working with you. Keep celebrating those small victories and don’t hesitate to reach out whenever you need support. Until next time, take care!

Consultant: Hello, Little Red! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since your performance in class?

User: Hi! I feel happier since getting positive feedback from my classmates. It’s nice to be noticed, but I still sometimes feel lonely thinking about my family situation.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you felt positive about the performance! It seems like you’re experiencing some mixed emotions about your family and social life. Could you tell me more about how your performance made you feel in terms of your confidence?

User: After the performance, I felt so proud! I was really nervous at first, but after seeing my friends cheer for me, I felt like I could do anything. 

Consultant: That’s an amazing feeling, Little Red! It sounds like this experience really boosted your confidence. How do you think we can take that confidence and apply it to other social situations?

User: I guess I could try to join more activities with my classmates. But I still worry that they might not want to be friends with me.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a bit worried about that. Let’s explore this thought together. What evidence do you have that they don't want to be friends with you?

User: Well, sometimes I feel like they are closer to each other and might not include me in their games.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Let's think about it—could there be other reasons for their behavior? Sometimes, kids just get caught up in their own little groups without realizing it. 

User: Maybe. But I do wish they'd invite me more often. It makes me feel left out.

Consultant: Feeling left out is tough, and it's important to acknowledge that. How about we brainstorm some activities or ways you could reach out to them? 

User: I could invite some of them to do a project together or join a club at school. 

Consultant: Great ideas, Little Red! Taking that initiative can help you strengthen those friendships. How would it feel for you to take that first step and invite them?

User: I would feel nervous but excited. I'd really want to do it!

Consultant: That’s a perfect mix of emotions to have! Remember, taking that step is what builds connection. What’s a small action you could take this week to move toward inviting them?

User: Maybe I could talk to one of them tomorrow and ask if they want to work on a project together.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan! Let’s think about how you’ll approach the conversation. What will you say?

User: I could say, "Hey! Do you want to work together on the project? I think it would be fun!"

Consultant: That’s a fantastic way to approach it! Simple and inviting. How do you think they might respond to that?

User: I hope they’d say yes! They’re usually nice when I’m talking to them.

Consultant: I’m sure they’ll appreciate your invitation. Now, after you do this, how will you reflect on the experience, regardless of how they respond?

User: I guess I could remind myself that I took a step and tried my best. That’s important too.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s key to recognize your courage in putting yourself out there. What affirmations or positive thoughts can you tell yourself after taking this step?

User: I can say, "I’m brave for trying, and I deserve friendships." 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful affirmation! Repeating that will help solidify your growing confidence. How else could you practice feeling good about yourself in social situations?

User: I think I could maybe compliment someone in class or say something nice to them.

Consultant: That's a lovely idea! Compliments can really open the door to connections. Would you like to set a goal for complimenting someone in this coming week?

User: Yes! I’ll try to give at least one compliment every day.

Consultant: That sounds like a very achievable goal! As you do this, remember to pay attention to how it makes you feel about yourself. Through these small steps, you’re continuing to build your confidence. How are you feeling about everything we’ve talked about today?

User: I feel really good! I’m excited to try out my ideas. 

Consultant: I’m thrilled to hear that, Little Red! Remember, every small action counts, and you’re doing great work in strengthening your social skills. It’s been wonderful discussing this with you. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful now, and I can’t wait to share how it goes next time.

Consultant: I look forward to hearing about your experiences! Keep embracing that courage, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything before our next session. Have a great week!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Hong! I'm glad to see you again for today’s session. How have you been feeling since our last talk, especially with your new friendship?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really happy. Being with my new friend during our extracurricular activity made me feel accepted. It’s nice to have someone to share things with.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great that you're experiencing the warmth of friendship. Can you share what specific moments with your friend made you feel the happiest?

User: We worked together on a project and laughed a lot. I felt like I could really be myself around her. It’s a nice change since I usually feel lonely at school.

Consultant: It’s lovely to hear that you felt comfortable being yourself. That’s an important part of any friendship. How do you think this friendship has changed how you feel about school?

User: I think I’m looking forward to school more now. Before, I just went through the motions, but now I actually want to go because of her. It makes me feel less alone.

Consultant: It seems like this friendship has positively impacted your feelings about school! Since you want to maintain and strengthen this friendship, what do you think are some good ways to spend more time together?

User: I was thinking we could hang out after school, maybe work on homework together or just talk more. I want to make sure we keep this connection.

Consultant: Those sound like great ideas! Spending more time together can definitely help solidify your friendship. How do you feel about reaching out to her to suggest these plans?

User: I feel a bit nervous because I don't want to seem too pushy. What if she’s busy or doesn’t want to hang out?

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about that. Perhaps you could frame it as an invitation without pressure. You might say, “Would you like to study together or hang out sometime?” This way, it feels more casual. How does that sound to you?

User: I think that makes sense! It sounds less scary that way. I just don’t want to mess up this friendship.

Consultant: You’re being thoughtful about it, which is already a great step! Remember, friendships are about give and take, and it's natural for friends to have different schedules sometimes. If she can’t this time, it doesn’t mean she doesn’t enjoy being friends with you. How do you feel about that?

User: That makes me feel better. I just worry too much sometimes. I guess I should give it a try!

Consultant: Giving it a try is a fantastic approach! So what’s our next step? Would you like to create a plan on how to invite her to hang out or study?

User: Yes, I’d like to prepare how I can ask her. Maybe I can send her a message today!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan. Crafting a message can help you feel more in control. What would you like to include in your message to make it inviting?

User: I want to be friendly and say how fun it was working together. I think I’ll ask her if she wants to study over the weekend.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Being friendly and referencing your previous time together can help create a positive tone. Would you like to write the message together now?

User: Sure, let’s do that! I could use some help to make it sound good.

Consultant: Absolutely! How about starting with, “Hi [Friend’s Name], I really enjoyed working together on our project. Would you like to study together this weekend?” 

User: I like that! It’s friendly and simple. Should I add anything else?

Consultant: Maybe you could add a specific time, like “I was thinking Saturday afternoon, but I’m open if you have other times in mind.” This shows flexibility. What do you think?

User: That’s a great idea! I’ll feel more organized that way. I’ll add it!

Consultant: Fantastic! Now that you have your message ready, how do you feel about sending it?

User: I feel a little more confident now. I can always just send it and see what happens!

Consultant: I believe in you, Xiao Hong! Getting it out there is an important step. Remember, no matter the outcome, reaching out itself is a positive action for your friendship.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’ll let you know how it goes next time!

Consultant: Absolutely, I’m looking forward to hearing about it! And remember, it’s all about building connections. You’re doing great!

User: I feel better about everything already. Thank you so much for today!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s wonderful to see you gaining confidence. Let’s continue building on this support next time. Have a lovely day, Xiao Hong!

Consultant: Hello, little one! I'm really glad you're here for our session today. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better lately. My mom and my teacher have been really supportive, and it's nice to know they care. But sometimes, I still feel a bit lonely.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling better and that your mom and teacher are there for you! It's perfectly normal to feel lonely sometimes, though. Can you tell me more about what makes you feel lonely?

User: I think it's because my friends are busy a lot, and I don't always get to play or hang out with them. I miss having someone to talk to.

Consultant: It sounds like you really value those connections with your friends. What do you usually do when you feel lonely? 

User: I often read books or listen to music. It helps, but sometimes I just wish I could talk to someone.

Consultant: Those are great ways to cope! However, reaching out for support can also be very helpful. Have you thought about ways to connect with your friends or even making new ones?

User: I guess I could invite some of my friends over to play games. I haven't done that in a while.

Consultant: That sounds like a fun idea! Inviting friends over could be a wonderful way to reconnect and have some enjoyable times together. What games do you think you’d like to play with them?

User: I really like playing board games and video games. They could be fun!

Consultant: Those are great choices! Board games can encourage teamwork and laughter. And video games could be a fun way to bond. How do you think you would feel after spending time with your friends like that?

User: I think it would make me really happy! I love spending time with my friends, and it feels good to laugh and play.

Consultant: That happiness and connection are so important! Let's think about what steps you could take this week to make that happen. What do you feel like is holding you back from inviting them over?

User: I sometimes worry they might not want to come, or maybe they are too busy.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to worry about that. However, you might be surprised! Sometimes friends are more than happy to make time for each other. What if you just asked them and see what their reactions are?

User: That sounds okay. Maybe I’ll just text them and see if they want to come over this weekend.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Sending a text can feel less intimidating. Remember, even if they can’t come this time, you can always try again later. How does that make you feel?

User: It makes me feel a bit more excited! I like the idea of reaching out.

Consultant: I’m happy to hear that! It’s a brave step forward. Let’s check in on how you’re feeling about this invitation process next time we chat. Is there anything else you’ve been thinking about or any other concerns on your mind?

User: No, I think that’s it for now! I feel good about trying to connect with my friends.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Remember to celebrate those small steps you take. They contribute to your overall happiness. Before we wrap up, is there anything specific you'd like to focus on for our next meeting?

User: Maybe we could talk about how it went with my friends? I’d like to feel good about it, no matter what happens.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can definitely discuss your experiences with your friends next time. It sounds like you're really taking control of your feelings and relationships. I’m proud of you for your progress today! 

User: Thank you! I feel like I'm getting better at this!

Consultant: You truly are, and that’s something to be very proud of! Keep embracing those positive feelings and the support around you. I’m looking forward to hearing about your connection with your friends next time. 

User: Me too! Thank you for your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Have a wonderful time, and just remember, you are not alone in this journey. See you next time!

User: Bye!

Consultant: Bye! Take care!
