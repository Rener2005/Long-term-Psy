Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today's session. I'm glad to have you here. Let's start by discussing how you've been feeling lately. What has been on your mind?

User: Hi! Well, ever since I transferred to this new school, I've been feeling really out of place. My classmates seem to be way ahead of me in studies, and it makes me feel kind of small and inadequate.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable to feel that way when faced with a new environment and increased academic expectations. Can you tell me more about how you cope with these feelings?

User: I usually find myself playing video games to escape. At first, I just thought it was a fun way to relax, but now I find it so hard to stop. It's like I get a rush of achievement from the games, and I forget about everything else.

Consultant: It makes sense that you would seek comfort in something that gives you a sense of accomplishment. Video games can be really engaging. But it’s good to be aware of how they’re affecting your studies and feelings towards school. Have you noticed any specific moments when you feel the urge to play instead of studying?

User: Yeah, especially when I sit down to do homework. I just feel overwhelmed and then my mind drifts to the games. It’s like I just want that quick satisfaction from playing rather than facing the hard work ahead of me.

Consultant: That sounds like a challenging cycle to be in. You're seeking immediate gratification from the games instead of dealing with the stress of schoolwork. How does that make you feel about your studies and your progress with your classmates?

User: I feel really anxious about my studies, and I sometimes wish I could just be as good as the others. It's frustrating because I know I can do well, but I keep getting sidetracked by games.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel frustrated when you're not meeting your own expectations. It seems like there’s a conflict between your desire to succeed academically and the satisfaction you find in gaming. What do you think might happen if you tried to reduce your gaming time and focus more on your studies?

User: I think I’d feel less guilty, but I’m also scared that I won’t be able to keep up with the studies. It seems like such a big change.

Consultant: Acknowledging that fear is a great first step. You might face challenges, but changing your routine could bring positive results as well. What might be one small step you could take to start balancing gaming and your studies?

User: Maybe I could set a timer for myself, so I only play for a certain amount of time. That way, I could still have fun but also get some studying done.

Consultant: That sounds like a reasonable approach! Setting limits can help you enjoy gaming without it taking over your time. How do you think you'd feel after trying this for a week?

User: I think I might feel a little more in control. If I can manage both, it could take off some pressure. 

Consultant: That’s a positive perspective! It’s about finding the right balance that works for you. Balancing enjoyable activities with your responsibilities might help you feel less anxious. Is there anything else you want to discuss about how you can approach your studies or gaming habits?

User: I wish I could feel more confident when talking to my classmates about school or when asking questions. 

Consultant: It’s common to feel isolated in a new environment, especially when you're struggling. What do you think holds you back from initiating those conversations with them?

User: I guess I fear they’ll think I’m not smart enough or that I’m bothering them with my questions. 

Consultant: That’s understandable, but remember that asking questions shows a desire to learn. Most classmates will appreciate your effort. What if you tried reaching out to just one person next time you’re there? How would that feel?

User: That might be okay. I think if I could find someone who’s friendly, I could probably manage it. 

Consultant: That’s a great idea. Making that first step could open doors to new friendships and support. It’s all about taking small steps, as we’ve talked about. Can you think of how you will approach this next time?

User: I think I’ll try to start a conversation with someone during lunch or after class. It might be easier then.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! By initiating a chat during a relaxed time, it can help reduce those feelings of pressure. How do you think this new approach would affect your feelings toward school and your studies?

User: I hope it’ll make me feel less alone. If I can connect with someone, I think it’ll help my confidence.

Consultant: Absolutely! Building connections can greatly improve how you feel about your environment, which can help ease that academic pressure. It seems like you’re making good strides towards understanding and addressing the challenges you’re facing. 

User: Thanks! It feels nice to have a clearer path forward.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a process, and you have the ability to overcome these challenges. Before we wrap up, let’s quickly summarize what you plan to do moving forward.

User: Right... I’ll limit my gaming time, try talking to a classmate, and focus on my homework more during set times.

Consultant: That sounds perfect. It’s all about small, manageable steps. I believe you can do this, and I’m here to support you. Remember, it's okay to seek help when you're feeling overwhelmed. I’m excited for our next session to hear about your experiences! 

User: Thank you! I'm looking forward to it too. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! Take care, and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad to see you here today. It's great that you're taking steps to address how you're feeling. Can you start by sharing a little about how you've been since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been trying to reduce my gaming time, but I still feel a lot of pressure about my studies. I find it hard to focus, and I feel isolated when I try to talk to my classmates.

Consultant: It sounds like you've been going through some tough times. Reducing your gaming time is a positive step, but feeling pressure academically and isolated can be overwhelming. Can you elaborate on what specific aspects of your studies make you feel pressured right now?

User: Well, I find it hard to concentrate on my homework, and I worry that my performance isn’t as good as it used to be. I also feel nervous talking to my classmates because I don’t know what to say.

Consultant: That makes sense. Balancing schoolwork and socializing can be challenging, especially when you're feeling anxious about your performance. If you could imagine what it would feel like to manage your studies without that pressure, what would that look like for you?

User: I guess I'd feel more relaxed and be able to participate more in class discussions without feeling nervous. 

Consultant: That's a great goal to aim for. Let's dig a little deeper—when you're studying and those feelings of pressure arise, what sorts of thoughts run through your mind at that time?

User: I often think that I'm going to fail or that my friends are doing way better than I am. It makes me want to give up.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite intense. It's normal to have concerns about school performance, but it seems like those thoughts are adding to your anxiety. Can you recall a specific instance when you felt overwhelmed by these thoughts? What were you doing, and how did it affect you?

User: I remember last week, I had a math assignment due. I spent hours staring at it but just couldn’t get started. I felt like everyone else was finishing their work while I was just stuck.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel stuck, especially under those pressures. Sometimes our minds can exaggerate situations, making us feel like we're the only ones struggling. How do you think you could challenge those thoughts about being stuck? What might be another way to view that situation?

User: I suppose I could remind myself that it's okay to take my time and that everyone has their struggles too.

Consultant: That sounds like a helpful perspective. Recognizing that it's okay to go at your own pace can really alleviate some pressure. How do you think you could incorporate that thought into your study routine?

User: Maybe I could set smaller goals for my assignments instead of trying to finish everything at once. That might help me feel less overwhelmed.

Consultant: Exactly! Breaking tasks into smaller, manageable steps can make everything feel more achievable. Have you tried using any rewards for yourself after completing a task? It might encourage you to stay focused.

User: No, I haven't thought about that. What kind of rewards do you mean?

Consultant: Rewards can be something simple, like taking a short break to play outside, reading a favorite book, or even enjoying some time to relax. What do you think would motivate you to keep working through your assignments?

User: I think playing football with my friends after I finish my homework would be really motivating. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Football can provide a great way to relax and connect with friends, which might also help you feel less isolated. Are there any opportunities for you to play regularly with your classmates?

User: There’s a game after school a few days a week. I haven’t gone yet because I was worried about my homework.

Consultant: Joining those games could be a wonderful way to bond with your classmates and ease some of that academic pressure. It sounds like it could also help you feel more connected at school. How do you feel about giving it a try?

User: I think I will! It sounds nice to be part of a team and have fun. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You're taking important steps toward feeling more connected and balanced. As we start to wrap up, how are you feeling about the strategies we've discussed today?

User: I feel more hopeful. It makes me think I can handle things better if I take it step by step and use football as a reward.

Consultant: That's great to hear, Zhao! Remember, taking small steps and recognizing your strengths can make a big difference. How about we set a goal for our next session? Maybe aim to join your classmates for football and share your experiences with your homework strategy?

User: That sounds like a good plan. I’ll give it a shot!

Consultant: Perfect! I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. You've done really well today. If you ever feel overwhelmed again, just know that it's okay to reach out.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: You're welcome, Zhao! Take care and enjoy your time playing football. See you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad to see you today. How have things been for you since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better because of the football competition. I made some new friends, and we won a couple of matches. But I still struggle with my studies. I just feel so overwhelmed.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling better and have made some friends through football! That sense of achievement can really help. Can you share more about what specifically is overwhelming you when it comes to your studies?

User: I just can't seem to focus. Whenever I sit down to study, my mind starts to wander, and I think about games or my friends instead. My parents are worried about my grades, and that adds even more pressure on me.

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like you have a lot on your mind, juggling both the pressure from your parents and your thoughts about gaming and friends. What do you think would help you feel more focused when studying?

User: Maybe if I could find a way to make studying more fun or interesting? Sometimes I just feel like I’m not cut out for it.

Consultant: That makes sense. Finding ways to make studying engaging could be really helpful. What subjects are you currently struggling with, and are there any aspects of them that you enjoy at all?

User: I really like reading stories, like "Water Margin" and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," but I find subjects like math really tough. I just can't see why it matters.

Consultant: It sounds like reading is a strong interest of yours. Perhaps we can connect your love for stories to your study habits in other subjects. How would you feel about using story elements to help make math more approachable?

User: That could be interesting! So, like using stories to understand math problems?

Consultant: Exactly! We could create scenarios or stories that involve math challenges. This way, it may feel less intimidating. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds cool! I’d like to try that. But I still worry about whether I can improve my grades.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those worries. Let’s focus on what we can control. Maybe we could also keep a record of both your achievements in football and your progress in studies, which will help you see your growth over time. What do you think?

User: That could help! I could see my progress and feel like I’m achieving something, not just dealing with pressure.

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping track of your successes in both football and academics can provide a balanced perspective. What are some positive things you accomplished recently that we could start noting?

User: Well, I scored a goal in our last match, and I also helped a classmate with his reading homework last week.

Consultant: Those are fantastic accomplishments! Scoring a goal shows your determination and teamwork, and helping a classmate demonstrates your knowledge and kindness. How did you feel doing those things?

User: I felt really proud, especially scoring the goal. It felt good to help my classmate too because he said it made him understand better.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Feeling proud of your achievements is important. Let’s carry that sense of pride into your studies as well. How about we set a small goal for your reading this week? Perhaps reading a chapter of a new book and summarizing it?

User: Yeah, I can do that! I like summarizing what I read—it makes me feel like I really understand the story.

Consultant: Great! Let’s make a plan for that. And as you do this, try to remind yourself that learning can also be about enjoying the process. If you were to think of your learning journey as a story, what kind of character do you want to be?

User: I want to be a hero who keeps trying despite challenges!

Consultant: I love that! Heroes often learn and grow through their challenges. So, how can we help you become that hero in your studies this week?

User: I guess by focusing on reading and enjoying it, rather than stressing about grades all the time.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! Remember, it’s all about the journey and those small successes that build up over time. We will check back next session to see how this new approach is working for you. 

User: Sounds good! I feel a bit more positive already about studying.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. Remember, it's perfectly fine to take things one step at a time. You’re already on the right track. Let’s keep nurturing that positive outlook.

User: Okay, I will do my best. I really appreciate your help!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Zhao. I look forward to hearing all about your achievements in the next session. Keep up the positive attitude, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything before then!

User: I will! Thank you so much!

Consultant: Take care, Zhao, and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad you're back for our session. I remember you’ve been exploring your experiences in the reading club. How have you been feeling lately about your studies and school life?

User: Hi! I think I've been feeling a mix of excitement and worry. Joining the reading club made me happy because I get to share what I think about the stories. But I still worry about my grades and how I’ll keep up.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re excited about sharing your thoughts in the reading club! That’s a positive step. Let’s talk about your worries too. What specifically about your grades is causing you to feel anxious?

User: I guess it’s just that I feel like I have to keep impressing my parents. When my grades dropped because of video games, they were really upset. I worry they’ll be angry again if I don’t do well.

Consultant: That sounds really stressful, and it’s understandable to feel that way, especially with the pressure from your parents. Let's explore this together. What would it look like for you to feel more at ease with your studies and your parents' expectations?

User: I think it would be nice if I could just focus on my studies without worrying too much. Maybe if I could show them I'm trying hard, they wouldn't be so upset.

Consultant: Focusing on your efforts rather than just the results can be a helpful approach. Can you think of ways to demonstrate your hard work to your parents, even if your grades aren't perfect?

User: I could share with them what I’m learning in reading club and show them my reading notes. That way, they might see I'm trying.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! By sharing your reading notes and insights, you can highlight your efforts and progress. How do you feel about discussing what you enjoy sharing in the reading club with your parents?

User: I feel good about that! I think they would be proud to hear what I’m doing and the stories I’m reading.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your achievements can help build a bridge with your parents. Let’s also consider how the skills you’re developing in the reading club can enhance your schoolwork. Have you noticed any changes in your writing or thinking since you started?

User: Yes! I've started to write more creatively. When I talk about the readings, it helps me think of new ideas for my essays.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Zhao! It seems like your participation in the reading club is already influencing your writing positively. How might you incorporate these new ideas into your next school assignment?

User: I could use some themes from the books I read. Maybe I can write about the characters and how they relate to my own life.

Consultant: That sounds like a brilliant approach! Connecting your reading to your life experiences can make your work more personal and engaging. Let’s also talk about any challenges you anticipate with this. What do you think might hold you back from doing this?

User: Sometimes, I feel like I'm not as good as some of the other kids. They write so well, and I get nervous.

Consultant: It’s common to compare ourselves to others, but remember that everyone has their unique strengths. What if we challenge that thought? Can you think of ways to appreciate your own writing style?

User: I guess I could remind myself that I have my own ideas, and not everyone thinks the same way. I could try to focus on what I like about my writing.

Consultant: That’s an excellent mindset! Focusing on your unique voice is vital. Let’s create a small goal for your next assignment. How might you celebrate the effort you put into it, regardless of the outcome?

User: Maybe I’ll treat myself to some time playing football after I finish it. That could be nice!

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Rewarding yourself for your efforts can be a strong motivator. When you complete your assignment, how will you feel knowing you put forth your best effort?

User: I think I would feel proud, and maybe less stressed. It’s nice to think about enjoying football as a reward.

Consultant: Exactly! Celebrating your accomplishments can enhance your confidence. As we wrap up, let’s summarize what you’ve identified today. What strategies do you plan to use moving forward?

User: I’m going to share my reading notes with my parents, use themes from my readings in school assignments, and reward myself with football after finishing my work.

Consultant: Those sound like fantastic strategies, Zhao! I’m excited to see how they play out for you. Remember that I’m here to support you in this journey, and you have the ability to manage your studies and emotions effectively. If any challenges arise, we can always work through them together. 

User: Thank you! I feel more relaxed about it now. I’m looking forward to next time!

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m glad to hear that. Take care, and I’ll see you at our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello Zhao! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve felt pretty good actually. I’ve been trying out the segmented studying and relaxation techniques we discussed. They seem to be helping me a lot.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re making some great progress. Can you share what specific changes you’ve noticed in your study routine?

User: Well, I’ve been able to focus better and take breaks at appropriate times. I feel less overwhelmed when I study and I think my grades are starting to improve again.

Consultant: That’s great! It’s fantastic that you’re feeling less overwhelmed. What aspects of the segmented studying do you think have been most beneficial for you?

User: I think breaking the material into smaller parts makes it feel more manageable. Also, taking short breaks helps me recharge, so I don’t feel burnt out by the end.

Consultant: Absolutely, that’s a key part of effective learning! It’s important to give yourself rest; our brains need time to process information. Do you notice any changes in how you feel emotionally during your studies?

User: Yes! I’m not as anxious as I used to be, which is a relief. I used to dread sitting down to study, but now it feels easier to get started.

Consultant: That’s a significant change! Reducing anxiety is a big step towards achieving your goals. How does this new emotional state influence your motivation to study?

User: I’m definitely more motivated! I find myself wanting to study a bit more instead of avoiding it. It feels rewarding when I manage to complete my study segments.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you're feeling motivated. Feeling a sense of accomplishment can really fuel your drive. What short-term goals are you hoping to achieve as you continue with this approach?

User: I’d like to keep improving my grades, especially in math. I haven’t been doing well lately, and improving in that subject would make me feel even better.

Consultant: That’s a good goal. Setting specific targets, like improving in math, can guide your focus. How do you plan to approach this subject with your new techniques?

User: I think I need to spend more time on it. Maybe I can set up a schedule that includes math segments and stick to the relaxation techniques afterward.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Structuring your time can definitely help you manage the subject better. What positive outcomes do you think you’ll experience if you achieve this goal?

User: I’ll feel more confident about my abilities, and I think it will ease the pressure from my parents too. They worry a lot about my grades.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re considering the impact on your confidence and family as well. Constructive communication with your parents might also help relieve some of that pressure. Have you thought about how you could share your progress with them?

User: I could show them my study schedule and tell them how I’m planning to improve. I think they would be proud if I share my efforts.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Sharing your plans can not only ease their worries but also create a support system for you. What do you think you can do to keep yourself accountable to your study goals?

User: Maybe I could ask a friend to study with me or check in with them regularly about my progress. Having someone else involved could motivate me.

Consultant: Collaborating with a friend can be very beneficial. It’s often easier to stay motivated when you’re working towards a goal together. Do you have someone specific in mind?

User: Yes, I have a friend in my class who's also trying to improve in math. We could help each other out.

Consultant: That's perfect! Mutual support can really enhance your learning experience. What challenges do you think you might face while working towards your goals?

User: I guess I might still get distracted by games or social media if I'm not careful. That’s something I should be aware of.

Consultant: It's good that you recognize that potential distraction. Creating a study environment that minimizes those distractions could help. What strategies could you implement to stay focused?

User: I could put my phone in another room while studying and set specific times for playing games as rewards after completing study segments.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Having clear boundaries can really help you stay focused and enjoy your game time as a reward. How do you plan to celebrate your achievements along the way?

User: I think I’ll treat myself to a small reward like some extra game time or a snack after completing my goals. It would be nice to have something to look forward to.

Consultant: Celebrating your achievements is so important for maintaining motivation and reinforcing your progress. As we wrap up our session today, let’s summarize what you’ve planned and how you feel about moving forward.

User: I’ll continue segmented studying and relaxation, focus on math, communicate with my parents, and involve my friend for accountability. I feel hopeful and excited about it!

Consultant: That’s fantastic! You’ve outlined some clear goals and strategies. Your sense of hope and achievement is inspiring. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Keep implementing these strategies, and if you need support, don’t hesitate to reach out in the future!

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help. I feel ready to tackle the upcoming weeks with a positive mindset.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You're doing an exceptional job, Zhao. I look forward to hearing about your continued progress. Have a great week ahead!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao! I'm glad to see you again today. It sounds like you've had some recent accomplishments. Could you share how you've been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good. My grades have improved a lot, and I feel more motivated. It's like I can see the efforts I'm putting in are paying off.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It seems you’re experiencing a sense of achievement and hope for the future. What specific changes do you think contributed to this improvement?

User: I think I've been more focused on my studies and also communicating better with my parents. We talk more, and they seem less stressed now.

Consultant: It sounds like better communication with your parents has had a positive impact on both your relationship and your studies. Can you tell me a bit about how you achieved that communication improvement?

User: I just started sharing more about what I’m doing in school and being honest about my struggles. It feels nice to have their support instead of just pressure.

Consultant: That’s an excellent step! Sharing your struggles can really help build trust and support. What do you think you could do to maintain this positive communication going forward?

User: I think if I keep being open and maybe ask for their help when I need it, it could work. I want to keep that connection strong.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Would you like to discuss any potential challenges you might face as the new term starts?

User: Yes, I’m a bit worried about balancing my study time with my interests, like playing football and reading. I don’t want to get lost in games again.

Consultant: It’s good that you’re aware of that concern. Balancing hobbies with study commitments can be challenging. What strategies do you think you could implement to ensure you can enjoy both?

User: Maybe I could set specific times for studying and for playing games or reading. That way, I wouldn’t feel guilty about downtime.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Creating a schedule can help you enjoy your hobbies without compromising your studies. How do you feel about setting that kind of structure for yourself?

User: I feel like it could really help. I’ve done something similar before, and it worked well until I got distracted again.

Consultant: It’s normal to face distractions, especially with something as enticing as gaming. How about we brainstorm some strategies to keep you accountable to your schedule?

User: That sounds helpful. Maybe I could have a calendar or use an app to remind me of what I need to do.

Consultant: Using a calendar or an app can be very effective! It can also be beneficial to set clear goals for what you want to accomplish each week. What specific goals do you have in mind for your upcoming term?

User: I want to maintain my good grades and maybe even participate more in class activities. I also want to keep up with reading and practice football.

Consultant: Those are fantastic goals! It seems you have a well-rounded approach. What might be some potential obstacles to achieving these goals, and how could you prepare for them?

User: I could get overwhelmed if there’s too much homework, or if I feel the urge to play games instead of studying. But I guess if I stick to my plan, I can manage it.

Consultant: Recognizing those potential obstacles is a significant step. Along with sticking to your plan, perhaps you could set smaller, manageable tasks when you notice feeling overwhelmed. How does that sound?

User: That sounds reasonable. I think breaking things down might make them less scary.

Consultant: Absolutely! Breaking tasks into smaller parts can make them feel more achievable. Is there anything else that might help you maintain your motivation during tougher moments?

User: I think having a friend to study with could keep me motivated. We could remind each other to stay on track.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Having a study buddy can provide support and extra motivation. Have you thought about who you might want to study with?

User: I have a friend in class who seems as determined as I am. I could ask him.

Consultant: Great choice! Teaming up with someone who shares your goals can be very encouraging. As we wrap up today’s session, what are your main takeaways regarding your goals and strategies?

User: I feel more confident about my ability to balance study and play. The scheduling and having a friend to support me will really help.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Zhao! It sounds like you have a solid plan moving forward. Is there anything specific you’d like to focus on when we meet next?

User: I’d like to talk about how I’m managing everything and see if my plans are working.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea. We can check in on your progress and make adjustments if needed. Remember, this journey is about growth, and you’re doing wonderfully. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help. See you next time!
