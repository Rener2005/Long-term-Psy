Consultant: Hello, Xiaoqian! I’m glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, especially with your studies and everything going on?

User: Hi. Honestly, I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed. With the college entrance exams coming up, I've been really stressed. My grades have slipped a bit, and it feels like there's so much competition. I can't sleep well at night.

Consultant: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load right now. The pressure from the upcoming exams and the competition in your class seem really intense. Can you tell me more about how this situation has been affecting you?

User: I just feel really anxious all the time. I struggle to focus, and there are moments when I feel like I'm not good enough, which makes everything worse. Plus, I argue more with my parents because they don’t really understand the stress I'm under.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel anxious given your circumstances. You mentioned feeling like you're not good enough and having conflicts with your parents. How do you think these thoughts and feelings about yourself are impacting your daily life and your studies?

User: I just feel stuck, you know? I sit at my desk, but I can't concentrate on my work. It's frustrating. Sometimes, I think maybe I'm not cut out for this.

Consultant: Feeling stuck and frustrated is a tough place to be in, especially with all the expectations around you. It sounds like there are moments when those feelings of inadequacy creep in. Can you remember a specific thought you had during one of those moments when you felt stuck?

User: I often think, "What if I fail the exam?" or "What if I don't get into a good college?" Those thoughts really freak me out.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really challenging to deal with. They seem to create a lot of fear. Let’s explore them together. What evidence do you have that supports those thoughts? Is there another way to view the situation?

User: I guess I just see others studying so hard and doing well, and I feel like I'm lagging behind. I can't seem to catch up.

Consultant: It's tough to compare yourself to others, especially when you feel the pressure to perform well. But it’s important to recognize that everyone's journey is different. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them to help them cope with those thoughts?

User: I guess I’d tell them not to be too hard on themselves and to focus on their own progress instead of comparing with others.

Consultant: That’s a kind and supportive message! It may be beneficial for you to apply that same kindness to yourself. Let's challenge those negative thoughts by asking if they are truly accurate. What could be a more balanced way of thinking about your situation?

User: Maybe I could think that even if I don't score the highest, I’m still doing my best and can improve.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a much healthier perspective. Focusing on your efforts rather than just the outcomes helps reduce anxiety. What steps can you take to shift your thinking from negative to a more positive and realistic viewpoint moving forward?

User: I guess I could try to set smaller goals and celebrate those little achievements instead of fixating on grades.

Consultant: Setting small, achievable goals is a fantastic strategy! It helps you regain a sense of control while easing the pressure. What activities help you relax or feel good about yourself? 

User: I like listening to music and sometimes I do some drawing. It helps me forget about the stress for a bit.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Engaging in activities that bring you joy is important. Let’s think about ways you can incorporate those into your routine, especially on days when you’re feeling overwhelmed. How about planning specific times for music or drawing?

User: Yeah, that sounds good! I think having that time could help me unwind. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Planning that time can serve as a great relief. Let’s also think about how you interact with your classmates and family. You mentioned conflicts—what could be a simple way to communicate your feelings to them?

User: I think I could just explain to my parents how I’m feeling instead of bottling it all up. I often just say I'm fine when I'm not.

Consultant: That’s a healthy approach! Opening up to your parents could help them understand your situation better. Communication can create a more supportive environment for you. How do you feel about having a conversation with them about this?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think it might help. I really want them to understand.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous, but remember that sharing your feelings can foster understanding and support. You’re taking a brave step! What strategies can you use to prepare for that conversation?

User: Maybe writing down what I want to say could help. It might make it easier to express myself.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Preparing what you want to say can help ease your nerves and make communication clearer. As we work on managing your anxiety, remember to be gentle with yourself—this is a process. 

User: I understand. It’s hard, but I’m willing to try. 

Consultant: I’m really proud of you for being open to trying. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we've discussed. You’re working on recognizing and challenging those negative thoughts, setting smaller goals, incorporating relaxation activities, and improving communication with your parents. How does that sound to you? 

User: It sounds good. I feel a bit more hopeful now. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Remember, you have the tools to manage your stress and anxiety. As you implement these strategies, be sure to reflect on your progress. I believe in you, Xiaoqian, and I’m here for you whenever you need support. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate that.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, you can always reach out if you need help. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to our next session.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoqian! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling quite overwhelmed. With the exam approaching, the pressure is just intense, and I can't shake off this anxiety.

Consultant: I understand that you're feeling quite pressured with the upcoming exams. It's a significant time, and it’s normal to feel this way. Can you tell me more about what specifically is causing you to feel overwhelmed?

User: It's just that everyone around me seems to be studying all the time, and I feel like I'm falling behind. I keep doubting my abilities, like I'm not studying enough.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure from both your peers and your expectations for yourself. Let's explore that feeling of doubt—when you think, "I'm not studying enough," how does that make you feel?

User: It makes me feel anxious and hopeless, like I'm stuck. I just can't focus, which makes everything worse.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. You mentioned feeling stuck—can you identify any specific thoughts that come to mind when you're in that state of mind? Maybe something that you tell yourself in those moments?

User: I often think things like, "I’m going to fail," or "Everyone else is smarter than I am." It makes it hard to even start studying.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very powerful and quite negative. Let's take a closer look at them. What evidence do you have to support the idea that you're going to fail? Are there any other ways to view your situation?

User: I guess I can see that I've done well in the past, and I usually prepare for exams. But in that moment, all I can think about is how much pressure I feel.

Consultant: It's good that you're recognizing your past successes, even when the pressure is on. We can work on reframing those thoughts. Instead of thinking "I’m going to fail," perhaps you could remind yourself, "I have prepared for this and can handle it." How does that new thought sit with you?

User: It sounds a bit better, but I find it hard to believe it in the moment.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Believing a new thought takes practice. How about we develop some small reminders or affirmations that you can use during your study sessions to help redirect your thinking?

User: Yeah, that could help. Maybe I could write it down somewhere?

Consultant: Absolutely! Writing it down can reinforce the message. You could place it somewhere visible while you study. What phrase do you think would be most effective for you?

User: Maybe something like, "I’m capable and prepared." That sounds positive.

Consultant: "I’m capable and prepared" is a powerful affirmation! Now, let's shift gears a bit. Have you had a chance to take breaks or do things that make you happy amidst all this studying?

User: Not really. I feel guilty taking breaks because I should be studying.

Consultant: It's important to find a balance. Taking breaks can actually improve your focus and productivity. What if we brainstormed some short activities you could do during your breaks to recharge?

User: I guess I could take a walk or listen to some music for a bit. Those sound nice.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent options! They can help clear your mind and reduce anxiety. How about we try to set a schedule that includes short breaks with those activities? 

User: I think that would help actually. At least I would feel less guilty if I have a plan.

Consultant: Great! Let's create a simple study plan that includes your study sessions and those breaks. How much time do you think you could dedicate to studying at a time before taking a break?

User: I could try studying for about 50 minutes and then take a 10-minute break.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! With that, you can make good progress without burning out. Once you start applying this, do you think you'll feel a bit better about your studies?

User: I hope so. I think having that structure will help reduce my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s the aim! As you try this, keep an eye on how you feel. Remember, acknowledging your progress, no matter how small, is crucial. How do you anticipate feeling after implementing this plan?

User: I think I might feel more in control and less anxious. It would be nice to have a little more structure.

Consultant: It certainly sounds like a step in the right direction. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what we've talked about. What’s the biggest takeaway for you from this session?

User: I think it's realizing that I can challenge my negative thoughts and the importance of taking breaks. Those affirmations will help, too.

Consultant: That's a valuable insight! Practicing these strategies will help you build resilience against the pressure. Remember, you've made progress, and it's okay to seek support when you need it. How do you feel about our next steps now?

User: I feel hopeful, actually. I think I can manage my study routine better now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, you're capable of making these changes, and I'm here to support you. If you find yourself struggling again, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care, Xiaoqian!

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help. I'll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Qian. I'm glad you're here today. I know you've been facing some challenges with your recent exam results. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite lost and anxious since the mock exams. I just keep thinking about my scores, which were disappointing. It makes me doubt my abilities a lot.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way after not meeting your expectations. You mentioned doubts about your abilities—could you share what specific thoughts come to mind when you think about your performance?

User: I keep thinking that maybe I'm just not cut out for this. I see my classmates doing better, and it feels like I’m falling behind. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Qian. Comparing yourself to others can be a heavy burden. When you think you're not 'cut out for this', how does it make you feel emotionally?

User: It makes me feel really anxious and frustrated. I just want to do well, but now I feel like I can't even study properly.

Consultant: Those feelings of anxiety and frustration can be quite paralyzing, especially when you want to study. Let’s explore this a bit: what thoughts pop into your head when you sit down to study?

User: I just start thinking about how I might fail again, or I worry about what my family will think if I don’t improve. It all feels overwhelming. 

Consultant: It truly sounds overwhelming, and it's important to recognize how those thoughts impact your ability to study. Have you noticed any patterns in how these thoughts lead to your feelings of anxiety when facing your studies?

User: Yes, it feels like a cycle. I think negative thoughts, which makes me anxious, and then I avoid studying, which makes me feel even worse.

Consultant: That cycle can be quite challenging to break. Let's try to challenge some of those negative thoughts. When you think, "I'm not cut out for this," what evidence do you have that supports or disputes that thought?

User: I mean, I’ve done well in the past, but I guess recent failures overshadow that. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to remember your past successes too. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their abilities?

User: I would probably tell them not to dwell too much on one failure and that they can learn and improve from it.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective! Let’s try to apply that to yourself. What could you learn from this mock exam experience that might help you moving forward?

User: Maybe I need to focus more on my study methods and find what works best for me rather than just cramming before exams.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Qian! Focusing on effective study methods can shift your attention from the outcome to the process. What are some small, achievable study goals you could set for yourself?

User: I could start by breaking down my subjects into smaller topics and give myself a clear plan for each week.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Setting smaller goals can help you feel a sense of accomplishment. How do you feel about implementing that strategy in your routine?

User: I think it would help a lot because it seems less daunting. I just hope I can stick to it.

Consultant: Consistency can be challenging, but remember, it's okay to adjust your plan as needed. If you encounter hurdles, how might you remind yourself of your strengths and past successes?

User: I guess I could keep a journal of my progress or even write down positive affirmations to remember my achievements.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Journaling can be a valuable tool for tracking your growth and keeping yourself motivated. How do you feel now about your ability to cope with this pressure as you prepare for future exams?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful about it, but I still worry that if I don't communicate well with my family, they won't understand my struggles.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Communication is key to feeling supported. What do you think might help you express your feelings to your family in a way they can understand?

User: I could try to have an open conversation, but I worry they won’t listen or might just dismiss my feelings.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It might help to approach them with specific examples of how you're feeling. Perhaps you could share your thought process about your studies and explain that you need their understanding during this time. 

User: Yes, that could work. I need to practice expressing my feelings better. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing communication can help you feel more comfortable sharing your experiences. How can you prepare for this conversation to feel more confident?

User: Maybe I can write down what I want to say and even practice it in front of a mirror.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! It allows you to organize your thoughts and build confidence. What do you hope to achieve from these discussions with your family?

User: I just want them to understand that I'm facing challenges and not to pressure me more. 

Consultant: That’s a healthy expectation, Qian. Establishing that understanding can help lighten the emotional load. As we wrap up today, what do you feel is the most important takeaway from our session?

User: I think focusing on small, manageable goals and improving my communication will really help me. I still feel a bit alone, but I’ll try.

Consultant: That's an excellent takeaway! Remember, Qian, it's okay to seek support, and you don’t have to face this alone. I believe in your ability to navigate these challenges. If you ever need to talk again, I'm here for you.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoqian! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’m feeling a bit better emotionally, but I still feel quite frustrated about how my conversations with my family go. It seems like they don’t really understand what I’m going through.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're feeling isolated and struggling with communication at home. Let’s take a moment to reflect on what you would like to achieve in improving these conversations. What kind of understanding or support do you seek from your family?

User: I just want them to see how much pressure I’m under with the exams and that I need their support, but I struggle to convey that.

Consultant: That’s a very valid feeling. It’s tough when you feel the pressure but can't find the right words to express it. Perhaps we could focus on some communication techniques today that might help you share your feelings more effectively. Would that be okay with you?

User: Yes, that sounds good. I really need some help with that.

Consultant: Great! One effective approach is using "I" statements when expressing your feelings. For example, instead of saying "You don’t understand me," you could say, "I feel overwhelmed when I think about the exams, and I need some support." How does that sound?

User: That makes sense. It seems less confrontational that way. 

Consultant: Exactly, and it opens the door for dialogue. Let's practice that. Can you share a specific situation where you felt misunderstood by your family regarding your studies?

User: Well, last week, I tried to explain how stressed I was about my final exams, but they just told me to study harder. It felt like they dismissed my feelings entirely. 

Consultant: That must have felt really frustrating. You might say something like, "I feel stressed when I hear you say that, and I want to share my feelings with you." How do you think they might respond to that?

User: Maybe they would listen more if I framed it that way. I hope they would understand better.

Consultant: It’s a possibility. By expressing your feelings clearly, you give them a chance to listen and respond with empathy. Do you think you could try this in your next conversation with them?

User: Yes, I think I could. I really want to make them understand.

Consultant: That’s a positive step forward! Besides practicing how you express yourself, it might also be helpful to prepare for possible responses they could have. What would you do if they react negatively or dismissively again?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s not about me but how they might be viewing things. I can’t control their response.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember, how they react is not a reflection of your feelings. Practicing self-compassion in those moments can help you stay centered. Would you like to role-play that conversation to see how it might go? 

User: Sure, that could help.

Consultant: Awesome! I’ll be your family member. You can start by expressing how you feel about exam stress. Whenever you're ready!

User: Okay. "I feel stressed when I think about my exams, and I need your support." 

Consultant: "What do you mean? Just study harder, and you’ll be fine." 

User: "I understand you want the best for me, but I feel overwhelmed with everything. I hope you can understand how I feel." 

Consultant: "I see. It’s tough for you." 

User: That felt good! I’m glad I could express myself.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! You did a great job articulating your feelings. It’s also important to check in after the conversation. How would you feel reaching out again afterward to see if there are any misunderstandings? 

User: I think that would help. It could open up the conversation again if I need to clarify something.

Consultant: Exactly, and it nurtures an ongoing dialogue. It sounds like you’re developing some useful strategies today. How do you feel about this progress?

User: I feel hopeful! I’m starting to think I can communicate better and that they will listen. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Feeling hopeful is a solid foundation to build upon. Remember, it’ll take practice, but you’re on the right track. 

User: I’ll definitely keep practicing! 

Consultant: I’m proud of you for taking these steps, Xiaoqian. As we wrap up today, let's summarize what you’ve learned. How do you plan to use these communication techniques moving forward?

User: I will practice using "I" statements and try to prepare for different ways my family might respond. 

Consultant: Excellent plan! You have some great strategies to approach these conversations. Now, can I encourage you to think about ways to keep reinforcing your confidence in your studies as well? 

User: Yes! I think talking to friends who are also studying could help too. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Surrounding yourself with supportive peers can enhance your learning experience and keep you motivated. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel much better about everything. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoqian! I’m glad to hear that. Remember that you can always return if you need more support. You’re capable of handling these challenges. 

User: I appreciate that! I’ll keep practicing and maybe share my progress next time we meet.

Consultant: I look forward to hearing about it! Take care and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Qian! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling a bit better, especially after that group activity with my classmates. I felt more supported and connected to them.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear that you experienced positive changes in your relationships. How do you think this newfound support is affecting your motivation to study?

User: I think it helps a lot. I feel more encouraged to study because I know my classmates are going through the same thing. It feels like we're in this together.

Consultant: That's excellent insight! You’re feeling a sense of belonging, and that can really boost your motivation. Can you describe how this sense of support has changed your feelings towards preparation for your upcoming exams?

User: I feel less alone in my stress. It's like there’s a shared responsibility, and I find myself wanting to keep up not just for myself but for my friends as well.

Consultant: That's a powerful thought, feeling accountable to your friends! It seems like this sense of camaraderie is making your study efforts feel more meaningful. Do you notice any specific thoughts that come to mind when you sit down to study now?

User: Yes, actually! I find myself thinking more positively, like, "We can all do well together," rather than feeling overwhelmed by the pressure of exams.

Consultant: That's a significant shift in your thinking! Recognizing that collective effort can alleviate some pressure. Can you pinpoint any negative thoughts that might have crossed your mind before this experience?

User: There were times I thought, "What if I don't succeed? What if my family is disappointed?" Those thoughts made it hard to focus.

Consultant: I see. Those thoughts can be really overwhelming and discouraging. Let’s take a moment to challenge them. What evidence do you have that supports these worries, and what might be another perspective you could take?

User: Well, my family has always been supportive, and they remind me that my effort is what matters most. Maybe I’m just putting too much pressure on myself?

Consultant: Absolutely! It seems you have a strong support system. It could be helpful to remind yourself of their encouragement when those overwhelming thoughts arise. What could you tell yourself instead when those thoughts come up?

User: I could say, "I’m doing my best, and that’s enough," or "I have people who believe in me."

Consultant: Those are affirming and supportive statements! They can significantly change your mindset. As you move towards your exams, how might you incorporate these new thoughts when you start to feel anxious?

User: I can write them down and keep them visible while I study. I think that could help me refocus.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Visual reminders can be very effective. What other strategies could we explore to ensure you maintain this positive outlook and manage anxiety leading up to your exams?

User: Maybe planning study sessions with my friends could help. Having a routine together might keep us both focused and motivated.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Group study sessions can help keep you accountable and feeling less isolated. How do you think you can set that up effectively with your friends?

User: I could propose a regular study schedule. We can decide which subjects to focus on together and hold each other accountable.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! Creating a shared schedule bonds you and your friends even more. How have you been feeling about your study habits lately?

User: I think they’ve improved. I've started organizing notes better, and I'm more willing to ask for help when I need it.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic development! Organizing your notes and seeking help when needed shows a willingness to learn and grow. As you prepare for your exams, what strategies do you think will help maintain focus and manage your time effectively?

User: I think setting small goals for each study session would help. Break things down into manageable parts instead of trying to tackle everything at once.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Smaller goals can make tasks feel less overwhelming. What specific goals could you set for your next study session?

User: I could focus on reviewing one subject for an hour and then take a break. Maybe even involve a friend during the break to maintain that connection.

Consultant: That sounds like a balanced plan! It allows you to focus while also nurturing your social connections. As you look ahead to the upcoming exams, what else do you think you might need to support you emotionally?

User: I think just keeping that positive attitude and remembering that I have the support of my friends and family is enough. Maybe practicing relaxation techniques too.

Consultant: Practicing relaxation techniques is a wonderful idea to manage stress. Have you considered any specific techniques, such as deep breathing or mindfulness?

User: Yes, I've heard about deep breathing, and I think I’d like to try that. 

Consultant: Deep breathing can be incredibly helpful during moments of anxiety. Perhaps setting aside a few minutes before studying or during breaks to practice could be beneficial. How do you feel about making that a routine?

User: I think that sounds good! I’ll try to integrate it into my study breaks.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Regular practice will make it easier to use when you're feeling anxious. Before we conclude, how are you feeling about your preparation for the exams and the strategies you've discussed today?

User: I feel more confident. It’s reassuring to know I have ways to cope with the stress and I won’t be going through this alone.

Consultant: I'm pleased to hear that! It’s important to feel confident and supported. Remember, you’ve made great strides, and I believe you have the tools to manage what’s ahead. As we wrap up, what is the one takeaway you'd like to remember from our conversation today?

User: I think I’ll remember to lean on my support system and stay positive. It's okay to seek help and focus on what I can control.

Consultant: Yes, that’s a wonderful takeaway! Thank you for sharing your thoughts and progress today, Xiao Qian. You’ve come a long way, and I believe you’ll do great in your exams. If you need support in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoqian! Welcome back to our session. I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! Thanks for having me. I've been doing a bit better, actually. I'm feeling more stable emotionally and am trying to think positively about the upcoming exams.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some progress. Can you tell me more about what you’ve been thinking positively about regarding the exams?

User: Well, I’ve started to believe that if I focus on my studies and manage my time well, I can perform well. I’m also trying to remind myself that it’s okay to feel some pressure, as it’s a normal part of the experience.

Consultant: That's a great perspective, Xiaoqian! Accepting the pressure as part of the process can really help. Looking back, were there specific moments when you felt particularly anxious or pressured, and how did you handle those moments?

User: Yes, there were times when I felt overwhelmed, especially when I compared myself to others in my class. But I’ve tried to shift my focus back to my own progress and not worry too much about them.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re really working on comparing yourself less to others and focusing on your own journey. That’s an important skill. How has this shift in focus affected your emotions or your studies?

User: It has definitely reduced my anxiety. I feel more in control of my studies when I focus on my own path. I’m managing to cover more material without feeling as stressed.

Consultant: That’s a significant improvement! It seems like you’ve developed a healthier mindset towards studying. As we prepare for the exams, it might be beneficial to discuss some techniques for managing any remaining stress. How do you feel about that?

User: Yes, I think that would be really helpful. I still want to ensure that I handle any last-minute stress effectively.

Consultant: Absolutely. One technique we can explore is creating a structured study plan that includes small breaks. This can help keep you energized and focused. Does that sound good to you?

User: That does sound good. I’ve been trying to take breaks, but sometimes I end up losing track of time.

Consultant: It's common to lose track of time during breaks. We can set specific time limits for your study blocks and breaks, like studying for 50 minutes and then taking a 10-minute break. Would you be comfortable trying that?

User: Yes, I think that could work for me! I like the idea of having a specific plan to follow.

Consultant: Great! Additionally, when you take your breaks, try to engage in activities that genuinely help you relax, like deep breathing or stretching. This could keep your mind clear and refreshed for studying. How does that sound?

User: I really like that idea! I’ve never thought of using my breaks for breathing exercises. I’ll definitely give it a try.

Consultant: Wonderful! It’s all about finding what works best for you. How are you feeling about your preparation for the exams as we get closer?

User: I feel more confident now, but I know there’s still a lot to review. But at least I have a positive mindset about it.

Consultant: That’s a healthy attitude! Remember to celebrate your small victories along the way, like completing a chapter or mastering a topic. This can boost your motivation and maintain your positive mindset.

User: I’ll remember that! Sometimes I forget to recognize my achievements.

Consultant: It's easy to overlook them, especially when you're focused on what's ahead. Also, using positive affirmations can reinforce your confidence. For example, telling yourself, “I am prepared, and I will do my best” can make a difference.

User: I’ll definitely try that! It could help me feel more grounded as I prepare.

Consultant: I believe so! Lastly, as we approach the exams, what do you think might help you if you start to feel anxious again?

User: I think I could use some visualization techniques—imagining myself calmly taking the exam and doing well.

Consultant: That sounds effective! Visualization can greatly help in reducing anxiety by creating a positive picture of the situation in your mind. Practicing that regularly leading up to the exam can be quite beneficial.

User: I’ll start doing that along with my study sessions. Thank you for the suggestion!

Consultant: You're welcome, Xiaoqian! I'm proud of you for taking these steps. Let’s take a moment to go over your progress today. What do you feel has changed for you throughout our sessions?

User: I’ve noticed that I’m more aware of my thoughts and feelings, and I’m actively trying to manage them instead of letting them overwhelm me.

Consultant: That’s an amazing insight! Recognizing and managing your thoughts is a huge milestone. How do you plan to maintain this awareness moving forward?

User: I’ll continue to practice what I’ve learned, keeping a journal maybe to track my thoughts and feelings as I study.
