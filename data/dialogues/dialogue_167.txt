Consultant: Hello, welcome to today’s session. It's great to have you here. Before we dive in, I’d love to hear about how you’ve been feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed lately. Since the military training ended, I’ve started classes, but I can’t seem to keep up. The academic pressure is piling up, and it’s making me anxious. I feel lost and I sometimes can’t sleep well.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot right now. You're feeling anxious about your classes and the pressure is really affecting your sleep. Can you tell me more about what specifically feels overwhelming?

User: Well, I’ve got a lot of assignments and readings piling up. I try to focus on my studies, but I find myself getting distracted by my phone and computer. It’s like I can’t help it, and then I feel even more guilty for not studying.

Consultant: I can see how that creates a cycle of anxiety and guilt. It’s tough when distractions pull you away from what you want to accomplish. What do you think is the main reason you find it difficult to concentrate on your studies?

User: I think part of it is that I don’t have anyone to study with. I feel kind of isolated. I had high hopes for university, but now I just feel lonely and like I don’t fit in.

Consultant: Feeling isolated in a new environment can be really challenging. It's understandable to feel like you don't fit in, especially when you're used to a different kind of support. Have there been times when you've felt more connected or engaged in social situations?

User: Not really. I used to have a few friends in high school, but since I came here, I’ve mostly kept to myself. I guess I just don’t know how to reach out to others.

Consultant: It sounds like reaching out feels daunting. Building connections takes time, and it’s normal to feel unsure, especially in a new setting. How would you feel about exploring some ways to connect with classmates or navigate those feelings of isolation?

User: I’d like to, but I’m not sure how to start. I worry that I’ll embarrass myself or that no one will want to talk to me.

Consultant: Those worries are valid, but building connections often starts small. What if we think of it as taking a small step? For instance, just saying hello to someone in class or joining a study group. What’s your initial reaction to that idea?

User: That sounds doable, I guess. It’s just the thought of actually doing it makes me anxious. What if they ignore me?

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel anxious about that. But remember, a lot of people feel similarly when meeting new people. What if you looked at it as a learning experience? If someone doesn’t respond, it’s not a reflection of your worth.

User: I see what you mean; maybe it wouldn’t be so terrible to try. I just need to change how I think about it.

Consultant: Exactly! Shifting your perspective can be powerful. Instead of focusing on what might go wrong, you could consider what could go right or how it might feel to connect with someone. Have there been positive moments in your life where you took a chance and it turned out well?

User: Yeah, I remember joining a club in high school, and at first, I was nervous, but I ended up meeting some really cool people. It was a lot of fun.

Consultant: That's a wonderful example! It shows that taking that initial step can lead to positive experiences. As you think about this new environment, what could help remind you of that past positivity when you feel anxious about engaging with others?

User: Maybe I could write down some positive reminders or think about what I enjoyed about those experiences. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Jotting down those memories can be a helpful tool to reduce anxiety when approaching new social situations. What else might you find useful in supporting yourself while you navigate this transition?

User: I guess I could set specific goals each week for how I want to connect, like joining a study group or saying hi to someone new.

Consultant: Setting specific social goals is an excellent strategy! It gives you a clear aim to work towards, which can help reduce that overwhelming feeling. How do you feel about creating a plan for that?

User: I feel positive about it. Having a plan might help keep me on track and give me something to look forward to.

Consultant: That's the spirit! Looking forward to social interactions can certainly make them feel less daunting. As you think about this plan, what kind of support do you think you might need from me or others around you?

User: Maybe just some encouragement. I feel like knowing someone believes in me would help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Encouragement can make a significant difference. I'm here to support you, and we can celebrate those small victories together. As we wrap up for today, what do you think your next steps will be?

User: I’ll write down my positive experiences, set some small social goals, and try to remind myself that it’s okay to feel anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! You’re taking important steps toward managing your feelings and embracing this new phase of your life. Remember, progress takes time, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit better already talking about this. I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I'm glad to hear that. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.

Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad you could join me today. To start off, can we talk about how you've been feeling lately? What has been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really disappointed with myself lately. I realized I've been wasting so much time on my phone and computer instead of studying. It's frustrating because I know I could be doing better.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re quite aware of the impact your phone and computer usage is having on your studies. What do you think has led you to spend so much time on them? 

User: I guess it’s just a way to escape. I feel pretty lonely and overwhelmed, and distractions help take my mind off things. But afterwards, I always regret not studying.

Consultant: I can understand why you'd turn to that for comfort when feeling lonely and overwhelmed. It’s a common pattern. Let’s explore that a little more. Can you share what you feel when you pick up your phone or sit at your computer?

User: Well, there's this instant gratification. Scrolling through social media feels good at the moment, but then I end up feeling worse afterward, especially when I realize how much time I've wasted.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. The immediate pleasure is very tempting, but that can lead to regret later on. It sounds like a cycle you want to break. What would it look like for you to spend that time differently to feel more satisfied?

User: I wish I could just put my phone down and focus on my studies. Maybe even connect more with my classmates, but I don’t know how to do that.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Wang. Let’s think about ways you could replace that time with activities that make you feel good about yourself. For instance, have you thought about setting specific study goals for each day?

User: I haven’t really set clear goals. I'm just kind of going with the flow, but it hasn’t worked out well. I think having a plan could help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Creating a plan can help you feel more structured and focused. How about we outline some achievable daily goals for you? What do you think you could realistically commit to each day for studying?

User: I think if I could aim for at least two hours of study time each day, that would be a good start. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! We could also incorporate some rewards for yourself after hitting those goals, so it feels rewarding. How do you feel about that?

User: I like that idea! A little reward would definitely motivate me. 

Consultant: Great! Rewards can serve as positive reinforcement. So, let’s make a plan. What type of reward do you think would be good for you after studying those two hours?

User: Maybe I could allow myself some time on social media afterward, but limit it to a certain amount of time. That way, I still get some break without going overboard.

Consultant: That’s a balanced approach! Setting a time limit can help you enjoy your break without falling into that cycle of endless scrolling. How does it feel to have this plan in mind? 

User: I feel a bit more in control, actually. It’s nice to think I might have a way to manage my time better.

Consultant: That’s a positive step, Wang! Feeling in control is important. Now, we also mentioned briefly connecting with your classmates. Have you thought about any specific ways to engage with them more?

User: I’ve thought about starting small like maybe asking someone in class if they want to study together. But I feel shy.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel shy, especially when reaching out to others. What if you practiced that with a simple approach, like just asking one classmate to review some notes together?

User: Yeah, that sounds manageable. I could do that! 

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Starting small can really ease the tension. Let’s set a goal that by the end of the week, you'll reach out to at least one classmate. How does that sound?

User: I can commit to that. I just need to motivate myself. 

Consultant: Great! Remember, the more you practice, the easier it will become. We can also explore more strategies to help you break through that shyness. Do you want to discuss that now or focus on your study plan first?

User: Let’s stick to the study plan for now. I feel like that’s a good priority.

Consultant: Sounds good! Let’s recap your goals. You’ll study for two hours a day, limit your social media time afterward, and reach out to one classmate by the end of the week. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel hopeful but also a bit nervous about reaching out. 

Consultant: That’s completely normal, Wang. It’s a big step, but you've set a manageable goal for yourself. Just remember to be kind to yourself during this process. If you feel anxious when reaching out, try to remind yourself of the potential connection you could build.

User: I will try to keep that in mind. Thanks for reminding me! 

Consultant: You’re welcome! It’s all about taking small, positive steps. I believe you can do this. How about we touch base next time and see how everything is going with your goals?

User: Yes, I look forward to it! 

Consultant: Perfect! I’m proud of you for making these plans today. Remember, change is gradual, and it’s okay to feel nervous. You’re making progress already. Take care! We’ll see each other in our next session.

User: Thank you! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better. I managed to join a study group, and there’s a little sense of achievement, but I still feel anxious in social situations.

Consultant: That's great to hear that you joined a study group! It's a positive step. Can you tell me more about what makes you feel anxious in those social situations?

User: When I’m with the group, I often worry about saying the wrong thing. Sometimes, I just freeze up and don’t know how to contribute to the conversation.

Consultant: It sounds like you're concerned about how others perceive you. Can you recall a specific moment during your interactions in the study group where you felt particularly anxious?

User: Yes, just last week, I wanted to share an idea, but I hesitated. I thought everyone else would judge my thoughts as silly, so I stayed quiet.

Consultant: I understand that it can be tough to speak up. What kind of feelings did you experience in that moment when you wanted to share but chose to remain silent?

User: I felt embarrassed and a bit frustrated with myself. I noticed that I missed an opportunity to contribute.

Consultant: That's completely understandable. It seems like the fear of judgment is holding you back. Let's explore those thoughts. What was going through your mind when you believed others might judge your ideas?

User: I kept thinking, "What if they think I’m stupid?" or "What if my idea doesn’t make any sense?"

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very intense. Can you think of any evidence that supports or contradicts those thoughts? For instance, how do you think your classmates would react if someone else shared a similar idea? 

User: I guess they would probably be supportive. I remember someone else shared an idea that wasn’t perfect, and everyone just discussed it positively.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s possible that your classmates are more understanding than you think. What if you reframed your thoughts when you feel that anxiety creeping in? For example, instead of thinking, "What if they think I’m stupid?" you could think, "It’s okay to share my thoughts since everyone is learning here."

User: That makes sense. I can try to view it that way. 

Consultant: Great! Reframing those thoughts will help lessen the anxiety you feel. Why don’t we practice talking through a potential scenario in your study group? You can try sharing an idea, and I can help you with how you might feel more comfortable.

User: Sure, I can give it a try. Let’s say I want to suggest a study method I found online.

Consultant: Perfect! Imagine you’re in the group. How might you start that conversation?

User: I could say something like, “Hey everyone, I found this interesting study method that I think might help us. What do you think?”

Consultant: That’s a great start! It’s clear and friendly. How would you feel doing that?

User: I’d still feel a bit nervous, but it feels more manageable knowing that I might get a positive response.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. As you practice these interactions, it will start to feel more natural. How about we set a goal for your next study group meeting?

User: I’d like to share something at least once during the next meeting.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent goal! As you work towards that, how do you plan to handle any anxious thoughts that arise before or during the meeting?

User: I’ll remind myself that it’s okay to share my ideas and that everyone is there to learn together.

Consultant: That’s a constructive approach. And remember, it’s perfectly fine to feel a bit nervous. It shows you're stepping out of your comfort zone. What other strategies can you think of that may help you stay calm during the meeting?

User: Maybe I could practice some deep breathing before I speak, or remind myself of positive feedback I’ve received in the past.

Consultant: Wonderful ideas! Deep breathing can really help calm those nerves. It sounds like you're making solid progress in thinking about these strategies. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any other concerns on your mind today?

User: I think I’m okay for now. I just hope I can follow through on sharing next time.

Consultant: I believe you can do this, Wang! You've already taken important steps. Just remember to be kind to yourself during this process. Let’s continue to build on this in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing about your experience next time. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing okay. I’ve started feeling a bit more comfortable with my social interactions, especially with a few classmates I’ve met through club activities. But I still struggle with staying focused on my studies.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling more comfortable socially! That’s a significant step forward. You mentioned difficulty focusing on your studies—can you share what specifically is making it hard for you?

User: Well, I often find myself distracted by my phone and computer. Even when I sit down to study, I keep getting sidetracked and ending up scrolling through social media instead.

Consultant: It sounds like managing those distractions is a real challenge for you. How do those distractions make you feel about your study efforts?

User: I feel frustrated and guilty. I know I should be studying, but I just can't seem to get myself to focus, which makes me worried about my grades.

Consultant: I understand how that frustration can build up, especially with the pressure of wanting to do well in school. What do you think are some beliefs you hold about your ability to focus and study effectively?

User: I guess I think that I'm not as capable as my peers. Sometimes I feel like I’m falling behind and that makes it harder to get started.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s common to feel that way, especially in a competitive academic environment. Let’s take a moment to explore that belief. What evidence do you have to support the idea that you’re not capable compared to others?

User: I see my friends finishing their assignments quickly while I struggle to stay on task. They seem so confident, and I feel like I’m just dragging behind.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way when you’re noticing others’ successes. But let’s think about it—do you know if they also face similar challenges? 

User: I don’t really know… I just see what they show on social media, which is mostly the finished product.

Consultant: That’s a really good point! Social media often highlights successes without showing the struggles behind them. If you were to give yourself the same understanding you’d offer to a friend in your position, what would you say?

User: I think I’d tell them that everyone has their own pace, and it’s okay to take time to understand things.

Consultant: Exactly! You have the ability to acknowledge that it’s okay to take your time. Now, thinking about your studies, how might we set some realistic and specific goals to help boost your confidence and focus?

User: Maybe I could set smaller tasks instead of trying to tackle an entire chapter at once? That might make it less overwhelming.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Breaking down tasks can certainly help. What’s one small, specific task you could commit to for your study session today?

User: I could aim to read just a few pages and take notes on that rather than trying to finish the whole chapter.

Consultant: That sounds like a great and manageable plan! How do you think achieving that small goal will affect your feelings about studying?

User: I think if I complete those few pages, it might motivate me to keep going. It would feel like I’m actually making progress.

Consultant: Absolutely! Progress, no matter how small, can really help rebuild your confidence. How do you plan to reward yourself after completing that task?

User: Maybe I could take a break and watch an episode of a show I like. That feels like a good way to unwind after I study.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Balancing work with rewards can help maintain motivation. Remember, it’s essential to celebrate those small wins. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you see as your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think I need to challenge my negative thoughts about my study abilities and focus on setting small, achievable goals. 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a powerful insight, Wang. As we move forward, keep practicing those strategies and be kind to yourself in this process. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. You're doing great work!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I'm feeling more optimistic about my studies now.

Consultant: Hello Wang, I'm glad to see you today! It sounds like you've made some real progress this semester. How are you feeling about everything that's happened?

User: Hi! Yes, I'm actually quite happy. I did well in my exams, which feels great. But I still have some concerns about the upcoming semester and how to maintain this momentum.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear about your exam results! Maintaining that positive momentum can indeed feel challenging. Can you share what aspects of the new semester are on your mind?

User: I'm worried about keeping up with my studies and making new friends. Sometimes I find it hard to focus in class, and I don’t want to fall behind.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those concerns, especially after achieving something significant like you did. Let's focus on your study habits first. What strategies helped you succeed this past semester?

User: I started to plan out my study schedule better and tried to reduce distractions like my phone during study sessions. That really helped!

Consultant: Great job on planning and minimizing distractions! It sounds like you found a method that works well for you. How do you think you could apply those same strategies in the upcoming semester?

User: I think I can continue with the same schedule and maybe even set specific goals for each week to stay on track.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Setting weekly goals can keep you motivated. Now, let’s talk about socializing. What obstacles do you think you're facing in making new friends?

User: I guess I just feel a bit shy, especially in large groups. I tend to stick to myself, which makes it hard to connect with others.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel shy in new social situations. Would you be open to exploring some ways to gradually become more comfortable in those settings?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I want to feel more connected with my peers.

Consultant: One approach could be to set small social goals for yourself, like starting conversations with classmates or joining a study group. What do you think about that idea?

User: That sounds doable! Just little steps could help me feel less overwhelmed.

Consultant: Absolutely! Little steps can make a big difference. Let’s also think about any upcoming opportunities where you could meet new people, like clubs or activities on campus. Are there any that interest you?

User: There’s a photography club that sounds fun. I really like taking pictures, but I wasn’t sure if I should join.

Consultant: Joining a club based on your interests is a great way to meet people! It could also provide a relaxed atmosphere to connect with others who share your passions. What would be your first step toward joining?

User: I could attend their next meeting and just see how it goes. I think I’ll do that!

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan, Wang! Attending the meeting is a fantastic first step. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the strategies we discussed for both your studies and social interactions?

User: I feel much more encouraged! I like the idea of having a plan and setting goals. I think I can manage both my studies and making friends.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s normal to feel a bit anxious about change, but you're already showing such great commitment. To summarize, you’ll continue with your study schedule and aim to set specific goals for the new semester. You'll also attend the photography club meeting. Does that sum it up well?

User: Yes, it does! I feel ready to take on the new semester.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Wang! I have no doubt you’ll do well. It’s been a pleasure working through your thoughts today. If you need any support in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out again. Take care, and enjoy the upcoming semester!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.
