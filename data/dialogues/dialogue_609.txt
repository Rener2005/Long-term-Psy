Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ming! I’m glad you’ve come here today. Before we start, how are you feeling at the moment? 

User: Hi. To be honest, I'm feeling pretty lost and anxious. I can't shake off the feeling of disappointment in myself after what happened with the theft.

Consultant: I can imagine that must be a heavy weight for you. It’s important to recognize those feelings. Can you tell me more about what has been bothering you the most recently?

User: I just feel like I've messed everything up. I see my friends moving ahead with their studies, and I'm stuck. It’s like I’ve lost my way and don’t know how to improve.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a lot of pressure on you right now. You’re comparing yourself to others, and it’s making you feel even worse. Let’s take a moment to understand where these feelings of inadequacy might be coming from.

User: I guess I feel like a failure, especially since my parents are not around much, and I’ve let them down. My dad is always working, and I feel like my actions reflect badly on him.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiao Ming. It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you care about your father's opinion. Let’s explore your feelings a bit more—what specific thoughts come to mind when you think about the theft and your family?

User: I think about how disappointing it must be for them, especially since they sacrifice so much for me. I feel like I don’t deserve their efforts.

Consultant: That’s a heavy burden to carry. It’s common for people to internalize those feelings, but I wonder if those thoughts are truly reflecting reality. Let’s challenge that belief. Is it possible that your actions don’t define your worth as a person?

User: I want to believe that, but it’s hard. I keep thinking, “I am a criminal.” It feels like it’s stuck in my head and I can’t shake it off.

Consultant: I understand. It can feel overwhelming. But perhaps we can try to see it from a different angle. If a close friend made a mistake, wouldn’t you offer them understanding and support instead of harsh judgment?

User: Yeah, I would. I’d probably tell them that they can learn from their mistakes.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s helpful to recognize that everyone makes mistakes. Just because you've made one doesn't mean you can’t change or learn. What would you want to tell yourself if you were your own best friend?

User: I guess I would say that it’s okay to make mistakes and that I can still work towards being better.

Consultant: Great insight, Xiao Ming! Let’s shift our focus a bit. You mentioned wanting to improve and get back on track with your studies. What specific areas do you feel you need more support in?

User: I really struggle with motivation and focus. Sometimes I can’t even start studying. 

Consultant: That’s a common struggle, especially when there’s so much on your mind. Let’s think about small steps. Are there any activities you used to enjoy that could help rekindle your motivation?

User: I used to like drawing. It was a good way to relax, but I haven’t done it much lately.

Consultant: Drawing sounds wonderful! It might be a good idea to reconnect with that passion. Could you set aside some time each week for drawing as a way to express yourself and relieve some stress?

User: I think I could try that. It might help me feel better about myself.

Consultant: That’s a positive step! Drawing can be a great outlet for your emotions. Let’s also think about your study routine. What’s one small change you could make to help you get started?

User: Maybe I could set a timer for 20 minutes and try to study in short bursts? 

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Using a timer can help make studying feel less overwhelming. How do you think you’d feel after those 20 minutes of focused study?

User: I think I would feel accomplished, like I've done something worthwhile for once.

Consultant: Absolutely! That sense of accomplishment can build your confidence. If we set a few small goals each week, how do you think that could affect your overall mindset?

User: I guess it would keep me from feeling so lost and help me see that I can still achieve things.

Consultant: Exactly! It can help you feel more in control of your life. Remember, small steps lead to big changes. What do you think you’ll do after our session today to get started?

User: I’ll plan out some time for drawing and think of a study schedule with timers.

Consultant: That sounds like a productive plan, Xiao Ming! I’m proud of you for taking these steps. As we wrap up today, what’s one takeaway you’ll keep in mind from our conversation?

User: I think it’s about being kinder to myself and recognizing that mistakes don’t define who I am.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization. I'm here to support you as you work through this. If you ever feel overwhelmed, remember to reach out for support. You’ve already taken an important step by being here today. 

User: Thank you! I feel a little better just talking about this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a journey, and you’re not alone. You can always come back if you need more support. Take care of yourself, Xiao Ming, and let’s keep working together in the future!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoming! I'm glad to have you here today. I’d love to hear more about how you’ve been feeling lately, especially with your recent challenges in school.

User: Hi. I’ve been really stressed out because my grades in the final exams weren’t good at all. I feel like I’m not capable of doing well in my studies, and it makes me anxious about my future.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you’re feeling a lot of pressure from your grades, which has made you doubt your abilities. Can you tell me a bit more about those feelings? What specifically worries you about your future?

User: I just feel like if I can’t do well in school, I won’t have a good future. I see my friends doing better, and it makes me question if I’ll be able to get into a good college or even find a decent job.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel worried when you see others succeeding. You mentioned doubting your abilities—what thoughts cross your mind when you think about your studies?

User: I often think that no matter how hard I try, I can’t catch up or improve. I feel like I’ve already failed, and it’s hard to see a way out of it.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of negative thoughts about your academic abilities. Let’s take a closer look at those thoughts. Can you recall a specific instance when you felt like you’ve failed?

User: I remember during the last math exam, despite studying a lot, I still didn’t do well. It felt like all my effort was pointless, and I just wanted to give up.

Consultant: That must have been really disheartening for you. When you think about that situation, what thoughts come up? How do you feel when you remember that moment?

User: I feel really frustrated and defeated. It’s like my mind keeps saying I’m not smart enough, and I’ll never succeed.

Consultant: It’s tough when our minds tell us such harsh things. Let’s challenge those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you’re not smart enough? 

User: I guess I don’t really have any solid proof. I just focus on my last exam results, and it feels like they define me.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. Exam results are just one moment in time and don’t reflect your overall abilities. If you were to look at a friend in a similar situation, what would you advise them?

User: I’d probably tell them not to get too stressed over one exam and that they can improve next time. 

Consultant: Exactly! You already have the insight that improvement is possible. So, what if we work on some strategies together to help you feel more prepared for your studies?

User: I think that would help. I’m really looking for new ways to study and improve.

Consultant: Great! Let’s talk about some effective study strategies. Have you tried setting small, achievable goals while studying?

User: Not really. I usually just try to study everything at once, which feels overwhelming.

Consultant: It can definitely be overwhelming! Breaking your study sessions into smaller tasks can make them more manageable. How about we come up with a few specific goals for your next study session?

User: I could focus on one chapter at a time instead of trying to review everything.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Focusing on one chapter will make it easier to absorb the material. How do you feel about setting a specific time for those study sessions?

User: I could try studying for 30 minutes, then take a short break. That might make it less stressful.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea, Xiaoming! Short breaks can help refresh your mind. How about finding a comfortable space to study that minimizes distractions? 

User: I usually study in my room, but it can get noisy sometimes with my siblings around. Maybe I could try studying at the library.

Consultant: The library sounds like a good option! A quieter environment can help you concentrate better. What can you do to keep yourself motivated during these study sessions?

User: I think rewarding myself with a little treat or some time to relax after I finish each goal could motivate me.

Consultant: Rewarding yourself is a great motivational strategy! It creates a positive association with studying. How do you feel about discussing how to deal with feelings of frustration if they come up during studying?

User: That could be useful. Sometimes when I hit a hard spot, I just want to quit.

Consultant: It’s common to feel that way. One approach could be to take a deep breath and remind yourself that it’s okay to struggle a bit. You can even share your frustrations with someone you trust for support. How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful. I’ve been keeping a lot to myself, and talking to someone might lighten the load.

Consultant: Sharing your feelings can significantly reduce stress. Remember, you’re not alone in this. We all have ups and downs. How do you feel about reaching out to friends or teachers for help when you need it?

User: I think I could do that. I’ve been hesitant before, but it’s good to know that it’s okay to ask for help.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s a positive step toward building connections and gaining support. Before we wrap up, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today. What are some key takeaways for you?

User: I learned that I can set small goals while studying and that talking to others about my feelings is okay. I feel more hopeful about managing my anxiety now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiaoming! It sounds like you’re already starting to recognize some new strategies and perspectives. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. How do you feel about our next session? 

User: I’m looking forward to it. I hope to share how my new study plan works out!

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! We can discuss your experience and adjust strategies as needed. You’re making great strides, and I’m here to support you. 

User: Thanks so much! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoming! I'm here for you, and I look forward to talking again soon. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ming! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling right now?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really misunderstood lately. There was this incident with my teacher where I thought they were unfair to me, and it just made me feel all over the place emotionally.

Consultant: It sounds like that situation with your teacher really impacted you deeply. Can you tell me more about what exactly happened and how it made you feel?

User: Well, I made a mistake in class, and instead of just correcting me, the teacher made a big deal out of it in front of everyone. I felt embarrassed and, honestly, angry. It’s like I can’t talk to them without feeling judged.

Consultant: I see. That must have been really tough for you, especially with your feelings of embarrassment and anger mixed in. How did that experience affect your interactions with your classmates or the teacher after it happened?

User: I’ve been avoiding talking to my teacher and even my classmates. I feel like they’re all looking down on me, and I just want to stay away from them. It’s been hard to focus on my schoolwork too.

Consultant: Avoiding those interactions sounds like a common response when we feel judged or misunderstood. It could also add to your anxiety about school and affect your focus. What do you think would help you feel more comfortable speaking up or addressing these issues?

User: I wish I could just express how I feel without worrying about being looked down on. I want to be able to explain my side better, but I just freeze up when I try to talk about it.

Consultant: That’s a valid desire, Xiao Ming. It’s important to feel like you can express yourself. Would you be open to exploring some techniques together that might help you communicate more effectively?

User: I’m open to that. I really want to improve how I handle these situations.

Consultant: Great! One approach we can use is practicing different ways to express your feelings. Can you think of a specific way you might approach your teacher or classmates about how you felt during that incident?

User: Maybe I could say I felt embarrassed when they called me out in front of everyone? But I’m worried about how they’ll respond.

Consultant: That's a good start! Sharing your feelings can be powerful. We can phrase it in a way that makes it clear you're reaching out for understanding. How do you think you might feel if they responded positively?

User: I suppose it would feel relieving, to be heard and understood. But I just can’t shake off the fear of rejection.

Consultant: Understandable. That fear can be very powerful. What if we reframed that fear? Instead of focusing on rejection, we can think about the potential for positive connections with your teacher or classmates. What’s a positive outcome you might envision from this conversation?

User: I guess if they understood me better, maybe things would feel less tense. I want to feel more comfortable in class too.

Consultant: Absolutely, feeling understood could create a better classroom atmosphere for you. Let’s work on developing a script or some key points you could use when talking to them. What would be your main point to communicate?

User: I think telling them I made a mistake but also that I’d like to be treated fairly and with respect.

Consultant: That’s very clear and assertive. Being honest about your feelings and your expectations is important. How about we practice that together? I can play the role of your teacher, and you can try expressing your thoughts to me.

User: Okay, I’m willing to give that a try.

Consultant: Alright, let’s start. You can begin when you’re ready, and I’ll respond as your teacher.

User: Um, hi, Mr. [Teacher’s Name]. I wanted to talk about what happened in class. I feel like I made a mistake, but it really upset me when it was brought up in front of everyone. I just want to be treated fairly.

Consultant: I appreciate you coming to me about this issue, Xiao Ming. I understand how it felt to be called out in front of your peers. How do you think we can address this in class moving forward?

User: I guess if you could give me feedback privately instead, that would really help.

Consultant: That’s an excellent suggestion! It shows that you’re willing to learn and that you value a respectful environment. How did that feel to say?

User: It felt a bit scary, but also good to express what I need.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! The fear of speaking can lessen with practice, and you did a wonderful job expressing your needs. What can we do to help you feel more comfortable next time?

User: Maybe practicing more with you would help. I feel like I need to role-play more situations like this.

Consultant: Absolutely, we can practice more. Each time you practice, you’ll build more confidence. Would you like to explore any other situations that make you feel uncomfortable?

User: Yes, definitely. I think it would help a lot.

Consultant: Great! I'm here to support you. As we continue, let’s focus on building your skills for these interactions. Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous, but you can use that as motivation to speak up. 

User: Thank you, this feels helpful. I really think I need this.

Consultant: Of course! It’s a big step to address these feelings, and I’m proud of you for taking these steps. We can continue to refine your communication skills together. 

User: I appreciate your help. I already feel a little better about this.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiao Ming! As we wrap up today, what’s one thing you will take away from our conversation?

User: I think it’s about being honest about my feelings, and that I can practice expressing them without feeling too scared.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing that honesty is a crucial first step. Remember to be kind to yourself as you learn and grow. If you ever need support, feel free to come back. 

User: I will! Thank you for guiding me through this.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and I look forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today, Xiaoming. I understand you've had some tough moments lately with family communication. Can you share a bit more about how you’re feeling right now?

User: Hi. Yeah, I've been feeling really frustrated. My family just doesn't understand me, and every time we talk, it feels like we're just arguing. I got really upset last time and now I feel stuck.

Consultant: It sounds like you're going through a challenging time, and it's understandable to feel frustrated and stuck when communication isn’t flowing smoothly. What specifically happened during your last conversation that triggered these strong feelings?

User: Well, I wanted to talk about my future and what I want to do after high school. But instead of listening, they just kept saying I should follow a more traditional path, and it just felt like they weren't hearing me at all.

Consultant: That must have felt really disappointing, especially when you were trying to share your thoughts about your future. It’s difficult when we just want to be understood. Can you tell me more about the emotions you experienced during that conversation?

User: I felt really anxious and helpless. It's like no matter how I try to explain myself, they just don’t get it. I worry that they'll think I'm not serious about my future.

Consultant: Those feelings of anxiety and helplessness are valid, especially in a situation where you’re seeking support and understanding. Let's explore this further—when you think about your dreams and aspirations, what thoughts come to mind? 

User: I keep thinking I want to do something creative, like graphic design, but I worry they won't support me because it's not a stable job.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really passionate about graphic design, but the concern about stability is weighing heavily on you. Have there been any specific thoughts that feed into your anxiety about their reaction?

User: Yeah, I often think that if I choose this path, I'll disappoint them. I feel like I have to choose what they want instead of what I want.

Consultant: That’s a tough position to be in, feeling torn between your own desires and your family's expectations. Let's take a moment to challenge that thought: Is there evidence that pursuing your passion for graphic design would lead to disappointment? 

User: I guess I don't really know for sure. It just feels like they would see it as a failure.

Consultant: It’s common to fear negative reactions from loved ones, but sometimes our thoughts can exaggerate the consequences. If a friend's child wanted to pursue a creative field, how would you advise them or what would you think their parents might feel?

User: I’d probably tell them to follow their dreams and that they’ll find a way to make it work. I wish I could feel the same way about myself.

Consultant: That's a wonderful perspective to have for someone else! You show a lot of empathy towards your friends' dreams. How could you start applying that same understanding to your own aspirations?

User: Maybe I could write down my goals and create a plan on how to approach my family about it more calmly.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Writing things down can help clarify your thoughts. When you approach your family again, what specific points would you like to share with them about your passion for graphic design?

User: I want to explain why I love it, how I could have a plan to be successful, and maybe even show them some successful designers as examples.

Consultant: That’s a solid approach—providing context and examples can help them see your perspective. How do you feel about the idea of practicing this conversation beforehand, perhaps with a friend or even by yourself?

User: I think practicing would help. I often get too nervous when I actually talk to them.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing can build your confidence. Let’s also think about what support you might need during this practice. Is there someone in your life who can encourage you?

User: I have a couple of friends who are really supportive. I can talk to them about it.

Consultant: Great! Having supportive friends can make a significant difference. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what you’ve learned. What is one actionable step you can take this week to move forward with your communication goals with your family?

User: I will write down my main points and practice discussing them with my friends. Hopefully, this will help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan, Xiaoming! Remember, it’s okay to feel anxious, but preparing can help you feel more in control. I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes in our next session. Take care!

User: Thanks! I feel a bit more hopeful now.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ming! It's great to see you today. I'm looking forward to our session. How have you been feeling since we last met?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better, actually. The volunteering activity I did helped me think about my future a bit more, but I still have some worries.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling better and that the volunteering experience sparked some thoughts about your future. Can you share what specific worries are still on your mind?

User: I'm just not sure about what direction to take in my career. My parents' situation stresses me out, and I fear making the wrong choices.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel stressed about your future, especially given your family situation. It sounds like you’re trying to navigate some complex feelings. What do you think might help you gain more clarity about your career options?

User: I think it would help to learn more about different jobs and maybe talk to people who work in those fields. I just don't know where to start.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Gathering information about various professions can definitely help you feel more equipped to make informed choices. Are there any particular jobs or fields that you’ve thought about exploring more?

User: I've been thinking about education, because I enjoy helping others. But I’m also considering something in business since it seems practical.

Consultant: Both education and business can be fulfilling paths. Helping others in education can be incredibly rewarding, and business offers numerous opportunities. What excites you most about each of these fields?

User: In education, I love the idea of shaping young minds and making a difference. In business, I’m drawn to the chance of being independent and possibly starting my own venture someday.

Consultant: Those are both valid and exciting prospects! It sounds like a common theme for you is making an impact and having a sense of independence. How do you think exploring these interests further—maybe through internships or conversations—could help you?

User: I think talking to people already working in those fields would provide valuable insights. I could also look for internships to see what it’s really like.

Consultant: Absolutely! Conversations with professionals and hands-on experiences can clarify your interests and expectations significantly. What steps do you think you could take in the next week to start this exploration?

User: I could reach out to my teachers and ask if they know anyone in those fields. Maybe I can also look for local internships online.

Consultant: Those sound like actionable steps you can take. It’s great that you're thinking about reaching out to teachers—they can be a valuable resource. How do you feel about taking these steps?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. I think it could really help me figure things out.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel nervous when stepping out of your comfort zone, but it’s wonderful to hear you’re excited as well. Remember, each step can lead to growth and new opportunities. What strategies can you use to manage those nerves as you take action?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s just asking questions and learning, and that people are usually willing to help. 

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! Focusing on learning and remembering that most people enjoy sharing their experiences can lessen the pressure. What’s one thing you can do when you start to feel those nerves creep in?

User: I could take a deep breath and remind myself that it’s a part of the process of figuring things out.

Consultant: Exactly! Deep breathing and positive self-talk can be very effective. As we continue with our sessions, let’s keep reinforcing this progress you've made. How do you see your current mindset changing as you embark on this exploration?

User: I think I’m starting to feel more open to possibilities. It feels good to consider different options instead of feeling stuck.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Xiao Ming! Embracing possibilities is a powerful step towards a positive future. As we wrap up today, what key takeaway do you feel is most important from our discussion?

User: I think the most important thing is to take that first step and actually reach out to people. It feels like the best way to gain clarity.

Consultant: That's an excellent insight! Taking action is crucial. I’m proud of the progress you’ve made today. Remember, it's about continuous exploration. Do you feel like you have the tools to sustain this positive mindset going forward?

User: Yes, I feel more confident about it now. I can keep reminding myself to stay open and take those steps.

Consultant: Wonderful! I'm really glad to see your confidence growing. You’ve done great work today. If you encounter any challenges or have questions in the future, feel free to reach out. I look forward to hearing about your journey next time. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I'm excited to get started.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm excited for you too. Take care until our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoming! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good, actually. I finished my assessments and it feels like a big weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I'm excited about the new school term!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've had a significant release of stress. Can you share more about what specific experiences or changes have contributed to this positive mindset?

User: Well, I took some time to reflect on how much I've grown academically and personally. It's nice to actually feel like I'm making progress. Plus, I've been more social with my classmates lately, which has helped a lot.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling a sense of progress and are engaging more with your classmates. Social connections can be really helpful. What are some of the new activities or interactions that you've enjoyed recently?

User: I've joined a study group, and we're planning to explore some new subjects together. It's fun to collaborate with others instead of studying alone all the time. 

Consultant: Joining a study group is a fantastic way to connect with others and enhance your learning. How has being part of this group affected your attitude towards studying?

User: It's made studying feel less isolating and more enjoyable. I think the group motivates me to stay focused, which is a nice change from just sitting at my desk alone.

Consultant: That sounds like a productive and enjoyable shift in your study habits! As you look forward to the new school term, what goals do you have in mind to maintain this positive momentum?

User: I want to keep my study schedule organized and stay connected with my friends. I believe having more support will help me stay on track.

Consultant: Setting those intentions is a great step! Can we explore some specific strategies or practices that could help you stay organized and connected with your friends? 

User: Sure. I think I need to create a weekly study plan. I could also set aside time each week to hang out with my friends, maybe even have study sessions together.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! A weekly study schedule can help you stay focused, and combining social time with studying could provide support and accountability. What might be the first step you take to implement this plan?

User: I guess the first thing is to sit down this weekend and draft out my study schedule for the upcoming term. I also need to reach out to my friends to set a regular day for our study sessions.

Consultant: That sounds like a productive weekend ahead! As you work on this plan, how can you ensure you stick to it and maintain this positive mindset throughout the term?

User: I think I’ll need to remind myself of how good it feels to be progressing and being social. Maybe I can set little reminders on my phone to check in with myself about how I’m feeling.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Reminders can help keep you aligned with your goals and reflect on the progress you're making. What other self-care practices do you think might support your positive mindset during the school term?

User: I want to keep exercising regularly because it helps clear my mind. Also, I thought about journaling to process my thoughts and feelings.

Consultant: Those sound wonderful! Exercise can release stress, and journaling might help you reflect on your growth and any challenges you face. How do you plan to incorporate these activities into your routine?

User: I could set a specific time for workouts, like right after school. For journaling, maybe I’ll do it before bed as a way to unwind.

Consultant: That sounds like a balanced routine! Establishing those dedicated times for self-care will help ensure they remain a part of your life. What do you think will be the biggest challenge in sticking to this routine?

User: I think staying disciplined might be tough, especially when school gets busy. Sometimes, I might just want to skip my workouts or journaling.

Consultant: It's completely natural to face challenges with discipline, especially during busy times. What strategies could you employ if you find yourself wanting to skip these activities?

User: I could keep reminding myself of how good it feels after exercising or writing in my journal. Maybe I could also ask a friend to join me for workouts to make it more enjoyable.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Engaging a friend for accountability and focusing on how good those activities make you feel can certainly help you stay committed. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is the importance of staying connected with my friends and maintaining a routine that keeps me motivated. I feel really optimistic about the new term!

Consultant: That’s great to hear, Xiaoming! You have a strong plan in place, and it sounds like you're ready to embrace the new term positively. Remember, you’ve made significant progress, and if you keep focusing on these strategies, you'll continue to thrive. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance today.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of the progress you've made. Keep practicing those strategies, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need further support in the future. Take care, and good luck with everything!

User: Thanks! I will!
