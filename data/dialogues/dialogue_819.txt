Consultant: Hello, Xiao Wang! I'm glad you are here for our session today. I would like to talk about your current feelings and what led you to seek help. Can you share more about what’s been going on lately?

User: Hi. I've been quite anxious, especially after that incident during my physics class where I suddenly felt overwhelmed. Since then, I’ve been experiencing palpitations and shaking hands and feet. I keep worrying about my health.

Consultant: It sounds really distressing to go through that, especially with the experience of anxiety and the physical symptoms you're facing. Let's explore this together. Can you tell me more about what you were feeling during that class? What thoughts were running through your mind?

User: I just felt like everything was too much. The pressure from preparing for exams and the expectation to perform well has been overwhelming. I thought if I don’t score high, I won’t get into a good college.

Consultant: It seems like you’re dealing with a lot of pressure to perform, and that must be incredibly challenging. When you think about not scoring high, what kind of thoughts come to mind? How does that affect how you feel?

User: I keep thinking that everyone is judging me, and if I fail, I’ll disappoint my family, especially my mom who has invested so much in my education with all these tutoring classes.

Consultant: I can hear how much pressure you feel not only from your studies but also from the expectations that come from your family. That's a heavy burden to carry. Are there any specific moments when you feel this anxiety the most, or trigger thoughts that make the fear of judgment stronger?

User: Mostly during classes and exams, but also when I think about what others might say about my grades. Sometimes, I feel really embarrassed if others do better than I do.

Consultant: Feeling embarrassed can be very tough, especially in a competitive environment. Can you recall any specific thoughts you have about your performance or how others perceive you that might be contributing to that embarrassment?

User: I often think that if I don’t excel, I’ll be seen as a failure. It’s like my worth is tied to my grades, and that makes it even harder.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization, Xiao Wang. It sounds like you might be tying your self-worth to your academic performance, which can create a lot of anxiety. Let’s take a moment to challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that your worth is solely based on your grades?

User: I guess I don’t really have any concrete evidence. It’s just something I feel, especially with the pressure from my family.

Consultant: That’s an important insight. It sounds like a perception rather than a fact. If a friend came to you with a similar thought about their worth being tied to grades, what would you say to them?

User: I would probably tell them that their value is not just in their grades but in who they are as a person.

Consultant: Exactly. Your value as a person goes beyond your academic achievements. Let’s think about how we can reframe this thought. Instead of saying, “I am a failure if I don’t excel,” what could be a more balanced thought?

User: Maybe something like, “My grades do not define me, and I’m doing my best.” 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic reframe! It emphasizes your effort rather than just the outcomes. Next, let's look at your symptoms—like the palpitations and shaking. What are some ways you might react to these physical sensations that could help you manage them?

User: I usually just panic more and focus on how terrible I feel, which makes it worse.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Let’s try to find a strategy to respond differently when those sensations arise. What if we practiced some relaxation techniques that can help you manage those feelings in the moment?

User: That sounds useful. I’d like to learn how to calm myself down when it happens.

Consultant: Great! One simple technique we can try is deep breathing. When you feel those sensations, you could take a moment to breathe in deeply through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and then breathe out slowly through your mouth. How does that sound to you?

User: I think I can try that. I’ve heard of deep breathing before.

Consultant: Perfect! Practicing this during moments of anxiety can greatly help you stay grounded. Now, as we’ve been discussing your feelings and challenges, do you have any coping strategies that you’ve used before that might also work for you in this new environment?

User: Not really, because I’ve just been focusing on the stress rather than finding ways to cope.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. It’s common to become focused solely on stress without considering coping strategies. Let’s brainstorm together. What activities do you enjoy that could help you feel better during stressful times?

User: I used to enjoy playing video games and hanging out with friends, but I haven’t done any of that lately.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent outlets! Scheduling some time to engage in activities you enjoy could help alleviate stress and improve your mood. How about we create a small plan to incorporate these into your routine?

User: Yes, I think having a plan would help me to not get so overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Even setting aside just a little bit of time each week for those activities can make a difference. Also, let’s discuss your transition to university. What has been the most challenging aspect of this new environment for you?

User: I think it’s the new social dynamics. I feel like everyone is judging me, and I struggle to fit in.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel that way, especially in a new environment. Remember, many students are likely feeling similar pressures. What if, instead of fearing judgment, you focused on trying to connect with others over shared experiences?

User: That could help. I guess I need to remind myself that other people are also dealing with their own pressures.

Consultant: Definitely! Understanding that others are in similar situations can ease feelings of isolation. As our session is drawing to a close, let’s recap what we’ve discussed and how you can apply it moving forward. What would you say are your key takeaways from today’s consultation?

User: I’ve realized that my worth isn’t tied to my grades and that I can use deep breathing to help with my anxiety. I also want to make time for activities I enjoy.

Consultant: Those are excellent insights, Xiao Wang! I’m glad you’re feeling empowered to implement these strategies. Remember, it’s a gradual process, and acknowledging your feelings is the first step. If you need support in the future, we can always discuss more strategies. Thank you for sharing today, and I look forward to our next session!

User: Thank you! I feel like I have some tools to work with now.

Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today's session. I'm here to help you with any concerns you may have. How have you been feeling lately, especially with all the changes in your college life?

User: Hi. Honestly, I'm still struggling to adapt to the new environment. I worry a lot about how my classmates see me. I feel like I'm constantly being judged, and it's really stressing me out.

Consultant: That sounds really overwhelming. It's understandable to feel that way when entering a new environment. Can you tell me more about what specific situations trigger these feelings of being judged?

User: Well, during group activities in class, I often feel like I'm not as good as the others. I nervously avoid speaking up, fearing they might think I’m not smart or capable.

Consultant: It seems like those group activities are quite challenging for you. How do these thoughts about your classmates affect your emotions during those situations?

User: I often feel anxious and second-guess myself. I get a knot in my stomach, and it’s hard to concentrate on what’s happening in the discussion.

Consultant: I see. It can be tough to concentrate when anxiety takes over. Let’s explore this a bit more—what thoughts go through your mind when you feel that anxiety during group discussions?

User: I keep thinking, “What if I say something stupid?” or “They probably think I don't belong here.” 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound pretty harsh. It seems like you’re really critical of yourself. What emotions do those thoughts lead to for you?

User: They make me feel more anxious and insecure. It just reinforces my fear that I don't fit in.

Consultant: It sounds like there's a cycle here, where negative thoughts lead to heightened anxiety, which then makes you feel even less secure. Can we try to identify some evidence for those thoughts? What proof do you have that your classmates see you in such a negative light?

User: I don’t have any actual proof...it’s mostly just my mind assuming the worst.

Consultant: That’s an important insight. Sometimes our minds create stories that don’t reflect reality. If a friend were in your place having these thoughts, what would you tell him?

User: I would probably say that he’s probably overthinking things and that others are likely caught up in their own worries.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s common for everyone to have their own insecurities. Let's challenge those negative beliefs together. What if we tried to reframe your thoughts? For instance, instead of thinking, “They think I don’t belong here,” what could be another way to view the situation?

User: Maybe I could think, “Everyone is here to learn, and I have something valuable to offer, too.”

Consultant: That’s a great reframe! Focusing on your contributions can help reduce that sense of pressure. How do you feel about trying to implement that thought in your next group discussion?

User: I feel it might be a bit difficult, but I'm willing to give it a try. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel a bit uneasy, but that willingness is a good start. Let’s also think about some small actions you can take to help you feel more comfortable in these situations. Are there any activities or discussions you could approach differently?

User: Maybe I could prepare a few comments ahead of time so that I feel more ready to speak up.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical strategy! Preparing in advance can help boost your confidence. Would you like to set a specific goal for your next group interaction?

User: I’d like to aim for sharing at least one or two thoughts in the next meeting.

Consultant: That’s an achievable goal! Celebrating small successes is important. Let’s also practice some relaxation techniques you can use before those discussions to help manage anxiety—how does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I could definitely use some calmness before speaking.

Consultant: Fantastic! During our next session, we can explore some relaxation exercises. For now, let’s take a moment to recap what we've discussed today and how you might tackle the upcoming group activities.

User: Sure. I’ll work on reframing my thoughts and preparing comments. I want to remind myself that I do belong and that everyone has their own struggles.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. I believe you can handle this! 

User: Thank you for your support. I really appreciate what we talked about today. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here to help you every step of the way. If you have any thoughts or feelings you want to explore further, we can definitely do that in our next meeting. 

User: Definitely. I look forward to it! 

Consultant: Great! Take care of yourself until then, and remember to be kind to yourself on this journey. 

User: I will! See you next time. 

Consultant: See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Wang! I’m really glad to see you today. I understand you’ve been feeling quite anxious recently due to your new learning challenges. Can you tell me how you've been feeling about your studies and the pressures you’re experiencing?

User: Hi! Yes, I truly feel overwhelmed. The new courses are much harder than I expected, and I worry I won't keep up. It makes me anxious, and sometimes I even feel a bit lost.

Consultant: It sounds like these courses are really putting a strain on you. When you're feeling lost, what thoughts usually cross your mind? How do those thoughts affect your feelings?

User: I often think, "What if I fail this course?" or "I’m not smart enough for this." Those thoughts make me feel really down and anxious.

Consultant: I see. It’s understandable to feel that way when faced with new challenges. Let’s focus on those thoughts. Would you say these thoughts are realistic? How much evidence do you think supports those worries?

User: I guess there's no solid evidence. I did well in my previous courses, but it's just this fear that overwhelms me.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Wang. It seems that you have evidence from your past successes that doesn’t align with your current thoughts. If a friend expressed similar worries, what advice would you give them?

User: I’d probably tell them to focus on their strengths and remind them that they’ve succeeded before. I wouldn’t want them to get stuck in negative thoughts.

Consultant: Exactly! You already have the tools to remind yourself of your strengths. Let's try an exercise: when that anxiety kicks in, take a moment to list at least three things you've achieved before. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I can see how that could help shift my mindset a bit.

Consultant: Great! Now, aside from academic pressures, have you found time for activities that bring you joy or relaxation?

User: Not really... I’m so caught up in studies that I hardly take breaks. 

Consultant: Taking breaks is essential for mental health. What are some activities you used to enjoy doing before school got busy?

User: I liked playing video games and hanging out with friends. 

Consultant: Those activities sound like they could be beneficial for you. How about we come up with a plan to schedule time for these activities? What do you think?

User: I think I’d like that! It would be nice to have a bit of fun amidst all the stress.

Consultant: That’s a positive step! Let’s set a goal for how often you can play games or connect with friends. Would a couple of evenings a week sound manageable?

User: Yes, that’s doable. I can try to set aside two evenings for friends and gaming.

Consultant: Fantastic! Now, let's discuss how you can manage your time and prioritize your tasks. Do you have a study schedule already?

User: I try to stick to a schedule, but it’s pretty rough and sometimes I get derailed.

Consultant: It’s common to feel that way. How about we work on creating a more realistic schedule that allows for breaks and includes your time for fun? What subjects can you prioritize?

User: I think I can prioritize management and math since they’re most challenging right now.

Consultant: That sounds solid. Remember to include manageable study blocks and some downtime, as it’ll help reduce anxiety. What do you plan to do first in your new schedule?

User: I will start by tackling management assignments tomorrow morning and then take a break in the afternoon.

Consultant: Wonderful plan! As you start this new schedule, pay attention to how your feelings change. Are there any specific tools or tricks that can help you stick to the schedule?

User: I could use reminders on my phone and maybe set small goals for each study session.

Consultant: Excellent strategy! Using reminders and setting small goals can keep you on track. As you work on this, how do you feel about your ability to handle the course pressure now?

User: I feel a bit more in control. Having a plan makes me feel hopeful.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It seems like you’re gaining a sense of control over your situation. If you ever feel overwhelmed again, what will you remind yourself?

User: I should remember my past successes and the importance of taking breaks.

Consultant: Exactly right! You have the foundations to handle this pressure. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on your progress—what’s the most significant change you feel since we started working together?

User: I think I’ve learned to recognize my negative thoughts better and I’m more proactive about planning my time.

Consultant: That’s a big achievement, Wang! It’s a crucial step towards managing your feelings. Keep applying these strategies, and remember, it’s completely okay to seek balance. Do you feel ready to tackle the coming weeks?

User: Yes, I do! I’m much more optimistic than when we started. Thank you!

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Remember to take care of yourself and prioritize your well-being. I'm here for you if you need more support in the future. Best of luck, and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Wang! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling about your social experiences at university lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit nervous about the social events, but at the same time, I’m also excited to meet new people. I really want to make friends and enjoy my time in college.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset to have! Balancing excitement with a bit of nervousness is really common in new social situations. Can you tell me more about the recent social events you've participated in and how you felt during those moments?

User: Sure! I attended a club meeting last week. At first, I was really anxious and hesitant to speak up, but once I got involved, it felt good to share my thoughts. I noticed I was a bit kinder to myself during that process.

Consultant: It sounds like you had a positive experience even if it started off with some anxiety. Recognizing that kindness towards yourself is a big step! What do you think helped you feel more comfortable as the meeting went on?

User: I think talking about something I was passionate about helped. I realized that people were interested in my ideas, which made me feel more confident.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Engaging in a topic you're passionate about can definitely boost your confidence. Let’s explore that further—can you think of a specific moment during the meeting when you felt that shift from anxiety to confidence?

User: Yes! There was a moment when I shared my opinion about a project, and someone nodded in agreement. It felt really rewarding to be heard and validated.

Consultant: That sounds like a key moment for you. Validation from others can have a strong impact on our confidence. How did that experience change your perspective on social interactions moving forward?

User: It made me realize that people are not as judgmental as I thought. They actually want to listen. I feel like I can approach conversations with more openness now.

Consultant: That's a significant shift in thinking! Embracing that openness could help reduce the anxiety you feel in future interactions. Looking ahead, what specific social situations would you like to tackle next to further build your confidence?

User: I’d like to try speaking in smaller groups or maybe even initiating conversations with classmates. 

Consultant: Those sound like great goals! Starting with smaller groups can make the process feel more manageable. How can you prepare for those moments, so you feel more at ease when you approach someone?

User: I think I could come up with some conversation starters or questions in advance. Having a plan would help me feel more relaxed.

Consultant: That's a fantastic strategy! Preparation can definitely ease anxiety. Maybe you could also set a small goal for each interaction, like asking one person a question or sharing one of your thoughts. How does that sound to you?

User: Yeah, that sounds doable! I’ll aim for that. 

Consultant: Excellent! With each small step, you’ll continue to build on your social confidence. Remember, each interaction is an opportunity for growth. How do you feel about the progress you’ve made so far?

User: I feel pretty good about it! Reflecting on how far I’ve come makes me happy. I just hope to keep building on this momentum.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! It’s great to celebrate your progress. As we continue our sessions, we can discuss how to manage any anxiety that may come up and also reinforce those positive experiences. What do you think about that?

User: I think that would really help! I want to keep reinforcing those positive feelings.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can focus on those positive experiences and find ways to challenge any lingering anxious thoughts. As a next step, let’s reflect on the social events you participate in. Would you be willing to keep a journal about your experiences to track your feelings?

User: I’d be open to that! Writing things down usually helps me process everything better.

Consultant: Great choice! Journaling can help you reflect on both the challenges and successes during your social interactions. You could jot down what went well, what was difficult, and how you felt throughout. How about we set a goal for you to share your reflections in our next session?

User: That sounds like a plan! I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: Wonderful! Each reflection will help us identify patterns and work through any obstacles together. Before we wrap up today, is there anything specific you want to focus on or any concerns you have for our next meeting?

User: Not really, I just want to remember to be kind to myself and keep pushing forward.

Consultant: That's a perfect mindset! Being kind to yourself is key. Remember, progress takes time and persistence. I’m proud of the steps you're taking, and I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I feel more optimistic about moving forward.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiao Wang! I’m here for you, and I believe in your ability to succeed. Have a fantastic week, and take care!

User: Thank you! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad you're back today. It's great to hear that you've been feeling happier due to your recent social achievements. How are you feeling about your social interactions these days?

User: Hi! Thanks for having me. I'm actually quite excited. I had a few successful interactions recently that made me feel good. I think I'm starting to enjoy socializing more and worrying less about what others think of me.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It sounds like you’re really starting to enjoy the positive aspects of socializing. Can you tell me more about a specific interaction that made you feel accomplished?

User: Sure! Last week, I joined a study group with my classmates. I contributed to the discussion, and it felt good when they complimented my ideas. I realized I could share my thoughts without being so anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a meaningful experience! Receiving compliments can really boost our confidence. How did that feedback make you feel about your ability to engage with others?

User: It really helped! I felt more capable and accepted in the group. I usually worry about sounding stupid, but this time, I felt more comfortable. 

Consultant: It's wonderful that you felt more capable and accepted. That comfort is a significant step forward! Now, as you reflect on that experience, what do you think contributed to your increased comfort in the study group?

User: I guess I focused more on the conversation and less on my anxiety. The positive remarks from others made me feel validated, so I let go of my fears a bit.

Consultant: It seems like you found a way to focus on the interaction rather than your worries. That shift in focus is a valuable skill. As you continue to strengthen your social confidence, what steps do you think you could take to reinforce this newfound comfort in future interactions?

User: Maybe I could practice speaking up more often in smaller groups first, so I feel ready to share my thoughts more freely, even in larger groups.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Gradually increasing your participation can help reinforce your confidence. How do you feel about setting some specific goals for yourself in social situations moving forward?

User: I think it would help! I can aim to contribute at least one idea in every group discussion, no matter how small it is. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great goal, Wang! By setting achievable objectives, you're reinforcing your social skills while gradually boosting your confidence. How do you envision feeling as you meet these goals?

User: I hope to feel more confident overall, not just in studying but in social situations too. I want to keep this momentum going.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! Maintaining that momentum is important. What might be some ways to remind yourself of your progress when you encounter challenges in social situations?

User: I could keep a journal to reflect on my experiences and note the positive feedback I receive. Reading those entries might help if I start to doubt myself again.

Consultant: A journal is a fantastic idea! It will help you track your growth and serve as a reminder of your achievements whenever you feel uncertain. What kind of entries do you think you would include?

User: I’d write about my interactions, any compliments I received, and how I felt afterward. It could help me see the progress over time.

Consultant: That sounds like a meaningful practice, highlighting both your successes and your feelings. As we work together, how can I support you in keeping this practice consistent?

User: Maybe you can help me set a reminder to journal after my social interactions each week. That way, I won’t forget to reflect on my experiences. 

Consultant: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that! Regular reflections can be incredibly beneficial. As we wrap up today’s session, what are your main takeaways regarding your social experiences and the strategies we've discussed?

User: I learned that I can focus on the conversation rather than my anxiety, and setting small goals will help me build confidence. Journaling will also remind me of my progress, which will be motivating.

Consultant: Those are insightful takeaways, Wang! You've recognized powerful approaches to build and sustain your social confidence. Do you feel optimistic about applying these strategies in your life?

User: Yes, I do! I feel much more equipped to handle social situations and to keep reinforcing my confidence. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Remember, you are making great strides, and your willingness to engage and grow is commendable. If you encounter any setbacks, know that it’s a part of the process. I’m here to support you whenever you need it.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support and guidance. I feel much better equipped to handle things moving forward.

Consultant: You're welcome, Wang! It's been a pleasure working with you. Remember to celebrate your accomplishments along the way. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Wang! I'm glad to see you for our session today. How are you feeling about everything that's been happening in your life lately?

User: Hi! I feel pretty good, really. I've been really engaged with my studies and my extracurricular activities in the club. My anxiety has gone down a lot, and I'm optimistic about the future.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some significant progress. Can you share more about what specific changes you've noticed in your emotions or thoughts during this time?

User: Sure! I used to worry a lot about how I was performing academically, but lately, I've felt more confident in my abilities. I find myself trusting my instincts during exams and assignments.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you've developed more trust in your abilities! That self-efficacy is so important. How do you think this newfound confidence has affected your daily life or interactions with your peers?

User: I think it has helped me be more social. I’m participating more in discussions and activities, and I enjoy collaborating with my classmates, which has also strengthened our relationships.

Consultant: Building relationships and engaging socially is a huge part of college life! It sounds like you're really embracing this experience. Do you have any specific instances where you felt particularly proud of your progress or contributions recently?

User: Yes! Just last week, I helped organize a study group, and everyone said it was useful. I also presented a project confidently, and the feedback was incredibly positive.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Xiao Wang! Organizing a study group shows leadership and collaboration skills, which are invaluable. It’s evident that you’re thriving. Reflecting on your journey, what do you think were some key factors that contributed to this shift in your mindset?

User: I think being involved more with my peers and having supportive friends has made a big difference. Plus, I've been really focused on setting realistic goals for myself.

Consultant: Support from friends and setting achievable goals can have such a profound impact. How do you feel about the goals you've set for yourself? Are they still aligning well with your future aspirations?

User: I’m feeling good about them right now, but I haven't really thought about long-term goals yet. I’m not sure what I want to focus on after this year.

Consultant: That’s an important consideration! Let’s take a moment to think about your long-term aspirations. What areas are you interested in exploring further that might help shape your future goals?

User: I’m really interested in psychology and maybe even counseling, but I’m not completely sure what specific path I should take.

Consultant: That’s a thoughtful area to consider! Psychology and counseling can lead to many fulfilling paths. What aspects of psychology excite you the most, and how do you see yourself using those interests in the future?

User: I’m fascinated by how people's thoughts and emotions connect and how I can help them overcome their struggles. I guess I want to make a positive impact in that way.

Consultant: That’s a commendable aspiration, Xiao Wang! Helping others through understanding thoughts and emotions is a valuable pursuit. Considering this, how might you start taking steps toward those goals in a practical way?

User: Maybe I could look for volunteering opportunities or internships related to psychology during the summer. That could give me a taste of what it’s like to work in that field.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Volunteering or interning can provide you with practical experience and deeper insights into the field. How do you feel about setting a timeline for when you want to start exploring these opportunities?

User: I think setting a goal to start looking in the next month would work well for me. It gives me some time to research and see what’s available.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! A month should give you a great window to explore options. As you prepare for this next chapter, what emotions come up for you when thinking about this new journey?

User: I feel a mix of excitement and a little nervousness, but I think it's a good kind of nervous, like I’m challenging myself.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel both excited and nervous when stepping into new situations. Embracing that mix means you're growing! Do you have any strategies in place to manage those nerves as you take these next steps?

User: I think I’ll try to remind myself of the confidence I’ve built this past year. I can also talk to friends or mentors for support if I need to.

Consultant: That's a great approach! Leaning on your support network and recalling your successes will certainly help. As we wrap up our session, what do you see as your key takeaways today?

User: I realized that I have made significant progress and that I have concrete steps to take toward my future interests. It feels empowering!

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve highlighted your growth and laid down some actionable steps. Remember, it’s all about taking one step at a time. I’m really proud of what you’ve accomplished today. How do you feel about everything we discussed?

User: I feel good! This session really helped clarify my thoughts and made me more excited about the future.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! As we conclude, remember to celebrate your progress and don't hesitate to reach out if you need further guidance. You’ve done amazing work. Until next time, take care!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’ll see you next time!
