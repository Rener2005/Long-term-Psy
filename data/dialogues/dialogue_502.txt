Consultant: Hello Xiaomu, I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling pretty low. Sometimes I just feel overwhelmed, especially with the upcoming exams. I don't think I'm prepared enough.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like there's a lot of pressure building up with exams approaching. Can you share more about what specific thoughts or feelings come up for you when you think about your preparation?

User: I just think about how I'm letting my mom down. I used to do well, but now it feels like I'm not even trying. I often break down and cry, and I don't know why I can't focus on my studies.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling a lot of pressure, not just from yourself but also from wanting to meet your mom's expectations. Let's explore those feelings a bit more. When you think about your studies or preparation, what thoughts go through your mind?

User: Usually, I think I’m going to fail. I feel like everyone else is doing better than me, and I'm just falling behind. It really discourages me.

Consultant: That sounds tough. When you have those thoughts, like “I'm going to fail,” what emotions do you feel in your body? 

User: I feel a knot in my stomach, and my heart races. I just want to avoid everything, like the exams or even talking about it. 

Consultant: It seems like your thoughts are creating a lot of anxiety. Avoiding situations that make you feel anxious can be a natural response, but it seems that it’s also making things harder for you. Have there been any specific situations lately where you’ve tried to avoid thinking about your exams?

User: Yeah, during the last mock exam, I just didn't go. I couldn't face it. I know it was a bad choice, but I just couldn’t help it.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you're overwhelmed. Let’s think about that. What do you think led you to make the choice not to attend the exam?

User: I was so afraid of not doing well that I thought it would just be easier not to show up. I didn't want to see my name at the bottom of the list again.

Consultant: That is a very common feeling. It's often easier to avoid situations where we fear we might fail. But avoiding can also reinforce the anxiety. How do you think facing those situations, even if they’re difficult, might help you in the long run?

User: I guess I would be forced to confront my fears, but part of me still worries that it would just confirm how bad I am.

Consultant: It makes sense that you would have that fear. Let’s challenge that thought—what evidence do you have that attending could confirm you’re “bad” at this? Can we think of any alternative outcomes?

User: Well, maybe attending could actually show me where I really stand and help me improve. I just have a hard time believing that.

Consultant: That's a very insightful point. Facing the situation might indeed provide you with a clearer picture and a chance to improve. What if we set a small goal for the upcoming weeks to help you gradually approach this?

User: I guess if I could just study a bit every day, maybe I wouldn’t feel so lost. But what if I still can't focus?

Consultant: That's a great starting point! We can create a study plan that breaks down your material into smaller, manageable tasks. How about we focus on creating a schedule that integrates short breaks to help prevent overwhelm? 

User: That might work. I like the idea of short breaks, but I’m worried I might not stick to it.

Consultant: It's okay to feel that way. Why don’t we include some accountability? You might share your plan with someone you trust to help you stay on track. Would that help?

User: Yeah, I could tell my mom about the plan. She always wants to support me.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea, Xiaomu! It sounds like this plan could not only help you academically but also strengthen your support system. Now, how about figuring out a small, specific study goal you can start with?

User: Maybe I can start with just 30 minutes a day of studying math to begin with?

Consultant: That sounds very achievable! Focusing on just 30 minutes daily can help you gradually build your confidence and effectiveness. How can we make sure you stick to this plan?

User: I could set an alarm to remind me to start studying. It might help.

Consultant: Excellent! Having reminders can be a great strategy. Also, if you find yourself feeling anxious about studying, remember to take deep breaths and remind yourself that it’s just a process. 

User: That makes sense. I’ll try to keep that in mind as well.

Consultant: I believe in you, Xiaomu. Remember that it’s completely okay to feel anxious, and addressing those feelings can help you move forward. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the steps we’ve discussed?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I still worry about my grades, but I think I have some strategies now to help manage my feelings.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! It’s crucial to acknowledge your feelings but also to empower yourself with strategies. Let’s check in again soon to see how these changes are working for you. Until then, remember you’re not alone in this, and it’s okay to reach out when you need support. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaomu! I'm here for you whenever you need support. Take care until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaomu! I’m really glad you’re here today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. To be honest, things have been pretty rough. I still feel a lot of anxiety, especially thinking about my grades and how I've been avoiding my classmates.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, and it’s understandable to feel that way. Can you share more about what specific situations make you feel anxious regarding your grades and social interactions?

User: Whenever I see classmates talking about their grades, I get this intense feeling of fear. I just want to hide because I don’t want to be judged or asked about my performance.

Consultant: It sounds like avoiding those situations feels like a safe choice for you right now. Let’s explore that fear a bit more. What thoughts come to your mind when you think about being asked about your grades?

User: I instantly worry that I’ll be seen as a failure, and I feel like I won’t be able to answer well. It’s like everyone expects me to do great since I’ve done well in the past.

Consultant: That’s a lot of pressure to put on yourself. I hear you feeling the weight of others’ expectations. Do you think those thoughts could be too extreme or maybe not fully realistic?

User: Yeah, I guess they are. I know I’ve done well before, but it’s like I can’t accept that I might fail or struggle this time.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel that way, especially when you’re under pressure. Let’s try to challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that others really think you need to do perfectly all the time? 

User: Well, I sometimes hear them discussing their scores, and I feel like they look down on anyone who isn’t doing well. But maybe that’s just my interpretation.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, Xiaomu. It can be helpful to separate how others might perceive things versus our own interpretations. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them?

User: I’d tell them that they shouldn’t worry too much about others and just focus on doing their best. 

Consultant: Exactly! Applying that same kindness to yourself can be really beneficial. How might it feel if you allowed yourself to focus on your own journey, rather than what others think?

User: I think it would feel relieving, but it’s hard to let go of that pressure. 

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Let's think of some small steps you can take to begin shifting your focus. What if you shared your feelings with a friend? 

User: I haven’t thought about that, but it sounds helpful. I guess it could make me feel a little less alone.

Consultant: Absolutely. Sharing can create a supportive environment. How do you think you’d feel after telling a friend about your anxiety? 

User: Maybe a bit lighter. Like I’m not carrying all this weight by myself anymore.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Can we brainstorm a couple of relaxation techniques you can use when that anxiety kicks in, like before a social interaction or exam?

User: Yeah, that would help! I often feel so overwhelmed in those moments.

Consultant: One technique you can try is deep breathing. When you feel anxious, taking a moment to breathe in deeply and slowly can calm your body. Would you like to try it together now? 

User: Sure, I’d love to.

Consultant: Okay, let’s do this. Inhale deeply through your nose… hold it for a moment… and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Repeat this a few times. How does that feel?

User: It feels good! I didn’t realize how tense I was.

Consultant: Great! Using techniques like this can help you in those anxious moments. Now, let’s talk about re-engaging with school activities. Are there any events or clubs that interest you?

User: I love singing and was thinking about joining the choir again. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Singing can be a great way to express emotions and connect with others. How would rejoining the choir make you feel?

User: It would definitely help me feel more connected and less isolated, but I'm still a bit scared of performing.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel scared about performing. What if you just approached it as a way to enjoy music with others, rather than focusing solely on performance?

User: That makes sense. I think I can try to focus on the fun aspects of it.

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember, it's about the experience and not the perfection. It might also help to practice with a small group before a bigger performance. 

User: That sounds much better. I think I can do that!

Consultant: Great! You’re taking important steps here, Xiaomu. Reflecting on our progress, what do you feel has been your biggest realization today?

User: I’ve realized that I can be kinder to myself and challenge my negative thoughts. 

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a significant breakthrough. As we wrap up our session today, what strategies do you think you’ll use to tackle your anxiety moving forward?

User: I’ll practice deep breathing and try to communicate more with my friends. I’ll also focus on what I enjoy about singing.

Consultant: Those sound like fantastic strategies to implement. I'm really proud of you for taking charge of your feelings and stepping toward more positive experiences. Remember, it's a journey, and you’re doing great!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaomu! I’m here for you whenever you need help. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you here today. It sounds like you've had some ups and downs recently. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling pretty down. It's like a mix of pressure from school and this overwhelming feeling of self-doubt, especially after I was asked to give a speech for a school event. I want to feel more confident, but I often find myself wanting to withdraw and just be alone.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing quite a bit of anxiety, especially regarding that upcoming speech, and it's leading to feelings of isolation. Can you share what thoughts come to your mind when you think about giving that speech?

User: I keep thinking that I might mess up or that people won't like what I have to say. It makes me so nervous that I sometimes feel like I can’t even face them. 

Consultant: Those thoughts about messing up and worrying about others' opinions seem to be quite heavy for you. When you think about those thoughts, how do they make you feel emotionally?

User: They make me feel really anxious and even a bit hopeless. Sometimes I wonder if I should just refuse to do it.

Consultant: I can see how challenging that is for you. You mentioned feeling hopeless; it seems like those thoughts are providing a barrier to your confidence. Can you remember a time when you spoke in front of others and felt good about it? 

User: Yeah, actually! During the school talent show, I sang and received a lot of support from my friends. That felt amazing.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful experience—a time when you received positive feedback and felt confident! How do you think that experience might relate to your upcoming speech?

User: I guess I should focus on that good feeling, but I can’t help feeling that this is different. What if I don’t do well?

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. It's easy to let negative thoughts take over. Let's try to challenge that thinking. What evidence do you have that suggests you will mess up this time, especially considering how well you performed at the talent show?

User: Well, I suppose I don’t have solid evidence. I just have this overwhelming fear of failing.

Consultant: Exactly! Sometimes our fears can cloud our judgment. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about handling these fears?

User: I’d probably tell them to believe in themselves and remember the good experiences they’ve had. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight! You already have a positive approach to support others. How about applying that same kindness to yourself? What might that look like in preparation for your speech?

User: I could remind myself of my success in the talent show and think positively about the speech. Maybe I can practice in front of my mom to get her support.

Consultant: Practicing in front of your mom sounds like a great idea! Not only would it help you prepare, but it could also strengthen your bond with her. How do you feel about involving your mom in this process?

User: It feels good to think about it. She often encourages me, so that could really help.

Consultant: It seems like reaching out for her support could ease some of your anxiety as well. Have you talked to her about how you're feeling lately?

User: Not really, I tend to keep things to myself. But I think I could try talking to her about it.

Consultant: Sharing your feelings with your mom could be a great step forward, especially in supporting your confidence. What specific parts of the speech preparation would you like to discuss with her?

User: I could ask her for feedback on my content and maybe practice my delivery with her.

Consultant: That’s a constructive approach! Having her feedback might help reinforce your confidence. What strategies can you use to remind yourself of your strengths during this preparatory phase?

User: I can try to make a list of things I’ve done well, like my performances, and read it when I feel nervous.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic strategy! Focusing on your strengths will help reinforce your self-efficacy. As we wrap up our discussion today, what will be your next steps for both your speech and communicating with your mom?

User: I’ll make a list of my strengths, practice with my mom, and try to remind myself of my talent show experience.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent action steps, and I believe they will help you feel more prepared. Remember that it’s okay to feel nervous, and you have a way to turn those feelings into something positive. I'm proud of you for taking these steps, and I'm looking forward to hearing about how it goes with your mom and your speech!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. It feels good to have a plan now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad you’re feeling more positive about it. If you need any additional support, don’t hesitate to reach out. You’ve got this, and I believe in you!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaomu! It’s great to see you again. Last time, we discussed your emotional communication with your mother and how it has positively impacted your stress levels. How have things been going since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel pretty good actually. Talking to my mom has become easier, and I find myself feeling more at peace after our conversations. It does help with the stress from my studies.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made some real progress in connecting with your mother. Can you share what specific things you’ve talked about that have helped you feel this way?

User: We talked about how I’ve been feeling overwhelmed with school and how I sometimes cry alone. She listened and gave me advice, which made me feel less alone in my struggles.

Consultant: It must feel comforting to have that support from your mother. Feeling heard can make a big difference. Have you noticed any changes in your emotions or studying habits as a result of these conversations?

User: Yes! I feel less anxious, and I’ve started to make a study schedule. I can’t say I follow it perfectly, but I’m trying. Just getting started helps a bit.

Consultant: That’s a great step forward, Xiaomu! It sounds like you’re starting to take control of your study routine. What do you think is helping you stick to your study schedule, even if just a little?

User: Maybe it’s because I’m more open with my mom now. I feel like I have someone to share my goals with, which motivates me a bit.

Consultant: Sharing your goals with someone can definitely provide extra motivation. It's like having an accountability partner. What would you like to achieve with your study schedule in the coming weeks?

User: I want to feel more organized and less overwhelmed. I’d like to boost my confidence before the exams.

Consultant: That’s a very realistic aim. Feeling organized can reduce anxiety. Let’s think about some strategies to help you stay on track. Would you be open to trying some new study techniques?

User: Yes, I’m open to suggestions! I think I need some help figuring out what works best for me.

Consultant: Great! One technique we can try is breaking your study sessions into smaller, manageable chunks. This way, it might feel less daunting. How do you usually study?

User: I usually just try to cover everything at once, but I end up feeling tired and not remembering much.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re putting a lot of pressure on yourself when you study. How about we experiment with studying for shorter periods, maybe 25-30 minutes, followed by a brief break? Would you be willing to try that?

User: That sounds like it could be helpful! I usually just sit for hours, so breaks might refresh my mind.

Consultant: Exactly! Breaks are important for maintaining focus. After your break, you can give yourself a small reward for completing a study session. What might that reward be for you?

User: I could watch an episode of a show I like or listen to some music.

Consultant: Those are excellent rewards! They can help keep you motivated. Now, let’s talk about your emotional management as you prepare for your exams. How do you currently cope with feelings of anxiety when studying?

User: Sometimes I just sit in silence and try to breathe, but it doesn't always work. Other times, I just feel overwhelmed and don't know what to do.

Consultant: It’s helpful that you’re trying to breathe through it. Deep breathing can be effective. Besides that, do you think engaging in physical activities, like your throwing events at school, could also help release some tension?

User: Yes, I love throwing! It feels like a good way to let off steam, but I’ve been focusing more on studying lately and not doing it as much.

Consultant: Perhaps we can find a balance. Engaging in activities you enjoy can help alleviate stress and improve your concentration. How about setting aside specific times for both studying and physical activities?

User: That sounds good! If I can keep that balance, I might feel better overall.

Consultant: Absolutely! Maintaining that balance is key for your well-being. Let's also reinforce the communication with your mom. How can you share your new study strategies with her?

User: I can tell her about my new plan and maybe ask her to check in on me sometimes to see how I’m doing.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Having her support while you implement your new study strategies can help keep you accountable and provide encouragement. What do you think you’d say to her?

User: I might say something like, “Mom, I’m trying a new study schedule, can you help me stick to it?” 

Consultant: That’s perfect! Clear communication about your needs will strengthen your connection and support system. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s clarify your goals for the upcoming weeks.

User: I want to stick to my study schedule, balance studying with physical activity, and keep communicating openly with my mom.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals, Xiaomu! You’re on a positive path. Keep in mind that it’s okay to adjust your strategies as needed. I believe you have the tools to manage your emotions and improve your study habits. If you ever find yourself feeling overwhelmed again, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel more hopeful and ready to try these new strategies. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’re making significant steps forward. Remember, we’re here to keep building on your progress. Looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaomu! Welcome to our session today. I’m glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've been trying to work on my study habits. I feel a bit better than before, but sometimes I still find it hard to concentrate. I worry if my progress is enough for the upcoming exams.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're making an effort to improve your study habits. Let's talk more about your feelings regarding your concentration. What thoughts come to your mind when you struggle to focus?

User: I often think that I’m not good enough and that I’ll fail if I don’t study perfectly. It makes me feel overwhelmed and anxious.

Consultant: I see. Those thoughts can be really heavy to carry. Can we explore how specific thoughts make you feel? For instance, what emotion do you experience when you think, "I'm not good enough"?

User: I feel really anxious and discouraged. Sometimes, I just want to give up because it feels too hard.

Consultant: That sounds tough, Xiaomu. It's normal to feel discouraged under pressure. Let's consider this thought: "I'm not good enough." How valid do you think that thought is? Can we challenge it together?

User: I guess there might be some evidence against it. I did well in school activities like the singing competition and sports events, but it’s just hard to see my achievements right now.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s wonderful that you recognized your successes. Those achievements reflect your capabilities. Let’s try to replace that negative thought with something more balanced. What could you tell yourself instead that acknowledges your efforts?

User: Maybe something like, "I have done well in other areas, and I can improve in my studies too." 

Consultant: Yes, that’s a fantastic reframe! It’s positive and acknowledges both your struggles and your strengths. How does that new thought make you feel when you think about it?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Maybe I can find ways to be better without putting too much stress on myself.

Consultant: Hope is a powerful emotion, Xiaomu. Let’s build on that. What small goals can you set this week to help you steadily progress in your studies without overwhelming yourself?

User: I could start by reviewing just one subject each day for an hour, instead of trying to do everything at once.

Consultant: That sounds like a reasonable plan! Focusing on one subject at a time can help reduce anxiety and make studying feel more manageable. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel relieved! It feels more doable compared to trying to cover everything in one day.

Consultant: I’m glad you feel that way! Let’s also think about how you can keep track of your progress. What kind of system could you use to monitor your study time and how much you cover?

User: I think I could create a checklist for what I want to study each day. It would help me see how much I accomplish.

Consultant: A checklist sounds like a great strategy! It can give you a sense of achievement as you check off each item. Would you like to share how you plan to reward yourself after completing your tasks?

User: I could treat myself to some time playing games or listening to music after I finish my studies for the day.

Consultant: That’s a lovely way to reward yourself and reinforce your motivation. Balancing work and play is important. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today regarding your study plans or feelings?

User: I think we’ve covered a lot! I just hope I can maintain this positive mindset moving forward.

Consultant: Maintaining that positive mindset is key! Remember, it's okay to have ups and downs. Reflecting on your progress can help. As we wrap up today, what do you think you’ll do to keep your motivation high?

User: I’ll keep reminding myself of my strengths and maybe look back at my checklist to see how far I’ve come.

Consultant: That’s a perfect strategy! Reflecting on your strengths and your achievements can really help maintain a positive outlook. As we finish today’s session, what would you consider your biggest takeaway from our time together?

User: I learned that I can be kind to myself and that I’m capable of improving my study methods. It's okay to take small steps.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve gained important insights today. With the strategies we've discussed, I believe you’ll do great in your studies. Remember, I’m here to support you whenever you need guidance. Until next time, keep up the good work!

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help. I feel more confident now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad to hear that. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Mu! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling really good lately. After my recent progress in the mock tests, I've regained some confidence in my studies. It's surprising how much a little success can change my mood.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It's wonderful that you’re feeling more confident after seeing progress. Can you share more about how this progress has influenced your feelings and study routine?

User: I've been more motivated to stick to my revision plans. Instead of feeling overwhelmed, I feel excited to study. It’s as if I’m starting to believe that I can do well in the upcoming exams.

Consultant: It sounds like that boost in confidence has really made a difference in your motivation. What specific strategies or changes did you implement in your study routine after the mock tests?

User: I started breaking down my study material into smaller sections, which makes it less daunting. I also set small goals for each study session, and that helps keep me focused.

Consultant: That's a great approach! Setting small, attainable goals can really help manage stress and keep you on track. How do you feel when you meet those goals?

User: I feel accomplished! It gives me a sense of progress, and I look forward to studying more instead of dreading it.

Consultant: That sense of accomplishment is powerful! It seems like you’re building a positive cycle of motivation. Have there been any moments when you felt your old anxieties creeping back in?

User: A little. Sometimes, when I think too much about the actual exam day, I get nervous. I worry if I’ll perform well or if I'll forget everything.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious about the exam day. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit more. When you think about forgetting everything, what specific images or thoughts come to mind?

User: I imagine sitting in the exam room and staring at questions without being able to remember anything. It feels really overwhelming.

Consultant: I can see how that thought could be very daunting. Let’s challenge that idea together. What evidence do you have that supports this fear? Have there been times when you were able to recall information during crucial moments?

User: Well, during the mock tests, I actually remembered a lot more than I thought I would. I just need to remind myself of that.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a key point to focus on. If a friend were feeling the same way, what would you tell her to help her see things differently?

User: I’d probably say that she has studied hard and should trust herself. I want to believe that for myself, too!

Consultant: That’s a lovely sentiment. Trusting ourselves can make a huge difference. Let’s work on affirming that belief. How about we create some positive affirmations you can say to yourself before studying and during exams?

User: That sounds helpful! Maybe something like "I've prepared well, and I can do this"?

Consultant: That’s a perfect affirmation! It reinforces your preparation and confidence. Would you like to add any other affirmations that resonate with you?

User: Maybe something like "No matter what happens, I’ll handle it." That feels reassuring.

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation! It emphasizes resilience. Now, as we approach the end of our session, how do you feel about the strategies we've discussed today? Do you think they can help maintain your positive mindset heading into your exams?

User: I really think they will! I've already felt a shift in my mindset just from talking about it. I’m excited to implement these strategies.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Before we finish, let’s take a moment to reflect on how far you’ve come and the skills you’ve developed. What would you say is your biggest takeaway from our sessions?

User: My biggest takeaway is that I can adjust my mindset and that a little progress can lead to a lot of motivation. I feel stronger now.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization. Remember that you have the tools to manage your emotions and stay focused. If challenges arise, you can always revisit the strategies we discussed. This will be our last session for now, but remember, you can come back anytime you need support.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate all the help. I feel much more prepared and positive about the exams now.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xiao Mu! I’m really proud of the progress you’ve made. Take care of yourself, and remember to celebrate your achievements as you continue your journey. Good luck with your exams!
