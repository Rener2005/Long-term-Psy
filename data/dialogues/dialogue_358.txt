Consultant: Hello, welcome to our session today! I understand that you've been going through quite a challenging time with your recent job loss. Can you share with me how you’ve been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious and confused since I got laid off. I’m not sure what direction to take in my career now, and it feels overwhelming. My family is worried too, and that adds more pressure.

Consultant: I completely understand how difficult this situation must be for you. Feeling anxious and overwhelmed is a natural response to such a significant change. Could you tell me a bit more about what specific thoughts or feelings come up for you when you think about your career and future?

User: Well, I often think that I'm not good enough to find a new job. Sometimes I feel like I’ll never get hired again or that I’ll be stuck in this situation forever. It really makes me feel low.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts of not being good enough and fearing being stuck are weighing heavily on you. Let’s explore those feelings a bit more. When you think that you won’t find a new job, what emotions does that trigger?

User: It makes me feel hopeless and really anxious. I start doubting myself and it just spirals from there. I can’t stop thinking about it.

Consultant: That’s quite a heavy burden to carry. It seems like these thoughts are creating a cycle of anxiety and self-doubt for you. Have you noticed any specific situations that trigger these thoughts or feelings?

User: Mostly when I start looking at job postings or when my family asks me about my job search. It just reminds me that I’m unemployed.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Those situations can certainly amplify your feelings of anxiety. Let’s identify those automatic thoughts you experience in those moments. For example, when you see a job post and feel anxious, what thoughts go through your mind at that time?

User: I usually think that I’m not qualified enough or that there are many candidates better than me. It just feels discouraging.

Consultant: You mentioned feeling like there are many better candidates. Let’s challenge that thought a little. How much evidence do you have that supports the idea that you aren’t qualified? Can you think of any skills or experiences that you bring to the table?

User: I guess I have some relevant experience and skills from my previous job. But I just focus on the negative.

Consultant: It's great that you recognize your skills and experience! It’s common to focus on the negatives, especially in tough situations. If a friend were in your position, how would you encourage them to view their qualifications?

User: I’d probably tell them that they have skills to offer and that they should be confident in themselves.

Consultant: Exactly! You would encourage them to see their value. Let’s try to apply that same perspective to yourself. What’s one thing you can acknowledge about your qualifications that could help shift your negative thinking?

User: I can say that I have experience in project management, and I’ve led teams successfully. That should count for something.

Consultant: Absolutely, it certainly does! Acknowledging your strengths is a powerful step. Now, let’s think about how to tackle your job search with this new mindset. What might be some small steps you could take instead of feeling overwhelmed by the entire process?

User: Maybe I could focus on updating my resume first and apply to just a couple of jobs each week instead of trying to tackle everything at once.

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive and manageable approach! Taking small steps can help reduce that sense of overwhelm. How about we also discuss ways to improve communication with your family regarding your job search? How do you usually talk to them about it?

User: I tend to avoid the topic because I know they worry a lot. But when I do talk about it, it feels like they're just trying to pressure me.

Consultant: It makes sense that you’d want to avoid that pressure. It could be helpful to express to them how their concern makes you feel. Have you thought about sharing your plan for your job search with them, so they know you have steps in place?

User: I haven’t tried that yet. I guess that could help them see that I’m taking action.

Consultant: Yes! Sharing your action plan could reduce their worry and give you both a sense of shared understanding. It could also foster a supportive environment. Would you be willing to do that?

User: I think I could try that. It might actually ease the tension a bit.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step forward! As we come to the end of our session today, I want to acknowledge your willingness to open up and explore these feelings. What do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our discussion?

User: I feel that I need to be kinder to myself and recognize my strengths. Also, I have a plan that I can start implementing, which is reassuring.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Remember, acknowledging your strengths and taking small steps can make a big difference. As you move forward, focus on maintaining that self-compassion and keep in mind the steps you've outlined. I’m confident that you have the capacity to navigate this transition. If you find yourself needing support again in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out. You are not alone in this. 

User: Thank you. I appreciate your guidance. I feel a bit better after talking about all this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm glad to hear that. Take care, and I look forward to our next session. Remember, you’re taking positive steps toward your future!

Consultant: Hello, Zhang! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite frustrated. The job rejections keep piling up, and it's really affecting my confidence. I just don’t know how to move forward.

Consultant: I can understand how challenging that must be for you. It sounds like you're feeling quite stuck and questioning your abilities. Can you share more about what thoughts cross your mind when you receive those rejections?

User: I often think that maybe I'm just not good enough for the positions I'm applying for. It makes me feel like I'll never find a job that suits me or that I can excel in.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very difficult to manage. It seems like you're equating job rejections with a lack of personal worth or capability. What emotions do those thoughts bring up for you?

User: I feel a mix of anxiety and disappointment. Sometimes I even feel ashamed, like I should be doing better at my age.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel anxious and disappointed, especially in such a tough period. I want to explore those thoughts a bit more. When you think "I'm not good enough," what evidence do you have that supports this idea?

User: Well, I don't have a lot of experience compared to other candidates, and I often can't articulate my skills well in interviews.

Consultant: I hear you. It's tough to feel behind when you compare yourself to others. However, is there also any evidence that suggests you're capable or that you've had achievements in the past?

User: I guess I’ve done well in my previous job and received positive feedback on my work. But that seems far away now, like it doesn't count.

Consultant: That's a crucial point, Zhang. Your past successes do count, and they reflect your abilities. Let's try to reframe your perspective—if a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about their worth and skills?

User: I’d probably tell them that they shouldn’t be too hard on themselves and that everyone faces challenges.

Consultant: Exactly! If you can extend that kindness and understanding to a friend, why not offer the same to yourself? What if we took a moment to list your strengths and achievements to remind you of what you bring to the table?

User: That sounds helpful. I can see how I’ve managed projects well and built good relationships in my last job.

Consultant: Perfect! These are your strengths, and they absolutely matter. How can we leverage these strengths to boost your confidence as you prepare for upcoming interviews?

User: I might practice talking about my experiences more, focusing on those successes rather than just my weak points.

Consultant: That's a fantastic strategy! Practicing your narratives can help shift your focus to your strengths. Alongside this, let’s set some small goals for yourself in the coming week. What do you think would be a good aim, something achievable?

User: Maybe I can set a goal to apply to a few jobs and prepare responses about my strengths for each. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Setting realistic goals can make the process feel less overwhelming. How do you feel about taking these steps?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful! It feels good to focus on what I can do rather than just the rejections.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s also important to remember that setbacks are a part of the journey. Have you thought about how you might handle it if you face more rejections in the future?

User: I suppose I should remind myself that it doesn't define my worth. Maybe I could also talk to friends more, get their support.

Consultant: Absolutely! Seeking support can be very beneficial. Social connections can help boost your spirits and aid in seeing things from a different perspective. Speaking of friends, do you currently have a supportive network you can reach out to?

User: My social circle is kind of small. I think I could reach out to a couple of friends, though.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Even a couple of conversations can make a big difference. As we wrap up today, what key takeaways do you feel you've gained from our session?

User: I've realized that I need to focus more on my strengths and be kinder to myself about the job market. 

Consultant: Exactly! Emphasizing your strengths and practicing self-compassion are critical steps in this process. How are you feeling overall about your journey now?

User: I'm feeling more motivated, but I still have some anxiety about the uncertainties ahead.

Consultant: That’s a normal feeling when facing change. Having a bit of anxiety can sometimes be a sign that you're stepping out of your comfort zone. Remember, we can work through this together. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate the guidance and support. It helps to have someone to talk to about these things. 

Consultant: I'm really glad you found this helpful, Zhang. You're taking important steps, and I'm here to support you. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything before our next session. 

User: I will! I'm looking forward to our next meeting already.

Consultant: Likewise! Take care, and remember to reflect on your strengths until we meet again.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad you're here today. I understand you're going through some significant changes with the job transition. How are you feeling about the upcoming interview?

User: Hi. Well, I'm excited but also really anxious. I can't stop worrying about whether I'll be able to adapt to the new job and meet the expectations. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a mix of anticipation and doubt. Can you share more about what specifically worries you about the new job?

User: Sure. I’m concerned about fitting in with the team and handling the responsibilities. Plus, I haven't been in a work environment like this for a while.

Consultant: That makes sense, especially after experiencing a layoff. Transitioning can be challenging. What do you think would help you feel more prepared for this new role?

User: Maybe if I had some strategies to deal with the communication aspect, as that’s always been a bit difficult for me.

Consultant: Communication is a key part of adapting to a new work environment. We can definitely work on that. Have you had experiences in the past where communication went well for you?

User: I guess when I was working previously, I sometimes felt comfortable sharing ideas in small group meetings, but larger groups make me nervous.

Consultant: It’s great that you have some positive experiences to draw from! We can use those as a foundation. What do you think is different about larger groups that makes you nervous?

User: I feel like I'm often judged, and I worry about saying something foolish or not being heard.

Consultant: Those feelings are quite common. It sounds like there's some fear around judgment and not feeling confident in your voice during those discussions. How do you usually cope with those feelings in the moment?

User: I usually just stay quiet and avoid speaking up. I think that makes me feel even more anxious afterward.

Consultant: Avoidance can often lead to increased anxiety in the long run. Let's explore some ways we can challenge that thinking. What might happen if you did speak up, even if it's just a little?

User: I suppose some people might appreciate my input, but then again, I fear it might not be relevant.

Consultant: Those two feelings can be at odds, can’t they? It might be helpful to consider that others in the group may also feel similarly or might even welcome your perspective. What evidence do you have that your voice wouldn’t be relevant?

User: I don’t really have evidence, it’s more like a belief I hold onto. 

Consultant: It could be beneficial to challenge that belief. Let's think about a possible scenario where you share an idea. What might that look like, and how could you prepare for it?

User: Maybe I could write down my thoughts beforehand or practice with a friend before the meeting.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy to build confidence. Practicing ahead of time can help ease that anxiety. Would you be open to role-playing a brief scenario together?

User: Yes, I would be open to that.

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s imagine you’re in a meeting and a topic comes up that you have thoughts about. What would you say? 

User: I might say something like, "I think we could consider XYZ because..." 

Consultant: That’s a solid start! It's clear and structured. How do you feel saying that out loud?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also like it makes sense. 

Consultant: Acknowledging that nervousness is important. It’s a natural response to stepping out of your comfort zone. What could you do to calm your nerves right before speaking?

User: Maybe take a few deep breaths to regain focus.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be a great tool for managing anxiety. Let's practice a quick breathing exercise together to reinforce that strategy.

User: Okay, sounds good.

Consultant: Take a deep breath in through your nose... hold it for a moment... and now exhale slowly through your mouth. Let’s do that a couple more times.

User: That does help a bit. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about getting comfortable with the process. As we prepare for the interview, do you feel more equipped to handle potential communication challenges in this new workplace?

User: Yes, I feel like I have some tools to work with now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Let's also think about how to approach any feelings of social discomfort. What strategies can you employ when you feel a bit out of place during social interactions at work?

User: Maybe I can initiate small conversations or find common interests with my colleagues.

Consultant: Initiating small talk is a great way to build connections. It’s a subtle way to ease into larger conversations. What would be an easy topic to start with?

User: I could ask about weekend plans or interest in shared activities like sports.

Consultant: Perfect! Those are natural conversation starters. How do you feel about trying this out when you start your new job?

User: I think I can try it. Just the thought of it makes me a bit nervous, but also hopeful.

Consultant: That’s a positive step forward! It’s normal to feel nervous when trying something new. To wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed and any key strategies you’ll take with you.

User: I’ll practice my communication skills and try to initiate small talk. Plus, I’ll use deep breathing to manage my anxiety.

Consultant: Sounds like a solid plan! I'm proud of the progress you've made today. Remember, each small step counts, and it's okay to feel a little anxious. I’m here for you whenever you need support. How do you feel about moving forward?

User: I feel relieved! Thank you for the guidance. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Zhang! I'm excited for you as you enter this new phase. Keep practicing those tools, and I'm confident you’ll do great. If you ever feel the need to talk again, please don't hesitate to reach out.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang. I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling about your new job and the changes in your life recently?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit mixed. I'm relieved to have found a new job, but I struggle with communicating with my new colleagues. It creates a lot of pressure for me, especially since I want to make a good impression.

Consultant: I understand that you're feeling some pressure due to communication challenges at your new job, despite being happy about the opportunity. Can you tell me more about the specific situations that make you feel uncomfortable when communicating with your colleagues?

User: Well, during team meetings, I often find myself quiet and hesitant to speak up. I worry that my ideas might not be well received or that I’ll say something wrong. It makes me feel anxious and makes me second-guess myself a lot.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Zhang. You’re putting a lot of pressure on yourself to perform well in those meetings. What thoughts or beliefs come to your mind when you feel anxious in those situations?

User: I often think I’m not as articulate as my colleagues, and I fear they might judge me if I speak up. Sometimes I tell myself that I shouldn’t contribute unless I'm completely sure about what I want to say.

Consultant: It seems like you might be experiencing some negative thoughts about your abilities in communication. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit more. Do you think there is evidence to support the idea that you’re not articulate? 

User: I suppose my anxiety makes me doubt myself. In the past, I’ve had moments where I stumbled while speaking, which I think contributes to my current fears.

Consultant: It’s understandable that past experiences can influence your present feelings. However, remember that everyone has moments where they don’t express themselves perfectly. If a friend faced a similar situation, how do you think you would advise them to handle it?

User: I would probably tell them that it's okay to make mistakes and that they should just try to express their thoughts. It often helps me to hear that, but I don’t feel the same way when it’s me.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize that perspective. Let's try to apply that same compassion towards yourself. What would it look like for you to allow yourself to express your thoughts, even if they aren't perfect? 

User: I guess I could focus more on sharing my ideas rather than worrying about the outcome. That might help alleviate some pressure.

Consultant: Absolutely! By focusing on sharing rather than perfection, you’re giving yourself permission to communicate more freely. Let's work on some strategies to practice this in your workplace. Have you thought about any specific steps you could take in your next meeting?

User: Maybe I can set a small goal, like sharing at least one idea, regardless of how confident I feel about it. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Setting a manageable goal can help ease your anxiety. How do you think you would feel after accomplishing that in a meeting?

User: I think I’d feel relieved and a bit more confident. It might even help me engage more with my colleagues.

Consultant: Exactly! Celebrating those small victories can significantly boost your confidence over time. Now, let’s shift gears slightly. I know you also mentioned some tension in your family relationships. Can we explore how that dynamic is affecting you as well?

User: Yes, I find it challenging to communicate with my family too. They often misunderstand my career choices, and it leads to arguments. I feel frustrated and helpless at times.

Consultant: That sounds very difficult. Family misunderstandings can be incredibly frustrating. Could you share an example of a recent interaction that left you feeling this way?

User: Recently, I opened up about my career change, and they responded negatively, questioning my decision. I felt judged, which made me defensive, and it turned into a heated conversation.

Consultant: It's understandable that feeling judged would lead to defensiveness. When your family reacts this way, what thoughts go through your mind?

User: I think they don’t support me and don’t see my efforts. It sometimes feels like they’re stuck in their own beliefs about success.

Consultant: It seems like there may be a disconnect between your goals and their expectations. How might you communicate your feelings to them in a way that could help foster understanding?

User: I guess I could try to express my perspective calmly and explain why this change is important for me. 

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach. Sharing your perspective openly might help them understand your choices better. What small step can you take to initiate that conversation?

User: I can reach out to them this weekend and set aside some time to talk without interruptions.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Creating a space for open dialogue can make a big difference. As we wrap up today's session, let’s reflect on the progress you've made in both your workplace and family dynamics. 

User: I feel more confident about tackling my communication issues at work and I have a clearer strategy for talking to my family.

Consultant: You’ve made significant strides today, Zhang. Remember, it’s all about taking those small steps. How do you feel about continuing to build on the strategies we've discussed?

User: I feel optimistic. I believe applying these strategies will help improve my confidence both at work and at home.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Keep practicing these techniques, and you’ll continue to make progress. If challenges arise, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to support you. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance.

Consultant: It’s my pleasure, Zhang. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! It's great to see you again. I remember from our last session that you've been working on your family communication. How are you feeling about that now?

User: Hi! I actually feel a bit better about my confidence at work. However, the tension at home is still frustrating. I'm trying to communicate with my family, but misunderstandings still happen.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're making progress at work, which is a positive development. However, it's understandable to feel frustrated when family relationships are still tense. Can you share a specific instance where you felt misunderstood recently?

User: Well, there was a family dinner where I tried to explain my job transition, but my parents didn't seem to understand my situation. They kept bringing up the idea of traditional jobs, and that really made me feel cornered.

Consultant: That sounds like a challenging situation, especially when you're trying to express your feelings and goals. How did that exchange make you feel in the moment?

User: I felt anxious and a bit defeated. It seemed like they weren't listening to what I was trying to say. I wish they could see things from my perspective.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel anxious and defeated when our loved ones don't understand us. You mentioned wanting them to see your perspective. What do you think might help them understand your point of view better?

User: I'm not sure. I think they just see my career transition as unstable or risky. Maybe sharing more about my plans could help?

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach! Sharing your plans might indeed provide them with a clearer understanding of where you’re heading. What specific aspects of your transition do you think they would find helpful to know about?

User: I could explain the steps I'm taking, like networking and gaining new skills. I believe that would show them I'm serious about this change.

Consultant: Sharing those details could help them see your commitment and efforts. Besides sharing information, do you think there are any feelings or beliefs that might be guiding their reactions?

User: I think they might be worried about my future and financial stability since they come from a traditional background. They just want what they think is best for me.

Consultant: That’s a key insight. Understanding their worries might help you approach the conversation with empathy. How do you usually manage discussions when you sense tension rising?

User: I sometimes withdraw because I don’t want to argue, but I realize that this might not be the best approach.

Consultant: Withdrawing can feel like a safe option, but it often leaves the issues unresolved. Would you be open to exploring some techniques to communicate your feelings more effectively, even when tensions rise?

User: Yes, I think I need some tools to express myself better.

Consultant: Let's focus on some communication strategies. For instance, using "I" statements can help express your feelings without sounding accusatory. How would you feel about trying that in your next conversation?

User: That sounds manageable. I can say something like, "I feel anxious when we discuss my job," instead of pointing fingers.

Consultant: Exactly, that’s a great start! This can help open the dialogue rather than shutting it down. How do you feel about the idea of planning a conversation with them using these strategies?

User: I’m feeling a bit more hopeful. I think having a plan could really make a difference.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s all about setting the stage for open communication. Remember, it’s okay to share your feelings and also acknowledge their concerns. What else do you think could help you stay calm during the discussion?

User: I might practice some deep breathing beforehand to manage my anxiety. That could help me stay centered.

Consultant: Preparing that way is a wise approach! Deep breathing can greatly help in calming your nerves and keeping your mind focused. How do you feel about the overall progress you've made since our last session?

User: I feel more clarity about both the challenges and the possible solutions. It’s a relief to have a plan.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Zhang! Summarizing your progress can reinforce your confidence. As you continue this journey, what specific strategy or insight will you prioritize moving forward?

User: I think practicing open communication and using "I" statements will be my priority. I also want to stay open to their perspective.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Keeping an open mind will enrich your conversations. As we wrap up today, how would you describe your emotional state compared to when we started?

User: I feel much more positive and determined. I really believe I can improve my family relationships now.

Consultant: I'm thrilled to hear that! You've made significant strides, and it sounds like you have a clear approach going forward. Just remember, it’s a process, and taking small steps is perfectly okay. If challenges arise, you're more than capable of navigating them. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance and support. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Zhang! It's been a pleasure to work with you. If you need to talk again, I'm here for you anytime. Good luck with your conversations, and take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! It's great to see you today. How are you feeling about everything since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel pretty good, actually. I've managed to improve my communication with my family and strengthen my relationships at work. It’s been a positive experience overall.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear that you've made progress with both your family and work relationships. What specific changes have you noticed in those interactions?

User: Well, I've been more open with my family, and they seem to respond positively. At work, I've built stronger bonds with my colleagues, which makes the workplace more enjoyable.

Consultant: Building those connections is so important. It sounds like you're feeling more at ease in your interactions. Thinking about the future, how do you envision your career path moving forward?

User: I'm considering various options, but I feel a bit lost at times. I want to explore something that aligns with my interests and skills but I'm not entirely sure what that is yet.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel a bit uncertain at this stage, especially during a career transition. Can you tell me more about your interests and what skills you enjoy using?

User: I’ve always been interested in project management and team leadership. I like bringing people together to achieve a common goal and I feel fulfilled when working as part of a team.

Consultant: Those are valuable skills! Project management often requires strong communication and collaboration, both of which you've been working on lately. Have you thought about any specific roles or industries that might utilize those skills?

User: I've considered roles in tech or consulting, where team dynamics are crucial. However, I’m worried about starting over in a new field.

Consultant: Transitioning to a new field can feel daunting, but remember that your past experiences and relationships can be great assets. What steps do you think you could take to explore these new opportunities?

User: I guess I could start by networking with people in those fields and maybe taking a course to build my skills.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! Networking can open doors and help you gain insight into different roles. What would be the first step you could take in that direction?

User: I think I might reach out to some former colleagues who have moved into those areas. Maybe they can offer some advice or guidance.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Reaching out to connections can provide valuable information about potential roles and the skills needed. How does that make you feel about your career exploration?

User: It feels reassuring, actually. Just thinking about connecting with them gives me more confidence.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Confidence is key in these situations. Let’s think about any potential challenges you might face when reaching out. How can you prepare for those?

User: I might feel nervous about networking, but I could prepare some questions to make it easier. That way, I won't feel lost during the conversation.

Consultant: Preparing questions is an excellent strategy! It can help ease anxiety and keep the conversation focused. What kinds of questions do you think would be most helpful to ask?

User: I’d like to know about their experiences in the industry, what skills they find most valuable, and maybe advice on getting started.

Consultant: Those are insightful questions! Gathering their experiences can certainly help you get a clearer picture of what to expect. As you move forward, how will you keep track of the insights and advice you receive?

User: I could take notes during those conversations and maybe even follow up with them afterwards to thank them and keep the connection alive.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Keeping notes will help reinforce what you learn, and following up can build those relationships even further. As we wind down today’s session, what achievements from our conversation stand out to you?

User: I’m proud of how I’ve improved my communication and the plan I have to explore new jobs. It feels like I’m on the right path.

Consultant: You should feel proud! You've made significant progress in both personal and professional areas. Remember, maintaining that positive momentum is key. As we conclude, what strategies can you take with you to keep that momentum going?

User: I think staying connected with my network and actively seeking out new opportunities will help. I’ll also continue working on my communication skills.

Consultant: Absolutely! Those strategies will help you grow and explore your career goals effectively. This has been a productive session, Zhang. If you need any support in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance and support. I’ll take these insights into my next steps.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help today. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
