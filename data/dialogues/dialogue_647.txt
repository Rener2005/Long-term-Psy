Consultant: Hi there! I'm really glad to see you today. Let's talk about what’s been on your mind. How have you been feeling recently?

User: Hello. I've been quite down lately. I feel like I can't change anything in my life, and it's hard to focus on anything. My mom is worried about me, especially because of what I do at night, and it just adds more pressure.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed by both your emotions and the concerns from your mom. I appreciate you sharing that with me. Can you tell me more about what in particular has been bothering you at night?

User: Well, during the day, I try to be normal, but at night, I just feel different. I end up texting girls or things like that, and I don't think it affects them. I just like the thrill of it, but I don’t know why I keep doing it.

Consultant: I hear you. It seems like this nighttime behavior is a way for you to escape or seek excitement, but it's also creating conflict for you. Have you noticed any specific thoughts or feelings that come up when you're engaged in that behavior?

User: I guess it makes me feel a bit more connected, even if it’s just online. But at the same time, I feel bad later. I know it’s not the best way to interact with people.

Consultant: That’s a good recognition. Feeling connected is important, but it sounds like the way you're going about it isn't leaving you feeling fulfilled. What do you think are some of the thoughts that pop up for you when you're feeling down about this?

User: I often think that I won't ever change and that I’m stuck in this cycle. It feels like I’m never going to be able to have real friendships.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel stuck and frustrated when you're in a cycle like this. Let's explore that a bit further. When you think you'll never change, what emotions does that bring up for you?

User: I feel really hopeless most of the time, and it makes me want to just give up on trying to connect with others, you know? 

Consultant: It must be tough to feel hopeless. That feeling can create a barrier to reaching out to others. What if we think about some small steps you could take to change that perception? What would you want to see happen in your social life if change were possible?

User: I would like to have more friends and maybe even socialize more normally. But I fear I wouldn’t know how to act or what to say.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It might help to start with smaller interactions, maybe just chatting with classmates. What do you think would be a comfortable starting point for you in forming those connections?

User: I guess I could try saying hi to a classmate or something. But I worry they'll think I'm weird.

Consultant: It’s natural to worry about how others view us, especially when trying something new. But remember, many people appreciate a simple greeting. How would you feel about practicing that in our session today? 

User: Practicing sounds kind of silly, but I suppose it could help me feel more confident. 

Consultant: It's not silly at all! Practicing can really build your confidence. Let's role-play a simple introduction. I’ll be a classmate, and you can try starting a conversation. How does that sound?

User: Okay, I’ll give it a shot! Hi, uh... how are you? 

Consultant: Great start! You did well. The more you practice, the easier it will become, trust me. What thoughts are coming up for you while you're practicing this?

User: I feel awkward, but also a tiny bit relieved that I’m trying. 

Consultant: That’s a good sign. A bit of awkwardness is normal, especially at first. It shows you're stepping outside your comfort zone. How does the idea of continuing to practice make you feel?

User: It makes me feel a bit braver, I guess. But I still worry that it won’t lead anywhere.

Consultant: It's okay to have those worries. Remember, every small step counts, even if it doesn’t feel like it’s leading to immediate friendship. What could you do to ensure you’re still working towards connections, regardless of the outcome?

User: Maybe I could just focus on enjoying the conversation itself instead of stressing over the results. 

Consultant: That's an excellent approach! Enjoying the process can lighten the pressure. How would you like to remind yourself of this mindset when you're feeling anxious before social interactions?

User: I could write it down somewhere, maybe on my phone or something. That way I can check it when I need to.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Having a reminder can help you stay focused on enjoying the conversation rather than worrying. As we wrap up today, what are the main takeaways you've had from our conversation?

User: I think I've realized that I do want to change and that it won’t happen overnight. But I can start with small steps, and that’s not so scary.

Consultant: Absolutely! Real change happens gradually, and each small step is a victory. I’m really proud of the progress you’re making. Remember, it’s okay to reach out for help whenever you need it. If you experience any setbacks or need to talk again, I'm here for you.

User: Thank you. I really appreciate it. It helps to know I can come back if I need to.

Consultant: You're welcome! It's been great talking with you today. Keep practicing those small steps, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Gao! I'm really glad you decided to come in for this session. To start, I would like to hear more about how you’re feeling, especially regarding your recent experiences with classmates.

User: Hi. Well, I've been feeling pretty frustrated lately. During a recent class activity, I accidentally upset some classmates. It really made me think about how I interact with people. I feel like I’m constantly misunderstood.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Gao. It’s understandable to feel frustrated in situations like that. Can you tell me more about what happened during the class activity? What were you trying to achieve?

User: I was just trying to participate and share my ideas, but it seemed like they weren't well received. I felt isolated after that, like I can’t communicate properly with them. It makes me anxious about upcoming group activities.

Consultant: I can see why that would make you anxious. It seems like this experience has made you more aware of your interactions. How do you usually feel when you think about talking to your classmates now?

User: I feel really on edge. I keep worrying about saying the wrong thing or being judged. It’s like I can’t relax around them anymore.

Consultant: That heightened awareness can be really uncomfortable. It sounds like you might be feeling a combination of anxiety and frustration. Let’s explore this a bit. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come to mind when you’re in a social situation with them?

User: Yeah, I often think that they see me as weird or out of place. I feel like I don’t belong, and I get this sense that they’re judging everything I say or do.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite intense. When you think that way, how do you feel emotionally? 

User: It makes me feel really anxious and held back. I just want to be accepted, but then I feel like no one will ever really understand me.

Consultant: It’s painful to feel that way, especially when you’re seeking acceptance. Let's take a moment to evaluate those thoughts. What evidence do you have that your classmates truly see you as weird or out of place?

User: Sometimes I hear them whispering or see them laughing when I talk, it makes me assume they’re laughing at me. 

Consultant: That’s definitely an understandable assumption, but could there be other explanations for their laughter? For instance, could it be about something else, not related to you?

User: I guess it could be. I often jump to the conclusion that it's about me, but I don't really know for sure.

Consultant: Right, and it’s important to recognize that sometimes our thoughts can exaggerate reality. It might be helpful to consider alternate explanations. If a friend were in your situation, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them not to think too much about it and that it’s possible those classmates were just having their own moment. 

Consultant: Exactly! You are capable of providing that reassurance to a friend, and you can learn to be kinder to yourself in the same way. Let’s think about how we can practice this different perspective and create a more positive narrative around your interactions.

User: Alright, but it's hard for me to change my thoughts on my own.

Consultant: I understand that, and it takes practice. How about we work together to set some realistic goals for your next group interactions? What’s one small step you could take to connect with your classmates positively?

User: Maybe I could try initiating small conversations or even making a joke? 

Consultant: That sounds like a great starting point! It’s a manageable goal that can help you ease into social situations. Wouldn’t it help if we created some guidelines or tips for those interactions?

User: Yes, that would definitely help. I often feel lost in those moments.

Consultant: Let’s brainstorm some friendly conversational starters or light topics that you feel comfortable with. It may also help to have a few affirmations ready to remind yourself that you’re doing your best.

User: I like that idea. It feels a bit less intimidating if I'm prepared. 

Consultant: Preparation can indeed boost confidence. What topics do you know your classmates enjoy? 

User: They talk a lot about movies and music. Maybe I could ask them for recommendations.

Consultant: That’s a perfect idea! Asking for recommendations can open the door for them to share their interests and helps you engage without pressure. How do you think you’ll feel after trying this approach?

User: I think it would be nice. Even if it doesn’t go perfectly, I’d feel like I at least tried something positive.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset to adopt! Remember, every attempt is a step towards improvement, regardless of the immediate outcome. It’s about learning and growing from those experiences.

User: True. I guess I can shift my focus from worrying about being accepted to just enjoying the interaction itself.

Consultant: Absolutely! Shifting that focus can change the dynamics of your interactions. As we wrap up today's session, let's reflect on what you've learned. What new strategies do you feel are most beneficial for you?

User: I think recognizing my negative thoughts and trying to change them has been really helpful. Plus, the conversation starters give me something to work with in social settings.

Consultant: You’ve made great strides today in recognizing those thought patterns and developing strategies. As you practice these skills, remember to be kind to yourself. If you encounter difficulties, know that it’s all part of the process.

User: Thank you. I feel more hopeful about approaching these situations now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Gao! You’ve shown a lot of willingness to explore and learn. I believe you can apply these insights in your daily life. Whenever you feel ready, we can continue to build on this progress. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, I'm glad to see you today. It sounds like you've been reflecting on some positive experiences lately. Can you share more about your feelings after participating in the volunteer activity?

User: Hi. Yes, it was quite fulfilling to help others. For the first time, I felt a sense of purpose. But still, when I think about my studies, I feel disappointed and lost.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you found fulfillment in helping others. It can be a significant source of positive feelings. Let's talk a bit more about your studies. What specifically makes you feel disappointed and lost?

User: Well, I don’t think I’m doing well academically. I see my friends doing great, and I just can't match up. Sometimes, I feel like I won't achieve anything in life.

Consultant: I hear you; it can be really tough to compare ourselves to others, especially when we feel we're falling short. Can you identify any specific thoughts that come to mind when you feel this way about your studies?

User: I often think that I'm just not smart enough and that no matter how hard I try, it's useless. Those thoughts just keep repeating in my head.

Consultant: That sounds very challenging. Those thoughts—believing that you're not smart enough—can be quite heavy to carry. What emotions do you feel when those thoughts are present?

User: I mostly feel sad and frustrated. I want to do better, but then I think about how far behind I am, and it just makes me want to give up.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel sad and frustrated in this situation. That cycle of negative thoughts can be so discouraging. Have you had moments where you felt differently about your capabilities or achievements, even if they were small?

User: I guess when I helped out during the volunteer activity, I felt like I was doing something good. But when I’m back to studying, those positive feelings fade away.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. Helping others brought you some joy and purpose. How can we bring some of that positivity into your study routine or find activities that can help you feel accomplished in a similar way?

User: I'm not sure. I suppose I could try to engage in group studies or work on projects with friends. That could help, maybe?

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Group studies might create a supportive atmosphere and give you a sense of connection. How do you think participating in these activities could impact your feelings towards your studies?

User: I think it could help me feel less alone and maybe more motivated. But I also worry that I might not keep up with them.

Consultant: It’s natural to have those worries, but let’s explore that a bit. What evidence do you have that you won't keep up, or is that more of a fear than a fact?

User: I guess it’s more of a fear. I often tell myself I'm behind and won't catch up, but I don't have actual proof that I can’t keep up.

Consultant: Recognizing that distinction is an important step! What alternative thoughts could you try to replace those fear-based thoughts? What might be a more balanced viewpoint?

User: Maybe I could think, “It’s okay to learn at my own pace,” or “I can ask for help if I need it.” 

Consultant: Absolutely! Those are much more compassionate and realistic perspectives. How could you remind yourself to use those thoughts more often when you start feeling overwhelmed?

User: I could write them down and maybe review them before my study sessions. That might help me shift my focus.

Consultant: That sounds like a very proactive approach! Reviewing those supportive thoughts can help set a positive tone for your studying. Is there anything specific you’d like to commit to trying over the next week related to studying or participating in activities that bring you joy?

User: I’ll try to do some group study sessions and remind myself of those supportive thoughts before I start studying. I hope it could make a difference.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Remember, it's about small steps. Let’s check in next time about how those sessions go and how you feel after trying this new approach. Would you also like to explore other activities that might give you similar satisfaction as volunteering?

User: Yes, I would like that! I think finding more ways to help others would be beneficial for me.

Consultant: Wonderful! We can definitely discuss ways to get involved in community activities that align with your interests and values. How are you feeling about our conversation so far? 

User: I feel a bit lighter and more hopeful. Talking about these things really helps me see things differently.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, acknowledging your feelings and seeking new paths forward is a positive step. Next time, we can build on the progress you make and continue to explore those feelings around study and meaning in your life. 

User: Thank you! I look forward to our next session. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care until we meet again. Keep being kind to yourself—you're doing well.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling pretty low. My recent exam didn't go well, and I'm starting to doubt my choices for the future. I feel lost and unsure of what to do next.

Consultant: I hear you. It must be really tough to experience academic setbacks and feel uncertain about your future. Let's talk a bit more about this exam. What were your thoughts and feelings when you saw the results?

User: I felt disappointed, like I've let myself down again. I thought I was prepared, but the results showed I was wrong. It just adds to my feeling of inadequacy.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way when things don't go as planned. You worked hard, and it's hard when the results don't reflect your efforts. Can you say more about how this makes you feel about your academic goals or future plans?

User: I'm not sure what I want to do anymore. Sometimes I have ideas, but they all seem out of reach. I think about my future, and it feels overwhelming and unattainable.

Consultant: Those thoughts can really weigh heavily on your mind. If we break it down, what are some of the ideas you've had for your future? Let’s explore them together.

User: I thought about transferring to another school, but I’m worried I won't fit in. And then there’s this idea of taking some time off, but I don’t know if that’s a good decision.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a couple of ideas, but they come with a lot of uncertainty. Let’s discuss each option. What do you think stands out to you about transferring schools, and what makes you apprehensive about it?

User: I feel like a new environment could help me, but I worry that I won’t make friends again like I have here. It’s hard for me to connect with people.

Consultant: It's quite common to feel anxious about making new connections, especially in a new setting. What if we consider some small steps to gradually build your confidence in social situations?

User: That could be helpful. I just don’t know where to start.

Consultant: Let’s think of a few simple social activities you could try. For instance, joining a club or a sports team could be a good way to meet people. Are there any activities you might be interested in?

User: I used to enjoy sports in high school, but I haven’t been active lately. Maybe trying out a sports club could work.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Engaging in sports not only benefits your physical health but can also enhance your social interactions. What would be a manageable step you could take to explore that option?

User: Maybe I could look up local clubs and see if any practices are happening this week.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a practical first step. How do you feel about making that commitment to yourself?

User: It feels a bit exciting, but also scary. What if I go and no one talks to me?

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel nervous about that. Let's consider this: if you see someone else looking uncertain, how might you approach them? Sometimes, we're all waiting for a friendly face to break the ice.

User: I guess I could just say hi and ask if they want to join in on whatever they’re doing. It might be easier than I think.

Consultant: Exactly! Taking that initiative can often have a positive impact. What other strategies can you think of that might help you to feel more relaxed in those situations?

User: Maybe I could challenge myself to start conversations, even if they feel awkward at first. I think practicing would help.

Consultant: That’s a powerful approach! Practicing those conversations can indeed build your confidence over time. What do you think you could do to set that into motion?

User: I could even rehearse in front of a mirror or with a friend first, just to get used to the idea.

Consultant: That sounds like a creative and proactive way to prepare! It can help reduce some of that anxiety you might feel. How is that mindset shift from focusing on fear to seeing it as an opportunity for growth?

User: It makes me feel a little lighter. Maybe I can actually change things if I try to step out of my comfort zone.

Consultant: I love that perspective! It shows you’re ready to take action. As we continue our sessions, let’s work on setting those short-term goals that will guide you toward bigger changes in your life.

User: That sounds good. I really want to feel better about everything.

Consultant: And you’re taking the right steps. Remember to celebrate those small victories along the way, like reaching out to a new club or even starting a conversation. How does that sound to you?

User: It makes sense. I need to remind myself to appreciate those little steps instead of getting bogged down in what hasn’t happened yet.

Consultant: Exactly! Each small step contributes to your overall progress. In our next session, let's catch up on how these efforts are unfolding and explore any challenges you encounter.

User: I’m looking forward to that. Thank you for guiding me through this.

Consultant: It’s my pleasure! I'm here to support you. Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself as you navigate these changes. 

User: Will do! See you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hi there! I’m really glad to see you today. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve actually been doing pretty well. I started participating in some sports activities, and it’s been really nice getting to know new friends who share similar interests.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It sounds like the social interactions from those activities are bringing you joy. Can you share more about how those experiences have affected your mood and outlook?

User: Definitely! I feel a lot happier during and after the workouts. It’s like I’ve finally found a way to connect with people. I used to feel really lonely, but now I look forward to meeting up with them.

Consultant: I'm really happy to hear that! Engaging in sports and making connections can have such a positive impact on our mental health. How do you think this new routine is helping you manage your feelings of isolation?

User: Well, it feels like I belong somewhere now. I’ve always struggled with making friends, but being part of a team makes everything a lot easier. I don’t feel judged like I used to.

Consultant: That sense of belonging is incredibly important. It's great that you’re finding comfort in this team environment. What are some specific activities you enjoy the most during your sports sessions?

User: I really enjoy playing basketball! It’s fun to be active and work together with my teammates. I also like how it challenges me physically—I feel more energetic afterward.

Consultant: Basketball sounds like a great outlet for both physical activity and social interaction. How do you feel about the progress you've made since you started these activities?

User: Honestly, I feel proud of myself. I never thought I could enjoy sports this much, and it’s nice to see that I can improve. It boosts my confidence a bit.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Recognizing and celebrating your progress is key to building that confidence. Are there any moments during your activities that have particularly stood out to you?

User: Yes! There was this moment during a game when I made a really good shot, and my teammates cheered for me. It felt incredible to be supported like that.

Consultant: That sounds amazing! Celebrating those successes, big or small, can make a significant difference in how you view yourself and your capabilities. How do you think you can keep this momentum going in the future?

User: I think I’ll keep attending practices regularly and maybe try out for more games. I want to feel even more connected to my team and stay active.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Regular participation can help maintain your well-being and enhance those social bonds. What other activities or social opportunities do you think you could explore to further enrich this experience?

User: Maybe I could join a club related to basketball or organize some social events with my teammates outside of practices. I want to keep building those connections.

Consultant: Great idea! Building on those friendships outside of the sport can deepen your connection with your teammates and create a more supportive network. How does that prospect make you feel?

User: It actually excites me! I feel like I’m taking charge of my social life for once, and it’s a nice change.

Consultant: I love that enthusiasm! Taking charge of your social interactions is empowering. As you continue this journey, it’s important to be kind to yourself and recognize that everyone has their own pace in building relationships. 

User: That’s true. I sometimes worry about whether I’m pushing too hard or if I’m good enough to really fit in, but I’m trying to let those thoughts go.

Consultant: It’s natural to have those worries, but it sounds like you’re developing a more positive self-perspective. When those nagging thoughts come up, what strategies could you use to challenge or counter them?

User: I could remind myself of the support I’ve received from my teammates and reflect on my achievements instead of just the negatives. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on the positive feedback and your achievements can help reframe those negative thoughts. Are there any specific affirmations or reminders you’d like to create for yourself?

User: I think I could say something like, “I am capable and worthy of being here,” to remind myself of my value.

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation! Having those positive statements can serve as a great tool for building resilience. As we near the end of our session, let’s briefly review your progress. What would you say has been your biggest takeaway from our discussions today?

User: I’d say realizing that I can enjoy social activities and that I have the power to create connections is my biggest takeaway. I feel more hopeful about my social life.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You’ve made significant strides, and your hope for the future is a testament to your growth. As you move forward, remember to maintain that positive mindset and these new connections. How do you plan to continue this progress?

User: I want to stay active, focus on my sports, and keep meeting new people. I feel ready to embrace new challenges!

Consultant: I believe you can continue to thrive! Keep building those connections and reinforcing your positive mindset. If challenges arise, remember you have strategies to manage them. This is our last session, and I want to acknowledge all the hard work you've done. You're more than capable of maintaining this positive trajectory. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate all the support. I now feel more confident that I can handle things on my own.

Consultant: It’s been a pleasure working with you. Hold on to that confidence, and remember, you’re always welcome to reach out if you ever feel the need. Best of luck on your journey!
###################
Consultant: Hello, I'm glad to see you again! How have you been since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I've managed to set and achieve some small goals recently, which has given me a sense of accomplishment. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like those small achievements have positively impacted your perspective on the future. What specific goals did you set for yourself, and how did it feel to achieve them? 

User: I focused on organizing my study schedule and sticking to it. I felt really proud when I could follow through for several days in a row without getting distracted. 

Consultant: That’s impressive! Maintaining a structured routine can really help in managing your time and reducing anxiety. How did this accomplishment affect your mood or your mindset? 

User: I felt more in control and less anxious. It’s like I can actually see a path forward now, even though I’m still worried about the future sometimes. 

Consultant: It’s great that you’re starting to feel more in control. It’s normal to have worries about the future, especially when things feel uncertain. Can you tell me more about what aspects of the future you’re worried about? 

User: I’m just concerned that I won’t be able to achieve my aspirations. Sometimes I feel like I’m not doing enough or that I’m not capable of achieving them. 

Consultant: I can understand how those feelings might be overwhelming. It sounds like you’re facing some self-doubt. What evidence do you have that supports these concerns about your capabilities? 

User: Well, I didn’t do well in school for a long time, so I worry I might just continue failing. 

Consultant: It’s understandable that past experiences would lead to self-doubt. However, you’ve recently started achieving goals, which shows that you’re capable of making progress. How do you think your recent successes could challenge those negative beliefs? 

User: I suppose they show that I can change and improve. Maybe I shouldn’t let my past define my future? 

Consultant: Exactly! Your past does not dictate your future. It sounds like you’re already starting to cultivate a more positive mindset. What steps could you take to continue reinforcing this new way of thinking? 

User: I guess I could remind myself of my successes more often, and not just focus on the negatives. Maybe keeping a journal would help too. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! A journal can be a great way to track your achievements and reflect on your thoughts. What kinds of entries do you think would be most beneficial for you? 

User: I could write about my daily goals and how I felt after achieving them, or even note things that I felt went well each day. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Focusing on daily positives can really help shift your mindset over time. How do you feel about setting a couple of daily goals for the next week? 

User: I think that could work! It would help keep me accountable too. 

Consultant: Absolutely, accountability is key! Let’s outline a couple of achievable daily goals together. What do you think would be a good goal for tomorrow? 

User: Maybe I could aim to read for 30 minutes and then write down my thoughts afterward. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! Reading can also provide you with a break while stimulating your mind. How confident do you feel about accomplishing that tomorrow? 

User: I feel pretty confident! I think I can do that. 

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Remember, maintaining that positive momentum is crucial. How about the rest of your week? Are there other goals you’d like to pursue? 

User: I’d like to exercise a bit more too, maybe a couple of times a week. 

Consultant: Fantastic! Physical activity can really boost your mood. Setting specific times for your workouts can help ensure you stick to that goal. Do you have a preferred time or type of exercise? 

User: I prefer working out in the evenings, maybe some jogging or a workout video at home. 

Consultant: Sounds like a great plan! How many times do you think you could realistically dedicate to your workouts this week? 

User: I think I could manage twice, maybe Wednesday and Saturday. 

Consultant: That’s perfectly achievable! So, just to recap, you’re planning to read for 30 minutes and write your reflections tomorrow, and you’ll also aim for two workout sessions this week. How does it feel to have this plan? 

User: It feels good! I’m excited to get started and see how it helps me. 

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! It sounds like you’re already on a positive path. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the progress you’ve made and our discussion? 

User: I feel hopeful and motivated. I can see the benefits of focusing on small achievements and maintaining a positive mindset. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Remember to celebrate those small victories as they come. You’ve made great strides, and I believe you can continue this journey. If you encounter any challenges in the next week, we can definitely talk through them in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I’m looking forward to our next meeting! 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm here to support you, and I look forward to hearing about your progress. Have a great week ahead!
