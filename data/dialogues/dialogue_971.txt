Consultant: Hello, Xu Feng! I'm glad you're here today. Let's talk about how you're feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I'm really feeling down after that incident with my roommate. I can't shake off the guilt and self-blame. Sometimes, I feel like I’m not as good as the others, and I’m worried I won’t succeed in school.

Consultant: I can see how that incident has affected you deeply. Feeling guilty and comparing yourself to others can be really tough. Can you tell me more about those feelings? What thoughts go through your mind when you think about your classmates?

User: I often think that they must see me as a failure. I feel like I’m not smart enough. It’s like I'm letting everyone down, including myself.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially after a stressful situation. However, I want you to reflect on the evidence behind those thoughts. What makes you believe that you're a failure compared to your classmates?

User: Well, I didn't perform well in a few subjects, and I got into that fight which made me lose face. I feel like they must think I’m weak.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re using some very definite terms to describe yourself—like "weak" and "failure." Let's explore those thoughts a bit. Were there any positive outcomes or strengths you showed during that time?

User: I mean, I did try to resolve the issue with my roommate afterward. But it doesn’t feel like that matters much against everything else.

Consultant: That’s a significant step you took—trying to resolve the conflict shows courage and a desire to improve. It's important to recognize those instances as part of who you are, not just see the negative. Could we try to reframe your idea of "weakness" into something more positive?

User: I guess that could help, but it's difficult when all I feel is the disappointment.

Consultant: I understand. It is indeed challenging to shift your mindset. Do you think it would help to write down some strengths or positive qualities you have? 

User: Maybe. I haven't really thought about that. I mostly focus on what I did wrong.

Consultant: That’s a common tendency, especially when we’re feeling down. Let's challenge that pattern together—can you start a list of things you like about yourself or achievements you're proud of, no matter how small they may seem?

User: I could try that. I suppose I’m good at sports and I do help my mom a lot at home. I just don’t really see them as important.

Consultant: Those are really important qualities! Sports can show teamwork and determination, and helping at home reflects responsibility and caring. Let's just take a moment to appreciate those aspects of who you are. How about setting a small goal to include one of these strengths into your week? 

User: That sounds like a good idea. I could join a practice session for basketball maybe on Saturday.

Consultant: That’s great! Engaging in activities you enjoy can lift your mood. Also, how do you feel about reaching out to a classmate for a study session? 

User: I feel anxious about that. What if they reject me or think I'm not smart?

Consultant: It’s normal to feel anxious about social situations, especially after feeling low. However, let’s think about how you would advise a friend in a similar situation—what would you tell them?

User: I would probably say they should just give it a try and not be too hard on themselves.

Consultant: Exactly! You deserve that same kindness and encouragement. Remember, reaching out doesn’t define your worth. It’s about building connections. Would you consider taking that step, even if it’s small?

User: I guess I could try asking someone in my class for help with homework.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! It doesn't have to be perfect; just an effort to connect. Remember, even if things don’t go as expected, it doesn't reflect on your self-worth. You’re taking a brave step forward. 

User: Thank you! It's reassuring to hear that.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we continue our sessions, we'll keep exploring your thoughts and feelings, building your confidence and strategies. How are you feeling about what we've discussed today?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful about reaching out and focusing on some of my strengths. 

Consultant: That's an encouraging progress, Xu Feng! Remember, building self-acceptance and managing anxiety takes time and practice. Would it be alright if we check in on your feelings about this in our next session?

User: Yes, that makes sense. I’d like to see how it goes.

Consultant: Perfect! I believe you're taking significant steps forward. I'm here to support you. If you feel overwhelmed at any point, don’t hesitate to reach out. See you next time, and try to enjoy that basketball session!

User: Thanks! I will. Bye!

Consultant: Hello, Xu Feng! I'm glad to see you today. You've taken a brave step by coming in for this session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. I’ve been trying to cope, but I still feel anxious about my studies. With all the recent tests, I worry that I won't meet my family's expectations. Sometimes, I just want to quit.

Consultant: I hear you—it sounds like there’s a lot of pressure on your shoulders. It’s understandable to feel anxious, especially when you’re concerned about your performance in school and your family's hopes. Can you share more about what pens you down the feeling of wanting to quit?

User: I guess it’s just overwhelming. I feel like everyone else is doing better than me. The thought of disappointing my parents really weighs me down.

Consultant: That’s a heavy burden to carry. It seems like you’re feeling not only pressure from school but also a desire to meet your parents' expectations. Has there been a specific moment or experience in the recent tests that triggered these feelings for you?

User: Yes, during the last math test. I blanked out completely. I kept thinking I should know this stuff, but I just couldn’t recall anything. It was embarrassing, and I feared letting my mom down.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xu Feng. It's completely normal to feel embarrassed in such situations, especially when you have high expectations for yourself. What kind of thoughts went through your mind at that moment?

User: I kept thinking that maybe I'm just not good enough, or that I’ll never be able to catch up. I felt like a failure.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really discouraging. It's common for pressure to lead us to develop negative beliefs about ourselves. Let’s take a moment to explore those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you’re not good enough?

User: Well, I didn’t do well on that test… And I’ve struggled with math for a while now. It just feels like a pattern of failure.

Consultant: I understand how that can feel like a repeated cycle. But let’s look at it together. Can you think of any times when you succeeded or did well in any subject, even if it was small? 

User: I did well in science last semester. I got an A on my project. But that feels different somehow.

Consultant: That’s a great example! Acknowledging your strengths is a crucial part of challenging the belief that you’re not good enough. It sounds like you have the capacity to succeed in areas where you put in effort. How can we work together to remind you of these successes when you’re feeling overwhelmed by anxiety?

User: I guess I could write down my achievements… It might help me remember that I can do well sometimes.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Keeping a record of your achievements can serve as a reminder of your capabilities. Alongside that, we can set small goals for your studies and social interactions. What small step do you think you could take this week towards improving your study habits or engaging with classmates?

User: Maybe I could try talking to a classmate about a subject I find difficult. It’s scary, but I know it would help to have some support. 

Consultant: That’s a brave step! Reaching out to a classmate can provide not just help but also ease some of the loneliness that pressure can bring. How about planning a specific time to do this? 

User: I think I could try reaching out on Friday after school. I have some questions about the upcoming exam that I need help with. 

Consultant: Excellent! Setting a time makes it more concrete, and I believe it will benefit you both academically and emotionally. Let’s also think about how you can respond to any anxious feelings when they arise. What can you do to calm yourself down before this interaction?

User: Perhaps I could take some deep breaths and remind myself that it’s okay to ask for help. 

Consultant: Deep breathing is a great strategy! It helps center you before engaging in potentially stressful situations. Also, reminding yourself that seeking help is a sign of strength can shift your perspective. How are you feeling about this plan?

User: I’m feeling a bit more hopeful. It still feels hard, but I know it's worth trying.

Consultant: That’s a positive sign! Remember, it’s okay for things to feel challenging at first. Each small step you take adds to your confidence. As we wrap up for today, let’s think about how you can build on these strategies in the coming weeks. What will you take away from our conversation today?

User: I’ll focus on noticing my achievements and trying to be braver in reaching out to classmates. I want to keep reminding myself that I can succeed.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway, Xu Feng! Acknowledging your achievements and taking brave steps are both crucial for your growth. Let’s check in next time on how that goes. You’ve got this, and remember, each step is progress. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to support you on this journey. Remember, it’s okay to feel pressure, but you’re not alone in this. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hi Xu Feng! I'm really glad you're back for this session. Last time, we talked about your feelings of pressure in social situations and your desire to improve your communication skills. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! Honestly, I've still been feeling a bit anxious, especially about working with my classmates. I want to improve, but self-doubt keeps creeping in.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel anxious, especially when trying something new. Could you share more about a recent experience where you attempted to work with your classmates? What thoughts went through your mind during that time?

User: Well, we had a group project, and I was hesitant to share my ideas. I kept thinking, “What if they don’t like what I say?” It made me feel really unsettled.

Consultant: That sounds tough, Xu Feng. It seems like those thoughts made it hard for you to express yourself. When you had that thought, "What if they don’t like what I say?" how did it make you feel?

User: I felt embarrassed and even considered just keeping quiet. It’s like I wanted to disappear rather than put myself out there.

Consultant: Feeling embarrassed in that moment is quite common. Let’s explore that thought a bit deeper. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that your classmates wouldn’t like your input?

User: I don’t have any solid evidence; it’s just a fear I have. Sometimes, I feel like they are already set in their ways and may not listen to me.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, Xu Feng. It sounds like there might be some assumptions in your thinking. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has valuable ideas and that they should just share them because you never know how it will go.

Consultant: That’s a great piece of advice! It sounds like you recognize the value in sharing thoughts, even if it's daunting. When you think about your own ideas, would you be open to trying to share even just one next time, regardless of the outcome?

User: Yes, I think I could try that. Maybe I could practice what I want to say beforehand.

Consultant: Practicing sounds like an excellent idea! It might help build your confidence. What specific ideas or thoughts do you think you could share in your next group interaction?

User: I have an idea about how we could organize our project more effectively. I could suggest a timeline to keep us on track.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful suggestion! A timeline can really help a group stay organized. How do you feel about sharing this idea with your classmates?

User: I feel a bit nervous just thinking about it, but I also feel excited about it. Knowing I might help the team makes me want to try.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that! Feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety is very natural. Would you like to role-play how you might introduce your idea to your classmates?

User: Sure, I can give it a shot!

Consultant: Okay! Imagine we are in the group meeting, and you’re about to speak up. What would you say to introduce your timeline suggestion?

User: “Hey everyone, I’ve been thinking that maybe we could create a timeline for our project to help us stay on track with our tasks.”

Consultant: That was a solid start! You expressed your idea clearly. How does it feel to say that out loud?

User: It actually feels pretty good! I didn’t think it would be that easy.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sometimes just taking that first step can make a big difference. What if we think of a way to remind yourself of that feeling before you speak up in the real situation?

User: Maybe I could visualize how it feels to share my ideas successfully. I could also remind myself that it’s okay if not everyone agrees.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Visualization can really empower you. Also, remembering that everyone is learning together can help take the pressure off. How do you feel about trying these techniques?

User: I’m feeling more motivated to try them out! This gives me hope that I can engage with my classmates better.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Xu Feng. It sounds like you're working actively towards feeling more comfortable in group situations. As we continue, let's keep reinforcing these positive experiences. What do you think you might need to make your next social interaction more successful?

User: I think I’ll need some encouragement and to remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! Encouraging self-talk is key. Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. How do you feel about our session today? 

User: I feel much better! I have a clearer plan now and I believe I can handle social situations better.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! You’ve made significant progress today. For our next session, we can continue to practice these skills and build on your confidence. Remember, it's a journey, and you're doing great. 

User: Thank you so much! I’m looking forward to our next session. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xu Feng! I believe in your ability to grow. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xu Feng! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better. I’ve started participating in some class activities, and I got some positive feedback from my classmates. But I still feel anxious sometimes.

Consultant: That’s really encouraging to hear! It sounds like you’re beginning to enjoy some aspects of group activities. What specific experiences stood out to you during those activities?

User: Well, during one activity, I was asked to lead a small group discussion. At first, I was really nervous, but then I received compliments from my peers. It made me feel good, but I still worry about whether I can keep it up.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous when trying something new, especially when you're in a leadership role. It sounds like you received some affirmation, which is wonderful. How did that feedback affect your feelings about participating in the group?

User: It made me feel like I might actually be able to contribute something positive. I didn't expect to enjoy leading the discussion, but it was nice to feel appreciated.

Consultant: That's a significant realization! Recognizing your potential to contribute can certainly enhance your confidence. Can you reflect on how that positive feedback might shift your thoughts about future group activities?

User: I think it could motivate me to participate more. I want to keep feeling that sense of appreciation. Sometimes, though, I still feel overwhelmed and think that maybe I shouldn't be involved.

Consultant: It's understandable to have those mixed feelings. Let's explore those thoughts of feeling overwhelmed. What specific thoughts come to mind when you think about participating in group activities?

User: I often worry that I might mess up or that others may not see me as capable. I just want to avoid embarrassment.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It seems like you're worried about others’ perceptions of you. Let's examine those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the belief that you would mess up or be viewed as incapable?

User: Well, I guess I often just assume the worst will happen. Like when I don’t know something, I think people will think negatively of me.

Consultant: That’s a common cognitive distortion, where we anticipate negative outcomes despite evidence to the contrary. What if we turn that thought around? What would you say to a friend who felt the same way about participating?

User: I would tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s part of learning. And that being involved is more important than being perfect.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about growth and learning. How might that shift in perspective affect your willingness to engage in future activities?

User: I guess it would help me be more open to trying things, even if I’m not perfect. I’d like to remember that it’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: That's a powerful insight, Xu Feng. Embracing imperfections can be liberating. Can you think of an upcoming activity where you could apply this mindset?

User: We have a team project coming up, and I think I can take a more active role without worrying so much about being perfect.

Consultant: That sounds like a great opportunity! Remember to focus on the experience rather than the outcome. How can you remind yourself to adopt this new perspective during that project?

User: I could write a note to myself before the meeting, reminding me that it's okay to make mistakes and that I’ll get help from my teammates.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Having a tangible reminder can be very helpful. As you prepare for this project, how about noting down what you appreciate about collaborating with your team members?

User: Yes, I can note down their contributions and how we gel together. That could remind me of the positive aspects.

Consultant: Perfect! Reflecting on your experiences can reinforce your sense of belonging and value within the group. Let’s check in on your feelings as we wrap up today. How do you feel about continuing to engage with group activities moving forward?

User: I feel hopeful. I think recognizing the positive feedback and appreciating my teammates will help me stay motivated.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! You have made impressive progress in recognizing your value and the benefits of group participation. As we finish today's session, what are your main takeaways?

User: I’ve learned to challenge my negative thoughts and focus on enjoying group activities, and I want to appreciate both my and my teammates’ contributions more. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic summary, Xu Feng! Remember, it's about taking one step at a time. If you feel overwhelmed, you can always return to these strategies. I'm really proud of you for your growth today. If you need help in the future, feel free to reach out.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I feel more confident about moving forward now. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad to have been a part of your journey. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your successes in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xu Feng! I'm really glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling lately, especially after participating in the volunteer activity?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. Helping others during the volunteer activity made me really happy, and I felt like I belonged to the group. It's nice to be recognized by my peers.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear that you felt a sense of belonging and recognition. What specific moments during the activity made you feel valuable or appreciated?

User: I remember when we were helping out with the community cleanup. People were thanking us for our efforts, and it felt nice to contribute and be part of something bigger.

Consultant: That sounds like such a fulfilling experience. When you were receiving that appreciation, how did it make you feel about yourself and your place in the group?

User: It made me feel proud and important. I realized that I can make a difference, even if it’s small. It boosted my confidence.

Consultant: It's amazing how those moments can create a positive impact on our self-esteem. How do you think these feelings of pride and confidence can influence your daily life moving forward?

User: I think I’ll be more motivated to get involved in other activities. Maybe I can even try to continue volunteering off and on.

Consultant: That's a fantastic realization! What do you feel could help you stick with volunteering or participating in group activities in the future?

User: I think if I remember how good it felt helping others, it might motivate me. Also, maybe setting aside some time regularly to volunteer could help.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Keeping that feeling in mind can be a great motivator. It might also be helpful to reflect on what you've learned about yourself during these activities. What are some of the key takeaways for you?

User: I learned that I can feel useful and that working with others can be fulfilling. Plus, I feel like I can handle challenges better now.

Consultant: That’s insightful! Recognizing your ability to handle challenges while working with others is such an important skill. Can you think of any specific challenges you faced during the activity that you overcame?

User: Yes, I was initially nervous about interacting with strangers, but once I started talking with them, it got easier. I felt more connected.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you were able to push through your nervousness. That shows your growth! How do you think you can apply this experience to help you with your current challenges, like studying or socializing?

User: I guess I can remind myself that things usually get easier once I start. I can try to take small steps to approach studying or talking to others.

Consultant: That's a valuable takeaway! Taking small steps can definitely reduce the pressure. If you were to apply this approach to your studies, what might that look like?

User: Maybe I could set short study sessions with breaks in between. Just like I took small steps in talking to others, I can apply that to studying too.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Balancing study with breaks can help keep you motivated. How do you think you’ll feel after implementing this new strategy?

User: I think it will help me feel less overwhelmed and more focused. I really want to keep that sense of accomplishment going.

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping your achievements in mind will certainly contribute to a positive cycle. As we wrap up, is there anything specific you’d like to remember from our conversation today that can encourage you?

User: I want to remember that I can feel good when I help others and that I can also apply that to my studies. Maybe keeping a journal to jot down my feelings could help.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Journaling can be a great way to reflect on your experiences and reinforce positive feelings. I’m confident that you’ll continue to build on these insights. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel good! I really enjoyed talking about my experiences and realizing how they connect to other parts of my life.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've made some important connections today. Remember, you can always revisit these strategies and insights as you continue your journey. If you ever need support, I'm here for you. Thank you for sharing today, Xu Feng! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and guidance. I feel more optimistic about my future and the changes I can make.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xu Feng! It’s great to see you again. I'm glad to hear about your recent conversation with your mother. How are you feeling since then?

User: Hi! I feel a bit relieved after talking to her. It’s nice to be understood for once. But I still worry about my grades and how I’ll manage everything.

Consultant: It's good to hear that you felt relief after that conversation. It sounds like the communication helped you feel more supported. Let’s explore your worries about your grades. What specifically concerns you the most right now?

User: I guess I just feel overwhelmed with the amount of work I have. Sometimes, I think I can’t keep up, which makes it hard to focus on studying.

Consultant: That feeling of being overwhelmed can really affect your ability to concentrate. Can you tell me more about the specific thoughts that come to mind when you feel this way?

User: I often think that if I don't do well, it will disappoint my mother. I fear that I’ll let everyone down and that I won't be able to succeed in high school.

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry about disappointing your mother, especially since she has high expectations. However, let’s take a moment to examine those thoughts. What evidence do you have that you will let her down? 

User: I guess I can’t be sure. I’m just worried about failing and how that might affect her.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a lot of pressure to perform. What would you say to a friend who is feeling this same way about their studies?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has their struggles and it’s okay to ask for help.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate way to think. What if you applied that same kindness to yourself? It’s okay to feel challenged and to seek help when you need it. How might that change your current situation?

User: I think it would make me feel less alone and maybe I wouldn’t be so hard on myself.

Consultant: Exactly. Recognizing that it’s okay to ask for help can be a big step in managing your feelings of overwhelm. Are there specific strategies or support systems you could utilize when you start to feel anxious about your studies again?

User: I could talk to my mom more often about my worries. And maybe I should spend more time studying with friends.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Engaging with your mom and friends can provide support and make studying feel less isolating. How do you think you can create a plan to integrate these strategies into your routine?

User: I could set up regular study sessions with my friends after school, and I can plan to chat with my mom at the end of each week about how I’m feeling.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Xu Feng! Setting up those regular chats can help maintain a communication loop. How do you feel about implementing this plan? 

User: I feel more positive about it. It gives me something actionable to do when I start feeling stressed.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Taking action can empower you. Let’s also think about how to track your progress. What might help you see how you're doing with your studies and emotions?

User: Maybe keeping a journal where I write down how I feel after each study session and any difficulties I faced could help.

Consultant: A journal is a great tool for self-reflection! It can help you notice patterns in your thoughts and feelings. How can you commit to keeping this journal regularly?

User: I could set an alarm to remind me to write in it every night. That way, it’ll become a habit.

Consultant: That's a smart approach. Creating a routine makes it easier to maintain. As we wrap up today, let's summarize your key takeaways. What are the main strategies you've decided to focus on?

User: I’ll communicate more with my mom, study with friends regularly, and keep a journal to track my feelings and progress.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies! It sounds like you've thought it through and are ready to move forward. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel really good. I think I have some solid plans to work with, and I appreciate your support.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that, Xu Feng! Remember, it’s okay to reach out for help whenever you need it. You've made great progress, and I believe you can continue on this path. If you ever want to discuss anything further, you’re always welcome to come back. Keep it up!

User: Thank you! I will definitely keep working on this. See you next time!

Consultant: Goodbye, Xu Feng! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.
