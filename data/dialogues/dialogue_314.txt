Consultant: Hi Abel! It's great to see you today. I want to check in with you about how you've been feeling lately, especially with everything going on with your mom and school. Can you tell me a bit about what's been on your mind?

User: Hi! I’ve been really scared about my mom. Her health is getting worse and I can’t stop thinking about what will happen if she gets even sicker. I feel really anxious about school too, because I might get kicked out.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Abel. It’s understandable to feel scared when someone you care about is not well, and all the pressure from school can make things even harder. Can you share more about what you feel when you think about your mom's health?

User: Well, I feel this tightness in my chest, and sometimes I just want to cry. It’s really hard to concentrate on anything else when I think about losing her.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel that way, Abel. Crying can be a really natural response to feeling overwhelmed. When you think about school and the possibility of being kicked out, what thoughts come up for you? What does that make you feel?

User: I keep thinking that I’m not good enough and that everyone will be disappointed in me. It makes me feel really sad and alone.

Consultant: Feeling alone and thinking that you're not good enough can be very heavy. Can you remember a specific time recently when you felt that way, maybe at school or home? What thoughts were running through your mind then?

User: Last week, I forgot to do my homework and the teacher was really upset. I thought, “I’m such a failure.” It just made me feel worse about everything.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult, Abel. It’s easy to feel like a failure when something goes wrong. But remember, one mistake doesn't define who you are. What do you think would happen if you could see that mistake differently? 

User: I don’t know. Maybe I wouldn’t feel so bad about myself? 

Consultant: Exactly, Abel! It’s important to challenge those negative thoughts. If you were speaking to a friend who made a mistake, how do you think you would comfort them?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay and that everyone makes mistakes. Maybe I should be kinder to myself too.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization, Abel. Being kind to yourself can really help you manage those feelings. Let’s think of some strategies that could help you when you feel that anxiety about school and your mom's health. What’s something you enjoy doing that could help distract you?

User: I like drawing! It makes me forget about everything for a little while.

Consultant: Drawing is a fantastic outlet! How about we set a goal for you to spend some time drawing whenever you start to feel anxious? It could help you express those feelings. 

User: That sounds good! I can try to draw every day, especially when I’m feeling really anxious.

Consultant: That's a great plan, Abel. Drawing can be a way to express what you’re feeling inside. When you finish a drawing, how do you feel afterward? 

User: I usually feel lighter and happy for a bit. It’s like I can escape my worries.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Let’s try to build on that feeling. Besides drawing, what about talking to someone you trust? How do you feel about sharing your feelings with a friend or family member?

User: I’ve never really done that. I’m scared they won't understand what I’m going through.

Consultant: It's natural to feel that way, but opening up can sometimes lighten that load you’re carrying. What if you started slowly, maybe sharing just a little bit with someone you trust? 

User: I can try to tell my best friend. He usually listens and doesn’t judge me.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Having that support can really make a difference. When you think about talking to him, how do you imagine feeling afterward?

User: I think I’d feel a bit free, like I can talk about things instead of keeping them inside.

Consultant: That's a positive outlook! Remember, sharing your feelings is a strength. We can also practice how to express your worries before you talk to him, if you’d like. 

User: Yes! That would help. I want to make sure I say what I’m feeling clearly.

Consultant: Sure! Let’s take a moment to write down some of your feelings and thoughts. What do you really want your friend to understand about how you’re feeling?

User: I want him to know that I feel scared all the time and that I really miss how things used to be with my mom.

Consultant: Those are very important feelings to share, Abel. Being open about your fear and missing your normal can help your friend understand you better. Would you like to write it down together?

User: Yes, I would like that.

Consultant: Let's start with how you're feeling now and then mention your worries about your mom. You can say, "I feel scared and anxious because my mom is sick, and sometimes I feel alone at school." How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I think I can do that.

Consultant: I believe in you, Abel! You’re taking great steps to express yourself and seek support. As we wrap up today, what’s one takeaway you want to remember from our session? 

User: I want to remember that it’s okay to feel scared and that I should try drawing more and talk to my friend.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Abel! You’re learning how to manage your feelings and reach out for support. Remember, it’s a journey, and you’re doing great. If you want to continue working on this, I’m here to help whenever you need it. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate it. It feels nice to talk.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about how it goes with your friend and your drawing. Take care, and we'll meet again soon!

Consultant: Hi Abel! It's great to see you again. I want to check in on how you've been feeling since our last session. Have there been any new thoughts or feelings regarding school and your mom's health?

User: Hi! I've been trying to focus more on my drawing, but I still feel really overwhelmed. Every time I think about my mom, it just makes everything worse. And school is still a mess; I fear I might get kicked out anytime. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling quite heavy with everything that's happening. Balancing worries about your mom's health and school can be really tough. When you think about school and the possibility of getting kicked out, what kinds of thoughts come to mind?

User: I just keep hearing in my head that I'm a failure and that I won't ever be good enough for anyone. It makes me feel so sad and anxious.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you’re under so much pressure. Can you recall a specific recent experience that made you feel like a failure at school? What were you thinking during that moment?

User: Last week, I turned in an assignment late, and my teacher was angry. I just thought, “I can't do anything right.” It really crushed my spirit.

Consultant: That must have felt really tough, Abel. Those strong feelings of inadequacy can be really challenging. What do you think would happen if you could view that situation from a different perspective? 

User: I guess I could see it just as one mistake, not something that defines me. But it’s hard.

Consultant: You're absolutely right; it's hard, but recognizing that one mistake doesn’t define your worth is an important step. If you were to give advice to a friend who made a mistake like that, what would you tell them?

User: I’d tell them it’s okay to make mistakes and that it doesn’t mean they’re a bad person or student.

Consultant: Exactly! And you can give yourself that same kindness. How about we think of some constructive ways to manage your feelings about school? What’s a small step you can take to help yourself feel more confident in your work?

User: Maybe I could make a checklist for my assignments to keep track of what I need to do. It might help me not to forget things.

Consultant: A checklist sounds like a great idea! It could help you stay organized and diminish some of that anxiety. Let’s outline a few manageable tasks you could include on your checklist for the week. What’s one specific assignment you need to focus on?

User: I have a math project due next week that I’m really anxious about.

Consultant: Perfect! How about breaking that project into smaller tasks? What’s the first step you could take to get started on that math project?

User: I guess I could review the project guidelines and write down the requirements first.

Consultant: That’s a great starting point! Writing down the requirements helps clarify what you need to do. What’s the next step after that?

User: After that, I could break the project down into different parts, like research, drafting, and then finalizing it.

Consultant: Exactly! Breaking it down like that makes it feel less overwhelming. Next, how about setting specific days to work on each part? This could help you manage your time better and reduce anxiety. 

User: Yes, that sounds doable! I can plan to research on Tuesday, draft on Wednesday, and finalize on Thursday.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan, Abel! I can see you’re taking active steps to engage with your schoolwork. When you complete each part, how do you think you’ll feel?

User: I think I’ll feel accomplished, and that might help with my anxiety about getting kicked out.

Consultant: Absolutely! Achievements, no matter how small, can build your confidence. And remember to reward yourself for completing each part, even if it’s just taking a break to draw. 

User: I like that idea! I can use drawing as a reward when I finish a task.

Consultant: Fantastic! Having a reward system can be a powerful motivator. Let’s also revisit how you’re managing your feelings about your mom. How have you been feeling about her health lately?

User: It’s still hard. I just feel scared all the time, especially when I think about what might happen if her condition gets worse.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel scared when someone you love is unwell. Have you had a chance to talk to anyone about what you’re feeling regarding your mom?

User: Not really. I don’t want to burden anyone with my worries.

Consultant: It's understandable to worry about burdening others, but sharing your feelings can often lighten your load. What if you considered talking to a family member or friend, starting with just a bit of what you're feeling?

User: I might try talking to my aunt. She always listens well, and I think she’d understand.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Talking to your aunt could be comforting. What’s one specific feeling you want to share with her about how you've been dealing with everything?

User: I think I’d tell her that I’m really scared and that sometimes I feel really alone.

Consultant: That's a meaningful way to express what you’re going through. If you feel comfortable practicing that now, I’m here to help you find the right words.

User: Okay. I’d say to her, “I feel scared because my mom is sick, and sometimes I feel all alone with everything.”

Consultant: That’s perfect, Abel! You’re expressing your feelings clearly and honestly. Remember, vulnerability can bring people closer and might provide you with the support you need. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit lighter just thinking about it.

Consultant: I’m happy to hear that! As we conclude our session today, what’s one key takeaway you want to hold onto?

User: I want to remember my plan for school and to try talking more about how I feel with people I trust.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway, Abel! It sounds like you're developing skills to both manage your studies and express your feelings. Remember, I'm here to support you whenever you need. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Abel! I look forward to hearing about your progress with your action plan and your conversations. Take care, and we'll see each other soon!

Consultant: Hi Abel! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have there been any updates about school or your mom's health?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty anxious. I've been trying to stick to my plan for school, but I'm still really worried about getting kicked out. My mom's health is still a huge weight on me too.

Consultant: I can see how those pressures could feel really overwhelming. When you think about the possibility of being kicked out, what thoughts pop into your mind? 

User: I just keep thinking I’m going to disappoint everyone and that I’ll never be successful. It makes it hard to focus on anything. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way when you’re dealing with so much stress. Can you remember a specific moment recently when those thoughts surfaced, maybe during a class or when doing homework?

User: Yes, in my last class, I struggled with a math problem and thought, “I’m just not good at this,” and then everything started spiraling from there.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Abel. It’s easy to fall into negative thoughts when faced with difficulties. If you could see that situation differently, how do you think it might change how you feel?

User: Maybe I could see it as just a challenge I can work on instead of a failure. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Viewing it as a challenge can open up a space for growth and learning. If a friend faced a similar struggle, what would you tell them to help them feel better?

User: I would remind them that it’s okay to find things hard and that they can ask for help if they need it.

Consultant: That's a great perspective to share! And you can extend that same kindness to yourself. Let’s talk about how we can add some support into your plan for school. What’s a small action you could take this week to help you feel more confident in your work?

User: I could ask my teacher for extra help with math. 

Consultant: That’s a proactive step! Asking for help shows strength. Let’s think about how you might do that. What would you say to your teacher when you ask for help?

User: I could say, “I’m struggling with the math problems, and I’m hoping you could explain them to me.” 

Consultant: That sounds clear and straightforward. How do you think you would feel after reaching out for help?

User: I think I’d feel relieved, like I’m taking control instead of just feeling stuck. 

Consultant: Exactly! Taking control can do wonders for your confidence. Now, let’s reflect back on your mom's health. How have you been coping with your worries about her?

User: I’ve still been feeling scared and alone about it. I feel like I should be strong for her, but it’s hard.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those feelings. It's okay to not be strong all the time. Have you found any ways to express or cope with those feelings regarding your mom?

User: I haven’t really talked to anyone about it. I'm worried they won’t understand how I feel. 

Consultant: I understand that fear, but sharing can often make those feelings easier to bear. If you did talk to someone, who would be the most comfortable person for you to open up to about this?

User: I think my aunt would be a good person. She always knows how to listen.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful choice! Opening up to her could really help. What’s one thing you’d like to share with her about how you’re feeling regarding your mom’s health?

User: I’d like to tell her that I feel scared a lot because of my mom. 

Consultant: That’s a brave start. Do you want to practice how to express that thought now? 

User: Sure, I could say, “I feel scared about my mom’s health and sometimes I don’t know what to do with those feelings.”

Consultant: That’s beautifully stated, Abel! You’re being honest about your feelings, which is key to opening a conversation. How do you think that would feel for you?

User: I think I’d feel more connected to her, like I’m no longer carrying everything alone.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight! Sharing your fears can build connection. As we move closer to the end of our session, what is one takeaway you want to remember from today?

User: I want to focus on asking for help and opening up to my aunt about my feelings.

Consultant: That's a fantastic takeaway, Abel! You're taking essential steps to support yourself both academically and emotionally. Remember, I'm here for you whenever you need assistance. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I feel like I have a clearer path now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Abel! I look forward to hearing about your conversations and progress next time. Take care and see you soon!

Consultant: Hi Abel! It's wonderful to see you again. How have things been since our last session? Have you had a chance to try out your action plan for school and how you feel about your mom's health?

User: Hi! I've been trying to stick to my plan. I did ask my teacher for help with math, and it was really helpful. But I still feel anxious about everything, especially my mom. 

Consultant: That’s great to hear that you reached out for help, Abel! It takes courage to do that. When you think about your mom’s health, what feelings come up for you?

User: I feel really scared and sad. Sometimes, I just get this overwhelming feeling that I might lose her, and it’s really hard to handle.

Consultant: Those feelings can be incredibly heavy. It’s completely normal to feel scared when someone you love is unwell. How are you coping with those emotions when they become overwhelming?

User: I try to distract myself with drawing, which helps a little, but sometimes it just hits me out of nowhere, you know?

Consultant: It makes sense that those feelings can catch you off guard. Drawing is a great way to express those feelings. Have you had moments recently where drawing helped you release some of that anxiety?

User: Yes, there was one day when I felt really anxious, so I spent some time drawing my mom. It felt good to focus on something positive.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful way to redirect your feelings, Abel. Focusing on the positive can create a calming effect. Let’s think a little deeper—when those overwhelming feelings hit, what thoughts do you have about the situation with your mom?

User: I often think that I shouldn’t be scared or that I should be strong. But then I feel worse because it feels impossible to stay strong all the time.

Consultant: It’s important to remember that it’s perfectly okay to feel scared and not always be strong. Everyone has moments of vulnerability. If you were giving advice to a friend feeling the same way, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably say it’s okay to feel how they feel and that they don’t have to pretend to be strong all the time.

Consultant: Exactly! You're learning to show yourself that same compassion. What are some other ways you could practice kindness toward yourself when those feelings come up?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to be sad and to take breaks when I need them instead of pushing through everything.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach! Giving yourself permission to feel sad and take breaks is very important. As we think about your school situation, how are you managing any ongoing worries about appearing successful?

User: I’m still anxious about it, especially with my schoolwork. Sometimes, I just freeze up when I think about my performance.

Consultant: Freezing up is a common reaction to anxiety. Instead of focusing solely on the end result, what if you focused on the effort you’re putting into your work instead? 

User: I think that would help because then I'd concentrate on what I'm doing rather than worrying if it’s perfect.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on your effort can help shift the pressure off of achieving perfection. As you work on your assignments, how can you remind yourself that the process is what counts?

User: I could set small, achievable goals for my assignments and celebrate when I complete them.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Celebrating your small victories can help you build confidence. What’s a small goal you could set for your next assignment?

User: I can aim to finish the first draft of my history essay by Friday.

Consultant: That’s a great goal! Focusing on completing that draft by Friday can help you feel accomplished. Remember to celebrate that achievement, big or small. 

User: I will! And I think I can show it to my teacher to get feedback, which feels less daunting than just handing in a final version.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Getting feedback can really help you feel more confident moving forward. Before we wrap up today, what’s one key takeaway you want to remember from our session?

User: I want to remember that it’s okay to feel scared about my mom and that I should focus on the effort I’m putting into my schoolwork without the pressure of perfection.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway, Abel! You’re building resilience by allowing yourself to feel and taking steps to improve your situation. Remember, I’m here for you whenever you need support. 

User: Thank you! I feel like I have more clarity and hope now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Abel! I look forward to hearing about your progress and how you’re applying these strategies next time. Take care, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hi Abel! It’s wonderful to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? Were you able to implement your action plan at school and manage your feelings about your mom’s health?

User: Hi! I've been doing my best to follow the plan, and I did finish my history essay draft and showed it to my teacher. But I’m still anxious, especially about my mom. It feels like a lot to handle.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you finished your essay draft and sought feedback from your teacher! That’s a significant step. I understand how challenging it must be to balance those academic pressures with concerns for your mom’s health. What are the feelings that come up for you when you think about her situation?

User: I feel really scared and sometimes hopeless. I just worry about what will happen if her condition gets worse.

Consultant: Those feelings are completely valid, Abel. It’s tough to face uncertainties regarding someone you love. When those worries arise, what thoughts tend to run through your mind?

User: I often think things like, “What if I lose her?” or “What if I’m not strong enough to handle it?” It just makes everything seem darker.

Consultant: It’s understandable to think that way when faced with such difficult emotions. But remember, it’s okay to feel scared and to acknowledge those feelings. How do you feel when you think about talking to someone about your emotions regarding your mom?

User: I still feel hesitant. I’m afraid they won’t know how to help me or will think I’m being dramatic.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel hesitant about opening up, but sharing our fears can often lighten our emotional load. You might find relief in expressing your feelings. If you were to speak to your aunt again, how might you frame your thoughts this time to encourage a supportive conversation?

User: I could say something like, “I feel scared about my mom’s health and I’m worried I might not be able to cope.” 

Consultant: That's a fantastic way to express yourself! Being honest about your fears can invite support and understanding from her. Would you feel more comfortable practicing that thought now?

User: Yes! I can say that to her when I feel ready.

Consultant: Perfect! It’s a brave step to share your emotions. As we shift back to school, you mentioned last time that you made a checklist—how has it been working for you?

User: It has really helped! I feel more organized, but I still get anxious when I think about my grades and whether I’m doing enough.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Abel. It’s common to feel anxious about grades when you’re putting in effort. Remember, grades are just one measure of your abilities. What could you remind yourself of to help ease that pressure?

User: I guess I could tell myself that I’m trying my best and that learning is a process. 

Consultant: Absolutely, focusing on the effort you’re putting in is crucial. How about setting a personal goal for your next assignment that emphasizes your effort rather than the outcome? 

User: That sounds good! I could aim to focus on understanding the material rather than just aiming for a specific grade.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! Focusing on understanding can alleviate some of that pressure you feel about performance. When you succeed in grasping the material, it’s a win no matter the outcome. 

User: I like that idea! I might even take some time to review what I’ve learned after each class to reinforce it.

Consultant: That’s a great plan, Abel! Review time can help solidify your understanding and make you feel more prepared. As we start to wrap up today’s session, what’s one main takeaway or strategy you want to focus on moving forward?

User: I want to remember to express my fears about my mom and keep focusing on the effort I put into my studies rather than just the results.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway! You're cultivating resilience and allowing yourself to feel while also focusing on your efforts. Remember, I’m here to support you whenever you need guidance or encouragement. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful and equipped to handle things now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Abel! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress. Keep up the great work, and we’ll see each other soon!
###################
Consultant: Hi Abel! It's wonderful to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? Have you made any progress with your action plan regarding school and your mom's health?

User: Hi! I've been trying hard to stick to my plan. I finished another assignment, and I’ve managed to talk to my aunt about how I’m feeling regarding my mom. But I still feel really anxious at times.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're working through your plan and that you were able to talk to your aunt. That’s a brave step! What feelings come up for you when you think about your mom's health or your schoolwork?

User: I feel scared, especially when I think about what might happen if her health deteriorates. And with school, I worry that I won't keep up or that I'll mess up again.

Consultant: Those feelings are completely valid, Abel. It's understandable that you would feel scared when dealing with your mom's health and the pressure to perform at school. Can you identify any specific moments recently that made those feelings stronger?

User: Yeah, there was a day when my mom seemed particularly weak, and I started thinking, “What will I do if she gets really sick?” It freaked me out. Then I had a tough math test that compounded my stress.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Abel. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed in situations like that. When you're juggling so much, what thoughts run through your mind about your ability to handle things?

User: I often feel like I'm going to fail at everything. I keep thinking that if I can't handle this, I won't be able to succeed in school either.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be incredibly heavy. However, it’s crucial to challenge that narrative. If you were advising a friend who felt the same way, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay to struggle and that they should just focus on taking things one step at a time.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on one step at a time can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed. Let’s think about what small step you can take this week to help yourself feel more in control. How about with your schoolwork?

User: Maybe I could set aside specific times for studying to break things down into manageable chunks.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Setting aside specific study times can help create structure and reduce anxiety. What subject do you think you’ll focus on first?

User: I think I need to catch up on math since I’ve been struggling with it. 

Consultant: Great choice! How about setting a specific goal for your math study session? What would you like to accomplish during that time?

User: I’d like to review the topics I found difficult and maybe practice some problems to feel more prepared.

Consultant: That’s a solid goal. Reviewing difficult topics and practicing problems will help build your confidence. As for your feelings about your mom, how have you been managing them since talking to your aunt?

User: Talking to her helped a bit. I told her my fears, and she reassured me that it’s okay to feel scared and that I can talk to her whenever I need to. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Abel! Having someone supportive to talk to can make a huge difference, especially during tough times. How do you feel about checking in with your aunt regularly to share how you're feeling?

User: I think that would be good. I like knowing I have someone to turn to when it all feels like too much.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Regular check-ins can provide ongoing support as you navigate those feelings. As we wrap up today, what key takeaway do you want to remember from our session?

User: I want to focus on breaking things into small steps and to keep talking to my aunt when I need support with my feelings.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway, Abel! You're developing a solid approach to handling your challenges. I’m here to support you whenever you need. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about how to handle everything.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Abel! I look forward to hearing about your progress and any new strategies you implement next time. Take care and see you soon!
