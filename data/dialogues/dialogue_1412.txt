Consultant: Hello Miles! I'm glad to see you today. I know you've been through a lot recently, and I want to support you in exploring your feelings. Can you share what's been weighing on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling completely lost since my business went under. My wife took the kids, and I just can't shake this feeling of worthlessness. I don’t even know how to react to any supportive comments from friends or family. 

Consultant: It sounds incredibly tough. You're feeling alone and struggling with self-doubt, especially after such significant changes in your life. Let's take a moment to explore that feeling of worthlessness. What thoughts go through your mind when you reflect on your situation?

User: I constantly replay moments where I feel like I've failed—my business, not being there for my family. I just keep thinking that I'm not good enough. 

Consultant: I see. Those thoughts seem to be quite overwhelming. Can you tell me more about how these thoughts affect your emotions? For instance, how do they make you feel in your day-to-day life?

User: When those thoughts arise, I feel deep sadness and frustration. It’s like a never-ending loop of negativity that prevents me from moving forward. 

Consultant: That sounds exhausting, Miles. It’s clear that these negative thoughts are influencing not only your mood but your ability to make progress. Let's pinpoint some of these automatic thoughts. Can you share a specific situation where these feelings of worthlessness particularly stand out?

User: Sure, after I lost my business, I tried reaching out to a few friends for support. But when they said, "You'll bounce back," I felt even worse. I thought they didn’t really see how much I’ve failed.

Consultant: So, in that moment, their words sparked a deeper belief in your mind—that you are defined by this failure. It seems your mind quickly translates their encouragement into a reminder of your perceived shortcomings. Can we dig deeper into that thought? What evidence do you find to support this feeling of being a failure?

User: I can think of several examples where I didn’t meet my goals. It just feels like I always let everyone down, especially myself. 

Consultant: It can be really tough when our minds focus only on the negative. What if we challenge that thought a bit? Are there any instances, even small ones, where you succeeded or made a positive impact?

User: I used to be good at networking and building relationships. I made some solid connections that helped others. But now, I don’t even recognize that part of myself anymore. 

Consultant: It’s essential to acknowledge that part of you, Miles! You have accomplished meaningful things in the past. This negative belief might be overshadowing other aspects of your identity. How would it feel to remind yourself of those positive contributions when you think about yourself?

User: It sounds nice, but it feels distant. I’m so stuck in this negative mindset that I don’t know how to reconnect with those parts of me. 

Consultant: That’s understandable, especially when you’re going through such a challenging time. Let’s consider setting small, achievable goals that reaffirm your strengths. What would be one small step you could take this week to reconnect with that side of yourself?

User: Maybe reaching out to an old contact just for a casual catch-up? That feels manageable. 

Consultant: I think that’s a fantastic first step! Engaging with others could help shift your focus toward more positive interactions. What feelings do you expect to encounter during this catch-up?

User: I’m nervous about how they’ll perceive me nowadays. What if they judge me?

Consultant: It’s natural to feel anxious about how others might react, especially when we're feeling vulnerable. However, it’s important to remember that everyone goes through ups and downs. If a friend were in your situation, what would you advise them about reaching out?

User: I would tell them to just be honest and that it’s okay to be vulnerable. 

Consultant: Precisely! Honesty can lead to connection. Now, let’s also think about what you can do if you start feeling judged during that conversation. How might you handle that situation?

User: I suppose I could remind myself that their opinions don’t define my worth. I might even share my feelings of vulnerability.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy approach! Acknowledging your feelings can help you feel more empowered in the moment. As we near the end of our session, how are you feeling about the conversation we’ve had today?

User: I feel a little lighter. It’s helpful to realize I’m not alone in this and that it’s okay to reach out. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Miles! It’s vital to know you're not alone in this journey. As we wrap up, let’s summarize what you find beneficial from today's session. What do you think will help you most moving forward?

User: Recognizing my past successes and trying to reconnect with positive people is key. I’ll also work on challenging those negative thoughts. 

Consultant: Absolutely, Miles! Remember to be gentle with yourself in this process. You’re taking significant steps towards self-acceptance. If you find yourself struggling, we can revisit these topics in our future sessions. 

User: Thank you for your support. This has been really helpful. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm here to help anytime. Best of luck with your plans to reach out. Don’t hesitate to come back if you need further assistance.

Consultant: Hello, Miles! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been struggling a lot. I feel really hopeless about my relationship with my children. I desperately want to reconnect with them, but I think my past mistakes are too big to overcome.

Consultant: I hear you, Miles. Feeling hopeless about the relationship with your children can be really tough. Let's start by exploring your thoughts and feelings about this. What specifically worries you the most about reconnecting with them?

User: I suppose I worry that they might not want to see me, or they’ll just remember all the times I was harsh with them. It makes me feel really inadequate as a father.

Consultant: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden from the past, and those feelings of inadequacy can be overwhelming. What do you think would help you feel more capable in this situation?

User: I don’t know… Maybe if I could prove to them that I’ve changed, but then I just think, what if they don’t see it that way?

Consultant: That's a valid concern. It seems like you're worried about their perceptions of your changes. Have you had a chance to talk to them about how you're feeling?

User: Not really. I feel too scared to reach out. What if they just shut me down? 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel scared about reaching out, especially with the history you have. Let's consider what a small step might look like. How would you feel about writing them a letter to express your feelings?

User: A letter sounds less intimidating, but I still worry it won’t change anything. They might just think I'm trying to manipulate them.

Consultant: Those feelings of skepticism are common, especially after past experiences. What evidence do you have that they would think that? Sometimes, it helps to analyze whether our fears are based on facts or assumptions.

User: I guess it’s mostly assumptions. I’ve never actually tried to communicate this way before.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! Since it’s uncharted territory for you, how about we outline what you might want to express in that letter? What would you like them to know about your intentions?

User: I want them to know that I regret my past behavior and that I truly want to be a better father. But I struggle with expressing that.

Consultant: Acknowledging your struggles is a great first step. Perhaps you could write something simple, focusing on your regret and desire for positive change. How does that approach feel to you?

User: It feels a bit overwhelming, honestly. How can I make sure my message is sincere and not just empty words?

Consultant: That’s a great question! Sincerity often comes through when you share your personal feelings and experiences. Maybe start by acknowledging the pain that the past has caused you and express your commitment to change. How would it feel to write about that?

User: Writing about my pain makes me uncomfortable, but I can see how it might help them understand my feelings better.

Consultant: It’s a vulnerable space to explore, but expressing your true feelings might bridge the gap between you two. Would it be helpful if we brainstorm together some open, honest phrases you could use in the letter?

User: Yes, I would appreciate that. I struggle with turning my feelings into words.

Consultant: Alright! How about starting with something like, “I’ve been reflecting on my past mistakes, and I recognize how my actions may have hurt you”? That shows that you're taking responsibility.

User: That sounds good, but I worry that I’m still not good enough to be believed.

Consultant: It's normal to have that fear, but the act of writing the letter itself shows a desire to improve. It might also be helpful to remind yourself that this is just the beginning of a conversation, not the end. Are there any specific outcomes you hope for from this letter?

User: I just want them to know I care. I hope they’ll give me a chance to show that I’ve changed over time.

Consultant: That’s a great goal! Opening up that channel of communication could lead to further healing. Do you feel ready to start drafting this letter, or do you need more support in this area?

User: I feel a bit more ready. Just having this conversation has really helped me think more clearly about it.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, taking small steps is key. As you work on the letter, keep reinforcing your belief that change is possible. How are you feeling about approaching them after the letter is sent?

User: I still feel anxious, but a little hopeful too. It’s a start, I suppose.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! Recognizing that hope is important. Let’s discuss how you can maintain this hope and build on it moving forward. What are some ways you can support yourself through this process?

User: I think talking to you about it helps. Maybe keeping a journal about my feelings would also help.

Consultant: Journaling is an excellent tool for self-reflection and processing emotions. It can help you keep track of your progress. Would you feel comfortable sharing your journal entries with me in our next session?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful. Writing things down would make me feel like I’m actually doing something.

Consultant: Absolutely! Engaging in the writing process will help solidify your intentions and patterns of thinking. As we wrap up our session, remember to practice self-compassion as you navigate this journey. You are taking crucial steps toward healing.

User: Thank you. I feel encouraged. I’ll work on the letter and my journaling. It's nice to feel some positivity.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that, Miles! Embracing these feelings is an essential part of your journey. Remember, progress takes time, and it's okay to feel anxious. You’re moving in the right direction. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session.

Consultant: Hello Miles! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I'm still feeling quite anxious. The thought of the upcoming interviews really makes me stressed. I keep doubting my worth and abilities.

Consultant: It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure. The feelings of anxiety and self-doubt are very common, especially in high-stress situations like interviews. Can you tell me a bit more about what specifically makes you feel this way during interviews?

User: Well, I tend to think about all the things that could go wrong. I can't shake off the fear of being judged or not living up to expectations. It's overwhelming.

Consultant: I understand. It's challenging when your mind focuses on potential negatives. Let's explore some of those thoughts. What thoughts go through your mind right before an interview?

User: Before the interview, I often think, "What if I mess up?" or "What if they think I'm not qualified?" Those thoughts just spiral and make me feel even worse.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very discouraging. Can you share how these thoughts make you feel emotionally and physically? 

User: Emotionally, I feel anxious and often start to panic. Physically, I get sweaty and my heart races. It's like my body is telling me there's a real threat.

Consultant: That's a very natural response to anxiety. Our bodies react as if we're in danger. Let's work on changing those thoughts. When you think, "What if I mess up?" what evidence do you have that supports this thought? 

User: I guess I don't have concrete evidence. It's more like a fear based on my past experiences and the pressure I put on myself.

Consultant: That’s important to recognize—many negative thoughts stem from fear rather than evidence. What would you say to a friend who was feeling this way before an interview?

User: I would probably tell them to stay confident and to focus on their strengths instead of their fears.

Consultant: Exactly! It seems like you already have a more compassionate perspective for others. Now, let’s try applying that same approach to yourself. Can you think of some strengths or past successes that you might focus on before your next interview?

User: I suppose I’ve had a few successful projects and positive feedback from my team. It’s just hard to remember that in the moment.

Consultant: It's completely understandable. How about creating a list of those successes? You can review it as a form of positive affirmation before an interview. Would that be helpful to you?

User: That sounds good. I can see how reminding myself of those successes might help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Great! Let's also practice some calming techniques. What have you tried in the past that helps you manage anxiety?

User: I’ve tried deep breathing, which sometimes helps. But I often forget to do it when I'm really anxious.

Consultant: Breathing exercises can be very effective. How about we create a quick plan for using deep breathing before and during interviews? We can practice it together.

User: I’d like that. It would be good to have a specific plan to follow.

Consultant: Fantastic! Let’s visualize a scenario: imagine yourself in an interview, feeling anxious. How would you incorporate the deep breathing into that moment?

User: I guess I could take a few deep breaths before answering each question. Just to calm my nerves.

Consultant: Yes! Taking those moments for yourself can help ground you. After a few rounds of deep breaths, how do you think you’ll feel when you respond to the questions?

User: Hopefully more calm and focused. I want to be able to think clearly.

Consultant: Exactly. Clarity comes from being calm. Also, remind yourself that it’s okay to take a moment to gather your thoughts during an interview. That shows confidence. 

User: That makes sense. I need to allow myself that space to think.

Consultant: Definitely! You deserve that. And remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Each interview is an opportunity to grow and learn.

User: I like that idea; it takes some pressure off. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let's discuss how you'll handle feedback after your interviews. How do you usually respond to feedback from others?

User: I usually can't accept it well, especially if it’s positive. I tend to doubt it.

Consultant: It sounds like accepting positive feedback is particularly challenging for you. What if we set a goal for you to practice acknowledging any positive comments you receive?

User: I could try that. It might be helpful to write them down and remind myself of them.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach. Keeping a journal of positive feedback can help reinforce your self-worth. Would you be willing to commit to that?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. It will be a good reminder.

Consultant: Awesome, Miles! As we wrap up our session today, let’s review what you’ve learned and practiced. On a scale from 1 to 10, how confident do you feel about approaching your next interview?

User: I’d say around 6. It’s not perfect, but I feel a bit more prepared.

Consultant: That’s a good start! Remember, feeling more prepared can build your confidence over time. What will be your next step to continue this progress?

User: I will create my strengths list and practice deep breathing. I will also try to accept feedback more openly.

Consultant: Those sound like solid steps forward. I’m proud of you for being open to these changes. If you ever need more support, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate all the help. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Miles! I look forward to hearing about your next steps in our next session. Take care!

User: You too. Goodbye!
###################
Consultant: Hello Miles! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially regarding the feedback you received from the support group?

User: Hi. I felt a mix of excitement and skepticism, to be honest. Their positive comments were encouraging, but I still find it hard to believe that I'm worthy of praise.

Consultant: It makes sense to feel that way, especially given your experiences growing up. You’re starting to open up to positive feedback, which is a significant step! What specific positive feedback did you receive that stood out to you?

User: They complimented my ideas during the group discussion, saying I had a good perspective on things. It felt nice, but then I immediately thought, “They’re just being nice.”

Consultant: It’s great to hear you received compliments on your ideas! But I see you're still struggling to accept them fully. Can you tell me more about that immediate thought you had? How does that thought make you feel?

User: When I think they’re just being nice, it makes me feel small and undeserving. It’s like I’m waiting for them to point out something wrong to validate my doubts.

Consultant: That's a powerful insight, Miles. It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of self-doubt. Let’s explore that thought together. What evidence do you have that suggests their feedback isn't genuine?

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence. I just feel this way because of how my father treated me growing up. It has stuck with me.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Our past experiences can heavily influence our present feelings. If a friend received that same compliment, what advice would you give them regarding how to view it?

User: I would probably tell them to appreciate it and be proud of themselves. But when it comes to me, it’s different. I don’t feel I can do that.

Consultant: It’s interesting how we can be kinder to others than to ourselves. Let’s try to flip that perspective. What if we practiced acknowledging your accomplishments out loud? What’s something you’re proud of lately?

User: I suppose I did organize a workshop recently. It went well, and people seemed to enjoy it.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful achievement! Let’s take a moment to reflect on that. How did it feel for you to successfully lead that workshop?

User: It felt good, but I don’t think it was that special compared to what others can do.

Consultant: I hear you downplaying your success again. Instead of comparing, can we focus on what you did well? What skills did you utilize during the workshop?

User: I planned the agenda, communicated effectively, and kept the group engaged. 

Consultant: Those are valuable skills, Miles! Recognizing these strengths is essential in building your self-worth. How could you remind yourself of these skills moving forward?

User: Maybe I could write them down and read them when I doubt myself.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Keeping a record of your strengths can serve as a helpful reminder. How about we set a small goal for you to practice this week? 

User: Sure, I could write down at least three things I did well by the end of each day.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical plan! As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what you’ve learned. What do you think will be the most significant takeaway from our conversation today?

User: I think I need to work on accepting compliments and reminding myself of my successes rather than dismissing them.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve taken an important step forward. Remember, it’s all about building that habit of self-acceptance. How do you feel about coming back and sharing how this practice has worked for you?

User: I feel positive about that. I want to keep working on it and see where it leads.

Consultant: I'm excited to hear about your progress! You've made great strides, Miles. Remember, you are worthy of praise and can build on this momentum. Until next time, take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Miles! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to implement some of the communication techniques we talked about at work. It's a bit challenging, but I feel like I'm making some progress.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It's a positive step that you are actively trying to use those techniques. Can you share a specific instance where you applied them?

User: Well, there was a meeting where I spoke up to share my ideas. Normally, I would hold back, but I actually voiced my thoughts. I felt nervous, but it was empowering.

Consultant: Voicing your thoughts in a meeting is a significant step! How did that experience impact your feelings about yourself?

User: I was proud of myself for participating, but afterward, I found myself doubting whether my ideas were good enough. It's like I can't hold on to the good feelings for too long.

Consultant: It's understandable to experience doubt even after a positive action. Let's focus on that moment when you felt proud. Can you tell me what thoughts were going through your mind at that time?

User: I remember thinking maybe I should do this more often. But then I quickly switched to, "What if they didn't take me seriously?" It felt like my doubts overshadowed the moment.

Consultant: It sounds like you shifted from a positive self-recognition to a place of questioning your worth. This could be a pattern we explore. How would you rate the evidence for both the positive and negative thoughts you experienced?

User: I guess there isn't much evidence against my ideas. They were well-received, and people seemed engaged. But I just have this voice in my head that tells me I don't measure up.

Consultant: It seems like there’s a clear discrepancy between the positive feedback you received and the negative self-talk you engage in. Can we explore what it might look like to challenge that inner voice? 

User: Sure, I think it would help, but I’m not sure where to start.

Consultant: One approach could be to imagine you were advising a friend in the same situation. What would you encourage them to think in response to that inner voice?

User: I would probably tell them to recognize their accomplishments and not let doubts ruin their achievements. That does sound reasonable.

Consultant: Exactly! You already have a great sense of how to support others. Now let’s consider how you could apply that same kindness to yourself. What are some achievements you could remind yourself of?

User: Well, I did lead that meeting and even initiated a follow-up discussion. I also helped a new colleague settle in.

Consultant: Those are indeed commendable actions, Miles! Recognizing these achievements is vital. How about setting a small, specific goal for the upcoming week related to your communication at work?

User: Maybe I could aim to share my ideas in the next two team meetings and reflect on how that feels afterward.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! After each meeting, perhaps take a moment to write down how you felt and the feedback you received. This will reinforce those positive moments.

User: Yes, I like that. It feels more tangible. But I’m also worried about failing again, though.

Consultant: It’s natural to have that concern. Can we think about what ‘failure’ means in this context? How can we reframe that in a more constructive way?

User: I suppose “failure” might just be an opportunity to learn—like if my ideas get rejected or if I struggle to express them.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! Every experience can provide insights. Let’s create an environment where you view challenges not as setbacks but as learning opportunities. 

User: I can work with that! It shifts my focus away from fear and on to growth. 

Consultant: Absolutely! And remember, each time you achieve a small goal, you reinforce that growth mindset. You’re building a foundation for further self-recognition.

User: I feel a bit more confident about this. Just thinking about trying to share in the next meetings makes me a little excited!

Consultant: That excitement is a positive sign. Let’s embrace that! What steps will you take to prepare for these meetings in order to consolidate your confidence?

User: I think I’ll prepare some notes beforehand, so I feel ready to share my thoughts. 

Consultant: Preparing notes sounds like an excellent strategy! It can provide a sense of control and readiness. Would writing down affirmations about your capabilities be beneficial as well?

User: Yes, I think writing down some positive affirmations could help me reinforce that I am capable and my ideas matter.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Affirmations can help combat those negative thoughts. Let’s aim to have these affirmations at the forefront of your mind when preparing for meetings.

User: I will try to do that. I'm feeling optimistic about the upcoming week now!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Miles! Optimism is key. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the progress you’ve made during our sessions?

User: I feel like I've made real strides in recognizing my accomplishments and working on my self-perception. It’s empowering.

Consultant: That's wonderful! You've done a great job of focusing on your strengths. Lastly, what will you do if you find yourself falling back into negative thinking?

User: I’ll remind myself of our discussions and remember to reframe my thoughts. It’s about learning and growing, right?

Consultant: Exactly! Always keep that growth mindset. I believe you'll continue to strengthen your self-recognition. If you ever feel stuck, remember you can always come back for support. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate our sessions, and I'm looking forward to the next one!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Miles! I'm looking forward to hearing all about your experiences. Take care, and keep progressing.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Miles! I'm glad to see you today. It seems like you've made some positive strides recently. How are you feeling about everything?

User: Hi! I feel a lot stronger now. After expressing my emotions at the family gathering, my relatives really supported me, and it helped me feel more accepted.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like that experience touched you deeply. How has it influenced your thoughts about yourself since then?

User: Well, I've noticed that I'm beginning to appreciate myself a little more. It's still not easy, but I’m trying to acknowledge my achievements instead of just criticizing myself.

Consultant: That's a significant step forward, recognizing and appreciating your achievements! What specific strategies or practices have you found helpful in this journey so far?

User: I've started practicing self-affirmations. At first, it felt uncomfortable, but I'm gradually getting used to saying something positive about myself each day.

Consultant: It's great that you're incorporating self-affirmations! They can be powerful in reshaping how we see ourselves. Do you feel that these affirmations have changed the way you react to compliments from others?

User: Yes, a bit. When someone says something nice now, I try to remind myself that it's okay to accept it instead of brushing it off. But I still find it challenging sometimes.

Consultant: Accepting compliments can indeed be challenging. It's a lifelong skill. Let's explore that further—what kind of thoughts still come up for you when you receive a compliment?

User: I often think, "They must be saying that just to be nice," or "I really don't deserve it." I immediately revert to being critical of myself.

Consultant: Those thoughts are quite common, especially when we're used to being self-critical. Let's challenge those thoughts together. What evidence do you have that you don't deserve the compliment?

User: I guess there isn't much evidence. But I struggle to reconcile that with how I was raised. My father was always very critical, so it's hard to shake that off.

Consultant: It makes sense that those early experiences would have a lasting impact. It's important to recognize that your father's perspective doesn't define your worth. What would you say to a friend who believed they didn't deserve compliments?

User: I would tell them they should believe in themselves and not let past experiences dictate their worth.

Consultant: Exactly! You already have the insight. Now, let's practice applying that wisdom to yourself. What might be an empowering thought you could replace those critical thoughts with?

User: Maybe something like, "I am worthy of compliments because I work hard and am trying to improve."

Consultant: That's a fantastic reframe, Miles! How can you remind yourself of this new thought when you face compliments in the future?

User: I could write it down and keep it somewhere visible, or even repeat it to myself before I’m in a situation where I might receive praise.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Keeping a visual reminder can reinforce positive thinking. Let's also think about your support network. How do you plan to stay connected with family and friends who uplift you?

User: I think I’ll make an effort to reach out more often and maybe even suggest regular family gatherings. I realized I'm not alone in this.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Creating those connections can help maintain your positive mindset. As we look ahead, what kind of self-assessment practices do you envision incorporating into your routine?

User: I might start a journal to reflect on my feelings and track my accomplishments, no matter how small.

Consultant: A journaling practice sounds wonderful! It can really help solidify your growth and provide insight. How do you feel about setting specific times for this reflection?

User: Setting a regular time each week could be useful. It’ll give me something to look forward to, and I can see my progress over time.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Regular reflection can serve as an encouragement. As we approach the conclusion of our sessions, how would you sum up your journey and growth so far?

User: I feel I've come a long way in recognizing and appreciating myself. I still have work to do, but I'm more hopeful now than I was before.

Consultant: That's a remarkable reflection, Miles. Your hard work is truly paying off. What are the main strategies you'll take with you as you move forward?

User: I will keep practicing self-affirmations, reach out to my family and friends more often, and maintain my journaling practice.

Consultant: Those are wonderful takeaways to continue your journey. Remember, you've built a strong foundation, and it’s okay to seek support when needed. As we wrap up, do you feel prepared to implement these strategies on your own?

User: Yes, I feel ready and motivated to keep going. Thank you for all your help! 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Miles! It has been an honor to support you on this journey. Remember, you have the skills and support you need to continue thriving. If you ever feel the need to return, I'll be here for you. Take care!

User: Thank you! I'll definitely keep that in mind.
