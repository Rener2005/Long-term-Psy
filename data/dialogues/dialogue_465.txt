Consultant: Hello, Li Na! Welcome to our session today. I’d like to start by understanding how you’ve been feeling since our last meeting. Can you share what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi! Thanks for having me. I've been feeling pretty anxious lately. I attended that workshop on personal growth, and for a short time, I felt really positive. But now I’m back to doubting whether I can keep up this change. 

Consultant: I see. It sounds like there was a burst of motivation from the workshop, but now you're questioning its sustainability. What specific doubts or concerns do you have about maintaining that positive change?

User: I just keep thinking that maybe it was just a phase, and I'm not strong enough to keep it going. I feel like I don't really have control over my feelings.

Consultant: That must be frustrating, feeling like you lost the control you previously felt. Let's explore this thought of not being strong enough a bit more. Can you tell me what evidence supports that belief?

User: Well, I’ve tried to make changes before, and they never last. So, I just assume it will be the same this time.

Consultant: It sounds like you've experienced setbacks in the past, which makes you doubt your current abilities. However, I wonder if we could think of times when you have succeeded, even in small ways? 

User: I suppose I did manage to stay positive for a few weeks after the workshop... But it feels like a fluke, not something I can rely on.

Consultant: That’s an interesting perspective. It seems like you’re dismissing your achievements. What if we reframe that? Could it be possible that your success during those weeks was actually a result of your effort and not just luck? 

User: Maybe, but I just feel overwhelmed thinking about keeping it up.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed, especially when trying to maintain new changes. Let’s break this down together. What small steps do you think you could take to help you feel more in control?

User: I guess I could try setting smaller goals. Like, focusing on one positive thought a day or something similar.

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! Focusing on one positive thought a day can help reinforce those feelings. How do you think you might remind yourself to do this?

User: I could write it down in my journal or maybe set a reminder on my phone… I just worry I’ll forget.

Consultant: Remembering can be challenging, but having a system in place can help a lot. Consistency might be key here. Let’s visualize this—what would it look like for you to journal these positive thoughts daily? 

User: I think it would be satisfying. It would allow me to see my progress in writing. 

Consultant: Absolutely! It can serve as a tangible reminder of your journey. Now, let’s discuss—when you experience those negative thoughts about your strength to maintain progress, what other, more positive thoughts might you tell yourself instead?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that I successfully changed for a while, which shows that I’m capable.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Recognizing your capacity for change is a powerful affirmation. How does it feel to acknowledge that ability within yourself?

User: It feels good, actually. But I still have fears about failing again.

Consultant: Those fears are valid, and it’s important to acknowledge them. Let’s dissect these feelings—what do you think is the worst that could happen if you did face a setback again?

User: I guess I fear I’d just feel completely lost again and might give up altogether.

Consultant: It’s natural to fear losing progress, but setbacks are often part of growth. What could be a constructive way to respond if that were to happen?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it’s okay to take a break and then return to my positive practices.

Consultant: That’s a resilient mindset! Understanding breaks as part of the process can help reduce anxiety around potential setbacks. As you think about your journey ahead, what other steps can you take to build upon your success?

User: I think I need to connect with supportive friends who can encourage me instead of just doubting myself.

Consultant: Surrounding yourself with supportive individuals can be a great way to boost your confidence. How about sharing your goals with them? 

User: Yes! I could ask them to keep me accountable or even share if I've made progress.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Accountability can foster a sense of community and support. How do you feel about incorporating this into your action plan?

User: I feel more optimistic now. Having others involved might help push me forward.

Consultant: Fantastic! Reaching out for support can make a big difference. Let's summarize what we've discussed so far—setting a daily positive thought goal, journaling, creating a support network, and accepting that setbacks are normal. How does that sound?

User: It sounds quite helpful actually. I'll try to put it into practice.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we wrap up our session, can you share what your biggest takeaway is today?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is that I have the power to implement change. It’s okay to ask for help and that I can rebuild my confidence through small steps.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful reflection! Remember, it’s the small steps that eventually lead to significant changes. I’m here to support you, and I’m looking forward to seeing how you progress. If you find yourself struggling in the future, reach out. You’re capable of this!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help so much.

Consultant: Hello, Li Na! I'm glad you're here for our session today. I understand you've been feeling uncertain about your recent accomplishments and your ability to meet future challenges. Can you share more about what's been on your mind?

User: Hi! Yes, I recently completed a challenging project at work, but I still doubt whether I did well enough. Even though I received positive feedback, I can’t shake the feeling that I'm not capable enough.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve achieved something significant at work, but the positive feedback hasn’t fully alleviated your self-doubt. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel that way about your performance?

User: I think it's because I always compare myself to others. They seem so confident and capable, while I often feel like I'm just barely keeping up.

Consultant: That comparison can be quite damaging. It can create a skewed view of your own accomplishments. What thoughts go through your mind when you find yourself comparing to your colleagues?

User: I just think they are naturally better at their jobs, and I worry that I won't be able to maintain this level of performance. It’s like I don’t deserve the praise I got.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but those thoughts can be very limiting. Let's try to identify some of the automatic thoughts that come to you at those moments. What feelings do these thoughts bring up for you?

User: I feel anxious and a bit defeated. I want to be as confident as they are, but I don't believe I have what it takes.

Consultant: It’s difficult when your feelings of anxiety are overshadowing your achievements. Let's explore these negative thoughts deeper. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you don’t deserve the praise?

User: Well, I think because there were mistakes in my work, even if I still completed it. I fixated on those errors rather than the positive feedback.

Consultant: Mistakes are a natural part of any project, and they don’t negate your success. If a friend were in your position and received similar feedback, what would you say to encourage them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that the important part is having completed the project—that they should focus on the positives.

Consultant: Exactly! You have the ability to encourage others, but it’s sometimes harder to turn that encouragement inward. How can you apply that same compassion and understanding to yourself?

User: I suppose I could try reminding myself that the mistakes don’t define my ability or worth and focus on what I did well.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Let’s work together on reframing those negative thoughts. Instead of saying, “I don’t deserve this praise,” how might you change that to reflect more balanced thinking?

User: Maybe something like, “I worked hard and learned from my mistakes, and that makes me better at my job.” 

Consultant: I love that reframe! It highlights growth and effort. Let's practice that new thought. When you feel those doubts creeping in, I encourage you to remind yourself of your hard work and your capability. How does that feel to say out loud?

User: It feels a bit relieving, actually. It’s nice to think of my effort as a positive thing instead of just dwelling on mistakes.

Consultant: Absolutely! Shifting the focus to effort can be empowering. Moving forward, what steps can you take to reinforce this new way of thinking whenever doubt arises?

User: I could keep a journal where I write down my achievements and any positive feedback I receive. That way, I can remind myself of those truths when I feel uncertain.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful strategy! Journaling can be a powerful tool to help reinforce positive thoughts. Can we also explore ways to support you socially, since you mentioned some anxiety around that?

User: Yes, that would be helpful. I often feel anxious in social situations, worrying about how others perceive me.

Consultant: Social anxiety is common, especially when combined with self-doubt. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you anticipate a social situation?

User: I usually think that no one will want to talk to me or that I’ll say something embarrassing.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. Let’s challenge those. What evidence do you have that supports those beliefs? Have others shown you that they enjoy your company?

User: Actually, yes. My friends have told me they appreciate my viewpoints and enjoy our conversations. 

Consultant: That’s a key piece of evidence! Next time those anxious thoughts surface, remind yourself of those positive affirmations from your friends. What might that look like in practice?

User: I could tell myself, “People enjoy talking to me, and I have valuable things to say.”

Consultant: Perfect! That affirmation can help reduce your anxiety. We can also discuss practical skills to manage social situations. Would you be open to that?

User: Yes, I’d love to hear more about how I can feel more at ease in social situations.

Consultant: We can explore techniques such as deep breathing or grounding exercises before a social event. It may help to practice some small interactions in a comfortable environment. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds doable! I think it would really help reduce my anxiety, especially in casual settings.

Consultant: Great! Let’s set a plan for you to practice these strategies this week. We can check in on how it goes next session. What do you think?

User: I feel hopeful about that. Having a plan sounds reassuring, and I want to work on this.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Li Na! Remember, it's all about taking small, manageable steps. As we wrap up today, what do you feel are your key takeaways from our session?

User: I learned that I can challenge my negative thoughts about my achievements, and I have valuable social skills that I should believe in.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization! You've made excellent progress today. I encourage you to keep practicing those new thoughts and strategies. If you encounter any bumps along the way, we can address them together next time. 

User: Thank you, I really appreciate your guidance! I’ll see you next session!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Li Na! I'm glad you're here today. Let's start by understanding how you've been feeling lately. Can you share what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite anxious since a recent social event. I participated in discussions and received positive feedback, but I still doubt my social skills and feel uneasy in those situations.

Consultant: It sounds like you had a positive experience, but it's overshadowed by your feelings of uncertainty. What specifically were you anxious about during the event?

User: I was worried about saying something wrong or not fitting into the conversation. Even though people said nice things, I still felt out of place.

Consultant: That makes sense. It can be challenging to balance positive feedback with self-doubt. Can you tell me what thoughts went through your mind when you felt out of place?

User: I thought that maybe people were just being polite or that I would embarrass myself. It’s like I keep expecting to mess things up.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts contribute to your anxiety. Let's explore that a bit further. How do those thoughts make you feel emotionally in social settings?

User: They make me feel nervous and insecure. I wish I could just relax and enjoy the moment, but I often end up overthinking everything.

Consultant: I understand. The pressure to perform can be overwhelming. Would you be open to challenging those negative thoughts? For instance, how likely do you think it is that you'll actually embarrass yourself in a social setting?

User: I guess it isn't very likely. Most people are nice and understanding, but I just can’t shake that fear.

Consultant: That's a great insight! Recognizing that the likelihood is low can be a helpful step. What if you considered what a friend might tell you in a similar situation? How would they encourage you?

User: They would probably say that I’m overthinking and that it’s okay to make mistakes. Everyone has their awkward moments, right?

Consultant: Absolutely, everyone has their moments! Let's try this approach: next time, when that fear arises, can you remind yourself of your friend's perspective and that it's okay to be authentic?

User: Yes, I think that could help. I’d like to practice that instead of letting fear take over.

Consultant: That’s a constructive mindset! Now, what are some activities or situations where you can gradually expose yourself to social interactions to build your confidence?

User: Maybe I could join a local meetup or attend more gatherings with friends. Starting small sounds manageable.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Gradually putting yourself in social situations can help reduce that anxiety. How would you feel about setting a goal for yourself in this regard?

User: I feel excited about trying! I could aim to attend one social event this week and just focus on enjoying the company rather than stressing over how I come across.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent goal! Focusing on enjoyment rather than performance can really shift your experience. How do you plan to keep track of your feelings after the event?

User: I could write down what I felt and experienced afterward to see how it went compared to what I expected.

Consultant: Perfect approach! Reflecting on your experiences can help you identify positive moments and reinforce your growth. Do you have any concerns about this plan, or are there any potential challenges you foresee?

User: I worry I might feel overwhelmed if things don’t go perfectly.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. If you notice those anxious feelings surfacing, you can practice those affirmations we discussed. What would you say to yourself in those moments?

User: I'd remind myself that it’s okay to be awkward and that I’m doing my best. 

Consultant: Exactly! And leaning into those moments of discomfort can be a powerful way to build confidence. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel relieved, actually. Discussing this and having a plan gives me hope. I didn’t expect to feel this much better.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Your progress is evident, and with each step you take, you’ll find your confidence growing. For your next session, we can discuss the outcome of the gathering and any insights you gain. 

User: That sounds great! I’m looking forward to it. Thank you for your support today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li Na! Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and I'm here to help. Take care, and I can’t wait to hear about your experiences next time!

Consultant: Hi Li Na! Welcome to our session today. I’m glad you could join me. How are you feeling about your career development after the recent conference?

User: Hi! I appreciate you asking. The conference gave me some useful advice, but honestly, I feel quite lost about my career path. It’s stressful not knowing which direction to take.

Consultant: It sounds like the conference was helpful, but the uncertainty is still weighing on you. Can you share a bit more about what specific aspects of your career path are causing you this feeling of being lost?

User: I'm not sure if I should continue in my current position or try to explore new opportunities. I feel pressure to choose the right path, but it’s confusing.

Consultant: That’s understandable, Li Na. It’s common to feel pressure when making significant career decisions. Let’s try to break it down: what would it mean for you to feel more certain about your career direction?

User: I guess it would mean having a clear plan or goal in mind. I want to feel confident about the choices I make.

Consultant: A clear plan could really help you feel more confident. We can work together on setting some achievable career goals. What kind of goals do you think would give you that sense of direction?

User: I would like to set some short-term and long-term goals. Right now, I think I need to focus on improving my skills in marketing.

Consultant: That sounds like a great starting point! Improving your marketing skills could certainly enhance your confidence and open up more opportunities. What specific skills would you like to improve?

User: I think I need to get better at digital marketing and data analysis. I’ve realized these are crucial in my field.

Consultant: Excellent choices! Digital marketing and data analysis are indeed very valuable skills. How about we set a goal to learn more about these areas? For instance, you might aim to complete an online course in digital marketing within the next two months. Does that sound feasible to you?

User: Yes, that sounds doable! I like the idea of having a timeline.

Consultant: Great! Having a timeline can keep you motivated. As you progress towards this goal, how do you think you’ll feel about your career uncertainty?

User: I believe having that goal will lessen my anxiety about the future. It feels reassuring to focus on something actionable.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking actionable steps can help manage your uncertainties. What about the feelings of stress you might still be experiencing during this process? How can we address those?

User: I sometimes feel overwhelmed when thinking about the future. I think I need strategies to manage that anxiety.

Consultant: That's a valid concern. Let’s discuss some relaxation techniques you can practice to help reduce those overwhelming feelings. Have you ever tried any mindfulness or breathing exercises?

User: I haven’t really tried that before, but I’ve heard about it. It sounds like it could help.

Consultant: Mindfulness can be incredibly beneficial. How about we practice a simple breathing exercise together? It can be a good way to calm your mind and center yourself when you feel anxious.

User: I’m open to that. I’d love to give it a try.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s take a moment to focus on your breath. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a deep breath in through your nose... hold it for a moment... and then slowly exhale through your mouth. Let’s repeat this a few times. 

User: Okay, I’m doing it now. It feels nice to take a moment like this.

Consultant: That's great to hear! Focusing on your breath can create a sense of calm. How do you feel after doing this exercise?

User: I feel a bit more relaxed. I think this could help me when I start to feel overwhelmed with my choices.

Consultant: I’m glad it helped! Incorporating these techniques into your daily routine can provide you with a supportive tool for managing stress. Do you have thoughts on how to use this technique during challenging moments?

User: I could set reminders to take a few minutes to breathe deeply, especially when I feel anxious about my career decisions.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Creating those reminders can help you build a habit. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s review the progress you've made. You now have a goal to enhance your marketing skills, along with techniques to manage stress. How does that feel to you?

User: It feels empowering to have a plan in place. I'm excited to start working towards my goals.

Consultant: I’m really pleased to hear that! Remember, it’s a journey, and you’re taking valuable steps towards clarity and confidence. If you ever feel uncertain again, know that you can come back to these skills. I'm here to help!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. I’ll definitely reach out again if I need more help.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li Na! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress. Take care and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Li Na! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I think I've been feeling a bit lighter after practicing yoga and meditation. But I still feel like I need more stable ways to adjust my mind.

Consultant: That's great to hear that yoga and meditation have brought you some relief! It's understandable to want to find further stability in your mental health. Can you share what specific aspects of your emotional regulation you're looking to improve?

User: I think sometimes I still feel overwhelmed in social situations. I want to manage that pressure better and not feel so anxious about it.

Consultant: It sounds like you're seeking more confidence and calmness during social interactions. Let's explore what triggers those feelings of overwhelm. What thoughts typically arise in those moments?

User: Usually, I start to worry about what others think of me, and I get really anxious about making a mistake or saying something silly.

Consultant: That’s a common concern. It seems like you’re experiencing a lot of pressure from your thoughts about how others perceive you. How do these thoughts make you feel in those situations?

User: I feel a knot in my stomach and just want to escape. It feels so uncomfortable.

Consultant: I can understand how distressing that must be for you. It might help to recognize that those thoughts might not always reflect reality. Have you ever challenged those negative thoughts about yourself during social situations?

User: Not really. I just accept them and try to avoid the situation instead.

Consultant: Avoidance can be a tempting response, but it often reinforces those anxious thoughts. What if we explored a different approach? Maybe we could practice some techniques to help you face those situations with more confidence. Would you be open to that?

User: Yes, I would like to learn how to face it better. 

Consultant: Wonderful! One technique I recommend is mindfulness, which helps you focus on the present moment rather than getting lost in worries. Have you tried any mindfulness practices before?

User: I've done some mindfulness exercises during yoga, so I have a bit of experience with it.

Consultant: Excellent! Building on your existing experience, we can integrate mindfulness techniques into your daily life. For example, whenever you feel that knot in your stomach, you could take a moment to focus on your breath. Would you like to try a quick breathing exercise with me now?

User: Sure, I'm willing to try it.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start with a simple technique. Take a deep breath in through your nose… hold it for a moment… and then slowly exhale through your mouth. Let’s do this a few times together. How does that feel for you?

User: It feels calming. I can feel some tension releasing.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Practicing deep breathing can be a powerful tool to help you ground yourself during stressful moments. How do you think you can incorporate this technique into your routine?

User: I could practice it before social events or whenever I feel anxious during the day.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Consistency will make this technique more effective. Additionally, self-compassion is important. When those harsh thoughts about yourself arise, try treating yourself with the kindness you'd offer a good friend. How does that resonate with you?

User: I guess I often forget to be kind to myself. I tend to be my own worst critic.

Consultant: Many of us are. By practicing self-compassion, you'll create a space for self-acceptance. Could you think about one self-compassionate statement you could tell yourself when those critical thoughts appear?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that I'm doing my best.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful affirmation. Repeating that to yourself can help you combat those anxious thoughts. In what ways can you remind yourself of this affirmation when you need it most?

User: I could write it down and keep it with me, or maybe set reminders on my phone.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Visual reminders can help reinforce that positive message. As we near the end of our session today, what are some of the key takeaways that resonate with you?

User: I really liked the breathing technique and the idea of self-compassion. I feel like I have some useful tools now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It seems like you’re on a positive path to enhancing your emotional regulation. Remember, building these practices will take time, but you’re already making great strides. How do you plan to maintain the support network you've created through these sessions?

User: I think I’ll try to reach out to friends more and share like we discussed. It feels good to talk about these things.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Sharing your journey with friends can provide you with additional emotional support. As we wrap up, how do you feel about the progress you've made today?

User: I feel encouraged. I have a clearer idea of how to manage my feelings, and I'm excited to share more with friends.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Li Na! You've made significant progress in recognizing the importance of social support and emotional regulation. If you ever need help again, remember I’m just a session away. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Li Na! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. I think I've become more aware of how important my social support network is for my emotional well-being.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some positive progress in recognizing the value of your social connections. Can you share more about how you've been maintaining or deepening those relationships?

User: Well, I've been trying to reach out to friends more often, especially after our last conversation. I spend more time chatting with some close friends and sometimes even initiate plans for gatherings.

Consultant: That's a great step! Initiating plans can really strengthen those connections. How does it make you feel when you reach out to your friends and maintain those interactions?

User: It makes me feel happy and less anxious. I feel supported and more connected, and it seems to lighten my mood.

Consultant: It's fantastic that you're experiencing an uplift in your mood through these connections. Are there any specific moments or interactions that stand out to you as particularly supportive or helpful?

User: Yes! Just last week, I had a really great conversation with a friend about my feelings, and it felt good to be so open. She really listened and offered some encouragement.

Consultant: That sounds like a meaningful experience. Being open and feeling heard can indeed be very powerful. How do you think that conversation impacted your feelings going forward?

User: It reassured me that it's okay to share my feelings. I realized I don't have to handle everything alone, and that helps a lot.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing that you have support can be transformative. Now, do you think there are specific relationships in your network that you want to focus on strengthening further?

User: I think I want to strengthen my bond with that friend I talked to. I’d love to connect more regularly, maybe catch up monthly.

Consultant: That's a great goal! Setting a regular catch-up can help reinforce your connection. What kind of activities do you think you might enjoy doing together during those meet-ups?

User: We both love going to cafes and trying new places, so maybe we could make that a tradition!

Consultant: That sounds lovely! Regularly enjoying each other’s company can definitely solidify your bond. How do you think you'll feel once you've established this new routine with her?

User: I feel that it would give me something to look forward to and help me feel more grounded. 

Consultant: That's such a positive outlook! Looking forward to these moments can be uplifting. Now, are there any challenges you foresee in strengthening this relationship, or in reaching out to others?

User: I sometimes worry about being a burden to others or interrupting their lives, which makes me hesitant to reach out sometimes.

Consultant: It's normal to have those feelings, but remember, genuine friendships are built on mutual support. Your friend likely appreciates your company just as much. What could you say to yourself to counter those hesitant thoughts when they arise?

User: I could remind myself that friends want to support each other and that I also offer support. 

Consultant: That's a healthy and constructive way to think! Balancing giving and receiving support is key in relationships. How can we further foster this mindset for you? 

User: Maybe I can make a list of positive affirmations to remind myself of our mutual support?

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Writing down affirmations can serve as a helpful reminder. Would you like to brainstorm some affirmations together?

User: Sure! One could be, "My friends appreciate my presence, and it’s okay to reach out."

Consultant: That’s perfect! It captures both the importance of friendship and your right to seek support. Is there any other affirmation you would like to add?

User: Another could be, "It’s okay to lean on others when I need it, just as they lean on me."

Consultant: That’s very insightful. Both affirmations reinforce healthy relational dynamics. How do you feel about incorporating these affirmations into your routine?

User: I think writing them down and reading them regularly will help me internalize that mindset.

Consultant: Absolutely, it’ll serve as a great reminder for you. Now, as we look towards wrapping up our session, how do you feel about the progress you've made in maintaining your social support network? 

User: I feel really optimistic! I have a clearer approach to nurturing my relationships, and I’m excited to put it into action.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It's important to acknowledge your progress. Do you have any strategies in mind to deal with potential moments of doubt about reaching out to friends?

User: Yes, remembering my affirmations and focusing on the positive aspects of my connections will help.

Consultant: That’s a solid strategy! You’ve made great progress today, Li Na. As you continue to build these connections, remember that it’s okay to ask for support whenever you need it. 

User: Thank you! This session has been really helpful. I feel more confident in my ability to maintain my friendships.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! You've really done the work to recognize and strengthen your social network. If challenges arise, feel free to return. Wishing you all the best as you continue on this journey. 

User: Thank you so much! I will definitely take what I learned today with me.
