Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhu! It's great to see you today. I remember we discussed your feelings about the violent videos and the bullying you've experienced. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello. I still feel anxious, especially with the bullying happening again at school. It’s just like what happened in middle school. I’ve been feeling trapped and helpless.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds overwhelming to experience bullying again. Let’s focus on how this affects your feelings. Can you tell me more about your emotions when these situations arise?

User: I often feel really scared and alone. I have this urge to watch those violent videos, but it makes me feel guilty at the same time. It’s like I can’t stop myself, even though I know it’s not good for me.

Consultant: It seems like you’re torn between wanting to escape those feelings and knowing that watching those videos isn't helpful for you. Can we explore what thoughts come to your mind when you feel this urge to watch them?

User: I think about how helpless I am and how I want to feel something else, something stronger. Those videos make me feel alive, but I also hate myself afterward.

Consultant: That sounds like a tough cycle to be in—seeking comfort from something that ultimately leaves you feeling worse. Let’s take a closer look at those thoughts. When you think, “I’m helpless,” what other beliefs might be contributing to that feeling?

User: I keep thinking that no one likes me, and I’ll always be bullied. I feel like I’m destined to be alone.

Consultant: Those beliefs can be very heavy to carry. But let's consider this—are there moments when you felt connected with others, even just a little? 

User: Sometimes, but mostly during class when we’re working on group projects. But it’s brief, and I quickly go back to feeling scared.

Consultant: It’s a positive sign that there are moments of connection. Can we think about how you might build on those experiences in your daily life?

User: I guess I could try to talk to some class partners more often, but I really worry they won’t want to interact with me.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It takes courage to reach out. What if we try reframing that thought? Instead of thinking they won’t want to interact, how about considering that they might actually enjoy having you in their group?

User: I never thought about it like that. Maybe they do like working with me. 

Consultant: Absolutely! You have qualities that others appreciate. Let’s also think about some small, manageable ways for you to engage with your classmates more. What could you do this week?

User: Maybe I could start by asking a classmate how their weekend was or offering to help them with a project.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Small steps can make a big difference. How do you feel about setting that goal for this week?

User: I’m a bit nervous, but I also feel a little excited. It might help me feel less alone.

Consultant: Nervousness is completely normal! It’s a sign you’re stepping out of your comfort zone. If those feelings come up, remember to acknowledge them but also remind yourself that it’s okay to take these small steps.

User: I’ll try to remember that. Honestly, it feels empowering to think about it this way. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Empowerment comes from recognizing your strengths and taking positive steps. Let’s check in next session to see how those interactions went and how you’re feeling afterward.

User: Yes, I’d like that. I really want to feel better about my days at school.

Consultant: You’re doing great, Xiaozhu. It’s important to keep revisiting these feelings and thoughts. As for those urges to watch the videos, let’s create a list of alternative activities that can give you that sense of feeling alive but in a healthier way. 

User: That sounds good. I need something fun to focus on instead. 

Consultant: Exactly! What activities have you enjoyed in the past or thought about trying?

User: I used to like drawing and reading but haven’t done much of that lately. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful options! Incorporating drawing or reading into your routine could help channel your energy positively. How about setting aside some time for that this week?

User: I can commit to at least an hour of drawing or reading a few times this week. 

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Remember, it's all about making time for what brings you joy. Let’s also talk about how to manage those feelings if they arise while trying to replace the videos with these activities.

User: Right. I think I could identify those feelings as they come, maybe even jot them down when I feel an urge.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Writing down your feelings can help you process them without acting on the urge. It can serve as a moment to pause and reflect.

User: I feel like I'm gaining some control back, which is nice.

Consultant: You are indeed regaining control, and I’m proud of your effort! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you plan to do this week.

User: I’ll try talking to classmates more, spend time drawing or reading, and write down my feelings.

Consultant: Sounds like a great week ahead! We’ll check in on your progress next time. Remember, small steps can lead to big changes.

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about the coming week.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaozhu! Keep that hope alive, and we’ll continue to build on it together next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Little Zhu! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session? 

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling a lot of pressure lately. In class yesterday, some classmates made fun of me again. It really brought me down. I felt so isolated.

Consultant: I’m really sorry to hear that. It’s completely understandable to feel upset in such situations. Let’s talk about those feelings. What specifically went through your mind when they were making fun of you?

User: I felt like I was the odd one out, that they were laughing at me. I thought, “Why can’t I just fit in?” It made me doubt myself even more.

Consultant: It sounds really painful to feel that way. When you have those thoughts of not fitting in, what emotions arise for you?

User: I felt a mix of sadness and anger. I really wanted to hide and just disappear. Sometimes I think about how I might just end up alone.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Little Zhu. It sounds very tough to manage those feelings of sadness and anger. Let’s explore that thought of ending up alone. How often do you find yourself thinking this way?

User: It happens quite often, especially when I’m in social situations. I keep wondering if I’m just not meant to have friends.

Consultant: It seems like that thought has a significant impact on how you view yourself in social contexts. Can we examine how much evidence there is for that belief? What experiences might suggest that you're not meant to have friends?

User: Well, I've had some good moments, but they seem so rare. Mostly, I remember the times I’ve been bullied and the laughter directed at me.

Consultant: It's understandable to focus on the negative experiences, especially when they have left such a mark on you. But let’s look for some balancing evidence. Can you recall any moments when you connected positively with someone, even if they were small moments?

User: There were times when I talked to some classmates during group projects, and it felt nice. But those moments don’t last, and I often feel left out again afterward.

Consultant: Those moments are meaningful, Little Zhu, and it’s encouraging that you've had positive interactions. It’s great to acknowledge those experiences. How do you feel about possibly seeking out more situations like that? 

User: I’m not sure. I feel nervous about putting myself out there again. What if they ignore me or laugh at me?

Consultant: That fear is absolutely valid, especially considering what you've been through. But what if we could work together on some strategies to make those social interactions feel less intimidating? Would you be open to that?

User: I guess so. I want to feel more comfortable, but I'm afraid of rejection.

Consultant: It's a completely normal fear. Let’s develop some skills together to help you navigate those situations. For instance, how about practicing some small talk or role-playing different scenarios? 

User: That could be helpful. I really want to improve my communication skills.

Consultant: That's a great first step! Let’s start with a simple scenario. Imagine you’re in a lunchroom, and you see a classmate sitting alone. What would you say to start a conversation?

User: Maybe I could say, "Hi, can I sit here?" But I worry they might just ignore me.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! It shows confidence to approach them. Even if they don’t respond favorably, it doesn’t define your worth. We can keep practicing to build your confidence. How does that sound?

User: It sounds okay, I guess. But it still feels hard to imagine actually doing it.

Consultant: Absolutely, and those feelings are normal. Remember, every small step counts. We can also talk about what to do if someone does respond negatively. What’s important is to have a plan in place, so you feel more prepared.

User: Yes, having a plan would probably help ease my anxiety.

Consultant: Perfect! We can work on developing some responses for when things don’t go as hoped. It’s also good to remind yourself that social situations can improve over time. Would it help to set a small goal for the coming week?

User: I think so. Maybe I could practice saying hello to someone new in class?

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! Starting with a simple “hello” is a great way to ease into it. How do you feel about that goal?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also a little excited. It seems manageable.

Consultant: Nervousness is completely natural, but it’s encouraging that you feel a sense of excitement, too! Remember, each small interaction is a step toward building your confidence. 

User: I’ll definitely keep that in mind. I just hope I can stick to it.

Consultant: I believe you can. Remember, if things don’t go perfectly, it’s okay to learn from the experience. Growth takes time and practice. How about we check in on that goal next session?

User: That sounds good! I’ll try to practice and share what happens.

Consultant: Wonderful! I’m really looking forward to hearing about your experiences. Before we wrap up today, let’s review what we’ve worked on and the strategies you’re feeling ready to try.

User: We talked about recognizing my feelings and working on small, manageable goals. I feel a little more equipped to face social situations now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress, Little Zhu! It’s important to celebrate these small victories. Remember, self-compassion is key as you move forward. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the effort you’re making. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. I look forward to our next session. 

User: Me too! See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Zhu! I'm glad you could make it today. I remember from our last session that you're looking to build your resilience in social situations, especially regarding feelings of exclusion. How have you been since we last talked?

User: Hi! I've been trying to apply some of the methods we discussed, but I still feel pretty sensitive to the exclusion from my peers. I recently joined a study group, but I can't shake this feeling that they're not really interested in including me.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of discomfort from that situation. You hoped to connect with others but feel pushed aside instead. Can you share more about how that made you feel?

User: Yes, it's been really frustrating. I feel so anxious and self-doubting. Sometimes, I wonder if there's something wrong with me that makes them avoid me. 

Consultant: That's a tough place to be in, feeling like you might not fit in. It’s important to recognize those feelings of self-doubt when they arise. What thoughts are going through your mind when you perceive that exclusion?

User: I often think things like, "They don’t want me here" or "I’m just not good enough." It feels like I'm just reinforcing the idea that I’ll always be left out.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite powerful and difficult to challenge. Let's take a moment to examine them. How true do you think those thoughts are? Is there any evidence that suggests otherwise?

User: I guess I'm not always excluded. There have been times when they do include me in discussions, but I often forget those moments when I feel left out.

Consultant: It’s crucial to hold on to those positive experiences. When you feel excluded, your mind tends to focus only on the negatives. What if we worked on creating a more balanced view of your social interactions?

User: That sounds helpful. I’d like to shift my focus, but it’s hard in the moment.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Creating a balanced view takes practice. Let’s try a small exercise: when you feel that sense of exclusion, can you remind yourself of at least three times when you felt included? 

User: I can try that. It's just hard to remember in the heat of the moment.

Consultant: It will definitely take some reminders, but over time those memories can become stronger. Also, when you start to feel anxious, what coping strategies have you been using to manage those emotions?

User: I usually just try to distract myself with videos or scroll through social media, but I know I shouldn’t do that so often.

Consultant: Those distractions can be a temporary escape, but they don’t necessarily help your feelings. How about we explore some healthier alternatives for coping when you start feeling those negative emotions?

User: Sure, I could use some ideas. I really don’t want to return to those unhealthy habits.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! Some alternatives could be deep breathing exercises, journaling your thoughts, or engaging in a hobby that you enjoy. Would any of these resonate with you?

User: I like the idea of journaling. I’ve done it before, and it really helped me sort through my feelings.

Consultant: Perfect! Journaling can be an excellent tool for processing your emotions and reflecting on those positive social experiences. How about setting a goal to journal when you feel anxious about social situations?

User: That sounds doable. I think it might help clarify my thoughts. 

Consultant: Great! I believe this can create a habit that allows you to recognize and challenge those negative thoughts. Going back to your study group, have you noticed how your interactions change when you remind yourself of your strengths?

User: Sometimes I do feel more confident when I reflect on my good qualities, but it’s easy to forget in the moment.

Consultant: This awareness is a positive sign! We can work on integrating those moments of self-awareness into your routine. Before you interact with your study group, take a moment to acknowledge your strengths. What skills do you think you can bring to the group?

User: I’m good at explaining concepts. I think if I focus on that, it might help me feel more confident.

Consultant: That's a wonderful strength! Focusing on what you can contribute will not only help your confidence but also how you perceive those interactions. If you remind yourself of that before group activities, do you think it could decrease your anxiety?

User: Yes, that might actually help. I'm just scared I might still be excluded.

Consultant: It’s normal to have that fear, but remember that everyone experiences social nuances, and not everything reflects on you. Maybe we can also talk about how to initiate conversations within the group to better connect with them. What do you think?

User: I’d like that. Initiating conversations is something I struggle with.

Consultant: Let’s build some conversation starters together. Small open-ended questions about their studies or interests can be a good place to start. Would you be open to practicing some of these?

User: Yes, I think practicing might help me feel less anxious when approaching them.

Consultant: Excellent! We can role-play some scenarios, so you feel prepared. Additionally, let’s make sure to check in on your feelings regarding self-harm. How have you been managing those urges?

User: I still struggle with it sometimes. It's hard when I'm feeling really low after being excluded.

Consultant: I'm glad you brought that up, Xiao Zhu. It's vital to have alternative coping mechanisms. What strategies can you implement when you feel those urges come up?

User: I haven't thought about it. Maybe I could try to reach out to someone I trust.

Consultant: That's a powerful strategy! Connecting with someone can provide the support you need. Let’s identify a few people you trust so that when you feel triggered, you can reach out to them.

User: I have a couple of friends I could reach out to. I just need to remind myself to do it.

Consultant: Creating that reminder for yourself could be very beneficial. As we conclude today’s session, can you reflect on what you’ve learned and what actions you’ll take moving forward?

User: I think I’ll focus on journaling, practice my conversation starters, and remember to reach out to friends when I feel down. 

Consultant: Those are fantastic steps! You've made significant progress in recognizing your strengths and working through your feelings. Remember, it’s okay to reach out when you need support. I’m looking forward to hearing how things go in our next session!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance. I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Zhu! I believe in your ability to manage these challenges. Take care, and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Zhen! I'm glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better, especially after my classmates accepted me during our recent activity. But I still struggle with the thoughts of self-harm.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've felt more accepted by your classmates! That’s a positive change. Let’s explore a bit more about what feelings or thoughts come up when you think about self-harm. What goes through your mind during those moments?

User: Sometimes I feel overwhelmed, like everything is too much. I think about self-harm as a way to release those feelings, even if I know it's not good for me.

Consultant: I can understand why you might see self-harm as a release when things feel overwhelming. It sounds like these feelings can be quite intense for you. Can you identify what specific emotions you experience just before you have those thoughts of self-harm?

User: I usually feel really sad and hopeless, like nothing will ever change for me. It's like I'm in a dark place, and I don’t see any way out.

Consultant: Those feelings of sadness and hopelessness are very challenging to cope with. It’s important to recognize that they can influence your thoughts and actions. When you experience these emotions, do you find any other ways to cope or distract yourself?

User: Not really. Sometimes I just want to escape into those violent videos. It feels like an easy way out.

Consultant: Seeking an escape can be a natural response to feeling overwhelmed. However, it sounds like these videos may not be helping you in the long term. Can we explore some healthier alternatives together that might provide a similar sense of release?

User: I guess we could try. I just don’t know what else to do besides watching those videos.

Consultant: That’s okay! It’s a good start that you’re open to exploring alternatives. Perhaps we could think of creative activities, like writing or drawing, that could help express those feelings without harm. How do you feel about trying something like that?

User: I like the idea of writing. I used to enjoy journaling but stopped for some reason.

Consultant: Journaling can be a wonderful way to process your emotions. It allows you to express what you’re feeling without judgment. What do you think would motivate you to start journaling again?

User: Maybe if I set some small goals for myself, like just writing a few sentences each day…

Consultant: That sounds like a practical approach! Setting small, achievable goals can really help you build up the habit. What kind of themes or topics do you think you might want to write about?

User: I think I’d want to write about my feelings, like when I'm sad or anxious. It might help me understand myself better.

Consultant: Absolutely! Understanding your feelings is key. As you start this journaling practice, what do you think you might do when those overwhelming feelings arise before you decide to self-harm?

User: I could try to write it down instead of just thinking about it. That might help me see things more clearly.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Writing can help externalize those thoughts and emotions, making them less daunting. How do you feel about trying this for the next week and seeing how it goes?

User: I think I can do that! I’ll give it a shot.

Consultant: That's great to hear, Zhen! Remember to be gentle with yourself during this process. It’s all about progress, not perfection. Is there anything else you’d like to talk about today?

User: I’m just worried that I might slip back into my old habits. 

Consultant: It’s completely natural to worry about that. What can we do to prepare you for those moments? Perhaps we can brainstorm some quick coping strategies or reminders you can keep nearby?

User: Maybe I could have some notes or reminders on my phone to read when I feel those urges.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Having reminders easily accessible can make a big difference. What kind of messages do you think would help you the most during those stressful times?

User: I think reminders that I am not alone and that I can express my feelings in a healthier way would be helpful.

Consultant: That's a powerful reminder. Knowing you're not alone can alleviate some of the pressure you might feel. Let’s also add some affirmations, like “I choose healthier ways to cope,” or “It’s okay to feel my emotions.” How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. Having positive words like that might help me feel supported.

Consultant: I’m glad you think so! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ve agreed to try this week. You’ll start journaling your feelings, use coping strategies when overwhelmed, and create reminders on your phone. How does that feel to you?

User: I feel like I have a plan! I hope it helps me.

Consultant: It definitely sounds like a solid plan, Zhen! You’ve taken some meaningful steps toward better understanding and managing your feelings. I’m proud of your willingness to explore this. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You're very welcome. We'll continue to work together on this journey. Remember, it’s okay to reach out if you need to talk before our next session. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhu! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better. I've been spending more time on my drawing, and it feels great to express myself that way.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Engaging in activities you enjoy can really help improve your mood. Can you tell me more about your experience with drawing lately?

User: I've started experimenting with different styles and techniques. It's exciting to see how my ideas come to life on paper. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic way to express yourself and explore your creativity! How does drawing make you feel emotionally when you're engaged in it?

User: I feel relaxed and happy. It distracts me from my negative thoughts, which is something I really appreciate.

Consultant: It's great that drawing helps you find a sense of relaxation and happiness. Do you find that you’re able to identify those negative thoughts more easily when you’re drawing?

User: Yes, when I’m drawing, I can push those thoughts away for a while. It's like I enter a different world.

Consultant: That's a powerful discovery, Xiaozhu. Immersing yourself in drawing can indeed provide a mental escape. Have you noticed any specific thoughts or feelings that arise when you're not drawing?

User: Sometimes I still get caught up in worries or feel overwhelmed. It's hard to manage those feelings when I'm not being creative.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those feelings, especially after experiencing challenges in the past. Let's explore some strategies to help you manage those emotions better even when you’re not drawing. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I want to learn how to deal with those feelings without relying on my drawing.

Consultant: Absolutely! One useful technique we can try is keeping a feelings journal. You can write down your emotions, thoughts, and any triggers you notice. How do you feel about starting a journaling practice?

User: I think that could be helpful. Writing things down might help me see everything more clearly.

Consultant: Exactly! It can serve as a great way to process your thoughts. We can even create a structure for it together. What specific emotions do you find yourself feeling most often?

User: I often feel anxious and sad, especially when I think about school or my friendships.

Consultant: Those are important feelings to recognize. In your journal, you can note times when you feel anxious or sad, and then explore what thoughts or situations contributed to those feelings. Would you like to give it a try this week?

User: Yes, I’d like that! I’ll try to note down my feelings when they come up.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Xiaozhu! Remember, it’s a way for you to understand and challenge those feelings. Once you get comfortable with it, we can look at how your thoughts might be contributing to those emotions. 

User: I like the idea of challenging my thoughts. It sounds empowering!

Consultant: It certainly can be! And as you become more aware of your thoughts, you can begin to challenge them. When you feel anxious, ask yourself if there is a different way to look at the situation. Can you think of any recent situations where your negative thoughts might have affected you?

User: I remember feeling really anxious before a group project at school. I thought everyone would judge my work.

Consultant: That’s a classic example! Let’s challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that your work would be judged negatively? Are there points that counter that idea?

User: I guess I usually get positive feedback from teachers. Maybe my worries are exaggerated.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s fantastic that you can recognize that. When you find yourself thinking negatively, recalling those positive experiences can help shift your perspective.

User: I’ll try to do that the next time I feel anxious!

Consultant: Great! Additionally, when you're feeling anxious, practicing deep breathing techniques can also be helpful. This can calm your mind and make it easier to challenge those thoughts. Would you like a quick strategy for that?

User: Yes, I’d love to learn some breathing techniques!

Consultant: A simple technique is to take a deep breath in for three counts, hold it for three, and then exhale for six. This can help slow down your heart rate and make you feel more relaxed. How do you feel about trying that when you need it?

User: That seems easy enough! I’ll give it a shot.

Consultant: Awesome! Remember, it’s about finding what works best for you. As you practice both journaling and breathing techniques, you’ll start to notice how your emotions change over time. 

User: I’m excited about this! I think it will help me a lot.

Consultant: I believe so too! We’ll review your experiences in our next session and see how it’s helped you. Just keep in mind that progress takes time, and it’s okay to have ups and downs.

User: Thank you for reassuring me. That makes me feel better about it.

Consultant: You’re doing great, Xiaozhu. I'm proud of your willingness to explore new strategies. As we wrap up, what is one key takeaway you’ll bring from today’s session?

User: I think my main takeaway is to start journaling and using breathing techniques when I feel anxious.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway! Remember, you’re taking positive steps towards managing your emotions. I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. 

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to it as well.

Consultant: Until we meet again, take care, Xiaozhu! You’ve got this!
###################
Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you again! How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing pretty well, actually. I feel much more confident since I did well in the art competition. It's amazing how much that has helped me!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like the competition really boosted your self-esteem. Can you tell me more about how that experience has impacted your daily life?

User: Sure! I feel like I'm part of the group now, and my classmates seem more friendly. I’m finding it easier to interact with them, which used to be really tough for me.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! It seems that your sense of belonging has grown. With these improvements in your social interactions, what about your feelings of anxiety or any other challenges you've faced in the past?

User: Honestly, I still think about those things sometimes, but they don’t control me like they used to. I still have moments where I feel a bit overwhelmed, but I can manage it better.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize your progress. Feeling overwhelmed occasionally is completely normal, especially with changes happening in your life. How do you typically cope when those feelings arise?

User: I try to distract myself with art or music, and sometimes I just take deep breaths to calm down. It helps me a lot.

Consultant: Those are effective strategies! Using creative outlets and breathing techniques can be very grounding. It also sounds like you’ve developed a good toolkit for managing those overwhelming feelings. Are there any specific situations lately where you felt those feelings creeping back in?

User: Yes, there was a moment last week when I had to give a presentation in class. I felt anxious remembering how I used to struggle with public speaking, but I managed to get through it.

Consultant: That’s a big accomplishment! Presenting can trigger anxiety for many people. How did you feel before and after the presentation?

User: Before, I was really nervous and kept overthinking what could go wrong. But after it was done, I felt really relieved and proud of myself. 

Consultant: It sounds like you turned a potentially anxiety-inducing situation into one that you felt proud of. That’s a huge win! What do you think helped you get through it in the moment?

User: I think reminding myself about my art success helped. I told myself that I could do this too, just like I did with my artwork.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic way to draw confidence from your past successes! It highlights a strong connection between your mindset and performance. How do you feel about applying that same mindset to future situations that may make you anxious?

User: I think it’s a good idea. I should keep reminding myself of what I’ve achieved and practice positive self-talk.

Consultant: Exactly! Positive self-talk can be a powerful tool. Would you like to explore some ways to reinforce that mindset as you continue to face new challenges?

User: Yes, I’d love that! I want to keep improving and not fall back into negative thinking patterns.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal. We can consider setting realistic challenges for you to face and work through together. As you succeed, you’ll strengthen your confidence. Does that sound good?

User: Yes, definitely! I feel excited to try new challenges and see how far I can go.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s also discuss how to maintain the positive habits you’ve built so far. What strategies can you incorporate into your daily routine to continue supporting your mental health?

User: I think I need to set aside time for art and maybe try to engage more with my classmates. That would help.

Consultant: Engaging with art and your peers can greatly contribute to your well-being. It keeps you connected and joyful. How about we set a goal for the upcoming week related to these activities?

User: That sounds perfect. Maybe I can aim to create one piece of art and reach out to a classmate about hanging out?

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! By taking these steps, you’ll reinforce your connections and creative expression. As we wrap up today, what would you consider your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I realized how much I've improved and that I can keep building on my successes instead of focusing on the past. That feels powerful.

Consultant: It is powerful, indeed! Remember, you have the ability to continue growing and thriving. If you ever need support or guidance as you move forward, you know where to find me.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of the progress you've made. Until our next session, take care, and keep believing in yourself!
