Consultant: Hello, Xiao Tang! I'm glad you could join me today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been thinking a lot about the recent mental health test at school. It made me realize that I might have some psychological issues. I feel confused about my relationships with others and insecure about myself.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. It sounds like the test has prompted you to reflect on your feelings and relationships. What specific thoughts or feelings have come up for you regarding your social interactions?

User: I've been feeling really anxious when I think about talking to others. I often worry that I won't say the right thing or that they'll judge me harshly. It makes me want to avoid social situations.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiao Tang. It's understandable to feel anxious in those situations. Can you tell me more about how these worries affect you when you're in social settings or when you think about them?

User: Well, when I'm about to meet someone, I get really nervous and my mind starts racing. I think about all the ways I could mess up a conversation. It's like I'm trapped in my head.

Consultant: It seems like those thoughts are quite overwhelming for you. What kind of thoughts run through your mind just before you meet someone or during those interactions?

User: I often think they will think I'm awkward or not interesting. I also worry that if I say something wrong, they’ll laugh at me or lose interest.

Consultant: Those are very common thoughts to have. Let's explore them a bit. How much evidence do you have that people actually think that way about you? Is there another perspective you could consider?

User: I don't really have concrete evidence, but that fear feels so real to me. It’s just hard to shake off those thoughts.

Consultant: I understand. Those feelings can be very powerful. Can you think of a time when someone didn’t react negatively, even if you felt anxious? What was that experience like for you?

User: There was this one time I had a group project and we had to discuss our ideas. I was really scared, but everyone seemed fine with my contributions, even if I felt awkward.

Consultant: That’s a great example, Xiao Tang! It shows that your contributions were valued, even when you felt anxious. How might you reframe your thinking next time you find yourself in a similar situation?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it’s okay to be uncertain and that others might not judge me as harshly as I think.

Consultant: That’s an excellent insight! It’s crucial to acknowledge that others aren’t as focused on our perceived flaws as we might be. How do you feel about practicing this new way of thinking in future social interactions?

User: It sounds good, but I still feel nervous about how I will actually perform in those situations. What if I still mess up?

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about performance. Remember, even if mistakes happen, they are part of learning and growing. How could you approach a social situation with more curiosity rather than fear of judgment?

User: I guess I could remind myself to listen more and focus on the conversation instead of worrying about myself. That might help me feel less pressured.

Consultant: Absolutely! Engaging in the conversation can help shift your focus away from your anxiety. What’s one small step you might take this week to practice engaging more with others?

User: Maybe I could join a study group or talk to someone in class. That feels a bit less overwhelming than trying to make a new friend right away.

Consultant: Joining a study group sounds like a wonderful idea! It offers a natural context to interact with others without the pressure of personal relationships. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit excited about it, but also nervous. I just hope I don't disappoint anyone.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel both excited and anxious about new experiences. Remember, the goal is to simply engage, not to be perfect. What might help you remind yourself of this during the group?

User: I could write a note to myself about just being myself and that it’s okay to be nervous because it means I care about the interaction.

Consultant: That's a fantastic strategy! Keeping that positive reminder with you can help ease your nerves. How does the idea of using this note make you feel about the upcoming group?

User: It gives me a bit of comfort. I think I can do it. Just a little unsure about how it will actually go.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel unsure, but it sounds like you are prepared to give it a try. That’s a big step! Looking ahead, what would you like to gain from this experience?

User: I want to feel a bit more confident about talking to people, and maybe even enjoy it instead of just getting through it.

Consultant: That's a wonderful goal, Xiao Tang. Focusing on enjoyment can really shift your experience. As we wrap up today, what are two things you'll take away from our conversation that you can apply in your next social situation?

User: I’ll remember to focus on listening and to use my note to remind myself that it’s okay to be nervous. 

Consultant: Excellent takeaways! I'm proud of your progress today. Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s okay to take small steps. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed again, we’ll revisit these strategies together. 

User: Thank you so much. This has really helped me see things differently.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xiao Tang! I’m glad you found it helpful. We’ll talk again soon, and I’m here for you whenever you need support. Good luck with your group!

User: Thanks! I’ll do my best.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaotang! I’m glad to have you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really anxious about getting involved in social activities. I recently attended a club event, and although it was a challenge for me, I felt so nervous during it.

Consultant: It sounds like that event brought up a lot of mixed feelings for you—excitement about the opportunity, but also anxiety. What were some specific thoughts that crossed your mind while you were there?

User: I kept worrying about what others thought of me. I was afraid I would say something embarrassing or just freeze up and not be able to talk at all.

Consultant: I see. It’s natural to feel anxious about how we’re perceived by others, especially in new social situations. Can you recall any specific moments when those thoughts were particularly strong?

User: Yes, when I was supposed to introduce myself to the group, I panicked. I thought everyone was judging me, and it made me hesitate so much that I almost didn't say anything.

Consultant: That must have been really tough for you. It sounds like the fear of judgment affected your ability to express yourself. What emotions did you feel during that moment of hesitation?

User: I felt really embarrassed and frustrated with myself. I wanted to participate but felt paralyzed by my anxiety.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way when you’re in a high-pressure situation. Let’s think about those moments of panic. Do you notice any patterns in the thoughts that go through your mind when you start to feel anxious in social settings?

User: I often think that I’m going to mess up or that people will think I’m silly. It feels like I can’t speak without sounding awkward.

Consultant: You mentioned feeling silly or awkward. How true do you think those thoughts really are? Can you think of evidence that might contradict those thoughts?

User: Sometimes I see others make mistakes and laugh it off, and I wonder why I can't do that too. Maybe it's not as big a deal as I make it out to be.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s a great realization that everyone makes mistakes and can laugh about them. If a friend were in your position, what advice would you give them about relaxing and being themselves?

User: I would tell them that it’s okay to be nervous and that others probably understand. They should just try to enjoy the moment instead of worrying too much.

Consultant: That’s wise advice! Now, let’s explore how you could apply that same advice to yourself in future situations. What specific steps can you take to enjoy social interactions more and ease that anxiety?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that it’s okay to be nervous and focus on just talking with one or two people instead of the whole group.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Starting with small interactions could make it less overwhelming. How do you think you can create opportunities for those smaller conversations?

User: Perhaps I can join study groups or activities where there are fewer people, so it feels less intimidating.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Smaller settings can provide a more comfortable environment for interaction. What feelings do you think might arise for you when you try out these suggestions?

User: I think I might still feel some anxiety, but maybe it won’t be as intense since I would be talking to fewer people.

Consultant: That’s a realistic perspective. Feeling a bit anxious is completely normal. Remember, it’s also about taking small steps. Can we set a goal for you to try one of these smaller social interactions this week?

User: Yes, I’ll definitely try to engage in a study group and focus on chatting with just one or two classmates.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid goal! What strategies can you use if you feel that anxiety creeping back in during the conversation?

User: I could take deep breaths to calm myself and remind myself that it’s okay to be myself and that others are likely not judging me as harshly as I think.

Consultant: Perfect! Deep breathing and positive reminders can be powerful tools to help you remain calm. Let’s talk more about how you could keep track of these experiences after you try them. How do you feel about journaling your thoughts and feelings about these social interactions?

User: Journaling sounds helpful. I like the idea of reviewing my experiences and seeing how they go, even if they’re not perfect.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflecting on your experiences can help reinforce your progress and reveal patterns in your thoughts and feelings. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ve learned and how you plan to apply it.

User: I've learned that it’s okay to be nervous and that I can take small steps to engage socially, starting with study groups. I’ll use deep breathing and remind myself not to focus too much on what others think.

Consultant: That’s an excellent summary, Xiaotang! You have a solid plan in place, and I’m confident that you can take these steps to build your confidence in social situations. Remember, progress takes time. I’m here to support you along the way.

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about trying new social experiences now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Just take it one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support. I wish you a great week ahead, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session.

User: Thanks again! I’m looking forward to it too.

Consultant: Take care, Xiaotang! See you next time.

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Tang! I'm glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been okay, I guess. I'm still trying to participate more in the dorm activities, but I still feel really shy and anxious when it comes to talking to others.

Consultant: It sounds like you're still facing some challenges in social situations, although you want to connect with others. Can you share more about what specifically makes you feel shy or anxious during these interactions?

User: Well, when there's a group of people, I just feel overwhelmed. I worry that I might say something silly or that they might not like me. So, I often just stay quiet.

Consultant: That feeling of pressure can be really tough to handle, especially when all you want is to engage with others. It sounds like you're experiencing some negative thoughts about your social interactions. What thoughts go through your mind when you're in those situations?

User: I often think that I'll embarrass myself or that people will judge me. Sometimes, I just wish I could be more confident like my friends.

Consultant: It's natural to compare yourself to others and feel that way. But let’s take a moment to explore the evidence behind those thoughts. How likely do you think it is that people are actually judging you or thinking negatively when you participate?

User: I don't know... maybe not that likely? I guess I just assume they might think I'm weird or not interesting.

Consultant: It sounds like you might be jumping to conclusions without solid evidence. If a friend of yours was in a similar situation, what would you tell them about their fears of being judged?

User: I would probably tell them not to worry too much about what others think and just be themselves.

Consultant: That's a wise perspective! It seems like you already have kind and encouraging thoughts that you can use towards yourself as well. How can we work together to create a more positive self-dialogue that reinforces your confidence during those moments?

User: I guess I could try reminding myself that I might not be as judged as I think and focus on just having fun instead.

Consultant: That's a great start! Focusing on enjoyment rather than worrying about judgment can help shift your mindset. How about we make a plan where you can gradually challenge yourself in your dorm activities, allowing yourself to practice that positive self-talk?

User: Yeah, I’m open to that. I really want to feel more at ease around people.

Consultant: Fantastic! How about starting with a small step, like initiating a conversation with one person during your next group activity? What thoughts can you remind yourself of to stay calm and positive in that moment?

User: I could tell myself that it's okay to be nervous and that everyone is just trying to have a good time. I’ll also remind myself that I've successfully talked to people before, even if it was tough.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on those positive reminders can really help ease some of the pressure. Can you think of any specific dorm activities coming up where you could try this out?

User: There’s a movie night this weekend. Maybe I could sit with someone and start a chat about the film.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! Remember, it’s okay to take it slowly. If you start feeling anxious, just pause and use those positive thoughts we talked about. How do you feel about this plan?

User: It actually makes me feel a bit more hopeful. I really want to give it a try.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It's a positive step forward. Remember, progress takes time, and each small effort counts. After the movie night, we can discuss how it went and any feelings that came up.

User: That sounds good. I’ll try to be less hard on myself.

Consultant: That's an excellent mindset to have! Creating a supportive approach towards yourself will make a significant difference. In the meantime, how about practicing some positive affirmations you can say to yourself each day to build that confidence?

User: I never really thought about that. What kind of affirmations would work?

Consultant: You could use simple statements like, "I am capable of making new friends," or "My thoughts don’t define my worth." Choose phrases that resonate with you personally. What would you like to try?

User: I think I like “I can connect with others” and “It’s okay to feel nervous.” They feel relatable.

Consultant: Those are excellent choices! Repeating affirmations like these can help reinforce a positive self-view. Let's touch base after your movie night, but remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process.

User: Thank you! I’ll keep working on it all.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xiao Tang! I'm looking forward to hearing about your experience. You've already taken a big step by talking about it. See you next time!

User: See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaotang! I'm glad you're here for this session. How are you feeling today after your recent classroom experience?

User: Hi. I'm feeling a bit excited but also nervous. Speaking up in class went well, but I still feel kind of anxious about participating more.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. It’s great to hear that you got positive feedback from your peers and teachers. What do you think this experience has taught you about your abilities?

User: I guess it showed me that I can actually speak in front of others and that my thoughts are valuable. But I still doubt whether I can do it again or in other situations.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re starting to recognize your potential, which is fantastic! What do you think it would mean for you to feel more confident in these situations going forward?

User: I think it would make me more willing to participate in group activities and maybe even lead some discussions. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! Let's explore what small steps you might take to gradually build that confidence. Can you think of a specific scenario where you’d like to participate more actively?

User: Maybe in group projects. I tend to stay quiet and let others take charge. I'd like to voice my ideas more.

Consultant: Group projects are a great opportunity! How do you usually feel when you’re in those group settings?

User: I often feel worried that my ideas won't be good enough or that I'll be judged. So, I end up not saying anything.

Consultant: It’s common to feel anxious about judgment in group settings. Let’s try to identify some of those negative thoughts. What specific thoughts go through your mind in those moments?

User: I often think, "What if they don't like what I say?" or "They won't care about my opinion."

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite discouraging. How do those thoughts make you feel when you’re about to speak up?

User: They make me really nervous and want to just fade into the background.

Consultant: That makes sense. Acknowledging those feelings is an important first step. Now, let’s challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts those negative beliefs?

User: Well, after I spoke in class, my classmates actually complimented me. But I keep holding onto the fear of the next time not going well.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that feedback! That suggests that your contributions can be valuable. How about reframing your thoughts? Instead of focusing on the fear of judgment, what if you thought, “I have something to contribute, and it’s okay if others disagree”?

User: That sounds reasonable. I guess thinking that way might make it easier to speak up.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s all about shifting your perspective. What small goal can you set for yourself in your next group project that aligns with this new way of thinking?

User: Maybe I could aim to share at least one idea in the meeting and see how it goes.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Sharing one idea is a manageable step. After the meeting, how would you evaluate your experience?

User: I could reflect on how it felt to share and what the reactions were, regardless of how it goes. 

Consultant: Great plan! Reflection can help you reinforce positive experiences. How do you feel about approaching your next group project with this mindset?

User: I feel a bit more confident just thinking about it. I like that I can focus on the process instead of just the outcome.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! Remember, every small step counts. Let’s also consider ways to engage with your classmates outside of group projects. What activities do you enjoy?

User: I like playing soccer and hanging out at the park with friends. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful activities! How about setting a goal to join in a casual game of soccer with classmates or inviting friends to the park? 

User: Yeah, I can ask my classmates to join a game. That feels less pressure than speaking in class.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s a great way to build connections in a low-pressure setting. How do you feel about that idea?

User: I feel good about it! I think it’ll help me get to know them better and feel more comfortable.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Establishing those relationships can boost your confidence across different situations. Before we wrap up, what’s one thing you want to remember from today’s conversation?

User: I want to remember that I can start small and that my voice matters. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway, Xiaotang! As you move forward, keep validating your experiences and remember that each step helps you grow. If you ever feel stuck, we can keep working on these strategies together.

User: Thank you! That really helps me feel more prepared moving forward.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You’ve made some wonderful progress today. Continue to believe in yourself, and I’m here if you need support in the future. 

User: I appreciate it. I’m looking forward to trying out these ideas. 

Consultant: I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Keep up the great work, and take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaotang! I'm really happy to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. I participated in a group project recently, and it was nice to be praised by my teammates. It really boosted my confidence.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like that experience gave you a great sense of accomplishment. What other feelings or thoughts have come up for you since then?

User: I've been thinking that maybe I should try to engage more with my classmates. I want to overcome my shyness and participate in more group activities.

Consultant: It's great that you want to take that step! Engaging more with your peers can really enhance your college experience. What specific activities are you considering to get involved in?

User: I've been thinking about joining a club or a study group. I feel like it could help me connect with others better.

Consultant: Joining a club or a study group sounds like a fantastic idea! Have you thought about which clubs or groups you might be interested in?

User: I’m not sure yet. There are several options, but I don't know which one would suit me best. I'm worried I might not fit in.

Consultant: That’s a common concern. Let’s explore this together. What does "fitting in" mean to you, and what aspects are you most concerned about?

User: I guess I'm worried that I might not have anything interesting to contribute or that I might feel out of place.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way. Let’s talk about your strengths. What do you believe you can bring to a group or club?

User: I think I can be a good listener, and I’m quite dedicated when I commit to something. 

Consultant: Those are valuable qualities! Being a good listener can really enhance group dynamics. How do you think these strengths could help you in a new group setting?

User: I think if I listen well, I could understand others better, and maybe that would help me feel more involved.

Consultant: Absolutely! Listening creates a connection with others and fosters a supportive environment. Let’s think about small steps you can take to start engaging with peers. What would be a comfortable first step for you?

User: Maybe I could start by talking to someone in my class that I don't know well. Just a casual conversation.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Casual conversations can help break the ice. What topics do you think you could chat about?

User: I could ask about class assignments or see if they want to form a study group. 

Consultant: Those are perfect conversation starters! How do you feel about taking that step in the next week?

User: I actually feel quite motivated to do it. It doesn’t sound too difficult.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Feeling motivated is key. As you prepare for this interaction, how can you remind yourself of the strengths you have?

User: I could write them down and keep them in my notebook. That way I can look at them if I start to feel anxious.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Writing them down will serve as a great reminder of your abilities. How about after the conversation, we do a reflection in our next session? 

User: Yes, that sounds good! I can share how it went and how I felt afterward.

Consultant: Perfect! I'm looking forward to hearing about your experience. Remember, it’s all about taking those small steps. How are you feeling about this plan overall?

User: I feel more confident about going for it now. I think this could lead to more opportunities.

Consultant: That’s the spirit, Xiaotang! Embracing those opportunities will help you grow even more. Let’s summarize what we discussed today. You’re planning to initiate a casual conversation with a classmate about school-related topics and reflect on the experience afterward. Does that capture it?

User: Yes, that covers everything!

Consultant: Amazing! I believe in your ability to connect with others. Keep reminding yourself of your strengths, and don’t hesitate to reach out when you need support. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’ve enjoyed our session today and look forward to seeing how you progress. Remember, you're doing great. Until next time, take care! 

User: Thanks! I will. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiao Tang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good. I got recognized as an excellent student at the semester summary meeting, and my parents were so happy about it. It made me feel good about myself.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made some significant progress, and it’s great that your parents are supportive. What does this recognition mean to you in terms of your studies and relationships?

User: It makes me feel more confident about my studies, and I think it also helps me feel more connected to others. I want to keep this positive momentum going.

Consultant: Absolutely, maintaining that positive momentum is key. What specific things do you think you can do to sustain this confidence moving forward?

User: I think I can keep focusing on my studies and maybe reach out more to my classmates. I used to be shy, but I feel like I should open up a bit more.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Engaging more with classmates can help build connections. Can you describe how you feel when you think about reaching out to them?

User: I feel a bit anxious, to be honest. What if they don't want to talk to me? But I also feel excited about the possibility of making new friends.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious about that! It’s a step outside your comfort zone, which can be challenging. Let’s explore that thought—what evidence do you have to support the idea that they wouldn’t want to talk to you?

User: Well, sometimes I saw them talking in groups, and I felt left out. I guess I just assume they don’t want me around.

Consultant: That’s a common thought, but let’s challenge it a bit. If a friend of yours felt left out, what would you tell them about that assumption?

User: I would probably tell them that it's possible they just didn’t notice them or that they could find a way to join in.

Consultant: Exactly! So perhaps there’s a possibility that your classmates might appreciate your approach, too. What would be a small step you could take to reach out to them?

User: Maybe I could just say hi to a couple of them in class or during breaks. That doesn’t seem too scary.

Consultant: That sounds like a great starting point! Small steps can lead to bigger changes. How do you feel about trying that this week?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also determined. I really want to push myself to be more social.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous; it’s part of the process. Reflecting on this experience can help you grow. What strategies can you use to cope with any anxiety you might feel before reaching out?

User: I could remind myself that it’s just a casual conversation and that it's okay if things don’t go perfectly. Maybe breathing exercises would help too.

Consultant: Great ideas! Breathing exercises can help calm your nerves, and keeping a positive perspective can make a difference. As you attempt to reach out, how will you keep track of your feelings and any progress?

User: I could keep a small journal to jot down my thoughts and feelings about these interactions. 

Consultant: That's an excellent strategy! Reflecting in a journal can help you recognize your progress and any patterns in your thoughts or feelings. When we meet next, we can discuss what you’ve learned from this approach. Does that sound good?

User: Yes, that sounds perfect! I’m really looking forward to it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiao Tang! Before we wrap up today, is there anything else you'd like to discuss or reflect on regarding your journey so far?

User: I think we covered a lot! I just want to make sure I stay consistent with my goals.

Consultant: Consistency is key, and you're already showing a lot of commitment. Just remember to be kind to yourself as you embark on these new experiences. How do you feel about everything we’ve talked about today?

User: I feel optimistic! I’m excited about the changes I’m planning to make.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Keep that momentum going. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. You've got this!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Tang. Have a great week ahead, and I’ll see you next time!
