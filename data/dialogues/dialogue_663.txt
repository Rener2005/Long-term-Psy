Consultant: Hello Yuehui! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling lately, especially regarding your upcoming exam?

User: Hi! I've been really anxious and scared. The pressure of the vocational exam is overwhelming, and I feel like if I fail, I won't be able to get my high school diploma. It just makes me feel really hopeless.

Consultant: I can see how much pressure you're under, and it's understandable to feel this way. Let's explore this a little deeper. What are some thoughts that go through your mind when you think about the exam?

User: I keep thinking that I'm just not cut out for studying, and that I’ll definitely fail. I feel like all my friends are doing better than me, and I’m just wasting my time.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling quite defeated right now, comparing yourself to others. Let’s take a closer look at those thoughts. When you say you’re "not cut out for studying," how does that belief make you feel?

User: It makes me feel really low and like I have no hope. I just feel like giving up, especially since I've been struggling with theory subjects.

Consultant: Feeling hopeless is really tough, and it's okay to acknowledge that. However, I'm curious—can you think of moments in your cooking practice where you felt confident or skilled?

User: Yeah, actually! I do feel good when I’m cooking. I’ve received compliments before, and I know I do well in the practical part.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It seems that you have a talent for practical tasks. How do those positive experiences in cooking relate to your ability to study theory? 

User: I guess I never thought about it that way. I just focus on how bad I am at theory and forget that I'm actually good at cooking.

Consultant: Exactly! Sometimes our minds get caught up in negative thoughts, overshadowing our strengths. So, let’s challenge that thought: What evidence do you have that you can succeed in your studies, even in subjects you find difficult?

User: I suppose I could try harder... I mean, I did manage to get through some practical assessments just fine.

Consultant: Yes! And those practical assessments are evidence of your capability. If you could approach your theory studies in a similar step-by-step manner, how might that change your outlook?

User: That could work. Maybe I can break it down, instead of trying to learn everything at once.

Consultant: That’s a good idea! Setting smaller, manageable goals could help. What small goal can you set for yourself this week regarding your theory study?

User: I think I could start by reviewing just one chapter each day instead of trying to cover everything before the exam.

Consultant: That sounds like a very achievable goal! And remember, it’s okay to progress at your own pace. How do you feel about starting this plan?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful about it. It seems more doable.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Now, let’s talk about how to keep the motivation up. What activities or incentives can you add to your routine after completing your study goals?

User: Maybe I could reward myself with some gaming time after I finish my chapter.

Consultant: That sounds like a balanced way to combine work and fun! How might this new routine help you view your studies differently?

User: Maybe I won’t see studying as a chore, but as something I can manage piece by piece. It feels less overwhelming.

Consultant: Exactly! By shifting your perspective, you can start to reclaim a bit of joy in your learning process. What other strategies can you think of to keep positive momentum going in your studies?

User: I could also ask my friends to study together. That way we can help each other out.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Collaborative study can make a big difference and help you feel less isolated in your challenges. How does that make you feel about reaching out to them?

User: It makes me feel less alone. I might be able to understand things better if we study together.

Consultant: Absolutely! It sounds like you’re beginning to build a support network. As we wrap up today, can you summarize some of the progress you've made and the strategies you've chosen to implement?

User: Sure! I've realized I have strengths in cooking, which I can relate to my studies. I plan to review one chapter each day and reward myself with gaming after. Plus, I’ll reach out to friends for group study.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Yuehui! I'm really proud of you for recognizing your strengths and developing these strategies. Remember, it’s normal to have doubts, but you’re capable of more than you realize. Don’t hesitate to come back if you need more support.

User: Thank you so much! I feel more encouraged now to tackle my studies.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care, Yuehui!

Consultant: Hello, Yuehui! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’ve been feeling a bit lost. I discovered that I really enjoy cooking during our practical classes, but I still struggle with my theoretical subjects. It’s frustrating because I feel like I’m not good enough in those areas.

Consultant: I understand that this must be difficult for you. It’s great to hear that you've found a passion in cooking, but it's also tough when you feel inadequate in other subjects. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing in your theoretical classes?

User: Well, I just don’t find them interesting. The theories seem so dry, and no matter how much I try to study, I can't concentrate. It makes me anxious, especially with exams coming up.

Consultant: That sounds overwhelming. It’s understandable to feel anxious about exams, particularly when the material doesn’t capture your interest. What would it look like for you to feel more confident and focused in those theory subjects?

User: I wish I could approach the topics with more confidence. Maybe if I had better strategies, I could feel less anxious and actually understand the material.

Consultant: Absolutely, developing effective strategies could certainly help you feel more at ease and confident. Let’s explore some personalized learning strategies that might work for you. Can you think of any methods that have helped you in your cooking classes that we could adapt for your theory studies?

User: Maybe breaking things down into smaller parts? Like how I focus on one dish at a time instead of trying to tackle everything. I could do that with my study materials, I guess.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Yuehui! Breaking down larger concepts into smaller, more manageable parts can definitely make them feel less daunting. Can you think of a specific theoretical topic you would like to start with and break down?

User: My least favorite subject is math. If I could understand it better, that might help. 

Consultant: Let’s start with math, then. We can break it down into smaller sections. How about setting a goal to focus on one specific topic each study session? What do you think would be a good first topic?

User: Maybe I could start with algebra. I struggle with the formulas.

Consultant: Algebra sounds like a good place to start. How about this: for each topic, we could set small goals, like understanding one formula at a time. What kind of time frame do you feel comfortable dedicating to this in a week?

User: I could probably manage about three study sessions a week, maybe an hour each.

Consultant: That sounds very doable! So, for this week, we can plan for three sessions focusing on understanding one algebra formula each time. How does that sound?

User: Yeah, that sounds good. I think starting small will help me feel less overwhelmed.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. Each small step can boost your confidence. How do you typically prepare for your cooking classes? Is there anything from that routine that we could apply to your math studies?

User: I usually look up recipes and practice them a few times. Maybe I could do the same with math problems, practicing a few different ones after I learn a formula.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Practicing problems, much like practicing a recipe, allows you to reinforce what you’ve learned. Perhaps after each session, you could solve a couple of related problems as your “practice dish”? 

User: Yes! I can do that. I’ll try to use that approach this week.

Consultant: Fantastic! Remember to keep track of your feelings during this process. How do you think you might feel after your first study session focused on algebra?

User: I hope I’ll feel accomplished, even if I don’t understand everything right away.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective to have. Focusing on the effort and small accomplishments is key. If you find yourself feeling anxious, just remember to take a step back and breathe. It's all part of the learning process. How does that make you feel?

User: It makes me feel a bit calmer knowing I have a plan. 

Consultant: Wonderful! I’m really pleased to hear that. Keep reminding yourself that it’s okay to have ups and downs in your learning journey. We can adjust your plan as needed. Are there any specific challenges you think you might face while trying this?

User: I might still feel distracted by video games. It’s hard to ignore them.

Consultant: I completely understand. It can be tough to avoid distractions. How about setting a specific time for studying that is separate from your gaming time? You could also reward yourself with some gaming time after completing your study goals.

User: That could work! Maybe I could tell myself I can play games only after I finish my study sessions.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive reinforcement strategy! By rewarding yourself, you can create a motivating cycle. Just remember to adjust your plan if you find yourself struggling, and reach out if you need support. What do you think about this approach?

User: I think it's really helpful. I feel more in control now.

Consultant: I’m glad you feel that way, Yuehui! Control and structure can really help ease anxiety. Before we wrap up for today, let’s summarize what you’ll do this week. You’ll focus on algebra, schedule three study sessions, practice problems after learning each formula, and create a reward system with gaming. Does that summarize everything well?

User: Yes, that sounds perfect!

Consultant: Great! I’m proud of the progress you’re making. Remember to keep practicing self-compassion and give yourself grace throughout this process. I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and understanding.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Yuehui. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yuehui! I’m glad to see you today. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot recently. Can you tell me more about how you’ve been feeling, especially after your success in the cooking competition?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel a bit more confident after winning that competition, but I’m still really stressed about my theory courses. The pressure from exams is overwhelming sometimes, and I find it hard to concentrate on studying.

Consultant: It's great to hear about your achievement in the competition; that must have been rewarding! It’s understandable to feel anxious about theory exams, especially when you're balancing both practical and theoretical learning. What specific aspects of your theory courses are causing you the most stress right now?

User: I think it's mainly the amount of information I have to memorize and the fear of not doing well in the exams. Sometimes I get so overwhelmed that I'd rather play video games than study.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. The feeling of being overwhelmed can lead to avoidance behaviors like turning to gaming. Can you identify what thoughts go through your mind when you consider studying for those theory exams?

User: I often think that I won’t be able to remember everything, or that no matter how hard I try, I’ll just fail. It makes me feel really anxious and unmotivated.

Consultant: Those thoughts can definitely add to your anxiety, creating a cycle that makes studying feel even harder. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit. How valid do you think those fears are? Are there any instances where your effort has led to positive results in your studies, even in theory?

User: Well, I did manage to pass a few subjects last semester, but I guess I just focus on the negative experiences more. It’s like my mind keeps telling me that I’m not good enough.

Consultant: It’s common to concentrate on the negative feelings, especially when under pressure. Let's try to challenge that thought. If a friend were in your position, what would you say to them? 

User: I would probably tell them that everyone struggles and that it’s okay to not be perfect. They just need to try their best and keep improving.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re right; everyone goes through struggles. It’s important to recognize your progress too. How about we focus on some strategies to help you manage that anxiety and break the overwhelming feeling of studying? 

User: Yes, I would like that. I just want to feel more in control when studying.

Consultant: Great! One technique we can explore is time management. By breaking your study time into smaller, manageable chunks, you may find it less daunting. Have you tried scheduling your study sessions before?

User: I haven’t really done that. I usually just study whenever I feel like it, which leads to a lot of procrastination.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Let’s think about a practical schedule that works for you. How about we set a specific time each day dedicated to your theory studies and include short breaks to refresh your mind?

User: That sounds doable! I think having a routine will help me get started rather than jumping around randomly.

Consultant: Absolutely! Establishing a routine can really help create a sense of stability. Along with that, we can incorporate some relaxation techniques to use when you start feeling that pressure again. Does that sound good to you?

User: Yes, I think it would help a lot. I often feel really tense before studying.

Consultant: We can try some deep breathing exercises. Focusing on your breath can calm your mind before you begin studying. Would you like to try it together now?

User: Sure, I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment to breathe in deeply through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then slowly exhale through your mouth. Let’s do this a few times together.

User: That really feels nice. I can feel some of the tension easing away.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Practicing this kind of breathing before you start studying can help to ground you and reduce anxiety. Now, how do you feel about making a study schedule together?

User: I feel more motivated to create one. I think setting aside specific times will help me stay focused. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Let’s map it out. How many subjects do you need to cover, and how much time do you think you’ll need for each?

User: I have three main subjects. I think I could manage about 30 minutes for each, with breaks in between.

Consultant: That’s a good plan! How about this: you study each subject for 30 minutes and then take a 5-10 minute break. You could also reward yourself with some game time after completing your study sessions. Does that work for you?

User: Yes, that sounds like a good balance! I’d definitely look forward to gaming after studying.

Consultant: Perfect! Creating that positive reinforcement can be motivating. Just be sure to adjust the wane of reward, so it doesn’t interfere with your study goals. How do you feel about putting this strategy into practice for the week?

User: I’m feeling more hopeful now. I think I can give it a try and see how it goes.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Yuehui! Remember, it's okay to take one step at a time. I’m here to support you as you continue to work through these challenges. Is there anything else on your mind right now?

User: No, I think we covered a lot today. I'm finally feeling a little more positive about my studies!

Consultant: That’s fantastic! You’ve made great strides today. Just remember to be kind to yourself and acknowledge your progress. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yuehui! It's great to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been trying to engage with my studies more. I’ve started forming a study group with my classmates, hoping it will help me stay motivated.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step! It’s great that you’re taking initiative. How has that experience been for you so far?

User: It's been interesting. At first, I was a bit nervous, but having others around makes studying feel less lonely. I think I’m starting to enjoy the discussions we have about the subjects.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Social support can be very motivating. Have you noticed any specific changes in your feelings towards theoretical learning since you started this group?

User: Yes! I feel a bit less resistant to it now. I’m trying to use some strategies I learned from games to make the learning process more engaging.

Consultant: That’s a creative approach! Could you share some examples of how you’re incorporating those gaming strategies into your studies?

User: For instance, I set small goals for each study session, like completing a chapter or mastering a specific topic. I also reward myself with some game time after achieving those goals.

Consultant: That's a great way to make studying more enjoyable and rewarding! How does accomplishing these small goals make you feel?

User: It feels satisfying! I’m less likely to procrastinate when I know there’s a reward waiting for me afterward.

Consultant: It's impressive how you've found a way to create incentives for yourself. What do you think is the biggest challenge you still face with your studies, especially in theory?

User: Sometimes I still get distracted easily. When I'm reading or trying to understand concepts, my mind wanders. It's hard to concentrate for long periods.

Consultant: That's a common challenge, especially in a digital age filled with distractions. Have you thought about any strategies to enhance your concentration during these study sessions?

User: I’ve considered trying timed study sessions, like the Pomodoro technique. Study for 25 minutes, then take a short break. I think that might help keep me focused.

Consultant: The Pomodoro technique sounds like a solid plan! Breaking down your study time can prevent you from feeling overwhelmed. Would you like to set a specific goal for incorporating this technique in your group study sessions?

User: Yes, I can suggest it to my group. We could follow that method together, and maybe even support each other during those focused bursts.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Encouraging each other could enhance everyone’s engagement. How do you think your group would respond to this suggestion?

User: I think they would be open to it. They’ve been positive about trying different methods to improve our studying.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! As you implement this technique, how would you like to track your progress and see its effects on your engagement with studying?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal to note how much I accomplish during each session and how I feel afterward.

Consultant: A journal is an excellent tool for self-reflection! Recording your experiences will help you identify patterns and what works best for you. What are you hoping to learn from this process?

User: I want to see if I can maintain my motivation over time and become more comfortable with theoretical subjects.

Consultant: That's a meaningful goal! As you work towards this, it's important to acknowledge your progress. How would you like to celebrate small victories along the way?

User: I think I could plan some time to play games or watch a show I enjoy whenever I hit a study milestone.

Consultant: That sounds like a fun way to reward yourself! It’s crucial to balance work and relaxation. How do you feel about your overall attitude toward learning now compared to before you started this study group?

User: Honestly, I feel more positive about it! The group has made a difference, and I’m more willing to engage with my studies.

Consultant: That's a wonderful transformation! Remember, maintaining a positive mindset is key to sustaining your motivation. What do you think you’ll do next to keep building on this momentum?

User: I’ll implement the Pomodoro technique and keep my journal. I’ll also encourage the group to continue exploring new strategies.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent next steps. Keep nourishing your curiosity and support from your peers! As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what you’ve learned and how it can help you maintain your motivation moving forward.

User: I’ve learned that engaging with others really boosts my motivation. Setting goals and rewarding myself also helps a lot.

Consultant: Absolutely! You've made significant strides. As you continue on your educational journey, keep focusing on those strategies. If you ever find yourself struggling again, remember the techniques we've discussed. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help. I feel encouraged to keep pushing forward.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Yuehui! I believe in your ability to succeed. Best of luck with your studies, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support in the future.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yuehui! I'm glad to see you for today’s session. I’d love to hear more about your recent experiences and feelings about your studies, especially after your success in the competition.

User: Hi! Thank you. I'm feeling quite encouraged because I did well in the learning competition recently, and my teacher praised my performance. It makes me want to do better in my studies.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like receiving positive feedback has inspired you. How are you planning to carry that motivation into your theoretical studies?

User: Well, I’ve been trying to link what I learned practically in cooking classes to the theory. It’s still tough, though. Sometimes I feel a bit lost when I sit down with the textbooks.

Consultant: I understand that connecting practical experience with theory can be challenging. What specific thoughts come to mind when you feel lost while studying? 

User: I often think, "Why is this even important?" It feels like memorizing things that seem unrelated to what I enjoy. I get discouraged and end up playing games instead.

Consultant: It seems like you’re experiencing some frustration and questioning the relevance of your theory studies. Can you share how the positive feedback from the competition made you feel about your abilities?

User: The praise from my teacher made me feel competent for the first time. I realized I can indeed excel if I apply myself, but it’s hard to keep that momentum going.

Consultant: It’s great that you felt competent! Acknowledging your success is key. Let’s consider how you can leverage that sense of accomplishment. What small academic goals do you think you could set for yourself, building on that success?

User: Maybe I could set a goal to study a bit every day, like one chapter of my theory book. It sounds manageable, but I’m afraid I won’t stick to it.

Consultant: Setting a daily goal of studying a chapter sounds like a positive step! Often, breaking tasks into smaller, achievable parts can help in sticking to them. How can you remind yourself to stay committed to this new goal?

User: I could use a notebook to track my progress. If I write down what I study each day and cross it off, it might motivate me.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Keeping a record of your progress can serve as a visual reminder of your achievements. How do you feel about starting this habit?

User: I feel slightly excited. It seems rewarding to see my progress, and I’m willing to give it a try!

Consultant: Excitement is a great emotion to channel into this new approach. Remember, each time you cross off a chapter, you're reinforcing your competence. What else can you do if you find yourself slipping back into old habits of gaming instead of studying?

User: I guess I could set time limits for gaming. If I finish my study goal first, then I can reward myself with some game time.

Consultant: That's a clever strategy! By rewarding yourself after completing your academic goals, you create a positive reinforcement loop. How do you think you'd feel after implementing this plan?

User: I think I’d feel more in control. Balancing game time with my studies sounds fair, and it could make studying feel less like a chore.

Consultant: Absolutely! Feeling in control can significantly impact your motivation. Let’s reflect on your feelings after you implement this plan. How will you monitor your emotional responses after studying?

User: I could write down how I feel after each study session. If I feel good about my progress, I want to remember that—so I keep going.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Writing down your feelings can help you recognize the positive emotions tied to your efforts. As you continue this habit, what do you hope to achieve in the next few weeks?

User: I hope to improve my grades in theory subjects. If I can pull them up, it would make me feel more confident going into the vocational exams.

Consultant: That’s a clear and achievable goal. Improving your grades will definitely build your confidence. How would you like to feel when you reach that point?

User: I want to feel proud of myself. If I can show that I can do this, it would mean a lot to me.

Consultant: Feeling proud of your achievements is very validating. Let’s keep that feeling in mind as we work on your goals. What will be the first step you take towards improving those grades?

User: I’ll start by organizing my study materials today and planning my schedule for the upcoming week.

Consultant: That’s a proactive step to take! Organization can really set a solid foundation for your study goals. I look forward to hearing how it goes next time. Remember to acknowledge every little achievement along the way. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I feel more hopeful about my studies now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Yuehui! It’s important to focus on that hope and keep building on it. Let’s check in with how you’re feeling and your progress during our next session. 

User: Sounds good. I’m looking forward to it! 

Consultant: Great! Keep up the good work, and see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yuehui! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling about your studies and the upcoming vocational exam?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a mix of confidence and a bit of nervousness. I've been preparing, and I'm getting the hang of things, but I still worry about whether I'll perform well.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel that way, especially with such an important exam approaching. Can you tell me more about what aspects of your preparation give you confidence, and what still makes you anxious?

User: Well, I've been practicing some cooking techniques, and I feel pretty capable in the kitchen. However, I sometimes struggle with the theory part and get anxious about forgetting things during the exam.

Consultant: It sounds like you feel solid with your practical skills but uncertain about the theoretical side. Let’s explore this a bit. When you think about the theory part, what specific thoughts come to your mind that contribute to your anxiety?

User: I often think that I won’t remember important details when it counts, or that I’ll mess things up, which makes me feel really pressured.

Consultant: I see. It seems those thoughts create a lot of pressure for you. What do you think could happen if you let go of those thoughts temporarily? How might that impact your performance?

User: I guess if I could stop worrying about what might go wrong, I’d feel freer to just focus on what I know.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Yuehui! It sounds like shifting your focus could really help. What are some alternative thoughts you could use instead of the worry about forgetting?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that I’ve practiced a lot and that I can handle the situation. I can also tell myself that it’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: Those sound like more balanced thoughts. Focusing on your preparation and accepting mistakes as part of learning can lessen that anxiety. How do you think thinking this way might change your emotions leading up to the exam?

User: I think I would feel less stressed and more relaxed if I really believed those things.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing those new thoughts before the exam could help you maintain that relaxation. Besides adjusting your mindset, what other strategies could you implement to prepare effectively for the exam?

User: I could create a study schedule to balance my theory and practice time better. That way, I wouldn't be cramming everything last minute.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! A structured approach can enhance your confidence. How do you feel about setting that up? 

User: I'm feeling more positive about it. I could start today and stick to it.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Yuehui! It’s great that you're motivated to start right away. While you’re working on that schedule, what methods will you use to reward yourself for sticking to it?

User: I could play some video games or watch a show I like when I finish my study sessions. It’ll keep me motivated!

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Balancing study with rewards can help keep your spirits up. How will you keep track of your progress as you work through your schedule?

User: Maybe I can jot down what I've covered each day and reflect on how I felt about my study sessions. That way, I can see my improvements.

Consultant: That's a smart approach. Keeping a reflection journal can boost your awareness of your progress and help reinforce the positive changes you’re making. How confident do you feel about following through with this plan? 

User: I feel quite confident! I believe this can really help me stay on track and reduce my anxiety.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Confidence can make a huge difference. As we prepare to wrap up today, let’s review the key points from our conversation. What are your takeaways that you'd like to remember moving forward?

User: I want to remember to focus on my preparation, challenge my negative thoughts, and maintain a good balance with rewards. 

Consultant: Those are excellent takeaways, Yuehui! It sounds like you've gained a lot of valuable insights today. As you head into your exam, remember that you have the skills and strategies to succeed. 

User: Thank you! I feel much better about things now. 

Consultant: You're welcome! You’ve put in the effort, and I believe you will do great. If you ever need more support, don’t hesitate to come back. Good luck on your exam!

User: Thanks! I really appreciate your help.
