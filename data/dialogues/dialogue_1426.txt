Consultant: Hello, Mary! I'm glad you could make it to today's session. I want to start by acknowledging how difficult things have been for you recently. Can you share with me what's been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. Thank you for having me. I feel really anxious, especially when I have to make phone calls to clients. The last time I called someone, they mocked me and shouted at me, which made me feel so embarrassed and defeated. Now, my boss is pushing me to meet higher sales targets, and it feels overwhelming.

Consultant: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load right now. Being mocked during a call can be really disheartening, especially when you're under additional pressure to perform at work. How have you been coping with these feelings?

User: Honestly, I've been avoiding making phone calls. When I think about it, my heart races and I feel sick. It’s like I want to shut down and not deal with anything.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. Avoiding a situation that causes such strong anxiety is natural. It’s tough to face something that makes you feel so uncomfortable. Could you tell me more about what thoughts come to your mind when you think about making those calls?

User: I keep thinking that I’ll mess up again or that I’ll be humiliated. I worry that clients will react negatively to me. It’s like that last call just stuck in my head, and I can’t shake it off.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite powerful for you. When you told yourself that you would mess up or that clients would react negatively, how did those thoughts affect your feelings in the moment?

User: It made me feel really anxious and small. I doubt my abilities, and sometimes I wonder if I'm even cut out for this job.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mary. It seems like your self-doubt is really getting in the way of your confidence at work. Let’s try to explore those thoughts a bit. Can you think of any evidence that might challenge the belief that you will mess up during calls? 

User: I guess I've had some successful calls in the past, but they feel so far away now. I just fixate on the one bad experience.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. It’s easy to fixate on negative experiences, especially when they are recent. Remembering your past successes can be a powerful way to balance those thoughts. If a friend of yours was in a similar position, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them not to be too hard on themselves and to remember that everyone has bad days. They can improve, and it’s not the end of the world.

Consultant: Exactly! You wouldn’t encourage them to dwell solely on the negatives. You’d help them see that they have strengths too. How might you apply that same kindness to yourself as you think about your calls?

User: I suppose I should try reminding myself that it's okay to have bad calls and that I can learn from them.

Consultant: That's a great perspective! We can also explore other strategies to help you feel more relaxed before making calls. Have you considered any techniques for managing anxiety in the moment?

User: I haven’t really thought about it. I usually just try to push through the anxiety, which doesn't help.

Consultant: Pushing through can be tough. How about we try some simple breathing techniques together? These can help calm your mind and body before making those calls.

User: That sounds like a helpful idea. I'd like to try it.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment to practice. Close your eyes if you feel comfortable, and take a deep breath in through your nose... Hold it for a moment... and now, slowly release it through your mouth. Let’s do that a few times together. 

User: Okay, I feel a bit more relaxed now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Breathing exercises can serve as a great tool to manage anxiety. As you practice this, remind yourself that it’s just as much about your experience as it is about the outcome of the calls. 

User: I see what you mean. Maybe focusing on my feelings instead of just the outcome could help.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s about creating a space for yourself where you can feel more positive and self-compassionate. How do you feel now about facing the next phone call?

User: I still feel nervous, but I think I can handle it better if I remember to breathe and not be so hard on myself.

Consultant: That’s an excellent step forward! Remember, it's a journey, and it's okay to take it one call at a time. Let’s discuss some other practical steps you can take to build your confidence before each call.

User: Yes, I'd like that. I need to prepare better so I can feel more confident when I pick up the phone.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! Creating a script or outline for your calls might help. What do you think you can include in that script to make you feel more prepared?

User: I could make a list of key points I want to cover and maybe even write down some positive affirmations to remind myself that I can do this.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Having those prompts can ease a lot of pressure and provide a solid foundation for your conversations. How do you feel about integrating that into your routine?

User: I feel hopeful about it. Having a written guide will probably make me less anxious.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It seems like each small step can lead you to greater confidence in those calls. Finally, as we wrap up today, what are your thoughts about the progress you’ve made?

User: I think I've opened up a little about my fears. It feels good to talk about it and to have some tools to use moving forward.

Consultant: That’s a significant accomplishment, Mary! Remember, it’s okay to take small steps. I believe in you and your ability to tackle this challenge. How would you like to summarize what we’ve discussed today to prepare for our next session?

User: I want to focus on practicing my breathing, using a script, and reminding myself that it’s okay to make mistakes. 

Consultant: That sounds like a strong plan! I’m looking forward to hearing how those strategies worked for you. You’ve got this, and I’m here to support you. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Mary. Take care, and I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Mary! It's good to see you again. I remember you were feeling quite anxious about phone communications at work. How have things been since our last session?

User: Hi! Honestly, I've been feeling even more anxious. I couldn't meet my sales targets because of my discomfort with phone calls, and it's really affected my confidence.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds really challenging when your discomfort with phone calls affects your performance. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about making these calls?

User: I keep thinking that I'm going to mess up and sound unprofessional. It's like I freeze up and can’t get my words out.

Consultant: That sounds very stressful. You mentioned feeling frozen and unprofessional. Can we explore how these thoughts make you feel emotionally when you're faced with making a call?

User: I feel a mix of anxiety and panic. It's like my heart races, and I just want to avoid it altogether.

Consultant: That sounds quite overwhelming. It’s understandable to want to avoid situations that make you feel anxious. Can you recall a specific call where you felt this way? What were you thinking at that moment?

User: I remember one call last week. I thought, "What if they judge me for my nerves?" That thought just made everything worse.

Consultant: It’s natural to worry about being judged, but let’s challenge that thought a bit. How likely do you think it is that they would judge you negatively, or could they perhaps be understanding if you're nervous?

User: I guess it’s possible they might be understanding. Most people have had awkward moments on calls, right?

Consultant: Exactly! Most people can relate to being nervous. What evidence do you have that those on the other end are going to judge you harshly?

User: I don’t really have any strong evidence. It’s mostly just my anxiety talking.

Consultant: That's an important realization! Maybe we can work on transforming that thought. If a friend expressed similar concerns about making a call, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone gets nervous and that it’s okay to be human.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective. Now, let’s take that kindness and apply it to yourself. Instead of thinking, “What if they judge me?” how about trying, “It’s okay to be nervous; it doesn’t define my professionalism”? How does that feel?

User: That definitely feels better, like it takes a bit of pressure off.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s build on that relief. Now, I want you to think about what small steps we could take to practice handling phone calls, potentially in less stressful environments. Does that sound okay?

User: Yes, I think starting small would help. Maybe I could practice with a friend first before tackling work calls.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant idea! Practicing with a friend can create a supportive environment for you. How about planning a mock call with them this week? 

User: I think I could arrange that. It should be less daunting than talking to a client right away.

Consultant: Absolutely! And while practicing, remember to use that comforting thought we discussed. Keep it in mind as a way to ease your feelings. How do you envision yourself approaching that mock call?

User: I can see myself being more relaxed and reminding myself that it’s a practice session. The pressure would be lower.

Consultant: Yes! Keeping the expectation low can make a significant difference. Once you practice, how do you think it will affect your confidence when you go back to work calls?

User: I think I’ll feel less anxious. Hopefully, it’ll help rebuild my confidence, too.

Consultant: Definitely! Each positive step can help you reconnect with your confidence. After your practice call, would you be willing to take some notes on how you felt during the process?

User: Yes, I can do that. I think reflecting on how it goes will be beneficial.

Consultant: Great plan, Mary! We can review those notes together in our next session, and it can guide our discussion on next steps. How does that sound?

User: That sounds perfect! I feel more hopeful about tackling it now, thanks to this conversation.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. Each effort you make is a step forward. You’re doing really well!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’m looking forward to practicing and seeing how it goes.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Mary. I’m here for you, and I’m excited to hear about your progress. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support before our next session. 

User: I will! Talk to you soon.

Consultant: Talk to you soon, Mary! Take care until then.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Mary! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty anxious and stressed. Since my last conversation with you, I've tried to reflect on my phone calls, but every time I think about making one, I feel this heaviness.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like the anxiety has really taken a toll on you. Let's talk about that heaviness. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about making those phone calls?

User: I worry that I’ll make a mistake and my boss will be disappointed again. I can't shake off the feeling that I'm just not good at this.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Mary. You're concerned that you'll make a mistake, and that feeds into your self-doubt about your abilities. Can you share how those thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: When I think about making calls, I feel dread. It's like this wave of anxiety washes over me, and it makes me want to avoid the calls altogether.

Consultant: That makes sense. The anxiety is overwhelming to the point where it feels like avoidance is the only way to cope. Let’s identify some of those negative thoughts about yourself and your performance. What would you say are the most prominent thoughts in those moments of anxiety?

User: I think thoughts like, "I can't handle this," or "I'm going to fail," keep looping in my head. 

Consultant: Those are very powerful thoughts, Mary. It seems like they create a cycle of anxiety that makes it hard for you to move forward. What do you think would happen if you challenged those thoughts—if you looked for evidence against them?

User: I guess if I really think about it, I have received positive feedback from a few customers. But it's hard to remember those moments when I'm so focused on the negatives.

Consultant: That’s a great observation! You have had positive experiences that contradict those negative thoughts. How might you reshape those negative beliefs into something more constructive?

User: Maybe I could tell myself, "I have succeeded before, and I can do it again." That feels a bit more positive.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Reframing your thoughts like this can really help. Now, let’s focus on some practical techniques to manage that anxiety when you are actually about to make a call. How do you feel about trying some breathing exercises or mindfulness techniques?

User: I’m open to trying those. I just need to find something that helps when I’m feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: Great! Let's start with a simple breathing technique. It involves inhaling deeply for four counts, holding for four counts, and then exhaling for four counts. Shall we try it together now?

User: Sure, let's do it!

Consultant: Okay, let’s inhale deeply... one, two, three, four. Hold... one, two, three, four. Now exhale slowly... one, two, three, four. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt calming, actually. I could feel my heart rate slowing down a bit.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Practicing this technique regularly can help bring your anxiety levels down when you approach a call. Have you thought about how you could incorporate this into your routine?

User: Maybe I could do this before each call or even during my breaks at work.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Now let’s also think about a small step you can take towards making those calls. Would you be willing to set a goal for the next week, perhaps starting with a couple of practice calls?

User: Yes, I think I could try making two practice calls. That sounds manageable.

Consultant: Excellent! Practicing in a low-pressure environment can build your confidence. How do you feel about approaching those calls with the new techniques we discussed?

User: I feel a bit less anxious knowing that I have tools to help me. I think I can face those calls now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Mary! Remember, it’s about taking small steps and being kind to yourself in the process. As we wrap up, what do you think your next steps will be?

User: I’ll practice the breathing exercises and aim to make those two practice calls. I feel more prepared than before.

Consultant: Sounds like a solid plan! Make sure to acknowledge your progress, no matter how small. We’ll discuss your experiences in our next session. Are there any last thoughts you’d like to share before we end today?

User: No, I think I'm good. Thank you for the support!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Mary! I believe in you, and I'm looking forward to hearing how everything goes next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Mary! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better about talking on the phone, but I still have my moments of anxiety. I really want to improve my sales performance, especially with this new strategy I learned.

Consultant: That's good to hear that you're feeling a bit better! Can you share what specific aspects of the new phone strategy have you been trying, and how you're feeling when you apply them?

User: I've been focusing on building rapport with customers and asking open-ended questions. Sometimes it feels natural, but other times I get really nervous and doubt my ability to connect with them.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel nervous when trying something new. When you feel that way, what thoughts cross your mind? 

User: I often think, "What if they don't like what I say?" or "What if I mess up the call?" Those thoughts really make my anxiety spike.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. Let’s explore them a bit. How are those thoughts impacting how you approach your calls?

User: Well, when I think that way, I tend to hesitate, and then I screw up the call because I'm not focused.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like those negative thoughts are creating a cycle of anxiety and self-doubt. What if we challenge those thoughts? Do you have any evidence that supports or contradicts those beliefs? 

User: Honestly, I've had some successful calls where customers were really friendly. But I tend to forget those instances when I'm nervous.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! It seems like you have some positive experiences to draw from. How might you remind yourself of those successes when you start to feel anxious again?

User: I could keep a small journal or note where I record my successful calls. That might help me remember the good moments.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Documenting your successes can help build your confidence. What steps can you take to start implementing this strategy?

User: I guess I can create a notebook dedicated to my phone calls and jot down at least one positive experience each day.

Consultant: Absolutely! And as you reflect on those positive experiences, what strategies can you use to calm those anxious thoughts before a call? 

User: Maybe I can practice some deep breathing exercises or remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Practicing deep breathing can help ground you, and reminding yourself that mistakes are part of learning will be beneficial. How do you feel about moving forward with these strategies?

User: I feel optimistic! It sounds manageable, and I like the idea of celebrating small wins.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Mary! Let’s set a goal for your next session. How many positive experiences would you like to aim for in your notebook by then?

User: I think I can aim for about five experiences. 

Consultant: That’s a great and achievable goal! And remember, it's not just about the quantity but also the quality of those experiences. How does that sound?

User: That sounds perfect! I think that will help me focus on the positives instead of dwelling on the negatives.

Consultant: Excellent! As you work on this, try to notice your thoughts and feelings when they arise, and practice reframing them using what we've discussed. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel encouraged! I see how challenging those thoughts can change my perspective.

Consultant: That's a significant step forward. Keep in mind that progress can take time, and it’s okay to have ups and downs along the way. What will you do if you encounter any setbacks?

User: I think I’ll remind myself that it’s part of the process and maybe discuss it in our next meeting.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a healthy mindset. Remember, I’m here to support you through this journey. Is there anything specific you’d like to address in our next session?

User: I’d like to discuss how the journaling goes and perhaps dive deeper into managing my anxiety during calls.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences. For today, what do you feel is the biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I feel empowered to tackle those negative thoughts and focus more on my successes. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! I'm proud of the progress you've made. Remember, you're actively working towards improvement, and that’s something to celebrate. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I feel like I'm slowly building my confidence.

Consultant: You're welcome, Mary! Keep up the great work, and I believe you’ll notice even more progress. Looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Mary! It's great to see you again. I'm glad you're here for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better. I’ve successfully interacted with clients recently, and it actually made me feel accomplished. But I still have moments of anxiety about phone communication.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear that you've had successful interactions! It sounds like you're gaining confidence, which is a great step forward. Can you share with me a bit more about those moments of anxiety? What specific thoughts come to your mind when you feel anxious about a phone call?

User: Well, sometimes I worry that I won’t know what to say or that I’ll mess it up. I get really nervous imagining how the conversation will go.

Consultant: I can understand why those thoughts would cause anxiety. It's quite common to fear not knowing what to say. Do you notice a pattern in those thoughts? For instance, do you often find yourself imagining the worst-case scenario?

User: Yes, I often think the worst will happen, like the client not understanding me or being disappointed. I start to overthink everything.

Consultant: That overthinking can definitely amplify your anxiety. Let’s take a moment to explore those thoughts. How do these worries make you feel when you think about them? 

User: They make me feel really uneasy and sometimes even a bit helpless. It’s like I freeze up before a call.

Consultant: Feeling uneasy and helpless is tough, especially when you want to perform well. Now, let's question those thoughts a bit. You mentioned worrying about the client being disappointed. How much evidence do you have that this will actually happen? 

User: I realize that the last few calls went really well, and my clients seemed satisfied. I guess I don't have a lot of evidence for my negative thoughts.

Consultant: That’s great insight, Mary! It sounds like you have successful experiences that contradict those anxious thoughts. If a friend had those same worries, what advice would you give them to challenge those thoughts?

User: I would tell them to focus on their past successes and remind them that it's normal to feel nervous. 

Consultant: That's excellent advice! You clearly see the validity of leaning on past successes. Let’s think about a specific strategy we can develop for you. What’s one small step you can take to remind yourself of your successes before a call?

User: Maybe I could make a note of my successful calls and read it before I make a new call.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical idea! Creating a success reminder can really help shift your focus. How about those moments just before the call? Is there anything calming you could do to ease the anxiety?

User: I could try taking a few deep breaths or even reviewing my note to boost my confidence.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a fantastic way to calm your nerves. It's great that you're thinking of ways to reinforce your positive mindset. How do you feel about practicing this before your next call?

User: I feel hopeful about it, actually. It seems manageable! 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Hope is a powerful tool. Let’s also reflect on this: when you think of making these calls in the future, how do you envision your mindset and feelings after implementing these strategies?

User: I hope to feel more relaxed and confident, and maybe even enjoy the interactions more instead of stressing out.

Consultant: That’s a lovely vision, Mary! Enjoying the interactions is a great goal. What would you like to do to celebrate your progress each time you have a successful call? 

User: I think I'll treat myself to a little reward, like my favorite coffee or a small treat!

Consultant: Celebrating your progress with little rewards is a wonderful way to reinforce positive behavior. How do you feel about setting a goal for yourself based on our conversation today?

User: I think I’ll aim to remind myself of my successes, practice deep breathing, and reward myself after each successful call.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! It encompasses recognizing your achievements and implementing strategies to manage anxiety, which is fantastic. Can we check in on these goals next time to see how they're working for you?

User: Yes, absolutely! I’d like to see how this progresses.

Consultant: Great! I believe you’re on the right path, Mary. Before we finish today, let's summarize these strategies one last time. What are the key points you will take away from our session?

User: Focus on past successes, practice deep breathing, and treat myself after successful calls.

Consultant: Perfect! You’ve captured the essence of our work together beautifully. Remember, it’s about taking those small steps and celebrating each victory along the way. I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes next time we meet!

User: Me too! Thank you for your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Mary! It’s been wonderful working with you. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything before our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Mary! I'm glad to see you for today's session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. I completed my work targets, which my boss appreciated. It feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made significant progress and received positive reinforcement. Can you share more about how you've been managing your anxiety since we last talked?

User: Well, I've been more relaxed, especially regarding phone calls. I used to dread them, but now I’m feeling much more comfortable. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic improvement! What do you think contributed the most to this change in your feelings about making calls?

User: I think it was really about practicing and realizing that most calls go smoothly. I started to challenge those negative thoughts I had about calling clients.

Consultant: Excellent job on recognizing and challenging those negative thoughts! Can you give me an example of a negative thought you had and how you turned it around?

User: Sure! I used to think that if I called a client, they would be annoyed or hang up on me. Now, I remind myself that most people are professional and understand that calls are part of work.

Consultant: That’s a great way to reframe your thinking! It seems like you are recognizing the reality of the situation better. How has that shifted your actions?

User: I’ve started making more calls, and it feels less daunting now. I even volunteered to reach out to a new client this week!

Consultant: It sounds like you've taken a brave step forward! How did that feel for you?

User: It felt exhilarating! I was nervous initially, but once I got into the conversation, it was fine. I actually enjoyed it.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Enjoying the conversation can really enhance your experience. Let’s talk about your current situation in more detail. What challenges are you facing now, if any?

User: I think I’m doing well overall, but sometimes I still struggle with keeping my motivation up, especially when it comes to following up with clients.

Consultant: It's common to have periods of lower motivation, even after doing well. What do you think causes that dip in motivation for you?

User: I suppose I fear lack of response from clients can be discouraging. I sometimes worry that I’m bothering them.

Consultant: I understand that concern. It sounds like that fear might be holding you back. How might you reframe that thought regarding following up with clients?

User: Maybe I could think about it as simply providing them with opportunities to connect rather than bothering them.

Consultant: That’s an excellent reframe! Seeing it as offering value can help ease that pressure. How do you think you can implement that mindset when you follow up with clients?

User: I could keep reminding myself that my message is about helping them and keeping them informed about what we discussed.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Keeping the focus on how your communication can benefit them may help alleviate some anxiety. Have you thought about setting specific follow-up goals to support this mindset?

User: I haven't, but that's a good idea. Maybe I could set a goal to reach out to a certain number of clients each week.

Consultant: That sounds very achievable and practical! Setting metrics can provide clarity and motivate you to reach your targets. What would be a reasonable number for you to aim for?

User: Perhaps three clients a week. That feels manageable without overwhelming myself. 

Consultant: Perfect! Setting a manageable goal can support your continued success. How do you feel about about taking this step?

User: I feel motivated! It seems like a good plan, and I think I can stick to it.

Consultant: Excellent attitude, Mary! As we review your progress today, what do you consider your biggest achievement since we started these sessions?

User: I would say overcoming my fear of calling clients and actually enjoying the process!

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement! You've shown strength and growth in that area. As we start to wrap up today's session, how do you plan to maintain your progress moving forward?

User: I’ll keep reminding myself of the positive feedback I receive and the rational thoughts about following up with clients. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid approach! Remember, it's all about maintaining that positive mindset. If you ever feel yourself slipping back, come back to those strategies. We’ve reached the end of our session today. What are your thoughts on continuing this journey?

User: I think I’m in a good place now. This has been really helpful, but I’d like to check in again in a few weeks to see how everything is going.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s important to stay connected and ensure your skills are being utilized. I’m confident in your ability to manage moving forward. Thank you for sharing with me today, Mary. I look forward to hearing from you again!
