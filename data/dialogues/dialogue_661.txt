Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for today's session. I understand that you've been feeling anxious, especially in public speaking situations. Can you share more about how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Yes, I feel really anxious, especially during my English speaking class. I find it hard to express myself, and I even stutter sometimes. It makes me feel so frustrated and exhausted.

Consultant: That sounds challenging, especially in a learning environment where expressing yourself is important. Can you describe a specific situation recently where you felt this anxiety most acutely?

User: Just last week, I had to present a short speech in class. I was so nervous that I could barely get the words out. My heart was racing, and I felt like everyone was judging me. 

Consultant: It sounds like that experience was quite overwhelming for you. When you were up there speaking, what thoughts were going through your mind at that moment?

User: I kept thinking that I was going to mess up, that everyone would laugh at me, and that I wasn't good enough. 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really distressing. It’s understandable why they would make you feel anxious. Do you think those thoughts are based on reality, or might there be another way to look at the situation?

User: I suppose they are a bit extreme. Maybe not everyone is actually judging me that harshly. But it's hard to shake off those feelings in the moment.

Consultant: Absolutely, it can be very tough to challenge those thoughts in the moment. Let’s explore those beliefs a bit more. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that everyone is judging you negatively?

User: I don't really have solid evidence, to be honest. It's more of a feeling I get. I just feel exposed when I speak in front of others.

Consultant: That feeling of exposure can be really intense. Let’s think about this from a different perspective. If a friend were in your situation, what would you tell them about their fears and feelings?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s normal to feel nervous and that most people are not really focused on them. 

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate viewpoint. It’s great that you can offer that kind of understanding to someone else. Now, how might you apply that understanding to yourself when you’re in these situations?

User: I guess I could try reminding myself that it's okay to be nervous and that other people are probably just paying attention to the content, not judging me.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy approach! Practicing self-compassion can be very beneficial. Let’s move forward and talk about ways to gradually expose yourself to speaking situations. What are some small steps you could take to become more comfortable?

User: Maybe I could start practicing speaking in front of my friends or even in front of a mirror.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Practicing in a safe environment can really help build your confidence. Let’s think of some specific scenarios you could try out with your friends. 

User: I think I could start with a short, casual conversation or a simple story to tell them.

Consultant: That sounds very doable! Remember to keep it relaxed and focus on the interaction rather than the outcome. How do you feel about setting a specific time to practice this with your friends?

User: I think I could try it this weekend. It gives me a bit of time to prepare.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Taking it step by step will help you build your confidence. Additionally, let’s touch on your sleep issues. How has your sleep been affected by your anxiety?

User: I've been having trouble falling asleep, especially on nights before I know I have to speak in front of people. My mind just races with all these worries.

Consultant: Sleep issues can definitely exacerbate anxiety. Would you be open to discussing some relaxation techniques that might help you wind down before bed?

User: Yes, I would really appreciate that. 

Consultant: One technique that many find helpful is deep breathing exercises. It can lower your anxiety and prepare you for sleep. Would you like to try some breathing exercises together now?

User: Sure, I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose for four counts... hold it for four counts... and then exhale through your mouth for four counts. Let’s repeat this a few times together. 

User: Okay, I’m doing that now. 

Consultant: How do you feel after trying that breathing exercise?

User: I feel a bit more relaxed, actually. It's nice to focus on my breathing instead of my worries for a moment.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Practicing this can definitely help you calm your mind before sleep. As you continue building confidence in your speaking abilities, remember to be patient with yourself. It’s a process!

User: Thank you for reminding me. I sometimes lose sight of that.

Consultant: Of course! Progress can take time, and it’s perfectly okay. Before we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed. You’re planning to practice speaking with your friends this weekend and try some deep breathing exercises before bed. What else do you feel you’d like to work on?

User: I want to keep practicing these new thoughts and remind myself that I’m not being judged as harshly as I fear.

Consultant: That’s a solid goal! You’re working toward a healthier mindset. For our next session, we can explore more strategies to reduce your anxiety and improve your public speaking skills. 

User: That sounds good to me. Thank you for your help today!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Remember, you’re making valuable steps forward, and I’m here to support you. Take care until we meet again!

Consultant: Hello! I’m glad you’re back for another session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I've still been feeling quite anxious, especially after my recent experience in class. I got really nervous while speaking in public and I didn’t do well. Now, I’m worried about facing that situation again.

Consultant: I understand that the experience in class was quite difficult for you and has added to your anxiety about speaking in public. Can you share more about what you felt during that moment?

User: I felt my heart racing, my hands were sweaty, and I completely blanked out. I was so focused on not messing up that I couldn’t think clearly. It was really embarrassing.

Consultant: That sounds really overwhelming. It's understandable to feel embarrassed after such an experience. Let's explore those feelings a bit more. What thoughts went through your mind just before you started speaking?

User: I was worried that everyone would judge me and that I would embarrass myself again. I thought, “What if I forget everything?”

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts put a lot of pressure on you. When you had those worries about forgetting, how did they affect your feelings in that moment?

User: They made me feel even more anxious. I was so scared of being judged that I couldn’t focus on what I wanted to say.

Consultant: It’s tough when fear of judgment gets in the way of your ability to express yourself. We can start by identifying those automatic thoughts more clearly. If you were to challenge the thought, “What if I forget everything?” what might you say to yourself instead?

User: Maybe I could think, “It’s okay to not be perfect, and I can always take a moment to collect my thoughts.”

Consultant: That’s a great alternative thought! It sounds more compassionate and realistic. How does it feel to consider that perspective instead?

User: It makes me feel a bit relieved, actually. I guess it’s not the end of the world if I forget something.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to remind yourself that everyone has moments where things don’t go perfectly. Now, let’s work on some strategies to help ease your anxiety. Have you tried any relaxation techniques when you start to feel nervous?

User: I haven’t really tried much. I just freeze up.

Consultant: That's completely understandable. Let’s consider introducing a simple relaxation technique you can use before speaking. Would you be open to trying some deep breathing exercises together?

User: Yes, I would like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s practice. Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose… hold it for a moment… and now exhale slowly through your mouth. Let’s repeat that a few times. How does it feel?

User: I feel a little calmer already, actually. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Deep breathing can be really effective in managing anxiety. We can practice this technique before future speaking situations. Besides that, how do you feel about setting small goals for participating more in class activities?

User: I think that might help. I’m just worried I won’t do well.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel that way, but remember that small steps can lead to bigger changes over time. What would a small goal look like for you?

User: Maybe I could aim to raise my hand to answer one question next class.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! It’s achievable and will gradually help build your confidence. How do you think you would feel if you successfully accomplished that?

User: I think I would feel proud of myself, even if it’s just one question.

Consultant: Absolutely! That sense of achievement can help reinforce your confidence. As you start to see success, you’ll likely find it easier to take on more challenging speaking opportunities. What other situations can you think of where you might want to apply these techniques?

User: I guess when we have group discussions or presentations in class.

Consultant: Definitely! Apply deep breathing and your new perspective during those times as well. Let’s also talk about how you can reflect on these experiences. How about keeping a journal to note what worked and how you felt after each speaking opportunity?

User: That sounds like a good idea. It’ll help me see my progress.

Consultant: Exactly! Reflecting on your experiences can be a powerful tool for growth. As we wrap up today, what’s one thing you’d like to focus on before our next session?

User: I’d like to work on that goal of participating in class and practicing deep breathing.

Consultant: Wonderful! I’ll look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process. You’re doing great work. See you soon!

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful now. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you here today. I want to check in with you on how you've been feeling since our last session. How has your experience with expressing yourself in group settings been going?

User: Hi! I've been trying to push myself to speak up more in group discussions, but I still feel that anxiety creeping in. There were a couple of times I wanted to share my thoughts, but my voice got shaky, and I ended up not saying anything. It really frustrates me.

Consultant: I hear you. It's understandable to feel frustrated when you have the desire to express yourself, but the anxiety holds you back. Let's explore those feelings together. Can you tell me what kind of thoughts run through your mind when you feel that anxiety before speaking?

User: Well, I often think that people will judge me or think my ideas are silly. Sometimes, I imagine them laughing at me if I mess up. It just makes my heart race.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite powerful for you. When you picture people potentially judging you, how does that affect your feelings in the moment?

User: It makes me feel embarrassed and really nervous. I start worrying that I'll make a fool of myself, which just makes it harder to speak.

Consultant: Thanks for sharing that. Let's take a moment to challenge those thoughts. You mentioned that you're worried about being judged—what evidence do you have that people will actually laugh at you or think your ideas are silly when you express them?

User: I guess I don't really know for sure, but I've seen some people in class react with surprise when someone says something they don’t agree with. 

Consultant: That makes sense. It's natural for people to have different opinions, but that doesn’t mean they’re judging you personally. Can you think of a time when someone shared a different opinion that you respected or appreciated?

User: Yes, I remember a classmate spoke up about a different view on a topic, and I actually found it interesting. I didn’t think any less of them.

Consultant: Exactly! Just like you respected your classmate's opinion, it's likely that others will respect yours, too. How can we reshape your thinking so that it feels less daunting to share your thoughts in the future?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that sharing my ideas can be valuable, even if they're different. It doesn't have to be perfect.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! What if you set a small goal for yourself during our next group activity? For instance, you could aim to share one idea, no matter how small, and see how that feels.

User: That sounds doable. I think I can try that. It's just hard sometimes to gather the courage.

Consultant: It’s perfectly okay to feel that way. Courage doesn’t mean the absence of fear; it means taking action despite the fear. Let’s work on some strategies to help you prepare for that moment. How about we practice a few scenarios together?

User: Sure, I’d like that. What do you suggest we do?

Consultant: How about we do a role play? I’ll act as a classmate, and you can practice sharing your ideas as you would in a real group discussion. This way, we can also identify any thoughts that come up so we can tackle them together.

User: I like that idea! It might help me feel more comfortable.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start with a topic you’re passionate about. What’s something you would enjoy discussing with your classmates?

User: Maybe something about teamwork. I had a group project recently that really tested our cooperation skills.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s say you’re in a group discussion about teamwork in that project. How would you start sharing your experience?

User: Um… I think I might say something like, “I learned that clear communication was key for our success.” 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! Now, let’s imagine that some classmates respond with a question or a differing opinion. How would you address that?

User: I guess I could say something like, “That’s a good point, but here’s what I think…” 

Consultant: Absolutely! That shows you’re open to dialogue and value others’ perspectives. It also reinforces your confidence in sharing your ideas. How are you feeling about this role play exercise so far?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. I think it helps to practice.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, practice can enhance your confidence. Let’s maintain this approach, and I encourage you to apply this in your next group setting. 

User: I will try to remember to stay positive and give it a go. 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! As we wrap up, let’s reflect on some supportive thoughts you can take with you when you feel that anxiety coming on. 

User: I’ll try to remind myself that it’s okay to be different and that sharing my ideas is valuable.

Consultant: Yes! That’s a perfect takeaway. I’m really proud of the progress you’re making. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel more hopeful and empowered. I know it won’t be perfect, but I’m willing to try. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic mindset! Remember, gradual growth is important, and I'm here to support you through it. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time we meet. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again today. I'm glad to hear that you've felt some relief from your emotions recently. Can you share a bit more about how your feelings have changed after the group discussion?

User: Hi! Yes, I felt really good after the group discussion. I received positive feedback from my classmates and the teacher, which made me feel proud of myself. But I still find myself a bit anxious about larger gatherings.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you received positive feedback—congratulations! Recognizing your strengths in social situations is a significant step. Let’s talk about that anxiety in larger gatherings. What thoughts come to your mind when you think about those situations?

User: I often worry that I might say something silly or that others won’t find me interesting. It makes me hesitate to speak up, even if I have ideas to share.

Consultant: Those thoughts are valid and commonly experienced. It sounds like you might be engaging in some self-criticism. Can we explore what specific evidence supports those worries? 

User: I guess I don’t have clear evidence. It's more of a fear based on past experiences. Sometimes, I just feel overwhelmed and think I won't be able to contribute anything meaningful.

Consultant: That makes sense. It's important to differentiate between fears based on experiences and what might actually happen. If a friend shared similar feelings, how do you think you would advise them?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on their strengths and remind them that everyone has something valuable to contribute. It’s just hard to follow my own advice sometimes.

Consultant: Absolutely, it's always easier to help others than ourselves. Let’s try something together—can you think of a past situation where you successfully contributed or felt appreciated? Maybe we could use that as a reference point for confidence.

User: Yes! During the recent group discussion, I raised my hand and shared my ideas. It felt nice when others responded positively. 

Consultant: That’s a perfect example! You’ve already shown that you can engage positively with others. How can you remind yourself of this experience when you start to feel anxious in larger gatherings?

User: Maybe I could keep a little reminder or note about that experience and read it before these situations?

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Keeping a physical reminder can help reinforce those positive feelings. We could also think about role-playing techniques to practice your responses in various social contexts. Would you be open to that?

User: Yes, I think practicing could really help! I'm often not sure how to smoothly join in on conversations.

Consultant: Excellent! We can simulate a few different scenarios. Let’s imagine a larger gathering where you want to participate. What might be a good opening approach to share your thoughts?

User: I could start by asking a question related to what others are discussing. That might give me a chance to jump in.

Consultant: That’s a smart strategy! Asking questions generally invites others to engage with you. Let’s work on a few questions together to prepare you for the next time.

User: Okay! Maybe something like, "What do you all think about...?" That feels more inviting.

Consultant: Absolutely! That's an inviting way to join the conversation. We can also brainstorm a few responses if someone asks for your opinion afterward. Do you have any topics you feel particularly passionate about?

User: I really enjoy talking about environmental issues and sustainability. I could use that!

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s create a few statements or facts you could share to spark interest in that topic. Practicing this will help you feel more comfortable contributing your thoughts.

User: Sure! I can prepare a couple of interesting facts and share why I find them important.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Remember, every small step counts. You’ve already made progress in your social confidence. During our next session, we can review how these strategies worked for you and continue building on that success.

User: I’m feeling more optimistic already! Thank you for helping me come up with ideas and reminding me of my strengths.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It's truly rewarding to see your progress. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we've discussed and what you will try in the next few weeks.

User: Sure! I’ll focus on my past successes, prepare a few questions to engage in conversations, and find ways to remind myself that I can contribute meaningfully. 

Consultant: Excellent! I believe these steps will help you maintain the confidence you've built. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Remember, it's completely okay to feel anxious. What matters is how you handle those feelings.

User: Definitely! Thank you for your support. I feel much better about things now.

Consultant: It's my pleasure. Remember, you're doing an amazing job working through this, and you're not alone in this journey. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. I hope you're doing well. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good actually. I participated in a class presentation and got a lot of positive feedback from my classmates. It felt great!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like that experience boosted your confidence. How do you want to channel that positive energy into your studies and social life moving forward?

User: I want to keep feeling that way and maybe even join more activities. I'm just not sure how to keep this momentum going consistently.

Consultant: Maintaining that momentum is essential, and I'm here to help you with that. Let's explore what specific strategies you might use to keep that confidence alive. What are some academics or social activities you're considering?

User: I'm thinking about joining a debate club. I feel like it could improve my public speaking skills and help me stay active socially.

Consultant: Joining a debate club sounds like an excellent choice—it could certainly enhance your confidence and skills. What feelings come up when you think about participating in this club?

User: I feel excited but also a little nervous. What if I mess up or don’t perform well?

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel a mix of excitement and nervousness. Let's take a moment to reflect on that nervousness. What specific thoughts come to mind when you think about not performing well?

User: I think about how others might judge me or that I won't be as good as they are.

Consultant: Those thoughts are quite common in situations like this. How do you think these thoughts affect your feelings about wanting to join the club?

User: They make me hesitate. I want to join, but I worry about what others will think.

Consultant: Acknowledging those feelings is a great first step. Let's challenge those thoughts together. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that others will judge you negatively?

User: Well, I don’t have any concrete evidence, just a fear of it happening. I guess it’s mostly based on my worries.

Consultant: Exactly! Those worries can be powerful, but they are often not based on facts. If a friend were in your position, how would you advise them to think about these fears?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on their own progress and not worry too much about others.

Consultant: That's a wise perspective! It might help to adopt that same mindset for yourself. Would you be willing to practice thinking about your progress instead of comparing yourself to others?

User: Yes, I think that could really help. I do want to focus on my growth rather than what others think.

Consultant: Great! This shift in perspective can have a huge impact. How about we set a small goal for this week related to your participation in the debate club?

User: I could aim to go to the next meeting, introduce myself, and maybe even share a thought!

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect goal! It’s small, manageable, and pushes you in the right direction. How do you feel about setting that goal for yourself?

User: I feel excited! It seems doable, and just thinking about it makes me less nervous.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Remember, each small step you take is a positive stride toward your overarching goal. We can also think of other activities you might want to engage in. Any ideas?

User: I might try to volunteer in some community event as well. It could be fun and a chance to meet new people.

Consultant: Volunteering is a wonderful idea! It not only helps others but also provides a great opportunity for personal growth. What about this experience excites you?

User: I like the thought of making new friends and being part of something bigger than myself.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful sentiment! Engaging with others in a meaningful way can enhance your sense of belonging. How do you plan to find volunteer opportunities?

User: I could check with my university for any upcoming events or clubs dedicated to volunteering.

Consultant: That's a proactive approach! It shows your commitment to creating positive experiences for yourself. As you embark on these activities, how can you remind yourself to focus on your improvements rather than your fears?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal to write down my experiences and feelings about how things go.

Consultant: A journal is an excellent tool for reflection! It can help you track your thoughts, feelings, and progress over time. How does that idea resonate with you?

User: I think it would help a lot to see how much I grow and change.

Consultant: Absolutely! It will also reinforce your positive experiences. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you are taking away from our session. What are your key takeaways?

User: I’m committing to attend the debate club meeting, focus on my own progress, and start a journal to track my experiences. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful steps! I’m proud of your determination to maintain your positive state. Remember, it’s all about continuous growth and being kind to yourself along the way. If you need support, don't hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I feel more confident moving forward. I appreciate your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Keep up the great work!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you again today. You've mentioned wanting to solidify your psychological state and social strategies. Can we start by reflecting on what you feel has been going well since our last session?

User: Hi! Yes, I think I have maintained a pretty stable emotional state. I got positive feedback from my teachers and classmates after performing at a recent event, which boosted my confidence.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like that experience was really rewarding for you. How did it feel to receive that recognition?

User: It felt amazing! I was really nervous before going on stage, but once I did it, I just felt so proud of myself. It made me realize I can handle such situations better than I thought.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization. You showed courage and competence. Reflecting on this experience, what do you think helped you succeed in that moment?

User: I think preparing well and practicing gave me confidence. Plus, I tried to focus on enjoying the moment rather than worrying about the outcome.

Consultant: Preparation and focusing on enjoyment can make a big difference. Now, let’s think about how you can apply this strategy to future challenges. Are there any upcoming situations or events that you might find challenging?

User: I have a group project coming up that worries me a little. I’m concerned about coordinating with my teammates and making sure we all do our part well.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. Teamwork can be challenging. How do you currently approach group projects?

User: Usually, I try to take charge and organize everything, but sometimes I feel overwhelmed with making sure everyone is on track.

Consultant: Taking charge shows leadership, but it’s also important to share the responsibility. What if we explore ways for you to delegate tasks effectively? 

User: That could help, but I'm worried my teammates may not follow through on their parts.

Consultant: It’s valid to feel concerned about that. Perhaps you could set clear expectations at the beginning and establish a system for check-ins? How does that sound?

User: I like that idea. It would help everyone stay accountable and I'm sure it would ease my worries too.

Consultant: Great! Accountability is key in teamwork. Let's think about what short-term goals you can set for this project to keep you on track and reduce stress.

User: Maybe I could set up initial meetings to outline our tasks and deadlines. That way, we start on the right foot.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Setting those initial guidelines can really set the tone. How confident do you feel about implementing this strategy?

User: I feel more confident now that we’re discussing it. I see how I can approach it and it feels less daunting.

Consultant: That's excellent to hear! Remember, you’ve already displayed your capability in a public setting, which is a great strength. Continuing to build on that will help you navigate this project as well.

User: Yes, I hope I can maintain that positive mindset. I don’t want to revert to feeling anxious.

Consultant: You’ve already proven you can thrive in challenging situations. Keeping a journal to reflect on your thoughts and feelings during the project might also help you stay grounded.

User: That's a good idea! Writing things down always helps me clarify my thoughts.

Consultant: Perfect! Journaling can be a great tool to process your experiences and emotions. As we near the end of our session, what key takeaways do you think will help you maintain this progress moving forward?

User: I think the main points are preparing well, focusing on enjoyment rather than fear, and ensuring clear communication with my teammates.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies! Remember, you’ve demonstrated your ability to manage challenges successfully. As you face new situations, reflect on these techniques and continue to set achievable goals.

User: Thank you for your guidance. I feel much more prepared to tackle these upcoming challenges.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m proud of the work you've done. Do remember that I'm here to support your journey, so feel free to reach out if you want to discuss anything in the future.

User: I will, thank you! I appreciate all your help today.

Consultant: It's my pleasure! Keep building on your strengths, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!

User: Thanks! Goodbye!
