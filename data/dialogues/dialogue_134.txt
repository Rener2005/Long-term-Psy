Consultant: Hi there, Sissie! I'm really glad you're here for our session today. How are you feeling?

User: Hi! I feel a bit sad because my teacher said I talk too much during class, and I just want to have fun with my friends.

Consultant: I understand that you love having fun with your friends and that it can feel disappointing when the teacher says something that makes you feel sad. Can you tell me a little more about what happened in class?

User: Well, I was just trying to help my friend answer a question, but the teacher said I wasn't being respectful. I don't want to be a troublemaker.

Consultant: It sounds like you were trying to be helpful, but it felt like the teacher didn't see it that way. It's normal to want to help friends. How did that make you feel when the teacher said that?

User: I felt really confused and a bit upset. I don't think I'm being bad, but I guess I talk a lot.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel confused and upset, Sissie. Talking a lot can be part of your personality, and it's good to express yourself. Do you think there are times when it’s okay to talk, and times when it’s better to listen?

User: Um, maybe. I guess sometimes it's nice to listen, but I really like sharing my ideas!

Consultant: Sharing ideas is wonderful! Let’s think about ways you can share your ideas while also listening to others. Have you noticed how your classmates react when you talk a lot?

User: Sometimes they giggle or look at me funny. I think they are having fun, but I don't want them to get in trouble too.

Consultant: That’s very thoughtful of you, Sissie. It sounds like you care about your friends too! What if we try to find a balance between sharing your ideas and giving others a chance to speak? 

User: That sounds okay, but how do I do that?

Consultant: We can come up with some fun ideas together! Maybe we could use games or drawing to help you express what you want to say while also watching how others respond. Would you like to try?

User: Yes! I love drawing and games!

Consultant: Great! Let’s start by drawing a picture of how you feel in class. You can use colors and shapes to show what’s happening inside. What do you think?

User: I want to draw a rainbow because I feel lots of different things!

Consultant: A rainbow sounds beautiful! Each color can represent a feeling. Once you’re done, we can talk about what each color means to you. 

User: Okay! I think red might mean mad, and blue could mean sad!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start, Sissie! It's important to recognize our feelings. After you finish your rainbow, let’s talk about some ways to show these feelings in class. What do you think you could do when you start feeling mad or sad?

User: Maybe I can take deep breaths? My mom taught me that.

Consultant: Deep breaths are a fantastic idea! They can help calm your feelings. Let’s try that together. Inhale deeply... and exhale slowly. How did that feel?

User: It feels nice! I want to feel like that in class!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Whenever you start feeling mad or sad in class, you can take a moment to breathe like this. Would you be comfortable sharing this with your teacher?

User: I think I could tell her about the breathing!

Consultant: That’s a brave step, Sissie! Telling your teacher can help her understand how you're feeling. And remember, it's okay to ask your friends if they want to share ideas too. 

User: Yeah, I want to include them!

Consultant: Wonderful! Next time in class, you can try asking if anyone else wants to share, and give them a turn to talk. It might make you feel good to let others have their moment too. 

User: I will try that! It sounds fun!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! I’m proud of you for wanting to try different ways to express yourself. We can continue to explore your feelings and find more fun activities in future sessions. 

User: I’m excited! 

Consultant: I am too! Before we finish today, let’s take a moment to reflect. What's one thing you hope to achieve by next time we meet?

User: I want to be able to listen better and maybe share at the right time!

Consultant: That sounds like a great goal, Sissie. I’m sure you can do it! I look forward to hearing all about your experiences next time. 

User: Thank you! 

Consultant: You're welcome! I'll see you next time, Sissie. Remember, it's okay to express how you feel!

Consultant: Hi Sissie! I'm really glad to see you today. I want to explore together how you've been feeling lately, especially with everything going on at home. Can you tell me what's been on your mind?

User: Hello! I just feel really fidgety all the time. Sometimes I think about my parents arguing. I try to make everyone laugh in class because it makes me feel better, but I think it annoys my teacher.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're using humor to cope with feelings at home, but it might be affecting your classroom experience. Can you tell me more about how it feels when your parents argue?

User: It makes me sad, I think. I just want everything to be happy and fun like it used to be. When they're loud, I feel like I have to be loud too. 

Consultant: That makes sense, Sissie. You’re trying to bring some joy into your environment when things feel heavy at home. Do you feel like you have to act a certain way in class to get attention or feel in control?

User: Yes! If I talk a lot, then everyone looks at me, and I feel like I can control what happens. But sometimes it feels too much. 

Consultant: It sounds like your way of seeking control in class is quite intense, and that can be tiring. Let’s think about ways you could express how you're feeling without needing to be so loud. What could that look like to you? 

User: Maybe I could ask my friend to play a game during break time? 

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Playing a game can be a fun way to connect with your friends. It might help you feel more relaxed too. What kind of games do you enjoy? 

User: I like tag and hide-and-seek! They make me run around and forget about things for a bit. 

Consultant: Running around sounds like so much fun! It helps you release some energy. Let’s explore how you could also talk about your feelings when things get overwhelming. How do you usually like to express what you feel? 

User: I don’t really know. I mostly just smile and pretend I’m okay. 

Consultant: Pretending can be a way to manage things, but it’s also okay to share how you truly feel. What if you practiced telling someone close to you how you feel, maybe a friend or teacher?

User: I think I could try! But what if they don’t understand? 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Sometimes sharing feelings can be scary. You could start by saying, “Can I talk to you about something that’s bothering me?” That way, they’ll know you need them to listen. 

User: I could do that! I’ll try to find a quiet moment. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan, Sissie! Quiet moments are great for sharing. Remember, there’s no rush; you can take your time. Have you thought about how you might feel after expressing your feelings to someone? 

User: I think I might feel lighter. Like I can breathe better. 

Consultant: Yes! Sharing can really lighten the load. It’s a strong step towards feeling more in control. Let’s talk about how you might practice expressing those feelings at school. 

User: Maybe with my favorite toy or drawing a picture when I feel upset? 

Consultant: Beautiful ideas! Using your toys or drawing can be fantastic outlets for your feelings. When you start to feel overwhelmed, maybe you could try that before seeking attention in class. 

User: That sounds helpful! 

Consultant: I’m really glad you think so! Remember, it can take time to adjust, but each time you express yourself, you're building those skills. 

User: I’ll keep practicing! 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! How about we make some fun plans for the week? Something you can look forward to? 

User: I want to play outside more! Maybe I can ride my bike! 

Consultant: Riding your bike sounds perfect! It's a fun activity that can help you clear your mind. How about you set a goal to ride your bike two times this week? 

User: Yes! I can do that! 

Consultant: Great! That’s a wonderful goal. And remember, you're also working on talking about how you feel. Let's keep that in mind when you're riding your bike. 

User: I will! This makes me feel more excited! 

Consultant: I’m so happy to hear that, Sissie! You’re making wonderful progress. As we wrap up today, what's one thing you feel you've learned about yourself or how to express your feelings? 

User: I learned that I can talk about how I feel and it’s okay not to pretend all the time. 

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a huge insight, and I’m proud of you for recognizing that. You can share your feelings, and it’s perfectly fine. 

User: Thank you! 

Consultant: You’re welcome! Remember, I’m always here to help you. Keep practicing everything we talked about, and I look forward to our next session together! 

User: I can't wait! 

Consultant: Take care, Sissie, and have fun riding your bike! See you next time! 

User: Bye!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Sissie! I'm really happy to see you today. How have you been feeling about things at school lately?

User: Hi! I've been trying really hard to behave better in class, but sometimes I still feel like I want to talk a lot and move around. It's just so hard to sit still!

Consultant: I see, Sissie. It sounds like you're aware of your desire to express yourself and move around, but you're also working on being more mindful during class. Can you tell me more about how you've been trying to control those impulses?

User: Well, I've been taking deep breaths when I feel the urge to talk too much. I try to listen more to my friends and teachers, but I still feel wiggly sometimes.

Consultant: That's a great strategy, Sissie! Deep breathing can really help when you're feeling restless. It's cool that you're listening more. What do you think makes you feel wiggly?

User: I think it's because I get excited about things, especially when I have a fun idea to share! But I don’t want to disrupt the class.

Consultant: It’s really awesome that you feel excited to share your ideas! How do you think you can share that excitement with your classmates without feeling like you’re interrupting?

User: Maybe I can wait until it's my turn to raise my hand, or I could try writing my ideas down if I can’t wait!

Consultant: Those are fantastic ideas, Sissie! Waiting for your turn shows great patience, and writing down your thoughts might help you remember them for later. Have you had a chance to practice those strategies yet?

User: Yes! I practiced raising my hand last week, and my teacher said I did a good job waiting. It felt nice to be heard!

Consultant: That must have felt really rewarding! It’s great to hear you're getting positive feedback. How did it feel to wait for your turn instead of speaking out right away?

User: It felt a little hard at first, but then I was proud of myself. I liked hearing what my friends said too!

Consultant: That's a wonderful insight, Sissie! It’s valuable to listen to others. It sounds like you’re already developing great social skills. What other ways do you think you could continue improving your interactions with your friends and classmates?

User: Maybe I could invite some of my classmates to play games during recess? I want to share fun activities instead of just talking!

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Inviting others to play can really help build teamwork and friendships. What kind of games do you think you would like to play together?

User: I love playing tag and hide-and-seek! Those games have lots of running and hiding, which is really fun!

Consultant: Those sound like such fun games, Sissie! They’ll certainly give you a chance to be active while playing with your friends. How do you think sharing these games will change how you feel about interacting with them?

User: I think I’ll feel more connected to them, and they’ll see that I can be fun without just talking all the time!

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing activities creates a connection and allows others to see your fun side in a different way. It's wonderful that you're thinking about how to balance your energy with social interactions. How do you feel about these new strategies?

User: I feel excited! I really want to try inviting them this week!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Sissie! I believe you’ll do great. Remember, it’s okay if it feels a little scary at first. Just take it one step at a time. What do you think you might do if it doesn’t go as planned?

User: If it doesn’t work out, I’ll just try again next time! It’s okay to keep trying.

Consultant: That’s an excellent mindset, Sissie! Learning often involves some trial and error. Do you feel like you have enough support from your friends and teacher to keep trying new things?

User: Yes, my friends are really nice, and my teacher helps us a lot! I’ll ask for support if I need it.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Having support makes a big difference. You're showing a lot of growth in how you express this control over your impulses and relate to others. Looking back, what do you feel has changed for you since we began these sessions?

User: I feel more confident about sharing my thoughts and playing with my friends! I’m not just about talking now.

Consultant: That’s such an important change, Sissie! It sounds like you’re finding a good balance between expressing yourself and being part of a group. How would you like to maintain this progress in the future?

User: I’ll keep practicing at school and remember to share more fun things with my friends. I want to stay on this path!

Consultant: I believe in you, Sissie! Remember to celebrate your success and keep trying new things. As we wrap up today, what is one thing you feel you can take away from our session together?

User: I’m taking away that it’s okay to be excited and share, but I can also wait and invite others to join in! 

Consultant: That’s a great takeaway, Sissie! I’m so proud of you for recognizing this. This is our last session, and I want you to know that you’ve learned many valuable skills. If you ever feel you need help again, feel free to come back. You've got this!

User: Thank you! I feel ready to keep going and trying new things!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Sissie! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. I've been trying to do what we talked about, and it feels nice when my teachers are happy with me. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've been working hard on your positive interactions. Can you share a moment from school when you felt proud of your behavior?

User: Yes! Yesterday in class, I waited for my turn to speak and even asked my friends if they wanted to share first. It felt really nice!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic example, Sissie! You took a positive step by waiting for your turn and letting your friends speak. How did that make you feel?

User: I felt really happy and like I was being a good friend. My teacher said I did well too!

Consultant: It must be rewarding to receive that kind of feedback. How do you think you can keep this positive behavior going in the future?

User: Maybe if I keep asking others how they feel and wait for my turn more, it can help me keep being good!

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Asking others how they feel is a wonderful way to connect. Have you thought about how to reward yourself when you notice these positive interactions?

User: I haven't really, what do you mean by rewards?

Consultant: A reward is something nice you can give yourself when you achieve a goal. For example, after a week of good behavior at school, you could treat yourself to a little outing or a fun activity. What do you think would be a good reward for you?

User: Oh! I love going to the playground. Maybe I can ask my parents to take me there if I do well at school!

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic reward! Going to the playground could be a great way to celebrate your achievements. How do you feel about sharing this idea with your parents?

User: I think they would like it! They want me to be good too!

Consultant: Exactly! Involving your parents in this will help them support you. Are there any specific moments you'd like to work on in your classroom interactions next?

User: Sometimes I still want to talk right away, even if it's not my turn. I don’t like waiting.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Waiting can be tough. When you feel that urge, you might try taking a deep breath and reminding yourself of how great it feels to listen first. How would that feel for you?

User: I can try that! Breathing sounds easy enough to remember.

Consultant: It is a simple yet effective tool! Developing that habit of deep breathing before speaking can help you manage your excitement. Do you want to practice this technique together now?

User: Okay! Let’s do it!

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in… and breathe out slowly. How do you feel doing that?

User: It feels nice and makes me a little calmer.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! This can be a helpful way to focus. What other positive behaviors do you think you can practice this week?

User: Maybe I can help my classmates if they don’t understand something. It will be nice to show I care!

Consultant: Helping others is a wonderful way to show care! How do you think your classmates would feel if you offered them help?

User: I think they would appreciate it and might even want to help me too!

Consultant: Exactly! It's a lovely exchange of kindness. Remember, when you help others, it also reinforces your positive behavior. How will you feel if that happens?

User: I’ll feel happy and proud that I made someone else feel better!

Consultant: That’s a beautiful mindset, Sissie! Now, what can you do to remind yourself of these goals throughout the week?

User: I can make a small chart to track my good actions each day. Then, I’ll remember what I wanted to do!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! A chart will visually show your progress and remind you of your goals. How do you plan to celebrate when you complete this chart?

User: I can ask my family to read it with me, and then we can go to the playground!

Consultant: That sounds like a great way to share your progress with them. I’m really proud of you for making these plans! 

User: Thank you! I’m excited to try!

Consultant: I’m excited for you too! Remember, all these small steps count. We’ll have our next session to see how everything went and continue building on your success. 

User: I can’t wait to share my good news!

Consultant: I look forward to hearing about it too, Sissie. Keep up the great work, and remember to be patient with yourself as you practice. 

User: I will! Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Have a wonderful week, and don’t hesitate to celebrate your wins, no matter how small. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hi Sissie! I'm so happy to see you today. How are you feeling after our last session?

User: Hi! I'm feeling really good! I’ve been talking more in class and helping the teacher. It feels nice to follow the rules!

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! I'm glad to hear that you're feeling proud of your improvements. Can you tell me more about how you've been helping the teacher in class?

User: I remind my friends to be quiet when the teacher is talking, and I raise my hand before speaking. It makes the teacher smile!

Consultant: That's fantastic, Sissie! It sounds like you're becoming more aware of your classmates and how to create a better learning environment. How does it make you feel when you see the teacher smile?

User: It makes me really happy! I like seeing the teacher happy. It feels like I'm doing a good job!

Consultant: It definitely sounds like you are! You’ve made great progress in following the classroom rules and helping out. What do you think you could do next to keep this good behavior going?

User: I think I could keep reminding my friends to follow the rules, and maybe help the new kids too!

Consultant: Helping new kids sounds like a great idea! It shows you're becoming a leader in your classroom. How do you think you might feel when you help someone who is new?

User: I think it would make me feel important, like I’m a big helper!

Consultant: Exactly! And that feeling of being important can boost your confidence even more. What could be some challenges you might face when trying to help new friends?

User: Maybe some of them will be shy and not want to talk to me. I don’t want to scare them!

Consultant: That's a valid concern, Sissie. It's wonderful that you're thinking about their feelings. If you notice someone being shy, what could you do to make them feel comfortable?

User: I could smile at them and maybe share my toys or ask them to play with me!

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Your smile could go a long way in helping them feel welcomed. Have you thought about any other ways to encourage new friendships in class?

User: I could invite them to sit with me during lunch so they won't feel alone!

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Sharing your lunch space could really help them feel included. How can you keep reminding yourself to keep up this positive behavior?

User: Maybe I can keep practicing good things in my head, like saying “I can do this!” when I’m at school.

Consultant: Affirmations, like saying “I can do this,” can be really helpful! Would you like to come up with a few more of these positive reminders together?

User: Yes! What about “I am a good helper” or “It's fun to be nice”?

Consultant: I love those! Both are affirmations that can remind you of how capable and kind you are. How do you feel about saying these reminders each morning before school?

User: I think that would be fun! I want to start each day happy!

Consultant: Starting each day with a positive mindset is a wonderful plan! As we wrap up today, what do you feel is your biggest accomplishment since we began our sessions?

User: I feel proud that I can be helpful in class and make the teacher happy!

Consultant: That's a huge accomplishment, Sissie! You should be very proud of yourself. Remember that you can use these skills and reminders in any situation. Would you like to share any last thoughts before we conclude?

User: Just that I can’t wait to help others and to keep practicing my good behaviors!

Consultant: I’m excited for you too! You've shown so much growth. Remember, continue to be kind to yourself and others. If you encounter any challenges, don’t hesitate to reach out to me again. 

User: I will! Thank you for helping me!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Sissie! It’s been a pleasure watching you grow. Goodbye for now, and take care!
