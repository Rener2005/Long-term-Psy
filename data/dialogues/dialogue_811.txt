Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyang! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling pretty down since I didn't get selected for the English experimental class. It really affected me when I realized my pronunciation isn’t up to par, and now I feel anxious and embarrassed around my classmates.

Consultant: I can see how that situation might make you feel anxious and insecure. It's understandable to feel this way when faced with setbacks. Can you tell me more about how it has impacted your interactions with your classmates?

User: Well, I find it hard to talk to them now. I worry they think I'm not good enough, and I often hesitate to join conversations. It's frustrating because I want to fit in better.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure and self-doubt. You're worried about what others think of your abilities. Let's explore this a bit more—what thoughts run through your mind when you feel you’re not good enough?

User: I often think that I'll always fail and that maybe I'm not cut out for university. Sometimes it feels like everyone else is much better than me.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy to carry. You mentioned thinking you may always fail—how does that thought make you feel in those moments?

User: It makes me feel really anxious and frustrated. I just want to do well, but then I end up overthinking everything.

Consultant: That's completely understandable. Your desire to succeed is strong, but it sounds like that pressure adds to your anxiety instead. Let's try identifying some specific moments when you feel this way. Can you recall a particular situation where you felt this self-doubt strongly?

User: Yes, during group projects, I often feel too scared to share my ideas, worrying they won't be good enough. I just freeze up and say nothing.

Consultant: It sounds like the fear of judgment holds you back from expressing yourself. When you freeze up like that, what thoughts are going through your mind at that moment?

User: I think about how they'll laugh at my pronunciation or how my ideas won’t be taken seriously. It's like a loop that just keeps playing in my head.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. You're getting caught in a cycle of negative thinking. If a friend were experiencing these thoughts, what would you say to them to help them feel better?

User: I guess I would tell them to believe in themselves and that everyone makes mistakes. But it’s hard to believe that for myself.

Consultant: That’s a really supportive perspective. It’s often easier to be kind to others than to ourselves. What if we tried to apply some of that kindness to your situation? Can we challenge your thoughts about your pronunciation or ideas? 

User: I’m not sure, but I’m willing to try. 

Consultant: Great! Let's take one of those negative thoughts and look at it more closely. For instance, the idea that your pronunciation will lead to ridicule. How likely is that compared to the idea that your classmates are also focused on their own performance?

User: I guess it’s not very likely. Everyone is probably nervous about their own things, but I focus too much on myself.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s common to overlook that others share similar insecurities. Now, let’s think of an alternative thought to replace “I’ll be ridiculed” with. What could you tell yourself in those group situations to feel a bit more confident?

User: Maybe I could say to myself, “I can express my thoughts, and I’m learning, just like everyone else.” 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful replacement thought! It acknowledges your learning journey. How do you feel thinking that instead?

User: I feel a little lighter, actually. It’s a nice change from the negative thoughts.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Building this kind of self-talk will take practice, but it can make a significant difference. When you're in situations that trigger your anxiety, how can you remind yourself of this new thought?

User: I can write it down and maybe even say it out loud to myself before speaking up.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! By reinforcing this thought, you’ll be training your mind to respond differently in the future. Let’s think about some small steps you could take towards engaging more with your classmates. What’s one thing you could try this week?

User: Maybe I could just initiate a small conversation with one classmate. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! A small step can lead to bigger changes over time. Remember, each positive interaction will help build your confidence. How does that make you feel thinking about taking that step? 

User: I feel nervous but also a bit excited. It’s a step I can take.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! It's natural to feel nervous, but excitement is a good sign that you’re open to change. Let’s talk about how you can reward yourself after this interaction to reinforce your efforts.

User: Maybe I could treat myself to something I enjoy after having that conversation.

Consultant: Absolutely! A reward can motivate you to take that step. Remember that progress is a journey, and every effort counts. As we wrap up today’s session, how are you feeling about the insights we’ve discussed? 

User: I feel a bit more empowered and less alone with my feelings. It's nice to think I have options.

Consultant: I’m really pleased to hear that, Xiaoyang! You've made some significant realizations today. Moving forward, remember that addressing self-doubt takes practice, but you’re on the right track. I believe in your ability to navigate these challenges.

User: Thank you for your help! I really appreciate it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here whenever you need support. Keep believing in yourself, and I look forward to hearing how things go in our next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hello Xiao Yang! I’m really glad you’re here today. I understand things have been a bit tough for you lately. Can you share how you've been feeling since the student council recruitment results?

User: Hi. Yes, it’s been really hard for me. Being eliminated from the student council made me doubt my social skills and academic abilities. I feel really anxious and down about it.

Consultant: That sounds quite challenging for you. It's understandable to feel anxious and low after experiencing a setback. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts came to your mind when you found out the results?

User: I just kept thinking that I’m not good enough and that I’ll always fail. It felt like everyone else was better than me, and I started to question if I really belong in this university.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts have really affected your self-esteem. When you think about not being good enough, what emotions do you feel in your body or mind? 

User: I feel this tight knot in my stomach, and I get really restless. I also start to feel very insecure and worried about my future.

Consultant: It’s tough to carry that kind of pressure in your body and mind. So, when you think you’re not good enough, do you see any patterns in how you react or what you do next?

User: Yes, I tend to withdraw from social situations and stop participating in group activities. I just want to avoid feeling that way again.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Wanting to avoid pain can feel like a safe choice. But let’s explore what that avoidance might mean for your growth. Have you considered any alternative thoughts or explanations for not getting into the student council?

User: I guess I thought it might just be a bad day for me, or maybe they were looking for something specific that I didn’t have. But it’s hard to see it that way when everyone else is doing well.

Consultant: That’s a very insightful observation. It seems like you’re recognizing there might be more to the outcome than just a reflection of your worth. If a friend came to you with similar feelings about the experience, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them to keep trying and to not give up because everyone faces setbacks.

Consultant: Exactly. It's so important to think about setbacks as part of the journey rather than a definitive judgement of value. Let’s challenge that negative thought about yourself. What evidence do you have that supports the belief that you’re not good enough?

User: I suppose there isn't really concrete evidence. It’s more of a feeling I have when I compare myself to others.

Consultant: That’s a common issue. Comparisons can be so misleading. Let’s suppose you were to create a balance sheet of your strengths and achievements. What would you include as evidence of your capabilities?

User: I did well in my high school and managed to get into a good university. And I know I am passionate about learning. 

Consultant: Those are fantastic accomplishments, Xiao Yang! It seems like you have tangible proof of your abilities. Would you be willing to remind yourself of these when negative thoughts arise?

User: I could try that. It makes sense to remember the good things instead of only focusing on one setback.

Consultant: Great! Shifting your perspective isn’t always easy, but it’s a step in the right direction. Are there specific situations where you think you could practice this new way of thinking?

User: Maybe during group projects or when I meet new people. I often feel insecure then.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Let’s consider how you might approach these situations differently. Perhaps you could affirm your strengths before these interactions. What affirmations could you use?

User: I could say to myself, “I am capable, and I deserve to be here,” or remind myself of my achievements.

Consultant: That sounds powerful! These affirmations can definitely help reinforce a positive mindset. How do you feel about starting to use these affirmations in the situations we discussed?

User: I feel slightly optimistic about it. It’s a small step, but maybe it can make a difference.

Consultant: Every small step counts, Xiao Yang. I’m really proud of you for being open to this. Let’s also think about an action plan for when you face moments of doubt. Do you have any activities or hobbies that help bring you back to a positive place?

User: I like reading and going for walks. Those help me relax a bit.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent self-care strategies! As part of your action plan, perhaps you could set aside some time each week for reading or walking, especially after social situations. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I’ll try to dedicate some time to it every week.

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember, this journey takes time and patience, and setbacks are part of the learning process. As we wrap up today, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I think I’ve realized that I can open up to different perspectives about my experiences and that I shouldn't solely define myself by setbacks. 

Consultant: That’s a significant insight. I'm glad to see you recognizing this opportunity for growth! How do you feel about our next steps moving forward?

User: I feel more hopeful and ready to work on my mindset. I appreciate your guidance.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Xiao Yang. Remember, it’s okay to reach out if you need further support. You’ve made great strides today, and I believe in your ability to navigate these feelings. We'll continue to build on this in our next session. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyang! I'm glad you’re here for our session today. I’d like to understand more about how you’re feeling recently. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really overwhelmed with my studies since starting university. I'm struggling with the new coursework and doubting my abilities, especially in my major subjects.

Consultant: I see, you're feeling quite overwhelmed and doubting your academic abilities. It sounds like things have been challenging for you. Can you tell me more about what's been particularly difficult in your studies?

User: Mostly, I find it hard to keep up with the material. The lectures are fast-paced, and I often feel confused and lost. It makes me anxious because I want to do well.

Consultant: That feeling of confusion can be really frustrating, especially when you care about your performance. How does this anxiety affect your ability to study?

User: When I feel anxious, I can't focus. It's like my mind goes blank, and I keep second-guessing myself. Sometimes, I even skip studying because that feels easier than facing the stress.

Consultant: It’s understandable to want to avoid that stress. Let's try to pinpoint these thoughts more closely. What kind of thoughts go through your mind when you feel that way?

User: I often think, "I'm not smart enough for this," or "I’ll never understand this material." Those thoughts make me feel worse about myself.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite harsh. They can definitely create a cycle of negative feelings and avoidance. Can you tell me how these thoughts affect your emotions when they come up?

User: They make me feel really low and defeated. I start to worry that I won't succeed at university, which adds even more pressure.

Consultant: That must be a heavy burden to carry. Let’s explore this a bit further. Is there any evidence that supports those thoughts about not being smart enough, or could there be other explanations for your difficulties?

User: I guess I did well in high school, but now it feels like everything is different. Maybe I just need to try harder?

Consultant: It's great that you have that awareness. Trying harder is a positive step, but it may also help to consider developing some strategies to manage your study methods. How do you currently organize your time and study sessions?

User: Honestly, I don’t have a clear plan. I usually just cram before exams, which makes everything feel chaotic.

Consultant: That sounds very stressful! Establishing a study plan may help reduce that chaos. Could we work together to create a more manageable approach to your studies?

User: Sure, that sounds good. I need help figuring out where to start.

Consultant: Let’s break it down into smaller parts. What subjects do you find the most challenging, and how much time do you think you need for each?

User: My major subjects are the toughest, especially when there’s a lot of information to get through. I feel like I need a lot of time, but I’m not sure how to divide it.

Consultant: Dividing your study time is a great start. How about we aim to create a study schedule that gives you more consistent, shorter study blocks? This might help keep the material fresh in your mind.

User: I think that could work. I’m just worried I won’t stick to it.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. One strategy could be to start small and gradually increase your study time as you get used to the routine. How does that sound?

User: Yeah, that sounds doable. I can try starting with 30-minute blocks and see how it goes.

Consultant: Excellent! And we could build in small breaks too, so you don’t feel overwhelmed. Remember, each small step is progress. Are there any specific study techniques that have worked for you in the past?

User: I used to make flashcards for important concepts, and that helped me remember things better.

Consultant: Flashcards can be very effective! Integrating them into your new study schedule could reinforce your memory. How do you feel about including that technique in your plan?

User: I’d like to give that a try. It sounds helpful.

Consultant: Great! It’s important to find what works for you. Also, how about finding a study group? Sometimes discussing materials with others can provide support and make the learning process less isolating.

User: I haven’t thought about that, but it might help my confidence if I’m studying with peers.

Consultant: Absolutely! Collaborative learning can reinforce your understanding and help ease some of that anxiety. How do you feel about reaching out to classmates to form a study group?

User: I think I could do that. I just need to take the first step.

Consultant: And that’s the first step towards building new social connections and enhancing your learning. It’s about progress, not perfection. How does thinking about this make you feel?

User: I feel a bit lighter, like there’s hope now. I can at least see a way forward.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Just remember, it’s okay to feel anxious, but there are ways to manage it and move forward. How do you think you’ll maintain this positive feeling moving forward?

User: I’ll start by sticking to the study schedule and using flashcards. Also, I’ll try to connect with classmates more.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Xiaoyang! Each step you take will build your confidence. As we wrap up today, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I feel that I now have some strategies to manage my studies, and it's okay to ask for help when I need it.

Consultant: Absolutely! Seeking help is a sign of strength. You've made great progress, and I believe in your ability to navigate these challenges. If you ever feel overwhelmed again, remember to reach out. I'm here for you!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to hearing how things go in our next session. Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyang! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I discovered a new area of interest during an academic lecture, and it's exciting. It helped me ease some of my anxiety.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Discovering a new interest can be quite motivating. Can you tell me more about what this new interest is and how it makes you feel?

User: I'm really interested in environmental science now. It feels like I can contribute to something important, and that gives me a sense of purpose.

Consultant: That sounds like a meaningful passion to have! Engaging with something that resonates with you can indeed boost your confidence. Have you thought about how you might explore this interest further?

User: Yes! I was considering joining a related student organization. I hope that would help me meet people and learn more about the field.

Consultant: Joining a student organization sounds like a fantastic idea! Connecting with others who share your interest can really enhance your experience. What would you feel excited about achieving by joining this group?

User: I think I'd love to learn more through discussions, and maybe work on projects. It would also help me become more social, which has been challenging for me.

Consultant: It's great that you're recognizing both the academic and social benefits of joining this group. Socializing can be tough, but it sounds like you're ready to take steps forward. What do you think might hold you back from engaging with others?

User: I guess I just feel a bit shy. Sometimes I worry about what people will think of me, especially since I'm from a different background.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel shy and worry about others' opinions, especially in a new environment. Remember, many students share similar feelings, and it’s okay to take small steps. What might be one small action you could take to ease into social interactions?

User: Maybe I could start by attending meetings as an observer before participating actively. That way, I can get a feel for things.

Consultant: That sounds like a very reasonable approach! Observing first can help build your confidence. How would you feel about setting a goal to attend the first meeting next week?

User: I think I can do that! It feels less daunting to just observe. 

Consultant: Excellent! Setting that goal is a positive step towards getting involved. As you prepare to attend the meeting, what thoughts might come up that could cause you to feel anxious?

User: I might start worrying that I don’t belong there or that I won’t have anything valuable to contribute.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite common. It's important to challenge such negative beliefs. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts those thoughts? 

User: Well, I do know that everyone has to start somewhere, and no one expects me to be an expert right away.

Consultant: Exactly! Everyone was a beginner at some point. It sounds like you have a realistic perspective on this. What alternative thought could you consider to replace the negative ones?

User: Maybe I could think, "I have a unique perspective to share, and it’s okay to learn from others."

Consultant: That’s a much more empowering thought! Viewing your contributions as valuable can shift your mindset positively. How does that new perspective make you feel about attending the meeting?

User: I feel more motivated to go now. It seems like it could be a great learning opportunity.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It's important to focus on the positives. What are some signs you might look for during the meeting that indicate you're having a good experience?

User: If I feel engaged during discussions or if I manage to introduce myself without too much anxiety, that would be a win.

Consultant: Those are fantastic indicators of progress! It’s not just about how you feel but also the milestones you achieve. As you move forward, what strategies can you put in place if you start feeling anxious during the meeting?

User: I could practice deep breathing before I go in, and remind myself that it's okay to feel nervous. 

Consultant: Those strategies sound effective! Deep breathing can really help calm the nerves, and reminding yourself of your preparedness is powerful. How do you plan to keep track of your experiences after the meeting?

User: I thought I could keep a journal about how I felt and what I learned. That might help me reflect on my progress.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Journaling can provide you insights into your feelings and help you track your growth over time. As we wrap up today, what key takeaway do you have from our discussion that you want to carry forward?

User: I think my main takeaway is that I can approach this new interest step-by-step and challenge my worries about fitting in.

Consultant: That's a wonderful insight, Xiaoyang. Remember, every small step counts towards your growth. I'm proud of the progress you've made, and I look forward to hearing how your meeting goes. Until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaoyang! It’s great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better, honestly. I’m starting to adapt more to university life, and I even made a few friends. But sometimes, I still feel awkward in social situations.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear that you're adapting and making friends! It's completely normal to feel awkward at times. Can you tell me more about those social situations where you feel uncomfortable?

User: Well, sometimes when I’m in groups, I hesitate to speak up. I worry that what I say might not be interesting or that I might embarrass myself.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing some anxiety about how others might perceive you. What thoughts go through your mind when you feel this way?

User: I often think, “What if they don't like what I say?” or “What if they think I'm boring?” 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite challenging. Let's explore how those thoughts affect your feelings. How do you feel when you have those thoughts about not being interesting?

User: I feel anxious and start to overthink everything. Then I just end up staying quiet, which makes me feel even worse afterward.

Consultant: I can understand how that would be frustrating for you, Xiaoyang. It seems like there's a cycle of negative thoughts leading to anxiety, causing you to hold back from contributing. How about we identify some alternative thoughts you could have in those moments?

User: That might help. But I’m not sure what else I could think instead.

Consultant: Let’s try this: if you imagine a friend in your position, what would you tell them? How might you encourage them to speak up?

User: I guess I would tell them that it’s okay to share their thoughts and that people are usually more supportive than we think.

Consultant: Exactly! You can apply that same kindness to yourself. Instead of thinking “What if they think I’m boring?” you could replace that with “It’s okay to share my thoughts; others might appreciate my input.” How does that sound?

User: That makes sense. It feels a bit comforting to think that way.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Now, let’s discuss some small steps you can take in your next social situation. What activity do you have coming up where you could practice this?

User: There’s a group study session this week. I could try to participate more.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! Before the session, you could remind yourself of your new thought. What’s one thing you could say to start participating?

User: Maybe I could ask a question about the topic we’re studying. That’s usually a good way to get involved.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a great idea, Xiaoyang. Asking questions is an excellent way to engage others and ease into the conversation. How confident do you feel about trying this?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited. It’s a good challenge for me.

Consultant: Feeling nervous is completely natural. Embracing that challenge can lead to growth. After the study session, let’s plan to discuss how it went. Would that be okay with you?

User: Yes, that sounds good. I want to see if I can actually do it.

Consultant: I believe you can, Xiaoyang! Let’s also think about any strategies you might use if you start feeling anxious during the session.

User: I could take a few deep breaths to calm myself down. 

Consultant: Great strategy! Deep breathing can be very helpful. You can also remind yourself to focus on the conversation rather than worrying about what others think. 

User: That makes sense. I think I could keep reminding myself of that during the session.

Consultant: Exactly! Remember, it’s about practice and patience. Over time, these strategies will become easier. How do you feel about our plan moving forward?

User: I feel optimistic! I think I’m ready to give it a try.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Before we end today’s session, reflect on your progress. What are some key takeaways you've gained from our discussions?

User: I’ve learned that changing my thoughts about social situations can help reduce my anxiety. I should practice being kinder to myself.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic takeaway, Xiaoyang! A compassionate inner voice can really make a difference. Are there any goals you want to set for yourself moving forward?

User: I want to focus on participating more in group activities and continue making connections with my classmates.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! You're taking proactive steps to enhance your university experience. Remember, you have the skills to continue growing. If you ever need support, I'm here for you.

User: Thank you! I appreciate all the help.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Keep up the great work, Xiaoyang. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!

User: You too! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Yang! I'm glad you could join me today. As we begin, I’d like to hear about your current feelings and any changes you've experienced since our last session. How are you doing?

User: Hi! I'm feeling a lot better overall. My first semester in college went quite well, and I'm really proud of my grades. But I'm also feeling a bit uncertain about setting new goals for this semester.

Consultant: That sounds like a great achievement, and it's perfectly normal to feel uncertain when transitioning into new challenges. What specific goals do you have in mind for this semester, or what areas do you think you might want to improve on?

User: I think I want to focus on managing my time better and getting involved in some extracurricular activities. I’ve heard they’re a good way to meet people and have fun.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! Time management and getting involved socially can really enhance your college experience. What strategies do you currently use to manage your time, and how do you feel about your current social connections?

User: I usually just try to study whenever I can, but it's a bit chaotic. As for social connections, I have a few friends in class, but I still feel a bit shy about joining clubs or activities.

Consultant: It's wonderful that you have made some friends already. Feeling shy about joining new groups is very common, especially in a new environment. What do you think holds you back from joining clubs or meeting new people?

User: I guess I worry that I won’t fit in or that no one will want to hang out with me. It’s hard to put myself out there.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. Let’s explore that thought a bit. Can you think of any evidence that supports or contradicts this belief of not fitting in?

User: Well, I did connect well with my classmates during group projects. A few of them even invited me to study together, so maybe it’s not entirely true that no one would want to be friends.

Consultant: That's a valuable observation! It seems like you have had positive interactions already. How might you change the way you view these opportunities for connection?

User: I could try to see it as an opportunity to make new friends instead of a potential rejection. That’s a good perspective!

Consultant: Absolutely! Shifting your mindset can make a big difference. What small step could you take this week to start getting involved, perhaps related to clubs or activities?

User: I think I could attend the next club meeting for something I'm interested in, even if I don't feel super confident about it.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Attending just to observe can ease the pressure. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I'm a bit nervous, but also excited. I think it might be good for me.

Consultant: That’s a healthy approach! It’s normal to feel a mix of emotions when stepping out of your comfort zone. What will you do if you experience any doubts before the meeting?

User: I suppose I could remind myself of my strengths and the positive connections I've already made.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Recalling your strengths can empower you. Are there other ways you could support yourself emotionally as you work towards these goals?

User: I could practice some mindfulness or relaxation techniques to help manage my anxiety about social situations.

Consultant: Great idea! Mindfulness can help ground you. How comfortable do you feel with trying some new techniques to handle anxiety when it arises?

User: I’ve never really tried it before, but I’m willing to give it a shot. I think it could help.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! Would you like to explore a simple mindfulness technique that you can practice before trying new activities?

User: Yes, that would be helpful!

Consultant: One effective technique is deep breathing. When you feel anxious, pause for a moment, take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, then exhale slowly through your mouth. This can help calm your nervous system. How do you feel about incorporating that?

User: It sounds easy enough! I think I can do that.

Consultant: Perfect! Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. As you integrate these practices into your routine, what do you hope to gain by the end of the semester?

User: I hope to feel more confident in social settings and have a better balance between my studies and my social life.

Consultant: Those are excellent aspirations, Xiao Yang. It sounds like you're setting yourself up for success! As we wrap up today’s session, what are some key takeaways you’d like to remember?

User: I want to remember to challenge my negative thoughts about fitting in and to practice deep breathing whenever I feel anxious.

Consultant: Those are very empowering insights! You've made wonderful progress today. Keep envisioning those goals you've set for yourself, and I’m here to support you along the way. If you ever feel uncertain, remember the positive experiences you've had so far. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I feel more prepared to take on this semester now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, you’ve got this, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Have a great week!

User: Thanks, I will! Looking forward to our next meeting.
