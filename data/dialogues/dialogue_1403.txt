Consultant: Hello there! I'm really glad to see you today. Before we dive in, I’d like to hear about how you’re feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious since the start of this semester. I used to be the top student in my class, but now I've dropped to seventh place, and it feels like my teachers and classmates don't see me the same way anymore.

Consultant: I can understand that must be really tough for you. Shifting from being at the top to facing such a change can definitely shake your confidence. Can you tell me more about how this shift has affected your daily life, especially in terms of your studies and how you feel in class?

User: Well, I’m having a hard time concentrating during lessons. I keep worrying about my grades and how everyone thinks of me. At night, I can't even sleep because I keep replaying everything in my head, and I just feel really low.

Consultant: It sounds overwhelming, feeling both anxious and low while dealing with these changes. You mentioned feeling low. What specific thoughts or feelings come up for you when you think about your current grades and your classmates' perceptions?

User: I constantly feel like I let everyone down, especially my parents. I think they expected me to do well since I always had good grades before. Now I just feel like I’m disappointing them.

Consultant: That’s a heavy burden to carry. It seems like a lot of your self-worth is tied to your academic performance and how your parents view you. Can we explore what a successful and positive view of yourself might look like, separate from your grades?

User: I guess I’d like to feel proud of my efforts, regardless of the grades. But right now, all I see are the numbers. I don’t want to disappoint anyone, but part of me feels like I won’t be able to meet those expectations again.

Consultant: It’s great that you want to feel proud of your efforts rather than solely focusing on grades. Let’s work on identifying the thoughts that contribute to this feeling of disappointment. What specific thoughts run through your mind when you receive a lower grade than you expected?

User: When I see a bad grade, I immediately think, “I’m not smart enough,” or “Everyone else is judging me.” It’s like I can hear them thinking that I’m not capable anymore.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite harsh and demanding. Let’s examine them closely. What evidence do you have that supports these thoughts? Have there been times when you’ve succeeded even if your grades weren't perfect?

User: There were definitely moments when I did well, even if I didn’t get the highest scores. But right now, I can’t help but focus on the negative. I see my friends doing better, and I feel like I’m falling behind.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way when comparing yourself to others. However, it’s important to recognize that those comparisons can fuel your negative beliefs. How might you challenge the belief that you’re not smart enough? Is there another way to view your abilities?

User: I guess I could remind myself that everyone has ups and downs. Maybe it’s okay to not always be at the top, but I still feel pressure to catch up.

Consultant: That's a healthy perspective to start with—recognizing that ups and downs are normal. Let’s focus on setting realistic personal goals that can help you improve your confidence without the pressure of being first. What small changes could you make in your study approach?

User: Maybe I could set short study sessions with breaks. I’ve heard that helps keep your mind fresh. But, I still worry I won’t be good enough.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Taking short, productive study sessions can definitely ease your anxiety. What if you approach each session with an open mindset? Instead of focusing on the outcome, concentrate on learning something new, regardless of the grade.

User: That makes sense. Focusing on learning sounds better than stressing about the scores. I still worry I won’t meet my goals though.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have that worry, and goals can be motivating. Let’s shift our focus on recognizing progress, no matter how small. Each step you take gets you closer to your goals. Can I support you in setting a tangible, achievable goal for this week regarding your studies?

User: Yes, I would like that. Maybe I could aim to complete a chapter in my textbook this week without stressing about how well I’ll do on a test afterward.

Consultant: That's an excellent goal! Focusing on completing a chapter and enjoying the learning process is a good step forward. As you work towards this goal, how will you remind yourself not to fall into those negative thoughts that say you aren't good enough?

User: Maybe I can write some positive affirmations. Like, “I am capable of learning and improving.” I think reading that might help me feel more upbeat.

Consultant: That sounds fantastic! Affirmations can be a powerful tool to counter negative thoughts. It’s all about retraining your mind to focus on your abilities and efforts rather than just the outcomes. How do you feel about this approach moving forward?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It sounds like a good way to work through my anxiety and maybe rebuild my confidence.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, progress takes time, and it’s okay to have setbacks along the way. Each day is a new opportunity to practice these strategies. How do you plan to integrate these changes into your routine starting this week?

User: I think I will try to apply these ideas gradually. I’ll use my affirmations each morning and set aside time for studying without worrying too much about grades.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! I believe you can implement these changes. As we wrap up today, what do you think is the most significant takeaway from our session that will help you in the coming weeks?

User: I think I’ve learned that it’s important to separate myself from my grades and to focus on my efforts. I need to give myself the space to grow without the pressure.

Consultant: That's a crucial insight! Remember to be gentle with yourself as you navigate this journey. If you ever feel overwhelmed or need support, don’t hesitate to reach out. You’re making great strides, and I'm here for you.
###################
Consultant: Hello Li! Welcome back. I appreciate you coming in today. I know you've been feeling quite anxious about your academic performance lately. How have things been since our last session?

User: Hi. I've still been feeling really stressed about my studies. Even after the last time we talked, I still find myself doubting whether I can catch up and get back into the top ranks in my class.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure and frustration with your current academic situation. Can you tell me more about the thoughts or feelings that come up when you think about your performance?

User: I often think that if I'm not at the top, I’ve failed. It's like there's this constant voice in my head telling me I'm not good enough, and that makes it even harder to concentrate.

Consultant: It's really tough to deal with that inner voice. What you mentioned about feeling like you're not enough if you're not at the top is a very challenging thought. How do you feel when you have those thoughts?

User: I feel really defeated, like I should just give up. It makes me anxious and I end up procrastinating because I’m scared of failing again.

Consultant: That makes sense. It seems like those thoughts are leading you to feel overwhelmed and stuck. Have you noticed any patterns in your thinking when it comes to your exams and grades?

User: Yes, I notice I tend to think in extremes—like either I do really well, or I completely fail. There’s no in between for me.

Consultant: It sounds like you might be engaging in what we call "black-and-white thinking." This type of thinking can create unnecessary pressure. What would it look like for you to have a more balanced perspective on your performance?

User: I suppose if I viewed my results as just one part of a bigger picture, it might take some of the pressure off. I just don’t know how to change that mindset.

Consultant: It's great that you're recognizing the need for a more balanced view. Let's explore some alternatives to that all-or-nothing thinking. What might be some positive outcomes of doing your best, regardless of whether it leads you to the top of the class?

User: I guess I would feel proud of myself for trying hard, and it might make studying more enjoyable rather than just a source of stress.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on your effort can help you find joy in learning itself, rather than just striving for grades. How about we set a goal for this week where you can focus on your study efforts instead of the grade itself?

User: That sounds good. Maybe I can try to celebrate my efforts no matter what the outcome is.

Consultant: That's a fantastic approach! Celebrating effort can help reduce anxiety. How can you remind yourself to celebrate your progress over your results this week? 

User: Maybe I can keep a journal where I write down what I studied each day and how I felt about my effort. 

Consultant: I love that idea! It can help you reflect on your experience positively. How do you feel now thinking about implementing this? 

User: I feel a bit relieved, like I have something to focus on, rather than just the outcome.

Consultant: That's a great feeling to have! Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to take small steps. Have you thought about how you can handle it if negative thoughts pop up again while you're studying?

User: I could remind myself that trying my best is what matters. Maybe I can also talk to a friend when I'm feeling down about my studies.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid strategy. Having a support system can really help you manage those feelings. Let's also think about any recent experiences where you felt a bit of relief during your studies. What was different about those moments?

User: I remember one time when I studied with friends; we had a lot of fun, and I didn’t focus too much on grades.

Consultant: Engaging with friends while studying can definitely lighten the mood! Would you like to incorporate more of that kind of interaction moving forward?

User: Yes! I think that could help me feel less stressed about studying on my own.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Mixing your study methods can also foster a more positive mindset. At this point, how do you feel about your ability to handle the upcoming exams?

User: I feel a bit more confident, but I know I have to remind myself constantly to not get back into that negative mindset.

Consultant: That's a very realistic acknowledgment. Building strategies is essential. We can make a plan to regularly check in on those thoughts as you progress. Would you like to establish what to do if you start feeling overwhelmed again?

User: Yes, maybe I can take short breaks and practice some breathing exercises when I feel anxious.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Deep breathing can really help calm your mind. We can build that into your study schedule this week. As we wrap up today, what do you think is the most important takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think learning to celebrate my efforts rather than just focusing on grades is a big one for me. It feels more achievable.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Recognizing your achievements is a great step forward. As we conclude, remember that this journey takes time, and it's perfectly fine to ask for help when you need it. How do you feel about our sessions and the strategies we've discussed?

User: It feels like I have a clearer path now, and I’m feeling a bit lighter. I appreciate your guidance.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that, Li! You’ve made great progress, and remember, it’s always okay to revisit these strategies. Should you need further support, you know where to find me. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! It’s great to see you again for our session. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi! I've been trying to manage my anxiety about the upcoming exams, but I still feel a bit overwhelmed. I keep thinking about how my grades will affect my future, and it’s exhausting.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re still feeling a lot of pressure regarding your grades and the competitive environment at school. Let’s explore that feeling a bit more. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about your upcoming exams?

User: I keep worrying that if I don’t do well, it will disappoint my parents. They’ve always had high expectations for me, and I feel like I have to meet them all the time.

Consultant: That’s a heavy burden to carry, feeling like you constantly have to meet those expectations. Could you share with me how this worry affects your emotions and actions when you think about studying for your exams?

User: When I start studying, I often feel anxious and find it hard to concentrate. My mind races from one negative thought to another about potentially failing.

Consultant: It’s understandable that these thoughts can distract you during your study sessions. Let’s focus on those automatic thoughts. Can you identify a specific negative thought that keeps coming up when you’re studying?

User: I often think something like, “If I don’t get the highest score, I’m not good enough,” which makes me even more anxious.

Consultant: That’s a tough thought to deal with, and it seems to be feeding your anxiety. What feelings arise for you when you have that thought?

User: I feel a mix of fear and disappointment in myself. It makes me want to avoid studying altogether.

Consultant: It sounds like this thought not only creates anxiety but also leads to avoidance. Have you noticed any patterns in your behavior when you feel this way?

User: Yes, sometimes I just leave my study materials and scroll through my phone instead. It’s like I can’t bear to face the possibility of not doing well.

Consultant: That’s an interesting observation. Avoidance can feel like a temporary relief, but it often makes anxiety worse in the long run. Let’s challenge that thought a bit. What evidence do you have that not getting the highest score means you’re not good enough?

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence. It just feels like that because of the pressure I feel from my family and school.

Consultant: That’s a crucial insight! It seems your feelings are influenced by external pressures rather than facts. How might you frame this thought in a more balanced way, considering your efforts and achievements?

User: Maybe I could think, “Doing my best matters more than just the score.” It’s about my effort too.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic perspective, Li! Focusing on your effort instead of just the outcome can help reduce some of that pressure. How do you think adopting this new thought would feel when you sit down to study?

User: I think it could help me feel less pressured and more motivated to study, rather than just feeling like it’s all about the grades.

Consultant: Exactly! Let’s incorporate this new thought into your study routine. Have you considered setting specific study goals instead of focusing solely on grades?

User: I haven’t thought about that. What do you mean by specific study goals?

Consultant: Setting specific study goals can mean focusing on what you want to learn during a study session, like understanding a concept or finishing a chapter, rather than just aiming for a high score. How do you feel about trying that?

User: That sounds much less stressful! I’d like to give it a try.

Consultant: Great! We can also include a relaxation technique to help manage anxiety during these study sessions. Have you ever practiced relaxation exercises before?

User: No, I haven’t tried any relaxation exercises. What do you suggest?

Consultant: A simple method is deep breathing. It can help calm your mind and body. Would you like to practice a short deep breathing exercise with me now?

User: Sure, I’d like to try.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a moment, and then slowly release it through your mouth. Let’s do this together a few times. Inhale… hold… and exhale. How did that feel for you?

User: It actually felt calming. I think I could use this during my study breaks.

Consultant: That’s excellent to hear! Integrating short breaks with relaxation exercises can help maintain your focus and reduce stress. Let’s recap what you’ll take from today’s session. What strategies are you planning to implement?

User: I’ll focus on my effort rather than just grades, set specific study goals, and incorporate deep breathing during study breaks.

Consultant: Those are wonderful strategies, Li! I believe they will significantly help you manage your anxiety and develop a healthier study approach. As we wrap things up, what do you feel you’ve gained from today’s discussion?

User: I feel more hopeful and less anxious about studying. I have some real strategies I can work with now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a journey, and you’re making progress every step of the way. Whenever you feel overwhelmed again, just remember these strategies. It was great working with you today, and I look forward to our next session!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! It's great to see you again. I remember last time we spoke about your new study methods and how they have been helping you. How are you feeling about them now?

User: Hi! I'm feeling a bit better. I've managed to keep up with the new study rhythm, but there are still moments when I worry about whether I'll be able to maintain this long-term. It sometimes feels overwhelming.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way, especially when trying to adjust to a new routine. Can you share more about those overwhelming moments? What goes through your mind during those times?

User: I guess I start to doubt myself. I think, what if I can't keep up with the pace? What if my grades drop? It feels like a lot of pressure, even when I’m doing okay.

Consultant: It sounds like you're facing some self-doubts and fear of failure. When those thoughts enter your mind, how do they make you feel emotionally?

User: I feel anxious and a bit lost. I sometimes have trouble concentrating on my studies because of this worry.

Consultant: It’s common for anxiety to affect focus. Let’s dig a bit deeper—what kind of thoughts do you have when you’re trying to concentrate but feel that anxiety creeping in?

User: I often think, "I don’t know if I understand this," or "What if I forget everything before the exam?" It makes it hard to get into the flow of studying.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite concerning and may create a cycle of anxiety. Let’s see if we can challenge those thoughts a bit. Do you have any evidence to support the idea that you won't understand the material or that you'll forget everything?

User: Well, I did learn more effectively in the last few weeks. I guess that's a positive sign? But I still worry a lot.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! It sounds like you have made significant progress recently. How would you reframe those anxious thoughts based on your achievements? 

User: Maybe I could tell myself, "I've been understanding my studies well, and I've handled new challenges before." 

Consultant: That sounds like a much more balanced view! Recognizing your past successes can help combat those negative thoughts. Now, let's think about how you can apply this positive reframing when you start to feel overwhelmed again.

User: I could write it down somewhere visible or say it out loud when I feel anxious. That might help me remember.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Writing affirmations or reminders can serve as a powerful tool. How else do you think you could prepare for unexpected academic pressures in the future?

User: I think I could develop a small study plan that includes breaks or even some fun activities. That could help relieve stress when things get tough.

Consultant: Absolutely! Incorporating breaks and enjoyable activities can prevent burnout. What fun activities do you have in mind?

User: I enjoy drawing and listening to music. I could set aside time for those things to help balance my study time. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Engaging in hobbies will definitely give you a mental break. Let’s also think about ways to remind yourself of your progress. What strategies can you use to note your improvements each day?

User: I could keep a brief journal to reflect on what I learned or how I felt after studying. I think that would help me see my progress. 

Consultant: That's a great approach! Journaling can help reinforce those positive feelings and provide a reference point for your growth. How do you feel about combining these strategies to enhance your study experience?

User: It makes me feel more empowered. I think having these tools will help me manage my worries better.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Feeling empowered is key to navigating challenges. As you continue to apply these strategies, remember to celebrate your achievements along the way. Is there anything specific you'd like to focus on before we wrap up our session today?

User: I want to make sure I can stick to my plan even when I feel anxious. I want some tips on that.

Consultant: Certainly! When anxiety arises, try grounding techniques, like deep breathing or mindfulness exercises, to regain focus. Would practicing these techniques sound helpful to you?

User: Yes, I’ve heard of deep breathing techniques. I’d like to try those.

Consultant: Great! Practicing deep breathing can help calm your mind and center your thoughts. To wrap up, how are you feeling about the strategies we discussed today? Do you feel more prepared for the challenges ahead?

User: I feel much more prepared! I’m looking forward to trying these new methods and seeing how they work for me.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Li! Remember that it's a journey, and you’re doing wonderfully. Keep engaging with your interests outside of studying, and keep me posted on your progress. This will be our last session for now. If you ever need support in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you so much for your help! I really appreciate it. I’ll definitely keep practicing what we discussed!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of the progress you've made, and I believe in your ability to manage your studies and emotions. Take care, and best of luck on your journey ahead!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you again for our session. How have you been feeling since our last talk?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good. I actually tried a couple of new activities outside of school. It's interesting to explore things beyond just studying.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like you’re starting to enjoy a more diverse range of activities. What kind of activities did you try, and how did they make you feel?

User: I joined a painting class and also started participating in a few club meetings at school. I liked painting because it allows me to express myself, and the clubs have been fun because I met new people.

Consultant: It seems like you’re discovering new ways to express yourself and connect with others. How do these activities compare to your usual study routine?

User: They feel much more relaxed! I don't have the pressure of grades or homework. I feel lighter when I paint or hang out with friends.

Consultant: That sounds refreshing! Being able to enjoy activities without the stress of academic pressure can be very beneficial. Do you think these activities are contributing positively to your overall mood and satisfaction?

User: Yes, definitely! I think they're helping me feel more balanced. But sometimes, I still worry about my schoolwork and whether I can keep up with both.

Consultant: It's understandable to have those worries, especially when you’re trying to balance multiple interests. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts you have regarding your studies and the potential impact of these new activities?

User: I often think that if I spend too much time on activities, my grades might drop. I fear that I could end up disappointing my teachers and family.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite heavy, especially given your background of performing well academically. Let’s explore them a bit. What evidence do you have that participating in these activities will negatively impact your studies?

User: I guess I don't have solid evidence. It's just a fear I have. I want to excel in both areas, but I'm worried I might fail at one if I focus too much on the other.

Consultant: It’s good that you're identifying that fear as a concern rather than a certainty. If you were to suggest an alternative perspective to a friend in your situation, what might that be?

User: I’d probably tell a friend that it’s okay to have interests outside of studies and that it can even help them feel more energized for school.

Consultant: Exactly! Engaging in activities you enjoy can provide you with a refreshing break and might even enhance your focus in your studies. How do you think you could create a balance between schoolwork and your interests?

User: Maybe I could schedule specific times for both. Like, I could allocate certain days for studying and others for activities so that I don't feel overwhelmed by either.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical approach! Creating a schedule can help you manage both effectively. How would you feel about setting some goals for this balance in our session today?

User: That would be helpful! I’d like to have a clearer plan moving forward.

Consultant: Great! Let's start with your study goals. What subjects do you feel need more focus, and how much time would you like to dedicate to them each week?

User: I need to pay more attention to math and English. Maybe I could spend about 10 hours a week on math and 8 hours on English?

Consultant: That sounds reasonable! Now, how can we incorporate your interests into this schedule? How many hours per week do you think would be ideal for painting and club activities?

User: I think I'd like to spend at least 5 hours painting and maybe 3 hours in clubs each week. That seems doable!

Consultant: Excellent! So, if we summarize your plan, you’d have 10 hours for math, 8 for English, and then 5 for painting and 3 for clubs. Do you think this distribution helps ease your anxiety a bit?

User: Yes, it feels manageable! Knowing I have time set aside for both makes me less worried.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s also about being flexible with this plan. If something comes up, you can always adjust it. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I feel more empowered to try this out now.

Consultant: Empowerment is key! Before we wrap up today, let’s reflect. What do you think will be your biggest challenge in implementing this schedule?

User: I think it might be sticking to the plan when I feel stressed or overwhelmed with school assignments.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. When you start feeling overwhelmed, what strategies can you use to remind yourself of your new plan?

User: Maybe I could write down my schedule and keep it somewhere visible to remind myself to stick to it. Also, allowing myself short breaks might help.

Consultant: Excellent strategies! Writing it down will keep you accountable, and taking breaks is essential for your overall well-being. As we conclude today, what are your feelings about moving forward with this plan?

User: I feel excited and more confident! I think this balance will help me enjoy both studying and my new interests.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Li! You've made significant progress today. In our next session, we can review how this balance is working for you. Remember, it’s all about growth and adapting. If you ever feel the need to tweak your schedule, that’s perfectly okay. You've got this!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I feel more motivated now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care and enjoy your activities!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! It's great to see you again. I’m happy to hear about your positive changes after the exams. How have you been feeling since we last met?

User: Hi! I feel much more confident now. The systematic revision really helped me, and I managed to improve my grades. My social relationships have also gotten better.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like your hard work has paid off. Can you share what specific changes you've noticed in your confidence or your social interactions?

User: I've started participating more in class and even joined a study group. I feel more comfortable speaking up and sharing my thoughts.

Consultant: That’s a great step forward! Being more active in class and engaging with others can really enhance both your learning experience and your confidence. How does it feel to be more involved?

User: It feels good, actually! I didn’t realize how much I was holding back before. Now, I feel more connected to my classmates.

Consultant: I'm glad you're feeling more connected. It seems like these experiences have positively influenced your mindset. What are your thoughts on maintaining this level of engagement and confidence moving forward?

User: I want to keep it up but I’m worried about falling back into my old habits. It’s like I’m scared I won’t be able to handle the pressure next time.

Consultant: That's a valid concern, Li. It's common to worry about slipping back into previous patterns, especially after experiencing success. Let’s talk about strategies to support you in maintaining these positive changes. What goals do you think you could set for your learning and social interactions?

User: I think I should aim to participate in at least one group activity each week and maybe set a study goal for each subject.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent goals! Having specific targets can help keep you motivated. How do you plan to keep track of your progress toward these goals?

User: Maybe I could use a planner or an app to remind me of my goals and reflect on my progress.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Using tools like planners can help you stay organized and mindful of your progress. How do you feel about checking in on your goals regularly? Would you prefer weekly or bi-weekly reviews?

User: I think weekly check-ins would be good. It’ll keep me accountable and help me see what’s working.

Consultant: Absolutely! Regular reflections can be very beneficial. Besides academic goals, are there other areas of your life you'd like to focus on enhancing, perhaps your social life or self-care?

User: I’d like to spend more time on hobbies, like painting. I feel like I’ve neglected that part of me.

Consultant: Engaging in hobbies is an essential aspect of maintaining balance in life. How do you plan to incorporate more painting into your weekly routine?

User: I could set aside some time during the weekends for it and perhaps join an art class to meet new people with similar interests.

Consultant: That sounds fantastic! Not only will you be nurturing your creativity, but you’ll also have the opportunity to connect with others. How does that prospect make you feel?

User: I’m excited! It feels like I’m building a more fulfilling lifestyle.

Consultant: That's wonderful, Li! Building a fulfilling lifestyle is essential for your well-being. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize your key goals and strategies for maintaining your progress. 

User: Right, so I’ll participate in group activities, set study goals, use a planner, and schedule time for painting.

Consultant: Exactly! Those are clear and actionable goals. Remember, it’s also important to be kind to yourself and to recognize that progress takes time. How confident do you feel in following through with these plans?

User: I feel quite confident! The goals seem manageable, and I’m looking forward to making these changes.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! You’ve made significant strides, and I believe you have the tools to continue progressing. As this is our last session, do you have any final thoughts or questions?

User: I just want to thank you for all your guidance. It has really helped me.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li! I’m proud of your achievements and how far you’ve come. Remember, the strategies you’ve learned will always be there for you. If you ever feel the need for support again, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care, and best of luck with your future endeavors!

User: Thank you so much! I will remember that. Goodbye!

Consultant: Goodbye, Li! Wishing you all the best on your journey!
