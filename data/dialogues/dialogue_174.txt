Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been since our last session? 

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really down. I've been thinking a lot about how my classmates have blocked me on social media, and it makes me feel like I don't belong anywhere.

Consultant: I can see how that would make you feel isolated and hurt. Feeling excluded can be incredibly painful. Can you share more about how that situation has impacted your feelings about yourself and your relationships?

User: It just intensifies my loneliness. I feel like I can't connect with others, and it makes me question my worth. Sometimes, I wonder if it's because of my weight or if they just don't like me.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-doubt. You've mentioned before that your weight has been a source of criticism, especially from your grandmother. How do you think these past experiences have shaped your perceptions of yourself and your relationships now?

User: Well, I've always felt less than others because of the comments. It feels like I'm being judged constantly, and I struggle to put myself out there. It's just hard to believe anyone could really like me.

Consultant: That sounds really heavy to carry. It's understandable to feel that way when you've faced such criticism. Can we explore some of the thoughts running through your mind when you think about interactions with your classmates? 

User: Sure. I often think that they must see me as the fat kid who doesn't fit in. And when they act distant or block me, it confirms my fears that I'm unlikable.

Consultant: You’re naming some strong thoughts there—like the idea that being 'the fat kid' makes you unlikable. Let's take a moment to challenge that thought. Do you think there could be other reasons behind their actions that aren’t related to you?

User: I guess so. Maybe it's just their own preferences or something unrelated to me. But it still hurts.

Consultant: Absolutely, it hurts, and your feelings are valid. It's essential to acknowledge that pain. What if we looked at the evidence supporting your belief that you're unlikable? Do you have other experiences that contradict that idea?

User: Well, there have been a few times when I thought I had a good conversation with a classmate. They seemed to enjoy talking to me, at least.

Consultant: That’s a great observation! It sounds like there have been moments of connection. How might we adjust your thinking to include those positive interactions?

User: Maybe I need to recognize that not everyone feels the same way, and I can also focus on those who do want to connect with me.

Consultant: That’s an excellent insight! By acknowledging those positive interactions, you can start to build a more balanced view of yourself. What steps do you think you can take to encourage more of those positive connections with your classmates?

User: I suppose I could try reaching out more, maybe join a club or a group where I could meet people with similar interests.

Consultant: Joining a club is a fantastic idea! It gives you a chance to meet new people in a shared environment. How do you feel about taking that risk to connect with others?

User: It’s a bit daunting, but I think it could help me feel more like part of a group.

Consultant: That's a brave step you're considering. Remember, it's okay to feel a bit anxious about it. In what ways can you support yourself during this process of reaching out?

User: I could remind myself that everyone feels nervous sometimes and that it's okay not to be perfect in social situations.

Consultant: That's a healthy reminder! Also consider that many people appreciate genuine kindness and effort, regardless of how things initially go. What's the next specific action you'd like to take towards reaching out?

User: I think I’ll look up local clubs and maybe attend a meeting next week.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, and I’m here to support you through it. As we wrap up today, let's reflect on what you've learned about yourself and relationships. How do you feel about your ability to form connections now?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I realize that I should focus on the positives rather than just the negatives. I still worry, but at least I have some strategies now.

Consultant: It's great to hear you're feeling a bit more hopeful and have gained some strategies. Remember, it’s a journey, and every small step counts. If you continue feeling anxious, think back to today’s conversation. What would you like to explore next time we meet?

User: I’d like to look deeper into those feelings of anxiety when I try to connect with others and maybe work on boosting my self-esteem.

Consultant: That sounds like a worthwhile focus for our next session. You've made some meaningful progress today, and I'm looking forward to supporting you further. Remember to be kind to yourself in this process. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Shao! Welcome to today’s session. I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last time together? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better about myself after receiving praise from my classmates for taking care of the blackboard. But I still feel anxious when it comes to personal relationships, especially worrying about how to maintain this good impression.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you received praise and that it has positively impacted your self-esteem! It sounds like you are beginning to see your abilities better. Let's talk more about the connections you’re trying to build with your classmates. What specific thoughts do you have when you think about deepening those relationships?

User: Well, I want to connect with my classmates, but I worry they might judge me or think I'm not worth their time. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you're entering new social dynamics. Can you tell me what specific thoughts run through your mind that contribute to this worry? 

User: I keep thinking that they might see me as just the "fat kid" and that I won’t fit in.

Consultant: That sounds quite challenging. It seems like you're holding onto some negative beliefs about yourself that might not be entirely accurate. Let's explore this together. What evidence do you have that supports this thought, and is there any evidence that contradicts it?

User: Well, I guess I did get compliments for my work, but I’m still scared they won’t want to hang out with me because of my appearance.

Consultant: It seems like the compliments you received might suggest otherwise—that your classmates do see your value beyond appearance. If a friend were in your place, how would you advise them? 

User: I would probably tell them that their value isn't just about how they look.

Consultant: Exactly! You recognize that everyone has strengths beyond their appearance. Now, let’s think about what would help you feel more comfortable reaching out to your classmates. What are some small steps you can take to build those friendships instead of focusing on these negative thoughts? 

User: Maybe I could try talking to them about things we like, like games or school events. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Engaging in shared interests can help break the ice. How do you feel about approaching one classmate this week with that in mind?

User: I feel a bit anxious, but I think I can do it. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious about this! Let’s set a realistic goal. What if you wrote down a topic or two you could bring up, and then chose one classmate to reach out to? How does that sound?

User: That sounds doable. 

Consultant: Great! And remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. You might find that when you take these small steps, your anxiety lessens over time. What emotions do you think you might experience after you make that attempt? 

User: I think I might feel proud of myself, if it goes well. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful outcome to aim for. Feeling proud can reinforce your self-esteem further. What about the thought of possible rejection? How can you prepare for that if it happens?

User: I guess I could remind myself that not everyone will connect, and that’s okay. 

Consultant: Excellent insight! Remember, rejection is a part of building connections and doesn’t define your worth. What are some positive affirmations you can tell yourself before you make that approach?

User: I could say, “I have something valuable to offer, and it’s okay if it doesn’t work out.”

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation! Repeating that to yourself can help shift your mindset. As we continue to build up your confidence, what strategies can we discuss for you to practice these affirmations leading up to that conversation?

User: Maybe I can write it down and say it to myself in front of the mirror.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! It helps in reinforcing the positive messages about yourself. Let’s check in next time about how that conversation went. Do you feel ready to move forward with this plan?

User: Yes, I think I’m ready to try.

Consultant: I'm proud of your willingness to take these steps, Shao. Before we wrap up today, let’s briefly summarize what you’ll focus on this week.

User: I will try to talk to a classmate about our interests, remind myself of my value, and practice my affirmations.

Consultant: Perfect! Keep in mind that you’re not alone in this. I’m here to support you through your journey. How are you feeling as we conclude our session today? 

User: A bit nervous but also excited. Thank you for the support!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, take things one step at a time. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Have a good week, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need any encouragement in the meantime!

Consultant: Hello, Shao! I'm glad you’re here today. Last time, we talked about your new friendship and how it made you feel positive, but you also mentioned feeling anxious about deepening that relationship. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better, actually. It's nice to have someone to talk to, but I still worry about what will happen if I try to get closer. What if they don’t want to be friends anymore? 

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re feeling a bit better. Your concerns about deepening the friendship are completely understandable. Let’s explore those feelings more. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about reaching out to your friend?

User: I keep thinking that maybe they might find me annoying or just don’t like me that much. Sometimes I feel like I don’t really know how to keep a conversation going.

Consultant: It sounds like you might be experiencing some self-doubt in social situations. You mentioned feeling annoying; can you tell me more about what makes you feel this way?

User: Well, I often think about how I talk too much or I might say the wrong thing. I worry that my weight makes a difference too, and they might judge me for it.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really tough to handle. It seems like there’s a fear of judgment from your friend. Have you noticed how those thoughts affect your feelings when you consider talking to them?

User: Yes, it makes me feel really anxious and sometimes even a bit sad. I just want to have a good friendship without feeling this pressure.

Consultant: It's understandable to want a supportive friendship without the weight of anxiety. Let’s try to challenge those thoughts a bit. What kind of evidence do you have that your friend would find you annoying, or that your weight would be a dealbreaker for them?

User: I guess I don’t really have any proof. They’ve been nice to me so far. I just keep imagining all the worst scenarios in my head.

Consultant: That’s a key point. Your friend has shown kindness, which is a positive sign. It could be helpful to remind yourself that your imagination might be exaggerating the worst-case scenarios. What if we considered ways to prepare for your next interaction, so you feel more ready?

User: That sounds good! I think having a plan could help my anxiety. What should I do?

Consultant: A good start might be to have some conversation starters or questions ready. What are some things you both enjoy discussing? 

User: I know we both like video games! I could ask them about what games they're currently playing.

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a great topic to connect over. You could also share your thoughts on those games, which might open up more conversation. Would you feel comfortable practicing this interaction together?

User: Yes, I think that would help! I want to feel more confident talking to them.

Consultant: Alright! Let’s pretend we’re in that conversation. You start by asking about their favorite game right now.

User: Okay… Hey! What game are you playing these days?

Consultant: Great start! Now, let’s say they respond with a game they love. How could you respond to keep the conversation flowing?

User: I could say something like, “I’ve heard about that game! What do you like most about it?” 

Consultant: Exactly! That shows your interest and invites them to share more. How do you feel practicing this way?

User: I feel a bit more relaxed about it, actually. It’s nice to think that they might enjoy chatting about it.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, this practice can help you build confidence. How about we discuss what you can do if the conversation doesn’t go as planned?

User: Hmm… maybe I should remind myself that not every conversation will be perfect, and that it's okay if it doesn’t go well?

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember, each interaction is a chance to learn. If you keep this mindset, it can ease some of that pressure. How does thinking about it this way make you feel?

User: It feels freeing. I won't be so scared of making mistakes.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift in mindset! It sounds like you’re making progress in how you view these interactions. What other strategies do you think might be helpful as you approach deeper friendships?

User: I could work on being open about my feelings and asking about theirs. Maybe that would help deepen our connection.

Consultant: Yes, openness can really foster connections. By showing that you're interested in their thoughts and feelings, you create space for deeper communication. How are you feeling about trying this approach?

User: I feel encouraged! It feels easier to think about being more open than always being worried.

Consultant: That's great to hear! Encouragement can lead to growth. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on some strategies such as practicing conversation, preparing questions, and maintaining an open mindset. What do you think will be your next steps?

User: I will try to talk to my friend this week and use those conversation starters. I also want to remind myself not to stress too much if it doesn't go perfectly.

Consultant: Sounds like a solid plan, Shao! Remember, you’ve got these tools at your disposal, and it’s a learning process. I’m proud of your willingness to take these steps. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about my friendships now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. As we conclude today’s session, let’s remember these strategies and keep building on your progress. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need to talk before then!

User: Will do! Thank you so much for your help today. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Shao! Take care, and see you next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello Shao! Welcome back to our session. I'm glad to see you've made some progress in understanding your mother's temperament. How are you feeling about that today?

User: Hi. I'm feeling a bit relieved, actually. Understanding her makes it easier for me to approach her, but I'm still a little tense when we're together. I really want our home to feel more harmonious.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling more at ease but still facing some tension in those interactions. Can you share an example of a recent interaction with your mother where you felt this tension?

User: Well, the other day we had a small argument about my grades. I tried to explain my side, but I felt like she didn’t want to listen and just kept blaming me. I felt frustrated.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. You were hoping to communicate your feelings, but it seems like her response didn't help. What were you thinking in that moment when you felt she wasn’t listening?

User: I thought to myself, "Why doesn’t she understand what I’m trying to say?" It made me feel helpless and stressed.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel helpless when you’re trying to communicate and not being heard. How did that experience affect your overall mood afterwards?

User: I was upset for the rest of the day. It just made me question if she really cares about my feelings at all.

Consultant: It’s painful to feel like your feelings aren’t acknowledged, especially by someone close to you. Can you think of any strategies we could explore to help you express yourself more effectively to her? 

User: Maybe I could try to calm myself before talking to her? I just don’t know how to express what I feel without getting defensive. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Calming yourself can help you communicate better. We could work on some specific phrases or techniques that might make it easier for you to express your feelings without feeling defensive. How does that sound?

User: Yeah, that sounds good. I just want her to understand me without it turning into an argument.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s practice a few phrases that you could use when you’re feeling anxious before a conversation with her. For instance, you could say, “I’d like to share how I feel about this situation. Can we take a moment to talk?" How does that feel to you?

User: I think that’s helpful! Me asking for a moment could make it less confrontational.

Consultant: Exactly! It sets a positive tone for the conversation. Now, can you think of a scenario coming up where you might want to use this approach with your mother?

User: I think I can try it next time she brings up my grades. That seems to be a regular trigger for arguments.

Consultant: That’s a good plan. When she brings up your grades, you can start with that request to open the dialogue. It may also be helpful to express how you feel about the pressure. Would you be willing to practice that with me?

User: Sure! Okay, let me try. Mom, I’d like to share how I feel about my grades. Can we take a moment to talk?

Consultant: That was a great start! You conveyed your desire to talk, which is a significant step. How did it feel saying that?

User: It felt okay, I think. I felt a bit nervous, but it seems like a good way to open up.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous, especially when trying something new. The important thing is that you're making an effort to communicate. Now, what about after the conversation? How might you follow up if it goes well?

User: Maybe I could ask her how she feels about what I shared. That way, it could open up the conversation more.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Following up by seeking her thoughts shows you’re open to dialogue. If she responds positively, how might you feel after that?

User: I’d feel more connected. It would be nice to have her understand my perspective.

Consultant: Exactly! And feeling connected can significantly improve your relationship. Let’s also think about how you can handle it if it doesn’t go as smoothly as you hope. What would you do?

User: I guess I could take a step back and try to stay calm, even if she doesn’t react well.

Consultant: Yes, taking a step back is an excellent strategy. It allows you to keep your composure. Would you like to talk about some calming techniques that can help you stay centered in those moments?

User: Yes, I think that would help a lot. I often feel overwhelmed when things escalate.

Consultant: Let’s explore deep breathing exercises. When you notice that tension rising, you can take a deep breath in for four counts, hold for four counts, and exhale for four counts. Would you like to give it a try together?

User: Okay, I’ll try that now. *takes a deep breath* 

Consultant: Great! And remember, you can use that technique anytime you start to feel overwhelmed. It can help ground you. As we continue, let’s also consider how you can apply these strategies to other areas, like meeting new people. How do you feel about that?

User: I’m actually excited but a little anxious about fitting in. I don't want to be left out again.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to have mixed feelings about new situations. Let’s focus on strategies to ease that anxiety and help you engage with new groups. Have you considered any activities you might enjoy joining?

User: I was thinking about trying out for a club at school. I just hope they accept me.

Consultant: Joining a club sounds like a fantastic opportunity! It can help you connect with others who share similar interests. What if we brainstorm how you could approach new members to break the ice?

User: Maybe I could ask a question about something they like? That might be an easy way to start talking.

Consultant: Exactly! Asking questions can create an inviting atmosphere for conversation. Remember, everyone is often just as eager to connect. You’re already taking great steps to improve both your home life and your social interactions!

User: Thanks! I feel like I have some plans now. I hope I can use these strategies effectively. 

Consultant: You’ve made wonderful progress, Shao! Keep reminding yourself of these strategies, and don’t hesitate to practice them. Remember, it’s okay to feel anxious, but you’re gaining valuable skills to navigate these situations. 

User: I feel more hopeful about it now. Thank you for your help today!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in your ability to create positive changes. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Shao! Welcome to today's session. I’m glad you're here. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety about joining the interest club at school. I really want to make friends, but I'm also worried about being rejected again.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel both excited and anxious, especially when trying something new like joining a club. Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you about this new environment?

User: I guess I’m afraid that I might not fit in or that they will judge me because of my weight. My grandma always criticizes me for it, and I just have this fear that others will do the same.

Consultant: That's a tough feeling to carry, especially with your grandmother's comments weighing on you. It sounds like you're concerned about being judged. What do you think are some ways those fears affect your feelings about joining the club?

User: I think my fears make me hesitate to talk to people, and I worry that I won't be able to connect with them. It always feels like I'm on the outside looking in.

Consultant: Feeling like an outsider can be really challenging. Let's explore your thoughts a bit deeper. When you imagine joining the club, what specific thoughts go through your mind? 

User: I often think, “What if they don’t want me to be part of their group?” or “What if they laugh at me?” Those thoughts just make me want to back away.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite distressing. Let's try to challenge them together. What evidence do you have that they wouldn’t want you in the group? 

User: I don’t really have any solid evidence; it’s mostly just my worry talking. I guess I’m projecting my past experiences onto this new situation.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, Shao. Past experiences can shape our expectations, but they don’t always predict the future. If you were to look at this situation more positively, what might you tell yourself instead?

User: I could tell myself that not everyone will judge me and that some might actually like me for who I am. Maybe they won't care as much about my weight.

Consultant: That’s a great alternative thought! Focusing on the possibility of acceptance can really shift your perspective. Let’s think about what small steps you could take to reinforce this positive belief when you join the club.

User: Maybe I could start with just saying hello to a few people and seeing how they respond without putting too much pressure on myself.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan, Shao. Starting with a simple greeting can make the idea of interacting feel less daunting. How do you feel about trying that?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful about it. It seems manageable, but I'll need to remind myself to stay calm.

Consultant: Absolutely, and remember, it's okay to feel anxious. Now, let's discuss some techniques you can use to manage that anxiety when you approach someone. How do you typically handle your anxiety in stressful situations?

User: I usually just avoid the situation or try to distract myself, but I know that’s not helping.

Consultant: Avoiding can sometimes provide temporary relief, but it’s great that you want to address it more directly. What if we explored some relaxation techniques together that you could use before talking to someone?

User: That could be helpful. I’ve heard about deep breathing exercises before; maybe that could work?

Consultant: Deep breathing is a wonderful tool! You could practice taking slow, deep breaths to calm yourself before approaching someone. Would you like to try a quick deep breathing exercise right now?

User: Sure, I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment to breathe together. Inhale deeply through your nose... hold it for a few seconds... and now exhale slowly through your mouth. Let’s do this a few times. 

User: That actually feels nice. I feel a bit more relaxed already.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Regular practice can help you regain calmness when you feel anxious. How do you think you can incorporate this practice into your daily routine?

User: I could try doing it whenever I feel overwhelmed or before I know I’ll be in a social situation.

Consultant: That sounds fantastic! It’s all about finding what works for you. As you prepare to join the club, let’s reflect on your progress. What do you think has changed for you since we started these sessions?

User: I feel like I have more tools to manage my anxiety and a better understanding of my thoughts. It’s comforting to know that I can challenge them.

Consultant: Absolutely, Shao! Recognizing and challenging those thoughts is a significant step forward. As we prepare to wrap up today’s session, what strategies do you think you’ll use going forward to maintain this progress?

User: I will focus on deep breathing, remind myself of positive thoughts, and take small steps to engage with others.

Consultant: That’s a well-rounded approach! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made today. Remember, it’s okay if things take time, and you can always reach out if you need support again. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I wish you all the best in the interest club. Take care, and remember that you’ve got this!
