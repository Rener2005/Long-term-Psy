Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. I understand you've been feeling anxious and concerned about your appearance lately. Can you share a bit more about what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. Yes, I feel really anxious about my weight and how others perceive me, especially since some classmates commented on my face and body. It's made me really self-conscious and I can't stop thinking about it.

Consultant: It sounds really tough to have those comments affect how you feel about yourself. Let's explore this together. How do these thoughts make you feel on a daily basis?

User: I often feel ashamed and frustrated. I believe I'm bigger than everyone else and that people see me as unattractive. It’s like I can’t escape those thoughts.

Consultant: That sounds overwhelming. So, these thoughts are deeply affecting your self-image. Can you tell me a specific situation where you felt particularly anxious about your appearance?

User: Last week, during gym class, I wore a tighter shirt, and I felt everyone was staring at my body. I couldn't concentrate on anything else, and I just wanted to hide.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that experience. It’s understandable to feel uncomfortable in such situations. What thoughts were running through your mind when you felt that way?

User: I kept thinking that everyone must think I look terrible and that I should lose weight to be more attractive. It was awful.

Consultant: It’s really hard to have those thoughts. Let's take a moment to consider: how much evidence do you have that others think negatively of you based solely on your appearance?

User: I guess I don’t really have solid evidence. It’s just how I feel, especially after those comments. 

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight. A lot of our feelings can be based on assumptions or past experiences rather than current reality. How would you feel if you tried to challenge that thought by finding some evidence to support a different perspective?

User: I’m not sure. It’s hard to imagine that people might think differently. 

Consultant: That’s completely okay. It can be a process. If you could think of a time when someone complimented you or showed appreciation for who you are beyond your appearance, what comes to mind?

User: There was a time when a teacher praised my project in class. It made me feel good, but I still focused on my looks afterward.

Consultant: That’s a great example of your worth beyond appearance. We can work on recognizing these positive moments more. How do you think your life would change if you focused more on your talents and less on your weight?

User: I think I would feel more confident and maybe even less anxious. But I still feel guilty about not being thin.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel conflicted. Let’s talk about that guilt. What do you believe would happen if you allowed yourself to accept your body as it is right now?

User: I guess I fear that if I accept myself, I won't try to lose weight. I don’t want to be unhealthy either.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a fear of losing motivation to take care of yourself. It’s important to find a balance between self-acceptance and healthy living. How might we redefine what being “healthy” means for you?

User: Maybe it means eating balanced meals and being active, not just focusing obsessively on weight loss.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a healthier perspective. We can focus on creating a balanced approach to your diet and exercise without the pressure of drastic changes. What small step could you take this week to start this balanced lifestyle?

User: I could start by adding more fruits and vegetables to my meals instead of cutting out foods I like.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! It's about progress, not perfection. How do you feel about implementing this change?

User: I feel a bit excited but also nervous. I hope I don’t slip back into old habits.

Consultant: It’s okay to be nervous. Habits take time to change. What strategies can we think of to help you stay on track when you feel that temptation?

User: Maybe I could keep a food journal or talk to a friend when I feel tempted to restrict my eating.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Keeping a food journal can help you reflect on your choices, and having someone to talk to can provide support. How do you feel about speaking with someone, like a friend, about your feelings and goals?

User: I think it could help. I’ll consider talking to my friend who I trust.

Consultant: That’s a great step towards building a support system. Let’s reflect on some of the progress we’ve discussed today. What do you think is the most important insight you’ve gained from this session?

User: I think I’ve realized that my worth isn’t just based on my weight or how I look, and that there are healthier ways to manage my body.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization. You are unique and valuable beyond your appearance. As we wrap up, what would you like to focus on in our next session? 

User: I’d like to explore more about balancing my self-image and how to deal with negative comments better.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can dive deeper into that. Remember, it’s about progress and being kind to yourself along the way. If you ever need to talk, I’m here for you. You’re doing great work!

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to our next session. Take care and have a great week!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you could join me today. I understand there have been some challenges with your recent approach to weight management. How are you feeling about everything right now?

User: Hi. Honestly, I'm feeling really overwhelmed. After fainting the other day, I’ve been worried about how my extreme dieting is affecting me. I feel guilty for trying to control my weight like that.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience was quite frightening for you. It's important to acknowledge how your body responded to extreme dieting. What thoughts do you have about your eating habits now after that incident?

User: I’m starting to think that maybe my approach was too extreme. But I still really want to be thin and get that sort of approval from others. It’s hard to let go of that desire.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to have those feelings, especially with societal pressures around appearance. Let's discuss this a bit more—what do you think it would mean for you to find a balance between being healthy and achieving the body image you desire?

User: I guess it would mean feeling good about myself without having to starve. But I'm not sure what that looks like. 

Consultant: That's a great insight. Balancing health and body image is indeed a journey. Can you identify any specific unhealthy habits you’d like to address or improve?

User: I've been skipping meals and completely avoiding certain food groups. I thought that would help me lose weight faster, but it just leaves me feeling weak and anxious.

Consultant: It’s important to realize how skipping meals can create a cycle of anxiety and physical weakness. Let’s explore some healthier alternatives. What type of food do you enjoy that could fit into a balanced diet?

User: I love fruits and some whole grains. But I feel guilty sometimes eating anything that might have calories.

Consultant: It’s great that you enjoy healthy options! Remember, nourishing your body with a variety of foods can help you maintain your energy and support your overall well-being. How do you feel about gradually introducing these foods into your plan without guilt?

User: I think that might help. But I'm still worried about how others might judge me for eating more. 

Consultant: It's natural to be concerned about others' opinions, yet everyone's body and journey are unique. What if we focused instead on how these healthy choices are beneficial for you personally? How would that change your perspective?

User: If I focus on myself, I guess it would make it easier to enjoy food without feeling guilty. But the pressure is still there.

Consultant: It’s understandable that external pressures can be tough. Why not try to shift your focus to how you feel physically and emotionally after eating wholesome foods? Could keeping track of those feelings help strengthen your resolve?

User: That sounds like a good idea! If I can acknowledge feeling better after eating right, it might help me ignore those outside judgments.

Consultant: That’s a positive step forward. Recognizing your body’s needs and how food affects your mood can empower you. What small changes do you think you could begin implementing in your daily meals?

User: Maybe I could start by including a few more fruits each day and not skipping breakfast. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Starting your day with breakfast can set a healthy tone. How about planning a nutritious breakfast for yourself for tomorrow? What might that look like?

User: I could do oatmeal with fruits. It sounds nice.

Consultant: That sounds delicious and nutritious! Remember, it’s all about balance. As you incorporate these changes, keep an eye on how your energy levels and mood evolve. How do you feel about this plan moving forward?

User: It feels achievable. I just hope I can stick to it without slipping back into my old habits.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to have concerns, but you’re already making progress by recognizing the need for change. If ever you feel tempted to revert, just remind yourself of the reasons behind these healthier choices. What are those reasons for you?

User: I want to be healthier and not feel weak all the time. I also want to feel good about myself. 

Consultant: Those are strong motivators! Emphasizing health over numbers can demonstrate self-love. How do you plan to remind yourself of these goals when faced with temptation?

User: I could write them down and even keep them on my phone for quick reminders.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Writing down your motivations can be a powerful reminder. As we wrap up today’s session, how are you feeling about your ability to implement these changes?

User: I feel hopeful. I see that there’s a way to be healthy and not feel guilty about eating.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s continue working on this path together. Remember that every small step counts. In our next session, we can explore how these changes have made a difference for you. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: I am too! You've made considerable progress today. Remember, it's about balance and kindness to yourself. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Since the fainting incident during gym class, I've been feeling rather ashamed. It's made me question my extreme dieting. I realize I need to find a balance between being healthy and how I look.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience has really impacted you. You want to find a healthier approach to eating and exercising. Let's explore what a balanced lifestyle looks like for you. What are some changes you feel you might want to make?

User: I think I need to eat more regularly and not skip meals. I often focus too much on the calories and forget about nutrition.

Consultant: That’s a great insight. Focusing on nutrition is vital. What kind of foods do you enjoy that could also support your health?

User: I like fruits and vegetables, but I often feel guilty about eating anything that seems “unhealthy,” like carbs or sweets.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those feelings, but remember that moderation is key. Eating a variety of foods can actually contribute to a healthier body. Can you think of a way to include some of those foods in a balanced way?

User: Maybe I can allow myself to have some carbs but with meals that include vegetables and proteins. I just worry I will overdo it.

Consultant: It's a good start to plan your meals that way! How about setting specific portions for carbs? This might help you feel more in control while still enjoying them.

User: That sounds reasonable. If I set a portion limit, I think I could manage it better without feeling guilty.

Consultant: Exactly! Why don't we try creating a sample meal plan together that balances what you like and your nutritional needs?

User: Sure, I’d like that. I usually have breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but I often skip snacks because I feel they might add unnecessary calories.

Consultant: Snacks can actually be quite beneficial if chosen wisely. They can keep your energy levels stable throughout the day. What are some healthy snack ideas you might like?

User: I guess I could have some nuts or yogurt. I've never considered those as snacks before.

Consultant: Those are great options! Both nuts and yogurt can provide nutrients and help curb hunger. How do you feel about trying to incorporate those into your daily routine?

User: I think I’d be willing to try. I guess having snacks would reduce my hunger and might help me better manage my meals.

Consultant: Yes! That could positively impact your relationship with food. How do you feel about tracking your meals for a short period to see how these changes work for you?

User: I think tracking might help me stay accountable. It just feels overwhelming sometimes to write everything down.

Consultant: It can feel like a lot at first, but it doesn’t have to be detailed. Just noting the main meals and snacks can provide valuable insights. Do you think you can give that a try?

User: Yes, I can start with just a simple note on what I eat. I want to see how I feel about it.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Let’s set a goal for you to track your meals this week. Afterward, we can discuss how it impacted your feelings about food.

User: Alright! I think I can manage that. I'm also worried about my exercise routine. I feel pressured to work out to stay in shape.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that pressure, especially with your desire for perfection. What kinds of physical activities do you enjoy, aside from structured workouts?

User: I like dancing and occasionally jogging, but I skip them because I feel I need to stick to a strict gym routine.

Consultant: Those activities sound enjoyable! They can be great exercises as well. What if we explored a way to include dancing or jogging in your week alongside some gym workouts?

User: That sounds more fun! I’d love to dance more often and maybe run occasionally. I feel less pressure that way.

Consultant: Exactly! Finding joy in movement is important. Could we aim for a couple of dance sessions or jogs alongside your current routine each week?

User: Yes, I think I can manage that! Incorporating what I enjoy will help me stay active without feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re starting to find a balance. How do you feel about the progress you’ve made today in terms of diet and exercise?

User: I feel happy about these new ideas. They seem more manageable, and I hope they will help improve my self-image.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Progress sometimes comes from small adjustments like these. Before we finish today, let’s summarize what you've planned to do.

User: I’ll track my meals, try to include healthy snacks, and add some fun workouts like dancing and jogging.

Consultant: That’s an excellent summary! Remember, it’s okay to take this process one step at a time. I believe you can achieve a healthy balance. How do you feel about our discussion today?

User: I feel optimistic and less pressured. I have a clearer idea of what I want to do moving forward.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’ve shown great willingness to change. If you face challenges, remember to reflect on these strategies we discussed. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and advice. I’m excited to see how I do with these changes. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in you, and I’m here if you need help. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good actually. I’ve started adjusting my breakfast habits, and I think it’s really working for me. I feel more energetic and focused while studying.

Consultant: That sounds great! It's wonderful to hear that your new breakfast routine is making a positive impact. Can you tell me a bit more about how you feel this is helping you?

User: Well, I'm able to concentrate better on my studies, and I feel less tired during the day. I even feel more motivated to exercise a little bit!

Consultant: It sounds like your changes are really contributing to your overall well-being. That's a fantastic achievement! How do these changes affect your view of your body image?

User: I think I’m starting to see my body in a more realistic way. I’m focusing more on how I feel rather than just how I look.

Consultant: That's a significant shift! Focusing on how you feel is key to building a healthier self-image. What has helped you to reach this more positive perspective?

User: I guess it's the changes in my diet. I feel good about taking care of my body, and that’s making me feel more confident.

Consultant: That's a great point. Taking care of your body can enhance your confidence. Are there any specific moments or experiences recently where you felt especially confident about your choices?

User: Yes! When I went out with friends the other day, I felt good in my own skin. It was nice not to worry so much about how I looked.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Social support can really help reinforce positive feelings about ourselves. How did your friends react to your new habits?

User: They actually noticed that I seemed more energetic and talked about my new breakfast. It felt nice that they were interested and supportive.

Consultant: That sounds really encouraging! Having supportive friends can make a big difference. Do you feel that this support boosts your motivation to maintain your healthy lifestyle?

User: Absolutely! It makes me want to keep going with my healthy choices even more.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Let’s think about how we can keep that momentum going. What specific goals or strategies can we set for you to maintain this healthy lifestyle?

User: I want to keep track of my meals and exercise. I think logging them might help me see my progress.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Keeping a log can help reinforce those positive changes and allow you to reflect on your progress. How often do you think you can log your meals and exercises?

User: Maybe every day? I think it would be helpful to make it a daily habit.

Consultant: Daily logging sounds like an effective plan! It can also help you identify any patterns. Are there any challenges that you anticipate while doing this?

User: I worry that I might get too strict with myself or overthink things if I can't stick to it perfectly.

Consultant: That's a valid concern. It's important to remember that it's okay to have some flexibility. How can we maintain that perspective of grace towards yourself while tracking your habits?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s a journey and not everything has to be perfect all the time.

Consultant: Precisely! Emphasizing the journey rather than perfection can help reduce pressure. How would you feel about setting small, manageable goals for yourself?

User: That sounds nice! It would help me feel less overwhelmed.

Consultant: Wonderful! Setting small goals such as logging your meals on weekdays and perhaps checking in on weekends could be a great start. Would this sound doable for you?

User: Yes, I can do that! It feels more manageable.

Consultant: Great! As you work on this, it’s also useful to celebrate your successes, no matter how small. What kind of reward could you give yourself when you reach those little milestones?

User: Maybe treating myself to a fun outing or buying a little something I like!

Consultant: Those sound like lovely rewards! Celebrating success is key to maintaining motivation. How do you feel about your current self-acceptance in light of these changes?

User: I feel like I'm gradually accepting myself more. I hope I can continue this way.

Consultant: That’s such a positive outlook! Building self-acceptance takes time, and you're clearly making strides. How can we reinforce this progress in the coming weeks?

User: I think I could keep reminding myself of the positives I’m experiencing and share my journey with my friends.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Sharing your experiences with friends can strengthen your support system and reinforce your progress. Remember, you’re never alone in this journey.

User: Thank you for the encouragement! I feel more confident about moving forward now.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! It's inspiring to witness your growth. As we wrap up today, what would you say is the biggest insight you've gained from our conversation?

User: I think it’s the importance of balance and that I can enjoy the process of becoming healthier without being too hard on myself.

Consultant: Beautifully put! Balance is essential, and it sounds like you’re on the right path. Before our next session, I encourage you to practice that mindfulness and remember your strengths. 

User: I will! Thank you so much for your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Keep up the great work!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good lately. I feel more confident about my health and body after taking that nutrition course. My family has been supportive, which really helps.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re experiencing some positive changes in your confidence and support system. What specific aspects of your health and body are you feeling good about?

User: I’ve been more proactive about my eating habits and have started to enjoy cooking healthy meals. I feel like I’m taking control of my health.

Consultant: That’s an excellent step, taking control of your health through your diet. How do you feel about the changes you’ve been making? 

User: I feel really proud! I used to worry about my body image a lot, but now I see it as something I can improve through healthy choices.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re proud of your efforts. This shift in perspective is significant. What does a positive body image look like for you now compared to before?

User: Before, I was always comparing myself to others and being overly critical. Now, I’m focusing on my own journey and appreciating my progress.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization. Focusing on your personal journey can lead to a healthier mindset. Are there any challenges you're facing in maintaining these new habits?

User: Occasionally, I still feel the pressure to be perfect, especially when I see others who seem to have it all together. Sometimes that makes me anxious.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel that way, especially when comparing yourself to others. Can you share more about these thoughts when they come up? What do you feel when you think about perfection?

User: I feel overwhelmed and start doubting my efforts. It makes me anxious, and then I sometimes lose motivation.

Consultant: I understand how that can be challenging. Let's explore those perfectionist thoughts. Can you identify any evidence that supports or counters these feelings of needing to be perfect?

User: Well, I know that everyone has their struggles, but I tend to forget that when I'm in that mindset.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! Remembering that everyone has their challenges can help. If you were to mentor a friend feeling the same way, what would you tell them about managing these expectations?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on progress rather than perfection and remind them that it’s okay to have setbacks.

Consultant: That’s wise advice! You have great insight on how to help others. Let’s try applying that to yourself. How could you reframe those perfectionist thoughts when they arise?

User: Maybe I could tell myself it's okay to have ups and downs, and as long as I'm making an effort, that's what really matters.

Consultant: I love that reframe! Effort, not perfection, is what leads to growth. When you think about your future plans for maintaining this healthy lifestyle, what strategies do you think will help you stay on track?

User: I think setting small, achievable goals will help. Also, I want to keep cooking and trying new recipes—I enjoy that!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! Small, achievable goals can make a big difference in staying motivated. What would be your first step in creating one of those goals?

User: I could start by planning my meals for the week and trying at least one new healthy recipe.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Meal planning is a great way to stay committed to your healthy lifestyle. Before we wrap up today, let’s reflect a bit on your journey so far. What are some key takeaways you’d like to remember moving forward?

User: I’d like to remember that it’s okay to take things slowly and that I shouldn’t be too hard on myself. Progress is what matters—and to lean on my support network.

Consultant: Those are excellent insights! Recognizing support and accepting progress over perfection can be incredibly liberating. As we conclude today's session, what feelings come up for you about continuing on this journey?

User: I feel excited and hopeful! I have a clear path, and I'm ready to keep pushing forward.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Your enthusiasm and commitment are inspiring. Remember, you’ve made significant strides, and you have tools to manage any challenges that come your way. If you ever need support, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your guidance. I feel more confident about my path.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. As you carry these lessons forward, know that you're capable of maintaining this positive shift in your life. Looking forward to hearing about your progress next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress since our last session. How have you been feeling?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good actually. Participating in the school sports event really helped boost my self-image. I feel proud of my performance.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It seems like the sports event had a positive impact on how you see yourself. Can you tell me more about how this experience has influenced your thoughts or behaviors regarding your health and fitness?

User: Well, I’ve started thinking more positively about my body. I used to focus on my imperfections, but now I feel more motivated to maintain a healthy lifestyle and be active.

Consultant: That's a significant shift in thinking! Emphasizing the positive aspects of your body and feeling motivated is crucial for maintaining a healthy mindset. What specific steps have you taken since the event to support this change?

User: I've been going for runs a few times a week and trying to eat healthier snacks instead of junk food. I really enjoy the runs; they make me feel energized.

Consultant: It sounds like you're taking great steps toward supporting your health. Running and healthier eating are excellent choices. How do these changes make you feel in terms of your overall well-being?

User: I feel proud and accomplished. It's nice to see that I can actually improve my health and reach my goals. I like challenging myself.

Consultant: That's fantastic! Challenging yourself in a positive way can lead to substantial growth. Have you noticed any changes in your self-talk or how you respond to challenges since you started this healthier lifestyle?

User: Yes! I’ve realized that I can be my own support system. When I start to doubt myself, I remind myself of my achievements, like in the sports event. It helps me stay focused.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization! Supporting yourself through positive affirmations is a valuable tool. Can you think of an example where this self-support has helped you overcome a challenge recently?

User: There was a day when I felt really tired and didn't want to go for a run. But then I remembered how good I felt after the last run and decided to go anyway. It turned out to be one of my best runs!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic example of challenging those negative thoughts! You actively chose to push through that barrier and ended up with a rewarding experience. How did that make you feel afterward?

User: I felt amazing! It was like I proved to myself that I can do more than I think. It made me want to keep pushing myself even further.

Consultant: Excellent! It's great that you're finding motivation through your successes. As we discuss these changes, what do you think is the most important takeaway for you moving forward?

User: I think it's about believing in myself and my ability to create positive changes. I need to keep reminding myself of that.

Consultant: That's a key insight. Believing in yourself is foundational for sustaining these positive changes. How do you plan to keep this momentum going in the long run?

User: I want to set small weekly goals for my runs and maybe join a local running group to stay motivated. Being part of a community could help too.

Consultant: Those are fantastic ideas! Setting weekly goals can help maintain your focus, and joining a community will provide additional support and encouragement. Let's consider what specific goals you might set for the coming weeks.

User: I think I can start with running three times a week and maybe signing up for a local 5K event in a month. That gives me something to work toward!

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Having a clear goal like running a 5K will surely keep you motivated. Additionally, how do you feel about the idea of integrating healthy meal planning into your routine alongside your running?

User: I like that idea! I could plan my meals for the week on Sundays. It would make it easier to stick to healthier choices.

Consultant: Meal planning can indeed alleviate the stress of daily decisions and ensure you stay on track with healthy eating. What kinds of meals or snacks are you excited to incorporate?

User: I want to try more salads and meal-prepped lunches. Also, some healthy smoothies for breakfast would be nice!

Consultant: Those sound delicious and nutritious! Incorporating variety is essential for keeping your meals enjoyable. How do you feel about the support system you currently have, such as family or friends, in your health journey?

User: My family is really supportive, but I haven't talked much about my plans with them. I think they would be excited to hear about my goals!

Consultant: Sharing your goals with your family can add an extra layer of encouragement. They could even join you in some activities. What do you think would be the best way to bring this up with them?

User: Maybe I could set aside some time this weekend to chat and share my running plans. I think hearing their support would feel great!

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan. It could strengthen your commitment and make you feel even more supported. As we wrap up today's session, what are your main takeaways, and how do you feel about the future?

User: I feel really positive! I've identified goals and ways to support myself, and I know I can achieve them with some effort. I’m excited about my journey ahead!

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that you feel positive and empowered. Remember, you have the tools and support to keep moving forward. If you ever need guidance or feel stuck, don’t hesitate to come back for support. You’re doing amazingly well!

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help. I'll keep pushing forward and communicate my progress with you next time!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing about all your achievements. Keep believing in yourself, and take care until our next session!
