Consultant: Hello, Li! I’m glad you’re here for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last talk? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty anxious. Ever since the money went missing in my dorm, I can't shake the worry that my classmates think I took it. It’s really bothering me, and I feel misunderstood.

Consultant: I can see how that situation could bring up a lot of uncomfortable feelings for you. It's tough to feel like people might see you in a way that isn't true. Can you tell me more about what you’ve been thinking during this time?

User: Well, I keep replaying the moment in my head. I worry that if they know I'm struggling financially, they might think I’m a thief just because I’m poor. It makes me feel even worse about myself.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, Li. It seems like you’re linking your financial situation to how others might perceive you. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come up when you feel this way?

User: I think things like, "They must be judging me for my background," or "They probably think I'm desperate enough to steal." 

Consultant: Those are heavy thoughts. Can we explore how you feel when these thoughts occur? What emotions are coming up for you when you think that way?

User: I feel embarrassed and ashamed. I also feel like I don’t belong with them and that they’re looking down on me.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. Many people feel deeply affected by how others view them. Let’s take a step back—what evidence do you have that your classmates view you negatively or think you took the money?

User: There’s no solid evidence, I guess. They haven’t directly said anything. It’s just a feeling I have. 

Consultant: It’s good that you recognize there isn’t any direct evidence. Sometimes, our minds can jump to conclusions based on our fears. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them to think or do?

User: I would probably tell them not to worry too much about what others think and that they know they're not guilty.

Consultant: That’s wise advice! It seems you can see the situation more clearly for someone else than for yourself. Let’s try to apply your own advice to your thoughts. What would change if you thought, "They don't believe I'm a thief"?

User: Maybe I would feel less anxious and stop worrying about their opinions as much.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Li. By reframing your thoughts, you can create a bit of distance from your fears. What might you do differently if you approached your classmates with a more positive mindset?

User: I might be more open and try to engage with them rather than isolating myself out of shame.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step forward. Engaging with them could help you rebuild your confidence and alleviate some of that anxiety. What small actions could you take this week to start doing that?

User: I could try to join in some group activities, maybe study together or just chat more casually in the dorm. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking those small steps is key. Engaging in activities can help shift your focus away from worry and start building those connections. How do you think you’ll feel after trying that?

User: I think it would help me feel a bit more connected and less isolated. It’s worth a try.

Consultant: I love your openness to trying new things. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s talk about how you can remind yourself of your self-worth, independent of others’ opinions. What are some of your strengths that you can focus on instead?

User: I know I’m good at studying and I’m reliable. I also try to help others when they need it, like with homework.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strengths, Li! Remembering those qualities can help reinforce your self-worth. So as you face these situations in the future, keep reminding yourself of your value. How do you feel about that?

User: It makes me feel a bit better. I think I really need to focus on what I can control, like my studies and my friendships.

Consultant: Exactly! You can’t control what others think, but you can control how you respond and what you focus on. Just before we end, what are some strategies you can use if those anxious thoughts come up again?

User: I could remind myself of my qualities and maybe even talk to someone I trust about how I’m feeling.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan. Having a supportive person to talk to can be really beneficial. Remember, it’s okay to reach out when you’re feeling overwhelmed. I’m glad we could talk today, and I believe you’re taking positive steps forward. 

User: Thank you, I appreciate it. I feel a little lighter now. 

Consultant: You’re doing great, Li. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time! Take care until then.

Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I've been feeling the same, still worried about how my classmates perceive me. I keep replaying their words in my head, and I often feel left out.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're feeling quite sensitive to your classmates' behaviors and attitudes. Can you tell me more about what specific behaviors or words seem to affect you the most?

User: Well, sometimes they laugh or whisper around me. I can't help but think they're talking about me, and it makes me feel so insecure and anxious.

Consultant: It's tough to feel that way, especially when you’re in an environment where social connections are so important. What feelings or thoughts come to mind when you notice those behaviors?

User: I feel like I'm not good enough to be part of their group. It lowers my self-esteem, and I start doubting myself.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way when you're sensitive to those situations. What do you think about the idea that their laughter or whispers might not be about you at all? Could there be other explanations?

User: I guess they could be talking about something else... but I struggle to think that way when I feel alone.

Consultant: That makes sense, and it’s a common pattern to jump to conclusions that may not be true. Let's reflect on this: what evidence do you have that they are specifically talking about you? 

User: I don’t have proof, just my feelings. Whenever I’m anxious, my brain assumes the worst.

Consultant: That's a very valid point. It seems like your anxiety is leading you to make assumptions without having the full picture. How could you reframe your thinking in these situations?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that they could be discussing something else entirely and that it’s not personal.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Practicing that kind of reframing could help. Can we come up with a few affirmations or positive reminders for you to use when you're feeling that way?

User: Sure! Maybe something like “I am worthy of friendship” or “Their laughter is not about me.”

Consultant: Those are excellent affirmations! Repeating them can help shift your mindset over time. How does it feel to acknowledge your worthiness of friendship?

User: It feels reassuring, but I still doubt it sometimes. 

Consultant: Doubts can linger, especially if you’ve been feeling this way for a while. When those doubts arise, what strategies can you use to counteract them?

User: I suppose I could think about my strengths and the friends I do have. Maybe I can focus on the positive experiences instead of just the negatives.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Shifting focus to your strengths and positive relationships can reinforce your self-esteem. Have you had any positive interactions with your classmates recently?

User: I did join a study group last week, and that went well! We helped each other out, and I felt more connected. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like engaging in that supportive environment was beneficial for you. What can you do to create more opportunities like this?

User: I guess I can try to be more proactive in joining activities or groups where I share common interests with others.

Consultant: Absolutely! By putting yourself out there, you’ll open doors to more connections. How do you feel about the idea of being proactive in social settings?

User: It sounds a bit daunting, but also exciting. I need to remind myself that it's okay to reach out.

Consultant: That excitement is a great sign. Feeling a bit daunted is normal, but remember those affirmations we talked about. They can give you the confidence to step out of your comfort zone. 

User: Yes, I will keep repeating those affirmations to help me. 

Consultant: Excellent! Let's summarize what we've talked about today: you’re recognizing how your thoughts can skew your feelings about social interactions, and you’ve come up with affirmations and strategies for reframing your thoughts. How does that sound?

User: It sounds good. I feel like I have some tools now to help me.

Consultant: That's fantastic, Li! Remember, it’s a process, and it's okay to take small steps. As we come to the end of our session today, is there anything else you'd like to discuss or clarify?

User: No, I think we've covered everything I needed. Thank you for your help!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of the progress you've made today. Keep practicing those affirmations and strategies, and I’m here to support you anytime you need. 

User: I appreciate it! I feel a bit more hopeful now. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Li. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello Li! I'm glad to see you again. It seems like you've made some progress since we last spoke. How are you feeling today?

User: Hi! I think I'm doing a bit better. I’ve been trying to focus on my interactions with classmates, but I still feel a bit of discomfort sometimes.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling better overall. That discomfort is completely normal as you step out of your comfort zone. Can you share a specific situation recently where you felt that discomfort in a social setting?

User: Well, last week we had a group project meeting, and I found it hard to contribute my ideas. I was worried about what they might think of me.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty in sharing that. It sounds like you were struggling with self-doubt in that group meeting. Let’s explore that feeling a bit more: what negative thoughts crossed your mind when you were in the meeting?

User: I kept thinking that my ideas weren’t good enough. I also thought that my classmates would judge me if I spoke up.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite limiting. It sounds like you're experiencing some cognitive distortions, like "all-or-nothing thinking." Can you think of any evidence that might challenge those thoughts—that perhaps your ideas could be valued by your classmates?

User: I suppose there were times before when they seemed to appreciate my input, but I just could not recall those moments when I felt anxious.

Consultant: That makes sense. Often, we focus on the moments that reinforce our fears. Let’s try to challenge that thought: if a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about sharing their ideas?

User: I would probably tell them that they have good ideas and that every opinion counts in a group.

Consultant: Exactly! Now, let’s put that into practice. How about we role-play a situation where you share an idea in a group setting? This exercise can help reinforce your confidence in expressing your thoughts.

User: That sounds helpful. I'm a bit nervous, but I’d like to try.

Consultant: That’s a brave choice, Li. Let’s start. Imagine you’re in the meeting, and you want to suggest an idea. What would you say to introduce your point?

User: I’d say something like, "I have an idea that I think could work for our project." 

Consultant: Great start! Now let's add some detail to that idea. What might come after that introduction?

User: I could explain the benefits of my idea and how it could help us achieve our goals.

Consultant: Perfect! Remember, framing your ideas positively can enhance how others perceive your contribution. How does that make you feel about sharing your thoughts in real life?

User: I feel a bit more confident about it. It’s reminding me that I have something valuable to contribute.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Let's discuss strategies to help you reinforce this confidence before engaging in social situations. What small step could you take to participate more actively in class or group activities this week?

User: I think I could start by answering at least one question in class discussions. 

Consultant: That's an excellent goal, Li! By taking incremental steps, you'll build your confidence over time. How do you plan to prepare for that?

User: I could maybe jot down a few points or questions beforehand to make sure I feel ready.

Consultant: Very practical! Preparation can help alleviate anxiety. As you do this, remember to celebrate each small success. How do you feel about implementing this strategy?

User: I feel good about it. It’s manageable, and I think it will help.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Throughout this process, it's important to acknowledge your progress. Let's take a moment to summarize what you've achieved today and how you can maintain this momentum.

User: I’ve recognized my negative thought patterns and practiced expressing my ideas positively in a group setting. 

Consultant: Exactly! And by continuing to participate and challenge those negative thoughts, you're on the right track to solidifying your social confidence. As we start to wrap up, how can you ensure you keep this confidence alive in the future?

User: I guess setting small goals and reflecting on my accomplishments will help. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflection and small goals are key. You've learned a lot today, and remember, it's okay to seek support whenever needed. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel really good! I have a clearer plan going forward.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Li! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. This session marks an important transition. Keep embracing these opportunities, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. You can do this!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Best of luck with everything. Remember, you’ve got the tools you need to succeed. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! It's great to see you again. I'm excited to hear about how you've been feeling lately and your experiences in class activities.

User: Hi! Thank you. I've actually been feeling much more confident since we last talked. I've started to engage more in class activities and interact with my classmates. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made some significant progress in being more social and involved. Could you share some specific moments when you felt confident while participating in these activities?

User: Well, during our last group project, I actually suggested some ideas and felt comfortable voicing my opinions. It was a big step for me.

Consultant: That’s an impressive achievement! Suggesting ideas in a group setting is a great way to build confidence. How did that make you feel, both in the moment and afterward?

User: At the moment, I was really nervous, but it felt rewarding when my classmates agreed with me. Afterward, I felt proud of myself. 

Consultant: Feeling proud is a wonderful sign of your growth. It’s important to acknowledge those moments. How do you think you can continue to build on this success in future activities?

User: I want to keep pushing myself to participate more. Maybe I can take the initiative to lead a discussion next time?

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent goal! Taking the initiative to lead can further boost your confidence. What steps can you take to prepare yourself for leading a discussion?

User: I guess I could write down some points and practice what I want to say beforehand. It might help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: Preparing in advance is a smart strategy! Writing down your points can give you structure and ease anxiety. How do you feel about practicing in front of someone before the actual discussion?

User: That could help a lot! I could ask a friend to listen to me and give feedback. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Having a friend support you can really make a difference. When do you think you’d like to practice?

User: Maybe this weekend? I have some free time then.

Consultant: This weekend sounds perfect. Setting aside time for practice can help you feel more prepared. Also, how do you plan to handle any nervousness you might feel when you start leading the discussion?

User: I think I might just take a deep breath and remind myself that it’s okay to feel nervous. Everyone else is probably feeling a bit nervous too.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a wonderful technique to manage anxiety. Remembering that others share similar feelings can also alleviate some pressure. How do you think this mindset can impact your performance during discussions?

User: It might help me relax and just focus on sharing my thoughts rather than worrying about what others think. 

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on sharing your thoughts instead of worrying can free you to express yourself more naturally. Is there anything specific you’d like to achieve through this discussion leadership experience?

User: I’d like to feel even more comfortable speaking in front of my classmates and maybe inspire them to share their ideas too.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Helping others feel included can enhance everyone’s experience. How can you encourage your classmates to share their ideas during your discussion?

User: I could ask open-ended questions and make sure everyone feels welcome to contribute.

Consultant: Absolutely! Asking open-ended questions creates an inviting atmosphere. As you prepare, think about some questions that might engage your classmates. Do you have any in mind already?

User: I’m thinking of asking, “What are some ideas you all think could improve our project?”

Consultant: That’s a great question! It opens the floor for collaboration and sharing. As you move forward with this plan, how can you remind yourself to stay positive and trust in your abilities?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal to write down my thoughts after each discussion. I can note what went well and what I want to improve. 

Consultant: A journal is an excellent tool for reflection! It can help you see your progress and provide insights into areas for growth. How do you feel about making journaling a regular practice moving forward?

User: I think I’d like that. It will help me stay focused on my goals and reflect on my experiences.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Li. Regular reflection can reinforce your progress and highlight your strengths. As we wrap up today, what's the most significant takeaway for you from our conversation?

User: I feel more confident about leading discussions. I’ve got a plan for practice and reflection, which makes me excited to participate more actively!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Your excitement and confidence are palpable. Remember, you’ve already shown great progress, and I believe you’ll continue to thrive in these situations. If challenges arise, you have the tools to manage them. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support and guidance.

Consultant: You're welcome, Li! It's been a pleasure to see your growth. Remember, I’m here to support you whenever you need. Good luck with your practice this weekend, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you're here today. It's great to hear that you've been enjoying school life lately. Can you share more about what you've been feeling recently?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling much more confident since I've been participating in more school activities. The praise from my teachers really helps. I feel like I'm starting to find my place.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're making significant strides in your self-esteem and social involvement. What do you think has changed for you that has allowed you to enjoy these experiences more?

User: I guess I'm starting to see my value more. Before, I often felt I wasn't good enough to participate in these activities, but now, I feel more welcomed and noticeable.

Consultant: It sounds like you're starting to shift your perspective about your self-worth, which is a fantastic step. Can you think of specific moments or interactions that contributed to this change?

User: Well, when I participated in the debate competition, I received positive feedback. It made me realize that my opinions matter and that I can contribute meaningfully.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, Li! Engaging in activities and receiving positive feedback can really help reinforce that sense of value. How does that feedback influence your thoughts about yourself now?

User: It makes me feel more capable. I used to second-guess myself so much, but now I feel like I can actually make a difference when I speak up.

Consultant: That's excellent progression! Challenging those doubts is a big part of building self-confidence. Let’s explore some of those thoughts. When you find yourself doubting, what kind of thoughts typically come to mind?

User: I used to think things like, “What if I mess up?” or “Everyone else is better than me.” But now, those thoughts have become less frequent.

Consultant: It's significant that you've noticed a decrease in those negative thoughts. What do you think has helped you to face those doubts more effectively?

User: I think participating more and getting positive feedback has changed my outlook. It's like I have more evidence now that I can do well.

Consultant: That evidence is key! How about we work on solidifying those positive beliefs about yourself? What do you think would be a good way to document these successful experiences and remind yourself of them later?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal of my achievements or positive feedback I receive. I could look back on it whenever I feel doubtful.

Consultant: A journal sounds like a great idea. It will serve as a tangible reminder of your achievements and contributions. Would you be willing to start this journal and perhaps set a specific goal for how often you'd like to write in it?

User: I think I could write in it at least once a week, especially after activities or important classes.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Li! Setting a regular time to reflect on your experiences can really help cement those positive thoughts. Are there any other strategies you’d like to discuss to continue building your confidence?

User: I’m not sure. I guess just keeping up with participating in more activities is a good start?

Consultant: Absolutely! Staying involved in activities will continue to boost your self-esteem. How do you feel about trying to participate in something new that makes you a bit nervous?

User: That could be helpful. I sometimes want to join the drama club, but it feels intimidating.

Consultant: Joining the drama club could be a fantastic opportunity! It might feel intimidating, but it can also be a safe space for self-expression. What are some small steps you could take to gradually involve yourself in that group?

User: Maybe I could attend a few meetings or watch a rehearsal first to see how it all works. That feels less daunting.

Consultant: That sounds like a smart approach, Li. Observing first will provide you insight and help you feel more comfortable. Could setting a specific date to attend their next meeting be helpful?

User: Yes! I can plan to go to their next meeting this Friday. It would feel good to have a plan.

Consultant: Great! Having a plan can help reduce anxiety and give you something to look forward to. Let’s also make sure you keep affirming positive thoughts after you attend. How do you think acknowledging your feelings after that experience could look?

User: I could write down my feelings about the experience in my journal, whether they’re positive or negative. That way, I can evaluate everything.

Consultant: Excellent idea, Li! Reflecting on your feelings will not only help you process the experience but also remind you of your growth. How are you feeling about all the strategies we've discussed today?

User: I actually feel really excited and motivated now. It’s nice to think about these possibilities instead of feeling afraid.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Focusing on excitement can help shift your mindset. Before we finish today, let’s summarize what you’ve done well and your plans going forward. What stands out to you?

User: I’ve recognized my progress in self-worth, and I have a plan to keep a journal and try new activities, like the drama club.

Consultant: Very well put, Li. You’ve made great progress in building your self-esteem and social confidence. Remember, you can return to your journal whenever you need a boost. 

User: Thank you! I feel more positive about my experiences and the future.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Keep embracing these new opportunities, and know that you can build on this progress. If you feel stuck or need assistance later, I'm here for you. 

User: I appreciate that! I’ll make sure to follow through with everything we discussed.

Consultant: Fantastic! I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care, Li!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! It's great to see you again. I'm glad to hear about the positive changes in your life. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good, actually. My confidence has improved a lot, especially after taking part in those social activities. I feel like I'm becoming more involved with my classmates.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like engaging more with your peers has had a significant positive impact on your confidence. What specific moments or experiences have you enjoyed the most?

User: I think leading a group project was a big step for me. I was nervous at first, but it turned out to be really rewarding. I've also enjoyed making new friends through these activities.

Consultant: Leading a project can be quite daunting, but it sounds like you handled it well! What did you learn about yourself through that experience?

User: I realized that I can take charge and that people actually look to me for guidance. It feels good to be depended on, and it boosted my self-esteem a lot.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that you recognized your capability to lead and that it made you feel valued. This seems to correlate with your increased self-acceptance. How do you think you can continue to nurture this newfound confidence moving forward?

User: I want to keep participating in more activities and perhaps take on roles that challenge me even more. I think that will help me grow further.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Engaging in more challenging situations can further enhance your skills. What might be some specific activities that interest you, and how can you incorporate them into your routine?

User: I’ve thought about joining a debate club or a volunteer group. I also want to connect with my classmates outside of class more often, maybe study together or hang out.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent opportunities to develop your social skills further and build connections. How do you feel about balancing these activities with your academic responsibilities?

User: I think I can manage it. I’m starting to feel more energetic and motivated, but I worry about losing focus on my studies again.

Consultant: It's understandable to have that concern, especially as you're balancing various engagements. Let's explore how you might maintain that balance. What strategies do you think could help you prioritize your studies while continuing your social involvement?

User: I could create a schedule that dedicates certain times for studying and certain times for social activities. I think setting aside specific times would help me stay organized.

Consultant: A structured schedule sounds like a practical approach. It can help you allocate your time effectively. Have you tried any time management techniques before that worked well for you?

User: I’ve used a planner before, and it helped me stay on top of things. I think I could start doing that again, especially with exams coming up.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Using a planner to track your commitments and study sessions can help you feel more in control. How does planning your study time make you feel in terms of your anxiety about exams?

User: I think it would reduce my anxiety because I’d have a clear idea of what I need to do each day instead of feeling overwhelmed at the last minute.

Consultant: Exactly! Having a clear plan can reduce that feeling of being overwhelmed and help you approach your studies more calmly. What small steps can you take this week to start implementing this planning strategy?

User: I could sit down this weekend to map out my schedule for the next couple of weeks, including both study time and social activities.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Setting aside some time to map things out will give you a sense of direction. Is there anything else you feel might help you maintain this balance effectively?

User: I think sharing my plan with a friend might help me stay accountable. If someone else knows, I’d feel more committed to sticking to it.

Consultant: Accountability can be a strong motivator! Sharing your goals and plans with a friend is a great step. How do you feel about reaching out to someone for this support?

User: I feel pretty good about it! I have a few friends who I believe would be supportive and willing to help me stay focused.

Consultant: That’s encouraging! Building a support system can strengthen your commitment to your goals. As we wrap up today, what is one key takeaway you'd like to remember from our session?

User: I think the importance of having a balanced schedule and maintaining accountability with friends is what stands out to me the most.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! I encourage you to embrace this balance. How do you feel now, knowing you have a plan to continue these positive changes in your life?

User: I feel optimistic and ready to take action. I’m excited to see how this will help me stay on track.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that, Li! It sounds like you’re well on your way to maintaining your newfound confidence and stability. Remember, I’m here to support you whenever you need. Do you feel we've covered what you wanted today?

User: Yes, I think we've addressed everything. Thank you for your support!

Consultant: You’re welcome! It's always a pleasure to work with you. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!
