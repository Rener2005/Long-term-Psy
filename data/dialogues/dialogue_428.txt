Consultant: Hello, Ms. Zhang! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious. The social worker has been pushing for me to start treatment to regain custody of my children, and it's just overwhelming. I feel like I'm under so much pressure.

Consultant: I can see how that would create a lot of anxiety for you. It's a significant situation, and it’s understandable to feel overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about what specifically is causing you the most stress right now?

User: I just keep thinking about how I might never get my children back. It’s hard to accept that I’ve lost them, and I’m worried about what happens next.

Consultant: Losing custody can be a very painful experience, and it’s natural to feel confusion and helplessness in such a situation. If you could envision a better future where you had your children back, how does that look to you?

User: I imagine being stable and providing a loving environment for them. But right now, it feels like that’s just a dream.

Consultant: That vision is very important, Ms. Zhang. Having a clear picture of what you want can help guide your steps forward. Let’s explore what feelings come up when you think about that ideal scenario. What thoughts cross your mind?

User: I just feel like I’m not enough. I think about my past mistakes, and I’m so afraid that the social worker will see that I’m not fit to be their mother.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of shame about your past. Those thoughts can be really heavy. I wonder, can we take a moment to challenge those thoughts? What evidence do you have that you’re not enough as a mother now?

User: I guess I don't have clear evidence. It's just this feeling I can’t shake off. I remember the times I struggled with drinking, and that haunts me.

Consultant: That memory can be very powerful and may cloud your current abilities. Let’s think about it this way: if a friend came to you with similar struggles, how might you respond to them about their worth as a parent?

User: I would probably remind them that they can change and that they are doing their best, but somehow, I can’t apply that to myself.

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate perspective. It’s important to apply that same kindness to yourself. What if we tried to replace some of those negative thoughts with more supportive ones? For instance, can you frame your past in a way that highlights your growth instead of just focusing on the mistakes?

User: I could say that I have recognized my issues and am actively trying to overcome them. But it feels like such a small step compared to how far I have to go.

Consultant: Every small step counts, Ms. Zhang, especially in the process of change. Let’s think about some concrete actions you can take that align with your desire to create a stable environment for your children. What could be a first step for you?

User: I think I could start attending support groups. That could help me stay accountable and feel less alone.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Having that support can provide a sense of community and encouragement. How do you think it might feel to take that step?

User: I hope it would help me feel more connected and less isolated. But still, I’m scared of judgment.

Consultant: It’s completely valid to feel scared. Many people feel vulnerable in such settings. Let’s explore that fear. What do you think is the worst that could happen if you faced that judgment?

User: I guess I worry that it would prove what I think about myself—that I’m not a good mother.

Consultant: It seems like there’s a cycle of negative thinking here. What if you were to approach this with openness instead? People in support groups can often relate to your struggles and provide encouragement rather than judgment.

User: Maybe I can challenge myself to go with the mindset that I’m there to learn, not to be judged. That might help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Shifting your perspective might make a significant difference. Remember, everyone is there to support each other. Would it help for you to set a goal for when you might start attending these groups?

User: I could aim for next week. It feels like a good timeframe to prepare myself mentally.

Consultant: That sounds very reasonable. Preparing yourself mentally is a great way to ensure you have the support you need. As you think about this plan, how does that make you feel about your ability to handle your anxiety?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful, but I also still have that nagging anxiety. 

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you feel some hope! Anxiety can be persistent, especially in challenging situations. Let’s consider some techniques to manage that anxiety as you approach your goal. Do you have any strategies that work for you when you feel anxious?

User: I usually try to breathe deeply or distract myself with television.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be very powerful. Would you be open to practicing some breathing techniques here, so you have them in your toolkit when you need to manage anxiety?

User: Sure, I think that would be helpful.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment together. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four... hold it for four... and now exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. How does that feel?

User: It actually helps a little. I feel a bit calmer.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, you can use this technique anytime you begin feeling overwhelmed. Let’s wrap up today. What’s one key takeaway you’d like to remember from our discussion today?

User: I think I’d like to remember that I'm on a journey of growth, and it's okay to have fears. 

Consultant: Exactly, Ms. Zhang! Embracing your journey with all its ups and downs is a powerful approach. I believe in your capacity to manage these challenges, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. You’ve got this!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ms. Zhang! I'm glad you've decided to come for this session today. How have you been feeling lately, especially with the pressure you mentioned from your family?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite overwhelmed. The pressure from my relatives about regaining custody of my children is really weighing on me. I keep doubting my ability to be a good mother, and it makes me anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-doubt and anxiety due to your family's scrutiny. That's understandable. Let's explore this together. Can you share more about what thoughts come to your mind when you feel this pressure?

User: I often think, "What if I can't handle it?" or "What if they are right about me being unfit?" These thoughts really make my anxiety worse.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing those thoughts. It seems like these negative beliefs are quite strong for you. How do these thoughts affect your feelings and behaviors when you're confronted with family pressure?

User: They make me feel helpless and like I should just give up. Sometimes, I even avoid talking to them because I’m scared of their judgment.

Consultant: Avoiding those conversations certainly seems like a way to cope with the anxiety. However, it might also prevent you from showing them how much you want to improve. What would it feel like to challenge those negative thoughts and see things differently?

User: I guess it could feel liberating to reframe my perspective, but I'm not sure how to start.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Ms. Zhang. Let's work on that together. Can we start by identifying some evidence that supports or contradicts those negative thoughts? What experiences have you had that demonstrate your capability as a mother?

User: Well, I did manage to take care of my children on my own for a while, and they seemed happy. I also think I've made positive changes since addressing my issues.

Consultant: Those are valuable experiences that show your ability as a parent. Let’s challenge that narrative that you're unfit. What might a friend say to you if you expressed your fears to them?

User: They would probably tell me that I’ve done a good job so far despite my struggles, and that I shouldn't let others define my worth as a mother.

Consultant: Exactly! It's often easier to be kind to others than to ourselves. Let’s use that friend's perspective to create a more balanced view of your capabilities. What would you like to tell your relatives about your journey and growth?

User: I want to say that I’ve worked hard to become a better person and parent. I want them to see I am trying my best.

Consultant: That’s a strong message. Would you like assistance in crafting some affirming statements that you could use when you communicate with them or even reinforce in your mind?

User: Yes, that would really help. I think if I could say something positive about myself, it might boost my confidence.

Consultant: Let's create a few together then. How about something like: "I am committed to my self-improvement and my children's happiness," or "I have successfully managed challenges before, and I can do it again."

User: I love those! They feel empowering.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Empowering yourself through positive affirmations is a significant step. How about we take this a step further? Can you think of a small goal in your interactions with your relatives, perhaps a specific thing you could do or say?

User: Maybe I could arrange a family meeting to share my progress and plans with them. That could show I'm serious about being a better mother.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful goal! A family meeting could provide a platform for open communication and showcase your dedication. How do you feel about approaching that?

User: Nervous but excited! It feels like a good way to start changing the narrative.

Consultant: You're acknowledging both the nerves and excitement, which is healthy. Remember, taking small, courageous steps can lead to significant changes. Shall we explore some strategies to help you prepare for this meeting?

User: Yes, I think preparing would help calm my nerves.

Consultant: Great! We can role-play potential scenarios and practice how you would communicate your achievements and aspirations. This could boost your confidence. What do you think?

User: That sounds very helpful! I think practicing would make me feel more ready.

Consultant: Let’s dive into that. Imagine you’re in the meeting and a relative questions your ability. How do you think you could respond?

User: I could say, "I understand your concerns, but I've made progress. I’ve taken real steps to improve my situation for my children."

Consultant: That’s an excellent response! It’s assertive yet shows understanding. You’re standing your ground while acknowledging their worries. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel stronger just saying it. I like that I’m not dismissing their concerns but still standing firm.

Consultant: Absolutely! Balancing acknowledgment with confidence is key. This approach might help you feel more in control of the conversation. Are there other scenarios you'd like to practice or discuss before our session ends?

User: I think we’ve covered a lot! Just having this practice makes me feel more prepared.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today. You’ve identified strong affirmation statements, set a goal for a family meeting, and practiced effective communication strategies. How does that feel?

User: It feels empowering! I feel like I have a clearer path forward. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Ms. Zhang. Celebrate those steps! Remember, it’s all part of your growth journey. If you ever doubt yourself, return to those affirmations and the progress you've made. You’re not alone in this process.

User: Thank you for your support. I feel considerably more optimistic and ready to face the family situation now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in your capabilities. Keep utilizing the strategies we've discussed. Remember, I'm here if you need any more support in the future. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ms. Zhang! I'm glad you're here for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a mix of anxiety and accomplishment. I really want to improve my communication with my child, but sometimes I worry about not being enough for them.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling some accomplishment in your efforts. It sounds like you're making progress in your communication, but the anxiety about being there for your child is still weighing on you. Can you share more about what specific aspects of communication you’ve been working on?

User: I've been trying to listen more to my child and show them that I care about their feelings. We had a good talk the other day, and it felt like a breakthrough, but I still doubt myself sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really focusing on active listening and showing care, which are essential for building that emotional connection. What did that breakthrough conversation feel like for you and your child?

User: It felt amazing! My child opened up about some feelings they had, and I was able to respond positively. I felt proud but then I worried if that would last.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel proud of that moment while also fearing that it might not continue. Those feelings of doubt are common, especially when working on something as important as communication with a child. How do you usually handle those doubts when they come up?

User: I tend to overthink and replay conversations in my head, wondering if I said the right thing or if I should have done more.

Consultant: Overthinking those conversations can create additional anxiety. Let's explore those thoughts a bit. What do you notice when you replay those moments in your mind? What emotions come up for you?

User: I often feel frustrated and anxious. It’s like I’m stuck in a loop, and I can’t move forward. 

Consultant: That loop can be really tough to break. It sounds like those thoughts make it hard for you to feel good about your progress. Can you think of any alternative thoughts or ways to reframe those moments that could help ease that frustration?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that I’m learning. Each conversation is a step forward, right? 

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing that you’re on a learning journey is a positive perspective. What would it look like for you to focus on progress instead of perfection in your communication with your child?

User: I guess I could celebrate the small victories instead of just worrying about the setbacks. That might help me feel less pressure.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Celebrating those small victories can help shift your focus. How can you incorporate that into your daily interactions with your child moving forward?

User: I could acknowledge when things go well and share those moments with my child, so they feel valued too.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! By sharing those positive moments, you can strengthen your connection even more. Are there any specific situations where you felt you could practice this strategy?

User: Yes! I have a family activity planned this weekend, and I think I can use that time to connect and celebrate our good moments.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful opportunity! Engaging in activities together can foster a stronger bond. How do you feel about implementing this approach during your family time?

User: I feel excited and a little nervous. I want to make sure I do it right.

Consultant: It's natural to feel a mix of excitement and nervousness. Remember that it's okay to embrace those feelings. The key is to be present and open during the activity. How might you stay grounded and focused during that time?

User: I think I could practice some deep breathing before we start and remind myself to enjoy the moment without overthinking.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a fantastic technique to help you stay calm and present. It’s a reminder to be in the moment rather than letting worries take over. How does that strategy resonate with you?

User: It resonates well! I’ve used deep breathing before, and it does help me relax.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As you prepare for this family activity, what else can you do to foster a positive environment and encourage open communication?

User: Maybe I could set some fun ground rules for us to share openly? Like a “no judgment” zone where we can all express ourselves.

Consultant: That creates a safe space for everyone! A “no judgment” zone can encourage everyone to share their thoughts freely. How do you think your child would react to that idea?

User: I think they would appreciate it. It might also help them feel more comfortable sharing their thoughts.

Consultant: That's a great insight! It sounds like you’re creating an environment that nurtures trust and openness. How do you feel about your communication skills and the work you’re doing so far?

User: I feel more hopeful. Recognizing my progress makes me feel more capable. I still have work to do, but it’s nice to see I’m on the right path.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you’re feeling more hopeful and capable! That recognition can be very empowering. As we wrap up today, what do you think you can take away from our session regarding your journey with communication and connection?

User: I’ve realized that small steps matter, and celebrating victories is key. I can also rely on deep breathing to help me stay present with my child.

Consultant: Those are valuable takeaways! Remember that each step you take is important, and you’re building a supportive relationship with your child. How do you plan to continue this growth moving forward?

User: I think I’ll keep practicing reflective listening and also remind myself to celebrate the little moments we share.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Building those habits will definitely enhance your relationship with your child. Before we finish, do you feel you have the support you need as you move forward?

User: I think I need to find some social support. I often feel lonely, and talking to others could help.

Consultant: Seeking social support is a great idea. Staying connected with others can help reduce feelings of loneliness. Exploring community groups or networks could provide you with that connection. 

User: Thank you. I’ll look into that before our next session. 

Consultant: I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress and experiences. You’re doing important work, and I believe in your ability to create positive change. Remember, I'm here to support you whenever you need. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ms. Zhang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, I think. Attending the support group has really helped me feel less alone. I’ve shared my experiences and felt listened to for the first time in a while.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're beginning to recognize the power of social support. What aspects of the support group have you found to be most beneficial for your emotions and social interaction?

User: Well, just talking with others who understand what I’ve been through is so comforting. I feel like I’m not the only one dealing with these struggles. It helps me express my feelings without feeling judged.

Consultant: That’s a significant step forward. Creating a space where you can share openly is crucial. Have there been any specific situations in the group that stood out to you?

User: Yes, there was one session where someone shared a similar experience with parenting and it really resonated with me. It made me realize that I'm not alone in trying to be a good mother while managing my own issues.

Consultant: It’s great that you found a connection with someone else’s story! Recognizing shared experiences can certainly lessen feelings of isolation. How do you think these shared experiences are changing the way you see your own situation?

User: I think it makes me feel less hopeless about my circumstances. I see that others are managing their challenges and it gives me hope that I can too.

Consultant: Hope is a powerful motivator! As you’re beginning to feel more optimistic, what are some steps you might want to take moving forward? 

User: I’d like to be more proactive about looking for jobs. I know it will help improve my self-worth and support my daughter better.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal, Ms. Zhang. Finding a job can indeed boost your sense of self-worth and enhance your overall quality of life. What kind of job are you interested in, or what skills do you think you could bring to potential employers?

User: I’ve always been good at organizing events. Maybe something in administrative or customer service. I just need to build my confidence first.

Consultant: Building confidence is an important part of this process. Have you thought about ways you could practice or enhance your confidence in job-seeking scenarios?

User: I think practicing interviews or even just updating my resume would help. But I get really anxious thinking about it.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious, especially when facing new challenges. Perhaps we can explore some techniques to help manage that anxiety as you prepare. What do you think might help you feel more comfortable taking those steps?

User: I guess breaking it down into smaller tasks might help. It feels overwhelming when I think of the whole process.

Consultant: Absolutely! Breaking tasks down can make them feel more manageable. For instance, you could set a small goal like dedicating just 15 minutes a day to updating your resume. Would that be feasible for you?

User: Yes, that sounds doable. I can handle 15 minutes at a time. 

Consultant: That’s a great start! As you work on these small steps, how do you anticipate feeling after completing each task?

User: I think I would feel accomplished and a bit more confident in my abilities, which would be encouraging for me. 

Consultant: Feeling that sense of accomplishment can really propel you forward. Alongside this, remember to celebrate even the small successes, as they all contribute to your journey. How do you feel about continuing to engage with your support group while you pursue these job-related activities? 

User: I definitely want to keep attending. It helps to share my progress there, and I think they’ll give me good feedback.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Their support, combined with your proactive steps, can create a positive reinforcement loop. What will you take away from our conversation today that you can put into action?

User: I think I need to break things down into smaller tasks and keep sharing my journey with the group. That can really help me stay motivated.

Consultant: That’s a promising takeaway! As we wrap up today’s session, I want you to remember that you are making significant strides in your journey. It's perfectly okay to reach out for support and guidance along the way. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help and encouragement. It makes me feel more hopeful about everything.

Consultant: You're welcome, Ms. Zhang! I’m glad to be part of your journey. Keep focused on your goals and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. 

User: Definitely! I’m feeling more positive already. See you next time!

Consultant: See you next time! Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ms. Zhang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more hopeful lately, especially since I've met some inspiring friends in the support group. It's really motivated me to think about job opportunities.

Consultant: That sounds promising! It's great to hear that you're feeling more hopeful and motivated. What kind of job opportunities are you thinking about exploring?

User: I’ve been considering roles in customer service or administrative work. I feel like those align with my skills, but I’m not sure how to get started.

Consultant: It’s a wonderful choice to think about customer service and administrative roles. What specific skills do you feel you have that might suit those kinds of jobs?

User: I think I’m good at communicating with people and organizing tasks. I used to manage my time well when I was working, but now I feel a bit lost.

Consultant: It’s very positive that you recognize your communication and organizational skills. Let’s build on that! Have you thought about ways to refresh those skills as you prepare to look for a job?

User: I haven’t really thought about it. Maybe I could look for some online courses?

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent idea! Online courses can help you regain confidence in your skills. Is there a particular area you’d like to focus on, like improving your communication or enhancing your organizational skills?

User: I think improving my communication skills would be helpful. I sometimes feel anxious when talking to new people.

Consultant: It's quite common to feel anxious in those situations. We can work together to manage that anxiety. Would you like to share more about what makes you feel anxious when talking to new people?

User: I worry about saying the wrong thing or not being interesting enough. It makes me hesitant to engage.

Consultant: Your feelings are entirely valid. Let’s explore that—what specific thoughts come to your mind when you think you might say the wrong thing?

User: I often think people will judge me or think I’m boring. It makes me avoid social situations.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite discouraging. Can we challenge them a bit? What evidence do you have that people would judge you negatively in those situations?

User: Well, I don’t have solid evidence. It’s just a fear I have based on past experiences.

Consultant: That awareness is a great first step! Let's consider if those past experiences represent the present. If a friend were in your position, how would you encourage them to think about social interactions?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on being themselves and that people generally want to connect.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on being yourself is key. What if we tried to apply that perspective to your own social interactions? How might that change your approach?

User: I suppose I could try to remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that everyone is just trying to connect.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset! Remembering that you’re all just trying to engage can reduce some pressure. How do you feel about practicing this mindset in your upcoming interactions?

User: I think I can do that! It feels less daunting now that I’ve thought it through.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! As for enhancing your communication skills, would you like to set a practical goal for yourself, like starting a conversation with someone new this week?

User: Yes, I would like to aim for that! Maybe I could talk to someone at the community center.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Engaging with others in your community can be a great way to build confidence. How do you feel about that step?

User: It feels exciting but a bit nerve-wracking at the same time.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel both excitement and nerves! Perhaps you could create a small script or a few questions to ease your anxiety during that conversation. How does that sound?

User: I like that idea! I’ll write down some questions I can ask.

Consultant: Fantastic! Writing down questions can help you feel more prepared. How about we check in next session about how that conversation went and your feelings afterward?

User: Sure! That sounds good. I look forward to it.

Consultant: Awesome! Before we end today’s session, let’s reflect on some of the progress you've made. How do you feel about the direction you're heading in with these job opportunities and managing social interactions?

User: I feel more confide
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ms. Zhang! It's great to see you here today. I’m glad to hear about the positive changes in your life. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! Thank you. I feel more in control of my life now and have more self-confidence. It's been a relief since I got the part-time job, and I hope to maintain this positive momentum.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Gaining more control and confidence is a significant achievement. Can you share with me what specific experiences or moments have contributed most to your sense of progress recently?

User: Well, getting that job felt like a big win for me. It made me realize that I can still manage things, even as a single mother. I've also been trying to connect more with friends, which helps.

Consultant: It's fantastic that you found a job that boosts your confidence! Social connections can be incredibly beneficial. What have you learned from those interactions with friends that you think is helping you maintain your positivity?

User: Talking with them allows me to vent my frustrations. It feels good to know that I'm not alone, and they provide support. This really helps my mood!

Consultant: That sense of support is vital, and it seems like you’ve built a strong network. Have there been any challenges that you've faced recently that might threaten this progress?

User: Sometimes, I still feel overwhelmed with my responsibilities. Balancing my job and taking care of my child can be a lot, and it makes me anxious occasionally.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel overwhelmed at times, especially with such significant responsibilities. When those anxious feelings arise, what thoughts typically come to your mind?

User: I often worry that I’m not doing enough—like I’m failing in my role as a mother or at work. This leads to a cycle of stress that’s hard to break.

Consultant: It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself. Let’s explore those thoughts further. What evidence do you have to support the idea that you are failing, and is there another way to view your situation?

User: Well, when I miss a deadline or don’t have time for my child’s activities, it feels like I'm failing. I guess I tend to focus only on the negative.

Consultant: Recognizing that tendency is an important step. Sometimes, we overlook our accomplishments. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you advise them to focus on?

User: I would probably tell them to celebrate the little victories and not be so harsh on themselves. I rarely do that for myself.

Consultant: That's a great insight! Celebrating small achievements can help shift your perspective. Let’s practice this. Can you recall some of the positives that happened in the past week?

User: I had a good day at work where I managed to complete all my tasks. Plus, my child and I enjoyed a fun afternoon together on the weekend.

Consultant: Excellent! Those are valuable experiences that highlight your successes. How might you remind yourself of these accomplishments when negative thoughts arise in the future?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal to jot down these good moments, so I have something to look back on when I feel low.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Journaling can help reinforce positive memories and achievements. Would you be willing to commit to this practice for the next few weeks?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful. I’ll try to write down at least one good thing each day.

Consultant: Perfect! That approach could significantly improve your mindset. Now, let’s think about your ongoing support needs. Is there anything specific you feel would help you continue on this positive path?

User: I think just regular check-ins would be good. Sometimes I feel unsure if I’m on the right track, so reassurance would help.

Consultant: Regular check-ins can provide that reassurance and help you refocus if needed. How would you feel about scheduling follow-up sessions to monitor your progress?

User: I’d appreciate that. Knowing I have support will motivate me to stay committed to my goals.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Your proactivity is commendable. As we wrap up our session today, how are you feeling about the strategies we discussed for maintaining your progress?

User: I feel more hopeful and empowered. Journaling and check-ins feel like solid steps I can take to keep things on track.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear. You’ve made significant progress, and I have no doubt that you can maintain your path of improvement. Remember, it’s okay to reach out whenever you need support. 

User: Thank you so much for your guidance. I really appreciate it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm proud of your achievements. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your continued progress in our next session!
