Consultant: Hello, J! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I’ve been thinking a lot about my interactions with that girl. I really admire her social skills, but I can't help but feel lost about how to approach my own style in relationships. 

Consultant: I understand that you feel a mix of admiration and confusion regarding her social skills. Let’s explore what aspects of her behavior stand out to you the most. What specifically do you find admirable? 

User: She seems so confident and at ease when talking to others. People are drawn to her, and I wish I could have that kind of presence. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful quality to have. Can you share more about how you feel when you compare yourself to her? 

User: It makes me feel inadequate, like I should be someone I'm not. Sometimes I think if I could just mimic her behavior, I'd be happier and more accepted. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. However, it's important to consider whether imitating her is the best approach for you. What do you think might happen if you tried to be more like her instead of focusing on your own style? 

User: I think I might just feel more lost. I mean, it feels wrong to pretend to be someone else. But at the same time, I don't know how to develop my own way of socializing. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're caught between wanting to be accepted and staying true to yourself. Could there be a middle ground where you can learn from her while still being yourself? 

User: That makes sense. Maybe I could pick up some of her techniques and still find a way to be authentic. 

Consultant: Exactly! Let’s think of some specific behaviors or techniques of hers that resonate with you. What would you like to adapt into your interactions? 

User: I like how she starts conversations easily and makes people feel comfortable. I want to learn how to do that without losing myself in the process. 

Consultant: That’s a great goal, J! Let's dive into how you could practice starting conversations. How do you usually approach talking to someone new? 

User: I'm often nervous, and I just freeze up. I don't know what to say or how to keep things flowing. 

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous. Many people experience that. How about we brainstorm some simple starters or questions you could use to ease into conversations? 

User: Yeah, that would help! I often just think about what to say, but I don't actually try to say anything. 

Consultant: Let's work on changing that. What if you set a small goal to ask someone a simple question, such as "How was your weekend?" How does that sound to you? 

User: That sounds doable. I guess I could try that next time I see someone in my class. 

Consultant: Great! And remember, it’s all about practice. The more you engage, the more comfortable you’ll become. How do you feel about that plan? 

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It’s nice to have a practical step to take rather than just thinking about it. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As you practice this, pay attention to how it makes you feel. Keeping a journal of your experiences might help you see your progress over time. 

User: I like that idea! I can note down how each conversation goes and my feelings about it. 

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Reflecting on your experiences can provide valuable insights. How about we also talk about any negative thoughts that might come up when you attempt to connect with others? 

User: Sometimes I think they’ll judge me or think I’m awkward. 

Consultant: It's common to worry about being judged. Let’s challenge that thought a bit. What evidence do you have that people think negatively of you when you try to engage? 

User: I don’t actually have any strong evidence, it's just a fear I have. 

Consultant: That's an important realization! Addressing those fears can open up more opportunities for connection. Would replacing that thought with something more positive help? 

User: Yes, I could try telling myself that people are more likely to appreciate my effort rather than judge me. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on encouraging thoughts could enhance your self-esteem during interactions. How do you feel about that perspective? 

User: I feel a bit lighter thinking about it that way. It doesn’t seem so daunting now. 

Consultant: Fantastic! Now we've discussed some practical steps and reframed some negative thoughts. How confident are you feeling about trying out these new skills in your next interactions? 

User: I feel more ready to give it a go. I’ll try to be more open and see what happens! 

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Remember, it’s a journey, and every small step counts. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to address in our time today? 

User: Not for now, I think this has been really helpful. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, J! You've made significant progress today, and I'm here to support you in further sessions. Keep working on your goals, and let's review your experiences next time. 

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to it. 

Consultant: You're welcome! Take care, and I'm excited to hear about your experiences at our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello J! It's great to see you today. I remember from our last session that you've been reflecting on the differences in interpersonal communication styles between yourself and your classmates. Can you share a bit more about what you've noticed since then?

User: Hi! Yes, I've definitely started to see those differences more clearly. It’s been a bit overwhelming, honestly. I see how my way of interacting feels different, and sometimes I question if it’s the right way.

Consultant: That sounds like a challenging experience. It's completely normal to feel uncertain when comparing yourself to others. What specific aspects of your interpersonal style are creating this sense of overwhelm for you?

User: I think it’s mostly about how I approach conversations. My classmates seem so effortless and confident, while I often hesitate and overthink what to say. This leads to me avoiding social situations which only adds to my anxiety.

Consultant: I understand how that can feel tough. It sounds like you’re feeling pressure to match the confidence of your peers. Can you describe a recent situation where you felt this way in a social setting?

User: Just last week, I was in a group study session, and everyone was chatting, making jokes, and I just sat there not knowing how to join in. I wanted to but felt like I would say something awkward.

Consultant: It makes sense that you felt stuck in that moment. Those feelings can create a real barrier to participating. When you reflect on that experience, what thoughts went through your mind as you watched your classmates engage?

User: I kept thinking that I don’t belong in those conversations and that I’ll embarrass myself if I speak up. It felt like my anxiety was just rooting me to my chair.

Consultant: Those negative thoughts can be quite powerful. Can we explore how accurate those thoughts truly are? For instance, what evidence do you have that speaking up would lead to embarrassment?

User: I suppose I don’t have any solid evidence. I just fear that I might say the wrong thing. It’s more of a gut feeling, I guess.

Consultant: It's understandable that our emotions can sometimes mislead us. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them when they feel anxious about speaking up in group settings?

User: I probably would tell them that it's okay to feel nervous and that they should just give it a try because they might be surprised by the outcome.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s great that you can empathize with others. How might you apply that same kindness towards yourself in these situations? 

User: I think I need to remind myself that everyone has their moments of awkwardness, and it’s not the end of the world. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent insight. Would you feel comfortable trying to challenge those anxious thoughts the next time you feel them arise? 

User: Yes, I think I’m willing to try that. Maybe I can practice some phrases in my head before I join a conversation.

Consultant: That's a good strategy! Preparing a few opening lines could help ease some of that pressure. How about setting a small goal for your next social interaction?

User: I could aim to contribute at least one comment! That seems manageable.

Consultant: I love that goal! It’s achievable yet pushes you a little outside your comfort zone. How do you feel about taking this approach moving forward?

User: I feel a little excited but also anxious. Still, I think if I keep reminding myself, I can handle it.

Consultant: That’s a nice balance of emotions to have. As you prepare for this goal, consider keeping track of your feelings and any progress you make. How do you see yourself managing those feelings leading up to your next interaction?

User: I might write down my feelings before going into the situation to process them. That could help.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Journaling can be a powerful tool to validate your feelings. As we continue through our sessions, we can explore more techniques that will work for you. How do you feel about the progress you’ve made today?

User: I’m feeling more hopeful. I think having these strategies in place gives me a sense of control.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Developing a sense of control can really help reduce anxiety. Remember, it’s a journey, and each small step counts. Do you have any worries or concerns as we wrap up our session today?

User: Not really! I just want to keep working on this. I appreciate your help!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, J! You’re doing important work on yourself, and I’m excited to continue our journey together. Let’s set a time for our next session!

User: Yes, I’d like that. Thank you so much again!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to seeing how you progress. Take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello J! It's great to see you today. Last time, we talked about exploring your personal style in social interactions. How have you been feeling about that since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling more comfortable with my style lately. I’ve been reflecting on how I interact with different people, and it’s been helpful to understand myself better.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more comfortable. That self-reflection is a valuable step. Can you share any specific experiences where you felt your style worked well for you?

User: Yes! I had a group project recently, and I was able to express my ideas without feeling too anxious this time. I felt like my input mattered.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant achievement, J! Feeling that your input matters is vital for building confidence. What do you think contributed to that success during the group project?

User: I think I was just being more open and willing to engage with my peers. I didn't hold back as much as I usually do.

Consultant: That's fantastic! Being open can really change the dynamic in group settings. Have you noticed any situations where you found it challenging to engage, or any lingering feelings of anxiety?

User: Well, I still find it difficult when I'm in larger groups or when I don't know anyone very well. I start to doubt myself and worry about how others perceive me.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way in new or larger social situations. Let's explore that. Can you recall any specific thoughts that come up when you feel that doubt?

User: I often think that people will judge what I say or find my ideas silly. That makes me want to stay quiet.

Consultant: I see. Those thoughts can be really tough to manage. Let's unpack them a bit. How much evidence do you think there is to support those worries? Could there be another way to view the situation?

User: I haven't really thought about it that way. I guess most of the time, people seem focused on their own discussions, and they might not be judging me at all.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s quite common for people to be more preoccupied with their own thoughts and concerns. How would you feel about reminding yourself of that before entering a social situation?

User: That could help! Maybe if I remember that others are focused on themselves, I wouldn't feel so pressured.

Consultant: That's a great insight, J. We can also practice some techniques to help you feel more confident in those moments. How do you feel about trying some role-play or scenario testing to build your comfort level?

User: I’d be open to that! I think practicing could really help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s imagine a scenario where you meet a group of new people. How would you typically introduce yourself in that situation?

User: I usually just say my name and that I'm a student, but I feel like it’s a bit boring.

Consultant: That’s a good start! How about we brainstorm a few engaging ways to introduce yourself that highlight your interests or hobbies? What do you think?

User: That sounds fun! I could mention my major or something I'm passionate about, like volunteering.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your passion can spark interest and make the interaction more engaging. Let’s try a practice introduction. How would you introduce yourself with that in mind?

User: Okay, I’ll give it a try. “Hi, I’m J, and I’m a student majoring in Environmental Science. I love volunteering with local wildlife organizations.”

Consultant: That was great, J! You shared your background and a personal passion, which can open up more conversation opportunities. How did it feel to say that?

User: It felt more authentic to me. I like that I’m sharing something I really care about.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic feeling! The more authentic you come across, the more others will resonate with you. What would be the next step for you after practicing this introduction?

User: I think I’d want to try it out in a real setting, maybe at an upcoming social event at school.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! As you prepare for that, remind yourself of your strengths and the interests that make you unique. How does that make you feel about the upcoming event?

User: I feel a mix of excitement and nervousness, but it's a good kind of nervousness. I’m looking forward to it!

Consultant: That’s a positive shift, J! Embracing that mix of feelings can actually help you be more present at the event. Let’s ensure you have some strategies in mind to manage any nerves you might feel there.

User: Sure, I can think of some positive affirmations to tell myself before I go in.

Consultant: Good idea! Affirmations can help ground you. What kind of affirmations might you use?

User: Maybe something like, “I am confident in my ability to connect with others” or “People are interested in what I have to say.” 

Consultant: Those are empowering affirmations! How do you feel about repeating them to yourself in the moments before the event?

User: That sounds like a plan! I think it’ll really help calm my nerves.

Consultant: I believe it will! Remember, J, practice makes progress, and it's okay to feel nervous. You’re building skills with each new experience. How do you feel about what we've worked on today?

User: I feel much more optimistic about trying new social interactions and exploring my style. I really appreciate your help!

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! You've made excellent progress today. As we wrap up our session, let's focus on what you've learned and how you can continue to reinforce this newfound confidence moving forward.

User: I will keep practicing my introductions and using affirmations before social events. Thank you!

Consultant: You're very welcome, J! Remember, I’m here for you, and I believe in your journey. If you ever need support, don’t hesitate to reach out again. Good luck with your social interactions, and take care!

User: Thanks! I’ll definitely reach out if I need to.
###################
Consultant: Hello, J! I’m glad to see you again today. Let’s take a moment to discuss how you’ve been feeling since our last session and your recent experiences with social activities. 

User: Hi! Thanks for having me. I’ve actually been feeling quite positive. Participating in campus events has made me more confident about my social skills. It was a bit nerve-wracking at first, but I enjoyed connecting with others.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear that you're feeling more confident. What specific feelings or thoughts did you notice during these social interactions?

User: I felt a mix of excitement and nervousness. Sometimes, I worried about saying the wrong thing, but most of the time, I was just focused on enjoying the conversations.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel a bit nervous when trying something new. How did you manage those worries when they came up?

User: I reminded myself that everyone else was just there to have a good time too, and it’s okay if I make mistakes. I tried to shift my focus from worrying to just being present.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Focusing on the present moment can really help reduce anxiety. Can you tell me more about your interactions? Were there any moments that stood out as particularly positive or enjoyable?

User: Yes, definitely! There was one time when I shared a funny story about a class project, and everyone laughed. It felt good to connect like that. I realized I have stories to share too.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization! It’s important to recognize your contributions to conversations. How did that experience affect your confidence?

User: It boosted my confidence a lot! I felt like I belonged there, and it encouraged me to participate more actively in the next events.

Consultant: That’s a significant step, J. It seems you’re truly embracing these new social experiences. What specific goals do you have moving forward to continue enhancing your social skills?

User: I want to keep attending more events and maybe even take the initiative to start conversations. I think I can develop deeper connections if I feel confident enough to approach others.

Consultant: Those are wonderful goals! Initiating conversations can be challenging but rewarding. What steps could you take to prepare for initiating those conversations?

User: I could think of a few open-ended questions or topics in advance that could help break the ice. Also, practicing with friends might help me feel more comfortable.

Consultant: Great ideas! Preparing some questions can make it easier to start conversations. How do you feel about practicing these skills in a safe environment with friends?

User: I think it would be helpful. It'll give me a chance to build that confidence before trying it out in larger groups.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. As you try these new approaches, how do you envision measuring your progress? 

User: I could keep a journal to note how the conversations go, what works, and where I can improve. I think that will help me reflect on my growth.

Consultant: Keeping a journal is an excellent way to reflect on your experiences! It will help you see your progress and areas for improvement. Have there been any challenges or fears you still encounter in these social settings?

User: Sometimes I still worry about saying something embarrassing. It’s not as intense as before, but it’s there.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to have those lingering worries. Let’s explore that thought a bit. When you think about potentially embarrassing yourself, what exactly runs through your mind?

User: I imagine everyone laughing at me or thinking I’m awkward. It really worries me.

Consultant: I can see how that thought can be quite distressing. How likely do you think that scenario is in reality? Have you experienced that kind of reaction from others in your recent interactions?

User: Not really. Most people have been friendly and understanding. I guess it’s more in my head.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. Often, our fears can be exaggerated in our minds. What could you tell yourself when those negative thoughts about embarrassment come up in the future?

User: I could remind myself that everyone makes mistakes, and it’s okay. Besides, I’ve had good moments that outweigh the bad ones.

Consultant: Absolutely! Acknowledging that everyone is human and imperfect is a key part of easing those fears. How confident do you feel in utilizing those reminders in your next social event?

User: I feel pretty confident. I think I can remind myself to focus on the good experiences rather than the fear of making mistakes.

Consultant: That’s excellent to hear! Emphasizing the positive experiences will help reinforce your confidence. As we wrap up today, what have you learned about your social interactions and the strategies you’ve developed?

User: I’ve learned that I can connect well with others and that my worries can be managed with positive thinking. It feels good to recognize my progress.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway, J. I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. As you continue practicing these social skills, remember to be gentle with yourself and celebrate your successes. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I’m looking forward to applying what we discussed.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here to support you. If any challenges arise, don’t hesitate to reach out. Until next time, keep working on those strategies, and I believe you’ll see even more growth. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, J! It’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? 

User: Hi! I’ve actually been feeling really good lately. I tried some new social strategies and got positive feedback from my peers. It feels great!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like those new strategies have really boosted your self-confidence. Can you share more about what specific strategies you used and how they made you feel?

User: Sure! I started engaging more in group discussions and made an effort to smile and make eye contact with everyone. I felt more connected and included, and the response was really encouraging.

Consultant: It sounds like those simple gestures have made a significant difference in your interactions. How did it feel to receive that positive feedback from your peers?

User: It felt amazing! I didn't expect such a warm response, and it really reinforced my confidence. I’m proud of myself for stepping out of my comfort zone.

Consultant: That pride is so important! It seems like you’ve made a lot of progress in a short time. What do you think helped you overcome any initial nerves you might have had?

User: I think reminding myself that everyone is just as nervous helped. Plus, I focused on enjoying the moment rather than worrying about how I was perceived.

Consultant: That's a great mindset to have. Focusing on the experience instead of self-judgment can really free you up to connect more with others. What would you like to focus on in today’s session to build upon this progress?

User: I’d like to explore how I can maintain this momentum and keep improving my social skills, especially in larger group settings.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s talk about strategies you can use to continue building on your success. What specific situations do you find most challenging when interacting in larger groups?

User: I sometimes feel overwhelmed in large groups, especially when trying to speak up or dominate the conversation. I worry others will judge my contributions.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Could we examine some of the thoughts that go through your mind in those moments? What do you typically think when you feel overwhelmed?

User: I tend to think that my opinions aren't valuable or that others will think I'm annoying for speaking too much. 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very discouraging. What evidence do you have that supports or challenges those beliefs about your contributions?

User: I guess the positive feedback I received contradicts those thoughts. People seemed to appreciate what I had to say. 

Consultant: That's an important realization! It sounds like you have evidence that challenges those negative thoughts. How could you remind yourself of this evidence when you’re feeling overwhelmed in the future?

User: Maybe I could write down some positive experiences and refer to them before entering those situations.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Keeping a record of your experiences can serve as a helpful reminder. Let’s also think about some practical strategies you can employ in those larger groups to feel more comfortable. What strategies have you used before?

User: I’ve tried to stay actively engaged by listening more, but I sometimes hesitate to jump in.

Consultant: Engagement is key! How about setting a small goal for yourself, like contributing once every few minutes? This could ease some pressure and also help you feel more involved.

User: That sounds doable! It might help me feel more comfortable sharing my thoughts.

Consultant: Exactly! Setting small, achievable goals can really help you gradually build your confidence. How do you feel about trying this in your next group interaction?

User: I feel optimistic! I think it will really help if I approach it step by step.

Consultant: That’s a great attitude! Alongside contributing your thoughts, encourage yourself with positive self-talk, maybe reinforcing how valuable your input is. Would you be open to practicing some affirmations or positive statements before you go into these situations?

User: Yes, I think that could be really helpful. I could practice saying things like "My opinions matter" or "I have valuable insights to share."

Consultant: Those are fantastic affirmations! Let’s take a moment to reflect on what you’ve learned today. What stands out to you as the most important takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think focusing on evidence that contradicts my negative thoughts and setting small goals are key takeaways. They will really help me maintain my progress.

Consultant: Exactly! These strategies can empower you to continue fostering your social skills. As we wrap up today, what plans do you have to implement these strategies moving forward?

User: I plan to make my list of positive experiences, set small goals for my next group, and practice my affirmations.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, J! I believe you have the skills to make these changes and continue feeling accomplished. Remember to check in with yourself regularly about your feelings and progress. 

User: Thanks! I appreciate your support. I feel more equipped to tackle these situations now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s rewarding to observe your growth. Keep practicing those strategies, and I'm confident you'll continue to do well. If you need further support in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care!

User: I will! Thank you again for everything. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hi J! It's so good to see you again. I'm eager to hear about your experiences since our last session. How have you been feeling?

User: Hi! I'm feeling much lighter now. After working through some interpersonal issues, I just feel a sense of accomplishment. I’m also optimistic about my future.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It sounds like addressing those interpersonal issues has really helped. What specific changes have you noticed in your interactions or your studies?

User: I’ve become more confident in social situations, and I find it easier to engage with my classmates. In terms of studying, I'm also organizing my time better.

Consultant: That's a great improvement in both your social life and studies! Let’s take a moment to reflect on how you can maintain this progress. What are some strategies or techniques that have worked for you?

User: I think setting small, achievable goals helps. It gives me motivation to keep going. Also, I remind myself of the successes I’ve had, which boosts my confidence.

Consultant: Setting small goals is a wonderful strategy, and celebrating your successes reinforces a positive mindset. As we look ahead, what kind of long-term goals do you have for your personal growth and studies?

User: I want to continue becoming more confident, not just socially but also academically. I’d also like to explore opportunities for leadership in group projects.

Consultant: Those are excellent aspirations! Building confidence in academics and aiming for leadership roles can open many doors. How do you think you can start working towards those leadership opportunities?

User: I could volunteer to lead study groups or participate in more team activities. Engaging more with classmates would be a good start.

Consultant: Volunteering for leadership in group activities is a great approach. It allows you to practice those skills in a supportive environment. What challenges do you anticipate while pursuing these goals?

User: I guess my biggest challenge would be fear of standing up in front of people. I sometimes worry about what others might think of me.

Consultant: That’s a very common concern. Fear of judgment can be quite daunting. Let’s explore this thought further. What evidence do you have that supports this fear? Can you identify any instances where it turned out differently?

User: Well, when I’ve spoken in class before, most of my classmates were supportive. It’s just my mind tends to exaggerate the negatives.

Consultant: It’s insightful that you recognize the support you’ve received. Let’s challenge that exaggerated thinking. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about these fears?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that people are usually more understanding than we expect.

Consultant: That's a compassionate perspective! It’s true that mistakes are a part of learning. Perhaps we can develop some alternative thoughts for you to use when those fears arise. Would you like to try that?

User: Yes, I think that would really help.

Consultant: Great! Let's think of a few positive affirmations or reminders. For example, "I have valuable insights to share," or "Most people are supportive of each other." How do those sound to you?

User: I like those! They feel reassuring. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You can also write them down and keep them visible as a reminder. As we work together, how do you feel about applying this strategy moving forward?

User: I feel good about it. Having those reminders will definitely help me push through my fears.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Additionally, engaging in exposure activities—like speaking up in smaller settings—can help, too. How do you feel about trying that?

User: That sounds doable. I think I can start with my small study group.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Taking gradual steps makes it less overwhelming. Is there anything else you think might help you manage anxiety when you face these situations?

User: Maybe practicing my speeches beforehand would help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Practicing beforehand is a fantastic strategy! It can increase your comfort and readiness. Let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today regarding your progress and your plans moving forward.

User: Sure! I’ve recognized my growth in confidence and have set long-term goals for further improvement. I will also use positive affirmations and practice more for upcoming speaking opportunities.

Consultant: That’s a solid summary, J! As we wrap up our session, what potential challenges do you foresee in maintaining these strategies?

User: I suppose I might hit some setbacks, like feeling shy or anxious unexpectedly. 

Consultant: That’s completely normal. It helps to have a plan in place for those moments—perhaps reminding yourself of past successes or reaching out to a supportive friend. 

User: That makes sense. I’ll keep that in mind.

Consultant: As we conclude our session, you’ve made remarkable progress with your goals and strategies. It’s been a pleasure working with you on this. Remember, you can always return if you need support in the future.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance. I feel more equipped to face my challenges now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, J! Keep up the great work, and I wish you all the best as you continue on your journey. 

User: Thank you! I’ll see you next time.
