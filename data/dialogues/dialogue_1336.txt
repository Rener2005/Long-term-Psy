Consultant: Hello, Zhou! It's great to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’m still feeling pretty low. School has been really challenging, and I just can’t shake off this feeling of being worthless. I thought it would get better, but it hasn’t.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that you're still struggling. It sounds like school is adding a lot of pressure for you right now. Can you tell me more about what aspects of school are making you feel this way?

User: Well, my grades aren't as good as I want them to be. I feel like I'm constantly falling behind, and it's really discouraging. I also feel like my classmates are doing much better than I am, which just reinforces my feelings of inadequacy.

Consultant: I hear you. It must be tough to compare yourself to others and feel like you're not measuring up. What specific thoughts go through your mind when you're feeling this way?

User: I keep thinking that I'll never be good enough. I tell myself that maybe I just don't have the ability to succeed like other students do. Sometimes, I think they see me as a failure.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really painful and heavy. It seems like you're caught in a cycle of negativity. Can we explore how these thoughts affect your emotions? How are you feeling when you think those things about yourself?

User: It makes me feel really sad and anxious. Sometimes I just want to give up. There's this overwhelming feeling of dread about school and what’s to come.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts really impact how you feel and what you want to do. Let’s take a closer look—do you think there might be any other explanations for your struggles in school, besides the idea that you're not good enough?

User: I guess I tend to overlook that I just started high school, and it’s a new environment for me. But it’s hard to remember that when I’m feeling so down.

Consultant: That's a valid point! Transitioning to a new school can be really challenging. It's understandable that you'd feel pressure. What if we tried to view your situation from a different angle? What would you say to a friend who was in your position?

User: I suppose I would tell them it’s okay to struggle and that it’s part of adjusting to something new. But I don't really apply that advice to myself.

Consultant: It’s interesting how we can be kinder to others than to ourselves. Let’s work on recognizing that self-criticism. What if we challenged one of your negative thoughts? For example, the idea that you're a failure—how true is that really in the broader context of your life?

User: I think it’s not completely true. I have done some things well in the past, but it feels like those moments are buried under my current struggles.

Consultant: That’s a good insight, Zhou. Remembering your past successes can help balance those negative thoughts. How can we use that realization to help shape your confidence moving forward?

User: Maybe I could start acknowledging my small achievements, even if they don’t seem significant?

Consultant: Absolutely! Acknowledging small wins is a great step. Let’s set some achievable goals for you to focus on. What is one small goal related to your studies that you might want to work towards this week?

User: I want to try to complete my homework on time without rushing. If I succeed, I think it might help my confidence a bit.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful goal, Zhou. Completing your homework on time is definitely something to celebrate! How do you plan to stay on track with this goal?

User: I could create a schedule for myself to stay organized, so I don’t feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! Creating a schedule can help break things down and make them feel more manageable. Let’s check in about how this makes you feel—do you feel any sense of hope or motivation as you think about this plan?

User: I do feel a little more hopeful now, but I still worry I won't follow through. 

Consultant: It's normal to have those worries, but you've taken a step toward building a plan. How about we develop some strategies that can help you stay motivated and accountable? 

User: Maybe I could share my progress with someone, like a friend?

Consultant: Yes, sharing your goals with a friend can provide support and encouragement. It might help you feel less isolated in your efforts. Would you like to adopt this strategy moving forward?

User: I think that could help. I don’t want to keep everything to myself anymore.

Consultant: That’s a positive change, Zhou! Opening up can be a powerful way to connect and share your experiences. As we wrap up our session today, what is one key takeaway you’d like to hold onto until we meet again?

User: I want to remember that it’s okay to struggle and to acknowledge my small successes. I think that’ll help me feel less alone.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway, Zhou! Keep reminding yourself that it’s okay to have ups and downs. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care of yourself, and see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, welcome to today's session, Zhou. I want to start by saying that it's okay to feel the way you do right now. Can you share with me what’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really down about my recent mid-term exam results. I thought I would do better, but it feels like I’ve failed. It just adds to my doubts about my abilities.

Consultant: I can see that you feel really frustrated and are struggling with doubts about yourself as a result of this exam. That’s understandable. What specifically about the exam results is making you feel this way?

User: I thought I had studied hard, but the results didn’t reflect that. I keep thinking that maybe I’m just not good enough, not smart enough to succeed like my classmates.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really putting a lot of pressure on yourself and feeling defeated because of how you perceive your performance. Let’s talk about that—what feelings come up for you when you think about being “not good enough”?

User: It makes me feel really anxious and sad. I feel like I’m just a disappointment to myself and to my family. I start wishing I could just disappear sometimes.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. I want you to know that these feelings are valid, but we can work on changing how you interpret these situations. Can you recall any specific thoughts you had after seeing your exam results that contributed to your feelings?

User: I remember thinking, "I’ll never be able to catch up," and "What’s the point of even trying?" Those thoughts just kept spiraling in my head.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really overwhelming. It’s easy to get caught up in that cycle of negativity. What evidence do you think supports these thoughts? And is it possible that there might be another way to look at your situation?

User: I guess there isn’t really proof that I’m a failure…I did do well in some of my classes before. But when something goes wrong, I just can’t help but focus on the negative.

Consultant: Yes, it’s common to fixate on the negative, especially when you're feeling low. Let’s try to challenge that a bit. If a friend was in your position, what would you tell them about their situation and their abilities?

User: I’d probably tell them that one bad result doesn’t define their intelligence and that they should just keep trying. But when it’s me, I don’t feel the same way.

Consultant: Exactly! You have the insight to offer support to others, which means you can also give that support to yourself. Let’s work together to create a different narrative. What might you say to yourself instead when you feel those negative thoughts creeping in?

User: Maybe I could say something like, “It’s okay to fail sometimes, it’s part of learning”? 

Consultant: That’s a great start! Reminding yourself that failure is part of learning can relieve some pressure. Now let’s talk about what steps you might take next. Are there some small, manageable goals you could set that would help you prepare for your next exam without overwhelming yourself?

User: I suppose I could plan to study a little each day instead of cramming at the last minute. Setting smaller goals might help me feel less anxious about it.

Consultant: That sounds like a sensible plan! Breaking it into smaller segments can make it feel less daunting and can help build your confidence over time. How do you feel about that approach?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful about it, like maybe it’s achievable. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Moving to smaller goals can really change your perspective. Now, thinking about your overall feelings of anxiety and sadness, are there any activities or hobbies that you enjoy and could incorporate more into your week?

User: I used to enjoy drawing and playing video games, but I haven’t felt like doing much lately.

Consultant: Engaging in activities you enjoy can be a great way to lift your mood. How about we set a goal for you to dedicate some time to drawing or gaming this week? 

User: That sounds good! I’ll try to set aside a few hours during the weekend to draw.

Consultant: That’s a positive step! It’s important to carve out time for things that make you happy. Let’s also focus a little on your social life. How do you feel about connecting with classmates or friends, especially when you're feeling down?

User: I usually avoid it. I feel like they won’t want to hang out with someone like me. 

Consultant: I understand where you’re coming from. It's hard to connect when you're feeling low. But remember, people are often more understanding than we think. What would it feel like to reach out to someone just to talk or hang out for a bit?

User: It makes me nervous, but I also think it could be nice to have someone to talk to. 

Consultant: It’s totally normal to feel nervous about social interactions, but taking that step could really benefit you! Maybe we can set a goal for you to reach out to one person this week. How does that sound?

User: I can try reaching out to an old friend I haven’t spoken to in a while. It would be nice to reconnect.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Reconnecting with friends can really help diminish feelings of isolation. As we move toward the end of our session today, let’s summarize what you’ve learned and how you can apply it. You’ve identified that failure is part of learning, you’ve created smaller study goals, and you’ll reconnect with a friend. 

User: Yes, I feel like I have some strategies to handle things better now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! As you move forward, remember that you can always return to these strategies when you find yourself feeling anxious or down. Your feelings are important, and reaching out for help is a strength. 

User: Thank you for helping me see things differently today. I appreciate it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhou! I believe in your ability to make these changes. Keep in mind, if things get difficult, don’t hesitate to reach out again. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhou! I'm glad to see you again today. I remember you mentioned feeling anxious about social interactions and missing out on opportunities recently. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit down. I regret not participating in that school activity because I was too scared to talk to my classmates. I keep thinking about it and feel like I'm missing out on a lot.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really disappointed in yourself for not participating. You're feeling a sense of loss for that opportunity. Can you tell me more about what went through your mind when you decided not to talk to your classmates?

User: I just felt so nervous. My mind kept telling me they wouldn't want to talk to me, that I would just embarrass myself. It felt easier to avoid it altogether.

Consultant: That makes sense. It feels safer to avoid situations that make you anxious. However, these thoughts can hold you back. Can you recall how you felt before you decided not to engage with them?

User: I felt a mix of anxiety and sadness, knowing that I was missing out. I just wanted to feel like I belong, but the fear stopped me.

Consultant: Wanting to belong is a natural desire, but fear can sometimes overpower that need. Let's explore those thoughts a bit. When you thought they wouldn't want to talk to you, what evidence did you have for that belief?

User: I guess I don't really have evidence. It's just how I feel. I tend to think people will judge me because of my past.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel judged based on past experiences, but it's worth questioning those thoughts. If you were to take a step back, how would you advise a friend who felt like you do?

User: I would probably tell them that they shouldn't worry too much and that people might surprise them by being friendly.

Consultant: That’s very insightful! It shows that the same kindness we offer to others can apply to ourselves too. Would you be open to trying an exercise this week where you challenge this fear in small steps?

User: Sure, I think that could help. What do you suggest?

Consultant: Let's start with something simple. How about setting a goal to say "hi" to one classmate over the next week? It’s a small step but an important one in opening up those lines of communication. How does that sound?

User: That sounds okay, actually. I think I could try that.

Consultant: Great! Remember to remind yourself that it’s just a greeting and that you're not alone in this experience. How do you think you'll feel after trying that?

User: I think I might feel a little more confident if it goes well. But I still worry about what they might think.

Consultant: That’s a normal concern! Let’s challenge that fear. What if you consider the possibility that they might respond positively or even be as nervous as you are? 

User: I never thought about it that way. They could be anxious too.

Consultant: Exactly! People often share similar fears. This week, try to keep those thoughts in mind. How could you prepare yourself emotionally for this small step?

User: I could remind myself that it’s just a way to connect, not a test. That way, I won't put too much pressure on myself.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy. Focusing on connection rather than pressure will help ease your anxiety. Is there anything else you’d like to address today before we wrap up?

User: I guess I just feel overwhelmed by everything sometimes. Like I don't know if I'll ever feel better.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but remember that change takes time, and you already have a goal in place. Each small step leads to progress. How do you feel about the goals we've set for this week?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I think I have a plan, and that feels good.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that, Zhou! Recognizing your ability to plan and take small actions is a significant step forward. As we move forward, what are some positive affirmations you could remind yourself of to encourage your confidence?

User: Maybe something like "I am capable of making connections," or "It's okay to feel nervous."

Consultant: Those affirmations are powerful! Keep repeating them to yourself, especially when you're facing those challenging moments. Before we end today, let's summarize what you’ll take away from our session.

User: I’ll try saying "hi" to a classmate and remind myself that it's just about connecting. I’ll also use some affirmations to boost my confidence.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I believe in your ability to take these steps. Remember, I’m here to support you along the way. How would you feel about our next session and discussing your experiences?

User: I’m looking forward to it! I hope I have good news to share.

Consultant: I’m looking forward to it too, Zhou! Remember, every little step counts, and it’s okay to take it one day at a time. See you next week!

User: See you next week! Thank you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhou! I'm glad to see you today. Let's take a moment to discuss how you've been feeling lately and any thoughts that might be on your mind.

User: Hi. I've been thinking a lot about how I felt appreciated during a class activity recently. It was nice to feel recognized, but I still sometimes struggle to believe in myself. 

Consultant: It sounds like that recognition brought you some joy, but there's still a part of you that struggles with self-doubt. Can you tell me more about what you felt during that moment of appreciation?

User: Yes, in that moment, I felt really happy and a bit proud of myself. But shortly after, I started to question if I really deserved it or if they were just being nice.

Consultant: That's completely understandable. It's good to experience positive feelings, yet difficult to hold onto them when self-doubt creeps in. What thoughts do you notice when those doubts surface after such positive experiences?

User: I often think, "Maybe they just said that to be nice," or "What if I messed up later?" It feels like I'm always waiting for the next mistake.

Consultant: I can see how those thoughts might overshadow your moments of positivity. Let's explore these doubts further. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts these thoughts?

User: I guess there’s no real proof they were just being polite. They were smiling and seemed genuine. But sometimes I can’t help but feel like I’m not good enough. 

Consultant: It’s great that you can recognize the genuine appreciation you received. What if we considered an alternative thought? Instead of thinking you're not good enough, how about believing that you are capable of learning and growing? What do you think?

User: That sounds nice, but it feels hard to really believe it. It’s like there's this inner voice reminding me of all my past failures.

Consultant: That inner voice can be really loud and persistent. Let’s challenge it together! If a friend came to you with similar feelings, what would you tell them about their achievements and potential?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that they shouldn’t be too hard on themselves. 

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective! Now, let’s try to apply that kindness to yourself. What would it look like to treat yourself with the same understanding and encouragement?

User: I guess I could try to remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and to focus on the things I do well instead. 

Consultant: Absolutely! How about we set a small goal for you this week? Maybe something simple like keeping a journal of positive moments or achievements, no matter how small. Would you be open to that?

User: Yes, I think I could do that. It might help me see things differently.

Consultant: Wonderful! Journaling can be a great way to reinforce those positive feelings. Let’s aim for a few entries over the next week. How do you think it will feel to reflect on positive moments regularly?

User: I think it will help me feel more balanced. Maybe I’ll start to see my worth a bit more. 

Consultant: That sounds promising! Reflecting on positive experiences can help shift your focus away from negativity. Remember to be gentle with yourself during this process. What other activities could you incorporate into your week to continue fostering positivity?

User: Maybe I could try to join more group activities or spend time with friends. They usually make me feel better.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Social interactions can be very uplifting. Let’s make it a goal for you to participate in at least one group activity this week. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I’ll make an effort to do that.

Consultant: Great! Engaging with others is a powerful way to boost your mood. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed and how you might apply these new strategies. 

User: We talked about recognizing my achievements, challenging my negative thoughts, journaling about my positive moments, and being kinder to myself. I also want to join more activities.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve got a solid plan in place. Remember to celebrate even the small victories. I believe that by following through with these steps, you'll continue to build your confidence. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful about the future now.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Zhou! You’ve shown a lot of willingness to explore and grow. Remember, I'm here for you whenever you need support. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate it. I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: Take care, Zhou! I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhou! I'm really glad to see you again today. How are you feeling after receiving the positive feedback from your teacher in class? 

User: Hi. Honestly, I felt a bit happier after that. It’s nice to hear something positive for a change. But I still worry that it won’t last and I’ll slip back into feeling down again.

Consultant: It's completely natural to have concerns about maintaining a positive state. Can you tell me what specifically made you feel happier after the feedback? 

User: I think it was the fact that I contributed in class and it was recognized. It made me think maybe I'm not as useless as I usually feel.

Consultant: That's a really great realization! Acknowledging your contributions is an important step. Let's delve into how you can keep this momentum going. What thoughts crossed your mind after that experience? 

User: I felt proud for a moment, but then I started doubting myself again, like what if it was just a fluke? Maybe the teacher was just being nice.

Consultant: Those self-doubts can creep in easily. Let's explore that a bit. What evidence do you have that suggests it was a fluke or that you're not capable? 

User: I mean, I've struggled with so many things for a while now. It’s hard to shake off the feeling that I’m still not good enough.

Consultant: I understand. It can be difficult to shift long-standing beliefs about ourselves. Can you think of any other successes or moments where you felt you did well, besides this recent class experience? 

User: Well, there was the time I helped a friend with his math homework last month. He understood it better after I explained it to him.

Consultant: That’s another great example! Helping your friend not only shows your understanding but also your ability to support others. How does that make you feel about your own skills and abilities? 

User: I guess it shows that I can actually help people. Maybe I’m not as useless as I think sometimes.

Consultant: Exactly! It's about recognizing and valuing those moments. What do you think might happen if you made a habit of celebrating these small successes? 

User: It might help me feel better overall, but I’m just not sure I can keep doing it.

Consultant: Let’s take small steps. How about we set a goal for you to acknowledge one positive thing you've done each day? It could be anything, no matter how small. 

User: That sounds doable. I think I could try that.

Consultant: Great! This practice can reinforce your self-esteem and create a more positive internal dialogue. How do you feel about implementing this goal for the coming week?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Just writing down the good things might change how I see things.

Consultant: I believe it will! Remember, the more we focus on the positives, the more we train our mind to notice them. Let’s also think about how you can remind yourself to do this daily.

User: Maybe I can set a reminder on my phone or keep a notebook with me.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Having reminders will help build this new habit. What else do you think could support you in keeping this positive outlook? 

User: I think talking about it with a friend could help too. Sometimes sharing feels good.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your thoughts and feelings can be very empowering. Is there a specific friend you feel comfortable discussing this with? 

User: Yes, I do have a friend who always listens and supports me. I could share this goal with him.

Consultant: That's perfect! Having someone to dialogue with can make a big difference. How do you feel about your ability to manage your mindset after our session today? 

User: I feel like I have some strategies to work with now. I hope I can really stick to those goals. 

Consultant: That’s the attitude! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Celebrate every step, no matter how small. How have you been feeling overall about our sessions? 

User: I feel like I've learned a lot about myself and why I think the way I do. It’s been helpful.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Zhou. Together, we’ve made significant progress. Just remember, change takes time, and it’s okay to have ups and downs. 

User: I understand. I guess I just need to be patient with myself.

Consultant: Exactly! Patience is key. As we wrap up today, let’s recap the positive changes you’ve made and the strategies you’ve set. What stands out to you? 

User: I think recognizing my worth and celebrating little achievements are big for me. It's something I haven't focused on before.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! Keep building on these strengths. As we conclude today’s session, what’s your biggest takeaway? 

User: I’m starting to see that I can be proud of myself, and I’m not just the person I’ve always thought I was.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! I'm proud of your progress. Remember, you can always reach out for support as you continue this journey. If you ever feel the need, I'm just a call away.

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help. I feel a lot better than when we started.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhou! I’m happy to see your progress. Keep practicing those strategies, and take care until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhou! I'm really glad to see you again today. It sounds like you've been feeling more positive lately. How has your week been since we last met?

User: Hello! Yes, I think I've been doing better. I had a good conversation with my mom, and it helped me feel more supported. I’m beginning to notice some positive aspects of my life.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Conversations with loved ones can make a big difference. Can you share more about what specifically made that conversation impactful for you?

User: She really listened to me, and I felt like she understood my struggles. It was nice to feel like I wasn’t alone. I think I might have been too closed off before.

Consultant: It sounds like you felt seen and heard, which is so important. Recognizing support from your family can really help in feeling more connected. What are some other positive aspects of your life that you've started to notice?

User: I’ve been trying to focus on the little things, like enjoying my hobbies more. I actually read a book last weekend, which I hadn’t done in a while. 

Consultant: That's a great step! Engaging in activities you enjoy can boost your mood and confidence. How did reading that book make you feel?

User: It felt nice to escape into a different world for a while. I guess I realized I can still enjoy things despite everything going on.

Consultant: Exactly! Finding joy in activities can be a powerful tool for mental well-being. Reflecting on your recent experiences, what would you say is a small but significant change you've noticed within yourself?

User: I think I'm starting to believe that I can be happy again. I’m not fully there yet, but it's a start. 

Consultant: That’s a significant insight, Zhou. Recognizing the possibility of happiness can be a pivotal change. How do you think you can maintain this positive shift moving forward?

User: Maybe I could set small goals for myself each week. Like, read another book or spend more time outside. 

Consultant: Setting small, achievable goals is a fantastic idea. Not only does it give you something to look forward to, but it also builds your confidence with each accomplishment. What are some other ways you think you could further nurture this positive mindset?

User: I could talk to my mom more often about how I'm feeling. I also want to try and connect with my friends again, even if it’s just a message to check in.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Strengthening your connections with people who care about you can provide additional support. Have you considered how you might approach reconnecting with your friends?

User: Honestly, I’ve been a bit nervous about reaching out. I worry they might not want to hear from me after all this time.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those feelings of uncertainty. How about testing the waters with a simple message? You could express that you’ve been thinking of them. What do you think about that approach?

User: That sounds doable! I could just say hi and see how they respond. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Just saying hi can be a good first step. It opens the door to re-establishing those connections without a lot of pressure. Would you feel comfortable setting a goal to do that this week?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. I’ll aim to send a message to at least one friend.

Consultant: That’s a perfect goal! Reaching out can be a positive step for both your social connections and your self-esteem. Let’s also think about how to keep track of your feelings as you take these steps. How do you feel about journaling your experiences?

User: Journaling sounds helpful. I can jot down how I feel after reaching out or doing something positive. 

Consultant: Great! It can help you reflect on your emotions and see your progress. As you engage in these activities, remember to be kind to yourself and celebrate your efforts. 

User: I will try to keep that in mind! 

Consultant: Wonderful, Zhou. As we start wrapping up today, let’s summarize the positive shifts you've made, like recognizing support from family, enjoying activities, and setting goals for reconnecting with friends. 

User: Yes, I feel like I have a clearer path now.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! Looks like you've made impressive strides, Zhou. As you continue on this journey, don't forget that you have the tools and support systems around you that can help. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful now about moving forward.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember, it's about taking one step at a time. If you ever feel overwhelmed or need more support, I'm here for you. 

User: I appreciate it! I think I can manage things better now.

Consultant: That's a remarkable realization. I believe in your ability to maintain this positive momentum. This will be our last session for now. Keep utilizing what you've learned, and take care of yourself. 

User: I will, thank you for everything. 

Consultant: It was a pleasure working with you, Zhou. Best of luck with everything moving forward! You have the strength to navigate this journey.
