Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm glad to see you for today's session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious and frustrated recently. My relationship with Xiaozhang in the dormitory has been worsening, and it’s affecting my mood and studies a lot. I feel so much resentment towards him for keeping me up at night.

Consultant: I understand that this situation with Xiaozhang is really weighing on you, and it's understandable given the stress of your studies. Can you tell me more about how this is affecting you day-to-day?

User: Well, I find it hard to concentrate during lectures, and I’m constantly worried about failing my courses. It's like I can’t focus at all, and my anxiety only gets worse because I think I might not graduate.

Consultant: It sounds like this anxiety about graduation is feeding into your current challenges, especially with your studies. It’s important for us to explore what thoughts are running through your mind in these moments. What do you typically think when you feel this anxiety?

User: I often think that I'll never pass my exams or that everyone is doing better than me. It just makes me feel trapped in this cycle of negativity.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very distressing. It seems like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself. Can you reflect on where you think these thoughts are coming from? 

User: I guess it's partly from my family's financial struggles. I know my parents are counting on me to succeed, and I can't help but feel I might let them down if I don’t graduate on time.

Consultant: That’s a heavy burden to carry, wanting to meet your family’s expectations. It’s normal to feel stressed in this situation. I wonder, could there be any other explanations or outcomes besides failing that might help you look at this differently?

User: I suppose I could consider that I might just need to improve my study techniques or ask for help. But then again, I feel like I should already know how to do this by now.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re able to consider reaching out for support! However, it’s also important to be gentle with yourself. Everyone struggles at times, and asking for help is a strength, not a weakness. What do you think might happen if you allowed yourself to embrace that idea?

User: I might feel a little less pressure, but I can't shake off the anger I feel towards Xiaozhang. Every time I try to study, I just think about how rude he is.

Consultant: That anger sounds quite overwhelming, and it’s understandable given the frustrations you’re experiencing. Let’s discuss this relationship with Xiaozhang further. What specific actions or words of his trigger that anger for you?

User: It’s mostly when he plays games loudly at night. It just shows a lack of consideration for others, and then I can't sleep. 

Consultant: It sounds incredibly frustrating when someone’s behavior disrupts your peace, especially when you're already feeling vulnerable. Have you had the chance to talk to him about how his actions affect you?

User: No, I haven't. I'm afraid it might get worse. I don't want any more conflict.

Consultant: Conflict can definitely feel daunting. However, addressing your feelings might be a helpful step. How about we explore some ways you could express your feelings to him without escalating the situation?

User: I’d like that. I want to be able to communicate without it turning into a fight.

Consultant: That’s a positive step forward! What if you approached him calmly and shared how his actions impact your ability to study? You could use "I" statements to express your feelings without blaming him. How does that sound to you?

User: That actually seems manageable. I think saying something like "I feel anxious when I can’t sleep" might work rather than accusing him directly.

Consultant: Exactly! That way, you’re sharing your experience rather than pointing fingers. This could help avoid defensiveness. Would you feel comfortable trying this approach soon?

User: I think so. I feel a bit nervous, but I also want to try.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous. Remember, every small step you take counts. And if it doesn’t go perfectly, that’s okay too. What do you think you might do if it doesn’t go well?

User: I could try again or maybe talk to someone else about it. I just don’t want to keep feeling this way.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re already thinking about alternatives and ways to cope. Let’s also discuss some coping strategies for your anxiety surrounding exams. What techniques have you tried in the past to manage this?

User: I’ve tried deep breathing, but it doesn’t always help. Sometimes I just freeze up.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be a useful start, but I understand it might not be enough during high-pressure times. How about we explore adding some structured study techniques or scheduled breaks to your routine? 

User: That makes sense. I often lose track of time while studying, and then I panic about how little I’ve done.

Consultant: Incorporating scheduled breaks can help reduce that panic and create a better balance. Would you be open to trying a study schedule that allows for both focused time and breaks?

User: Yes, I’d like to try that. It could help me feel more organized.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s set small, achievable goals for your study sessions and include those breaks. This way, you can gradually build momentum. How does it feel thinking about organizing your time in this way?

User: It feels relieving, actually. I like the thought of having a plan.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Plans can provide a sense of control over your situation. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize our conversation. What are some actionable steps you want to take before our next session?

User: I’ll try to talk to Xiaozhang using "I" statements, create a study schedule with breaks, and focus on keeping things in perspective about my anxiety regarding exams.

Consultant: Those are excellent steps! You’re building a proactive approach to tackle both the interpersonal conflict and your studies. Remember, it’s okay to reach out for support whenever you need it. I'm here to help you through it all.

User: Thank you. This session has made me feel a bit more hopeful about things.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Chen! It's been great working with you today. I look forward to seeing you next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Chen! It's great to see you again. I know you've been feeling quite anxious, especially with exams approaching. Let's dive in and talk about what's been on your mind lately.

User: Hi. I'm just really stressed out. My relationship with Zhang in the dorm isn't good. He plays on his computer late at night and it keeps me up, making my anxiety worse. I can't focus on my studies.

Consultant: That sounds really frustrating. It must be tough to deal with that kind of disruption when you're already feeling so much pressure. Can you share what specific thoughts go through your mind when you think about these late-night conflicts with Zhang?

User: My first thought is that it's completely unfair. I try to be a good roommate, but he doesn't seem to care about my needs at all. I feel like I'm constantly battling against him.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling quite resentful and cornered. It's understandable to feel that way when someone else's actions are affecting your well-being. How does this situation with Zhang affect your overall mood and focus on studying?

User: It makes me really angry and anxious. I lose sleep, which leads to me falling behind in my studies. I worry I won't pass my subjects, especially with the exams coming up. I just feel stuck.

Consultant: That feeling of being stuck can be incredibly overwhelming. In situations like this, sometimes our mind can latch onto negative thoughts. Have you noticed any specific thoughts or worries that keep repeating in your mind regarding your exams or Zhang?

User: I keep thinking that if I don’t manage to pass my exams, I might not graduate. And with all this stress from Zhang, I can't even focus on studying. It's like a cycle of panic.

Consultant: That cycle of panic sounds exhausting, and it's understandable that you would feel that way. Let’s explore those worries. When you think about not graduating, what evidence do you have that supports that thought? Can we look for any alternative perspectives?

User: I guess I don’t actually know for sure that I won’t graduate. I just assume that if things keep going this way, I won't be able to catch up. It’s all a mess.

Consultant: It’s a natural reaction to assume the worst when you're under pressure. But what if we worked on challenging that thought? Instead of focusing on the worst-case scenario, what would it look like if you could break things down step by step? 

User: I suppose if I focused on one subject at a time, it wouldn't feel so overwhelming. But I don’t know how to handle that with Zhang always around.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Focusing on one subject at a time can indeed make things feel more manageable. Let's also think about your interactions with Zhang. Could there be a way to communicate your needs to him that might help reduce your frustration?

User: I’ve thought about talking to him, but I’m afraid he’ll just dismiss my feelings and it’ll escalate the conflict.

Consultant: It's understandable to be worried about a potential confrontation. What if we tried to reframe how you approach the conversation? Perhaps you could express how his actions are impacting you rather than coming across as accusatory. 

User: That might help. If I talk about how I’m feeling rather than blaming him, he might be more understanding.

Consultant: Exactly! This approach could invite a more constructive dialogue between you two. I also want to make sure we equip you with some strategies to cope with your anxiety during this stressful time. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before?

User: Not really. I don’t have much time to think about those things when I’m so anxious.

Consultant: I understand, but even just a few minutes of deep breathing can make a difference. Would you be open to practicing a simple breathing exercise right now? It might help you feel a bit more grounded.

User: That sounds good! I’d like to try.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a moment, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Let’s do that two more times together. 

User: Okay, here goes. 

(Practices breathing exercise together) 

Consultant: How do you feel after that exercise?

User: Honestly, a little more relaxed. It’s nice to take a moment to just breathe.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Deep breathing can definitely help. As we move forward, I encourage you to try integrating this exercise into your daily routine. We can also work on keeping track of any negative thoughts you have and practice those new ways of responding to conflicts with Zhang.

User: That sounds like a good idea. I’ll try to note my feelings when I'm having conflicts or feeling anxious about my studies.

Consultant: Excellent! Reflecting on those thoughts can help us identify patterns and create more constructive responses. Remember, it’s a process, and it’s perfectly okay to take things step by step.

User: Yes, I’m starting to see that changing my responses could help a lot.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let's continue practicing that and also focus on your study strategies. How about we set a goal for the week? You could aim to communicate with Zhang and practice the relaxation techniques when you feel anxious.

User: That sounds doable! I really want to try to talk to him this week and see how it goes.

Consultant: Great! I believe you can do this, Xiao Chen. Remember, communication can take practice, and it's okay if it doesn't go perfectly at first. What matters is that you’re making the effort to express yourself.

User: Thank you for your encouragement. It really helps me to visualize things better.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm here to support you through this. Let’s reconvene next week to discuss how it went and any other feelings that arise. You’re making progress, and I’m proud of you!

User: Thank you! I’ll see you next week, and I hope I have better news!

Consultant: Looking forward to it! Take care, and remember to practice those relaxation techniques. Have a great week ahead!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm glad to see you again. I know we discussed your recent conflict with Xiao Zhang, and I'm here to help you work through your feelings about that. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really upset after that argument. I can't stop thinking about it. I get angry just thinking about how inconsiderate he is, and it makes me anxious about so many things.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of anger and anxiety related to that situation. It's completely understandable given the circumstances. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that come to your mind when you think about your conflict with Xiao Zhang?

User: I keep thinking that he doesn't care about anyone but himself. Every time I can't sleep because he's using the computer, it feels like he’s ruining everything for me. I feel so helpless!

Consultant: When you see those thoughts, such as perceiving him as inconsiderate, it can intensify your feelings of helplessness. Let's explore those thoughts together. How does believing he doesn't care affect how you feel day-to-day?

User: It makes me feel isolated and really frustrated. I begin to doubt myself and whether I actually can communicate my needs. 

Consultant: Feeling isolated can be really tough. It seems like there's a cycle here—your thoughts about Xiao Zhang lead to frustration and self-doubt. Can you recall a moment during your argument when this kind of thinking was particularly strong?

User: Yes, during our last argument, I was so angry that I shouted at him. I really thought I was going to lose control. 

Consultant: It sounds like those intense feelings took over. Let’s unpack that a bit. What was going through your mind at that moment when you felt you might lose control?

User: I felt like if I didn’t yell, nothing would change. I thought he needed to understand how much he was affecting me.

Consultant: That's an important realization. You felt compelled to express your frustration, but it may have escalated the conflict. Have you ever thought about alternative ways to express your feelings without resorting to yelling?

User: I’ve tried to calm down before talking, but in the moment, it’s just so hard. I don’t know what else to do.

Consultant: It’s understandable that managing emotions can be challenging in such heated moments. Let's try a breathing technique together. It can help you manage your anxiety and maintain control when emotions run high. Would you like to give that a try?

User: Sure, I’m willing to try anything at this point.

Consultant: Great! Let's take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four, hold it for four counts, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Ready? Inhale… hold… exhale… How did that feel?

User: It felt a little calming, actually. I can see how that might help me pause before reacting.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. Practicing this technique can provide you with a moment to collect your thoughts before responding. In our next conflict with Xiao Zhang, how can you apply this technique?

User: I could use it right before I start feeling overwhelmed and angry again. I'd like to think it could help keep me grounded.

Consultant: Absolutely! It sounds like you have a plan. Remember that emotional regulation is a skill that takes time to develop. Can you think of another situation outside of this conflict with Xiao Zhang where you might apply this as well?

User: Maybe when I’m studying? I often feel anxious and that might help me focus.

Consultant: Yes! Practicing it during study sessions can help reduce anxiety overall. It could create a positive feedback loop. What do you think would be a good way to integrate this technique into your study routine?

User: Perhaps using it whenever I start feeling overwhelmed with the material. I can take short breaks to breathe and clear my mind.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. It’s about creating those small moments of mindfulness. As we continue to work together, let’s focus on identifying these patterns in your interactions with Xiao Zhang and in your study habits. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I do need to change how I react to things in general.

Consultant: Absolutely. Let’s make it our goal to not only improve your communication with Xiao Zhang but also to equip you with techniques that can benefit you in various aspects of life. Looking at your overall progress, what do you feel has been your biggest takeaway so far?

User: I think understanding my feelings better. I realize I have choices in how to respond, rather than just letting my anger lead me.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight! Recognizing that you have choices is empowering. As we move towards wrapping up our session, what strategies do you believe will help you maintain these insights in the future?

User: I can keep practicing the breathing technique and remind myself to be patient in conflicts. I also need to be more aware of my thought patterns before I react.

Consultant: That sounds like a well-rounded approach. I want you to know that change is a process, and you're already on the right track. The more you practice these strategies, the easier it will become. Our time together has come to a close for now, but I believe in your ability to manage your emotions effectively moving forward. Remember, I'm here if you need further support in the future.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help today. I will try to practice these techniques.

Consultant: You're welcome, Chen! I'm proud of the progress you've made. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to hearing how things go in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Chen! It's great to see you today. I'm looking forward to our session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better about my situation with Zhang. I tried to have a more honest conversation with him. While we didn’t completely resolve our misunderstandings, there was a slight improvement.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear there was some progress in your communication with Zhang. Let's explore that further. What specifically improved in your conversation with him?

User: Well, I was able to express my feelings about how his late-night computer use has disturbed my sleep. He seemed to understand where I was coming from, which felt like a step forward.

Consultant: That's a significant step! It takes courage to share your feelings. How did you feel during and after sharing that with him?

User: I felt anxious before talking to him, but afterward, I was somewhat relieved. It felt good to let him know how much it affects me.

Consultant: It sounds like you were able to communicate your needs, which is really important. How do you think he received your concerns? Did he respond in a way that encouraged further dialogue?

User: Yes, he listened and admitted that he didn’t realize it was bothering me so much. He even said he would try to be more considerate in the future. 

Consultant: That's encouraging to hear, Xiao Chen! It seems like he cares about your feelings, which can help improve your relationship. What are your thoughts about continuing this type of communication with him going forward?

User: I think I should keep being open with him. I want to work on improving our dynamic instead of just avoiding conflict.

Consultant: That's a great mindset! Continuing to be open can really help build trust between you two. Are there any specific strategies or phrases you think could help you express yourself better next time?

User: I could start with something positive, maybe mentioning that I appreciate him listening to me before bringing up my concerns. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Starting with a positive note can set the right tone for the conversation. What else do you think might help alleviate any tension during your discussions?

User: I could focus on using "I" statements, like saying "I feel uncomfortable when..." instead of blaming him directly. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Using "I" statements can really help in communicating without making the other person feel defensive. How do you feel about practicing this approach during our session today?

User: That sounds good! I’d like to try practicing that.

Consultant: Perfect! Let's do a role-play where you share your concerns with me as if I were Zhang. You can start whenever you're ready.

User: Okay. *clears throat* “Zhang, I appreciate you listening to me. I feel really anxious when I can’t get enough sleep because of the noise…” 

Consultant: Great start, Xiao Chen! How does it feel to express it like this?

User: It feels a bit easier to say it like that, and I feel less confrontational.

Consultant: That's exactly what we're aiming for! Keep going; how would you like to continue with your message?

User: “…and I would really appreciate it if you could keep the noise down at night.”

Consultant: Nicely done! Ending on a positive note and asking for his understanding can be very effective. How do you envision Zhang responding to this?

User: I hope he would be understanding and willing to compromise, especially since I framed it in a way that focuses on my feelings.

Consultant: You’re setting up a constructive dialogue. If you keep this intention, I believe it can lead to a positive outcome. How does that make you feel about your relationship moving forward?

User: I feel more hopeful now. I think it could get better with time and effort.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Hope is such an important part of moving forward. Let's discuss ways to maintain this positive outlook and keep practicing these skills.

User: Sure! I want to make sure I don't revert to my old patterns of avoiding problems.

Consultant: Absolutely, reinforcing new habits takes time. What are some triggers you think might lead you back to avoidance?

User: If we have a disagreement or if I feel frustrated, I might just not talk to him.

Consultant: Recognizing those triggers is a great first step. What strategies can you implement in those moments to remind yourself to be open instead?

User: Maybe setting a small reminder or having a phrase in mind to encourage myself to address the issue directly.

Consultant: That sounds effective! You could even write down that phrase and keep it nearby as a gentle nudge. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I like that idea! It gives me something to focus on.

Consultant: Fantastic! Together, we can reinforce this plan, and as you practice these skills, your confidence in handling these conversations will grow. How does that sound for your next steps?

User: It sounds great! I feel more equipped to handle things now. 

Consultant: I’m proud of the progress you’re making, Xiao Chen. As we conclude today’s session, let’s recap your achievements and strategies. What do you feel are your biggest takeaways from our time together?

User: I feel I’ve learned how to communicate better with Zhang, and using "I" statements will really help.

Consultant: Absolutely, you've made great strides in improving your communication. Remember, you have the tools to navigate conflicts constructively. If you need further support, I’m here for you. Keep up the great work!

User: Thank you! I feel more positive about the situation now and I'm ready to tackle it. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! It's been a pleasure working with you today. Take care, and I look forward to our next session together.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaocheng! Welcome to today’s session. I'm glad to see you. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit lighter, actually. Working on that group project with Xiaozhang helped me see he might not be so bad after all. It feels like there's been some improvement in our relationship.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It sounds like you’re starting to find some common ground with him. Can you tell me more about what has changed for you during your interactions with Xiaozhang?

User: Well, during the group project, we had to communicate more. I realized he actually has some good ideas, and I think I judged him too harshly before. We were able to collaborate and it felt less awkward.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you’ve found a way to connect and collaborate. How did this shift in perception affect your feelings overall? 

User: I felt more relaxed and less anxious about our interactions. I think I'm starting to let go of the resentment I held. 

Consultant: Letting go of that resentment is an important step. How do you think you can maintain this positive momentum moving forward? 

User: I guess I just need to keep communicating openly when issues arise instead of shutting down or getting frustrated.

Consultant: Absolutely! Open communication is key. Are there other strategies you might consider to help sustain this positive interaction, especially given your upcoming graduation?

User: Maybe I could try to practice patience more. Also, I could set a goal to have at least one meaningful conversation with him each week to keep the connection going.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Building that routine can reinforce the positive changes you’re experiencing. How do you feel about these goals?

User: I feel good about them. I'm also excited to see how I can keep improving our relationship. It makes me less anxious about my studies too.

Consultant: That’s a positive outlook! As you get closer to graduation, what other thoughts do you have about your future and the relationships you’ll maintain?

User: I think if I can keep this open mindset with Xiaozhang, it could help me with other friendships too. I worry about graduating and feeling isolated, but I want to try to stay connected with those around me.

Consultant: Staying connected is very important, especially as changes occur in your life. Have you considered any specific ways to maintain friendships after graduation?

User: Not specifically, but I think I might reach out more to classmates and try to make plans to get together. It's just about making the effort, right?

Consultant: Exactly! Making that effort can go a long way in maintaining relationships. How do you feel about being proactive in reaching out to others now?

User: I think it’d be a bit challenging, but also rewarding. I don’t want to lose touch with people who matter to me.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! Challenging situations can bring growth too. What’s one action step you can commit to today to help you reach out to others?

User: I’ll send a message to a couple of classmates I haven't talked to in a while and see if they’d like to grab coffee. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! It’s a simple yet effective way to reconnect. How does thinking about this make you feel?

User: I feel hopeful! It's nice to have something to look forward to, and I believe these small steps can lead to better relationships.

Consultant: I’m glad you feel hopeful! Remember, every small step counts. Let's explore some thoughts or concerns you might have about your graduation. What comes to mind?

User: Honestly, I’m a bit anxious about job hunting. What if I don’t find something? But I guess it’s the process that matters.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Job hunting can be overwhelming. How do you plan to approach it to reduce that anxiety?

User: I’ll probably set a schedule for job applications and take it one step at a time rather than stress over the end result.

Consultant: A structured approach can definitely help! It helps you focus on manageable tasks rather than feeling overwhelmed by the big picture. How do you feel about breaking it down like this?

User: It sounds much better. I like the idea of focusing on daily tasks rather than the entire daunting process at once.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize your progress. You’re focusing on improving your relationship with Xiaozhang, establishing new connections, and preparing for your job search in a structured way. How does that resonate with you?

User: It feels empowering! I didn’t realize how connected all these aspects were, and I’m excited to see how it all unfolds.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Embracing this journey is key. Remember, you’re not alone in this process. If challenges arise, don’t hesitate to reach out for support. Good luck with your goals, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!

User: Thank you! I'm looking forward to it too.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Chen! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing relatively well. I feel excited about graduating, and I think my relationships with others have improved. It feels nice to be more confident.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Graduating is such an important milestone, and it’s great that you're feeling positive about your relationships. What specific changes have you noticed in those relationships?

User: Well, I’ve been trying to communicate better with my classmates. I used to avoid conflicts, but now I express my feelings more openly and it seems to help.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant improvement, especially in terms of connecting with others. Can you give me an example of a situation where you used these new communication skills?

User: Just yesterday, I had a group project meeting. Instead of keeping quiet when I disagreed, I voiced my concerns about the direction the project was taking. It turned out my ideas were welcomed!

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Voicing your opinions is an important step in building healthier relationships. How did you feel after that interaction?

User: I felt relieved and proud of myself. I used to worry about what others would think, but it actually felt empowering to share my thoughts.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! Empowerment often leads to more fulfilling interactions. As graduation approaches, how do you feel about the challenges you might face regarding job hunting or further studies?

User: I'm a bit anxious about job hunting, to be honest. I’m worried I won’t find a suitable position and that I might end up in a job I don’t like.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel anxious about job hunting. What specific thoughts are running through your mind when you think about this process?

User: I often think, “What if I apply and get rejected?” or “What if I don’t perform well in interviews?” It feels overwhelming sometimes.

Consultant: Those thoughts are quite common, but they can lead to a cycle of anxiety. Let’s take a moment to examine those thoughts more closely. How much evidence do you think supports the idea that you'll face constant rejection?

User: I guess I don't have any evidence for that. I mean, I have skills and qualifications, and I've done well in my studies despite some setbacks.

Consultant: Yes, exactly! Recognizing your strengths is essential. If a friend were in your position, how would you encourage them to think about the job search process?

User: I’d probably tell them to focus on their strengths and not to take rejection too personally—it’s part of the journey, after all.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective! You can definitely apply that same encouragement to yourself. Remember, each application is a learning opportunity. What steps can you take to prepare yourself for this process?

User: I think I should start by updating my resume and practicing some interview questions. I’ve read that it helps to be prepared.

Consultant: Great plan! Preparing can build your confidence significantly. Have you thought about setting small, manageable goals for yourself during this process?

User: Yes, I could set a goal to apply for at least two positions each week. That sounds achievable.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Setting smaller goals can make the process feel less daunting. As we wrap up today, what is one takeaway from our conversation that you find particularly helpful?

User: I really liked the reminder about focusing on my strengths and thinking about how I would encourage a friend. It puts things into perspective for me.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, you’ve made significant progress in both your relationships and your mindset. How do you plan to keep this positive momentum as you transition into graduation and job seeking?

User: I think I’ll continue to practice open communication and remind myself of my achievements. Also, I’ll reach out for support if I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy, Xiao Chen. You've shown a lot of growth. If you encounter any challenges while navigating these changes, don't hesitate to reach out. You’ve got this!

User: Thank you so much! I feel more prepared and optimistic now. I appreciate all your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It's been a pleasure working with you, and I’m confident you'll manage these upcoming changes successfully. Remember, a strong support system and a positive mindset will go a long way. Goodbye for now!

User: Goodbye! Thank you again!
