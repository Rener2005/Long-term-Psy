Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. To be honest, I've been feeling quite anxious again, especially thinking about my stuttering when talking to clients. It really affects my confidence, and I dread having to do presentations.

Consultant: It sounds like your stuttering is significantly impacting your confidence and interactions with clients. Can you tell me more about what thoughts come to mind when you find yourself in those situations?

User: I often think that people will judge me or that they won't take me seriously because of my stutter. It makes me more anxious and causes me to avoid speaking up.

Consultant: I completely understand how those thoughts can be overwhelming. When you think about being judged, how does that make you feel emotionally in those moments?

User: It makes me feel embarrassed and even more anxious. Sometimes, I just want to disappear rather than talk.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. Let's explore those thoughts a bit. When you consider that people might judge you, is there any evidence that supports this belief, or could there be other interpretations of how they perceive you?

User: I guess I don’t have any solid evidence. Most of the time, clients seem more focused on what I’m saying than how I’m saying it.

Consultant: That's an important realization. It seems like there's a gap between your perception of their judgment and the reality of their focus. How do you think you might begin to challenge that belief when it arises?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that clients care more about the information I'm sharing than my stutter. 

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a powerful strategy. By reframing your thoughts in that way, it might help reduce some of the anxiety surrounding your communication. Have you tried any techniques to ease your anxiety before speaking?

User: Not really. I just try to get through it, but it often backfires.

Consultant: It might be beneficial to incorporate some relaxation techniques before presentations. Would you be open to trying some breathing exercises or visualization techniques before you speak?

User: Yes, I think that could help. I just need to find the right time to practice them.

Consultant: Finding a routine that works for you is key. Perhaps you could practice these techniques in quieter moments before your meetings? Even taking a few deep breaths before starting can make a difference.

User: That makes sense. Having a consistent practice might help calm my nerves.

Consultant: Exactly. It can create a sense of control before you speak. Let’s think about your upcoming presentation—how can you apply these strategies we've discussed?

User: I could remind myself to focus on my message and breathe deeply before starting. I might also try visualizing a positive reception from my listeners.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent strategies! Visualizing positive outcomes can help create a more confident mindset. How do you feel about implementing these in your next meeting?

User: I'm feeling a bit hopeful about it. I just need to remember to do it in the moment, especially when anxiety hits.

Consultant: Practice will definitely help you remember these techniques. Would it be beneficial for you to set a reminder or perhaps rehearse these visualizations a few times before the presentation?

User: Yes, I could set reminders on my phone. That might help keep it fresh in my mind.

Consultant: Great idea! Reminders can provide a helpful nudge. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on everything we’ve discussed. What do you see as your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think it’s the idea of challenging my negative thoughts and focusing on what’s truly important in my communication, along with practicing relaxation techniques.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight, Zhang Wei. Remember, it's a process, and each step you take is essential. Moving forward, how do you plan to approach your upcoming work challenges?

User: I plan to approach them with a focus on my preparation and reminding myself that I'm capable of delivering my message effectively.

Consultant: I’m confident you can do that! You've gained valuable strategies today, and I encourage you to practice them. If you need further support or want to share your experiences, I’ll be here. 

User: Thank you. I appreciate your help. I’ll try my best to implement these strategies.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Remember, be kind to yourself during this journey. Take care, and see you soon! 

User: See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! I'm glad you're here today. I remember from our last session that you were feeling quite anxious about your performance in the meeting. Can you share a bit about how you've been feeling since then?

User: Hello! Yes, I've been thinking a lot about that meeting. I felt really frustrated with how I presented. My stuttering came up again, and I could see that it made me look less confident. It’s been making me anxious about speaking in front of others again.

Consultant: I understand, it sounds like that experience really impacted your confidence. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts or feelings were going through your mind during that meeting?

User: I kept thinking that everyone was judging me for my stutter. I felt like I was not able to communicate my ideas clearly. This made me feel embarrassed and less willing to express myself in future meetings.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way, especially in a high-pressure situation. Let’s explore that thought—that everyone was judging you. How much evidence do you think there is to support that belief? 

User: I don’t know... I guess I just assumed they were judging me since I was struggling to speak. But maybe it wasn’t as obvious to them as it felt to me?

Consultant: That’s an interesting perspective. It might be helpful to consider that others could be more focused on the content of your presentation rather than your speaking style. How does that shift in thought make you feel?

User: I suppose it makes me feel a little better, but I still worry about future presentations. What if I stutter again?

Consultant: It’s great that you're considering a different viewpoint. It’s normal to have worries about the future, but let’s try to break it down. What if we developed some small, achievable goals for your next presentation? 

User: That could work. Maybe I could practice speaking in smaller groups first to gradually build my confidence?

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing in smaller settings can be a great way to ease your anxiety. How often do you think you could set aside time to do this?

User: I could try to find opportunities at work. Perhaps I could lead some team discussions or volunteer for minor presentations in team meetings.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! You’re setting yourself up for success by gradually exposing yourself to speaking situations. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It sounds less intimidating when I think about it like that.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Let’s also develop some strategies to address your feelings of anxiety when they arise. What are some coping mechanisms you have tried or heard of that might help?

User: I sometimes take deep breaths before I speak, but I haven’t been consistent with it.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a great technique! Consistency is key, so perhaps we can incorporate that into your practice sessions. How about setting a reminder to practice deep breathing right before those small group discussions?

User: That sounds like it could help me calm my nerves before I start speaking.

Consultant: Exactly! And remember, each time you practice, you’re building your resilience and confidence. What else could you incorporate to help reinforce that confidence during your presentations?

User: Maybe I could remind myself of times when I have communicated clearly, even if it hasn’t been perfect.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Reflecting on past successes can really help counter those negative thoughts. What specific successes can you recall that you would like to remind yourself of?

User: I remember winning a client over last month with my presentation, even though I did stutter a bit. The client seemed to appreciate my enthusiasm and ideas.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic example! Focusing on the positive feedback can serve as a reminder that your ideas are valuable regardless of momentary difficulties. How do you feel about focusing on that success moving forward?

User: I think it could really help. It reminds me that I can be effective even when I’m nervous.

Consultant: Absolutely! As we prepare for your next challenges, it’s essential to celebrate those small victories. How do you envision using this mindset in upcoming situations?

User: I’ll try to remind myself that it’s okay not to be perfect, and focus on delivering my ideas instead of worrying about stuttering.

Consultant: That’s a powerful mindset to have. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what we've discussed. You’re setting achievable goals to practice speaking in small groups and reinforcing positive experiences during your presentations. 

User: Yes, I feel like I have some good steps to take now. I’m more encouraged about my ability to handle similar situations in the future.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a journey, and every small step counts. You can always return if you need support. Keep practicing your strategies, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help, and I’ll keep working on it. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Zhang Wei! Take care, and see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! I'm glad to see you today. It sounds like you’ve been working hard on your presentation skills. How are you feeling about your recent progress?

User: Hi. I feel a bit proud that I’ve made some small improvements, but I still worry about how I’ll perform in future presentations, especially when dealing with unfamiliar clients. My stuttering makes me feel less confident and it’s holding me back from participating fully in sales activities.

Consultant: It's great to hear about your progress, even if it's small! I can sense your concern about future performances. Let’s explore how you're feeling about presenting in front of others. What specific thoughts go through your mind when you think about upcoming presentations?

User: I keep thinking that I will stutter or that clients won’t take me seriously. It makes me really anxious and want to avoid speaking altogether.

Consultant: That anxiety is understandable, especially when you care about making a good impression. When those thoughts appear, how do they affect your emotions and behavior leading up to your presentations?

User: They make me feel very nervous. I usually end up overthinking everything, and sometimes I even hesitate to make calls or set up meetings.

Consultant: So it sounds like your thoughts about stuttering not only raise your anxiety but also lead you to avoid situations where you might need to speak. Have you noticed any particular triggers that make your anxiety worse when you’re preparing for a presentation?

User: Yes, it’s usually when I know I have to speak to a new client or when I’m in a group setting. Even thinking about it makes my heart race.

Consultant: Those specific situations can be quite daunting. Let's take a moment to think about the progress you've made. What aspects of your recent practice do you feel more comfortable with, despite your feelings of anxiety?

User: I feel okay about the new techniques I’ve learned for presentations. They help to some extent, but I still hesitate.

Consultant: That’s a solid start! Acknowledging what you're doing well is essential. Let's focus on ways we can build on that confidence. How would it feel to gradually expose yourself to small speaking opportunities where the stakes aren't too high?

User: I think that might help, but I’m still concerned about messing up in front of others.

Consultant: It’s completely okay to feel that way. What if we started by practicing in a very low-pressure environment? Perhaps you could begin with friends or family members. What do you think about that idea?

User: That sounds manageable. I think I could try practicing with my wife first.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Practicing with someone you trust can create a safer space. Once you feel more comfortable, how about moving to slightly larger groups gradually? 

User: Yes, I can see how that might help. I just need to overcome that initial fear.

Consultant: Exactly! Remember, these small steps can build up your confidence. How do you think you might feel after successfully practicing with your wife?

User: I guess I’d feel a bit more confident and hopefully carry that into future presentations.

Consultant: Absolutely! It's all about building momentum. Have you thought of any specific goals you’d like to achieve in these practice sessions with your wife?

User: I’d like to focus on reducing my stuttering and getting more comfortable with my pacing.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! We can also introduce some breathing techniques to help manage anxiety during your practice. Would you be open to trying a few calming techniques alongside your practice?

User: Yes, I think that would be really beneficial for me.

Consultant: Great! So, as we plan to implement these strategies, it’s important to track your progress. How would you like to document your feelings and improvements after each practice session?

User: I could keep a journal to note down my observations and feelings after each session.

Consultant: A journal is a fantastic way to reflect on your experiences and track growth. Let’s also think about how we can celebrate your small victories along the way! How does that sound to you?

User: Celebrating small wins sounds encouraging. I sometimes forget to recognize even the little things.

Consultant: It’s very easy to overlook those accomplishments. Every small step counts! As you make progress, how can you remind yourself to celebrate? Perhaps treat yourself afterwards?

User: Yes, treating myself to something nice after each session could motivate me to keep going.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Motivation is key. What strategy do you think you'd find most helpful to overcome the fear of speaking in front of unfamiliar clients?

User: Maybe visualizing a successful conversation and reminding myself of my skills could help.

Consultant: Visualization can be really powerful! Imagining success creates a positive mindset. Let's use that as part of your preparation. How confident do you feel about these strategies moving forward?

User: I feel more hopeful and a bit more equipped to handle these situations now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Remember, each time you practice or face a challenge, you're building the skills and confidence you need. Do you feel ready to set a date for your first practice session with your wife?

User: Yes, I think I can do that this weekend!

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s make that happen. Before we finish today, do you have any lingering concerns or anything else you’d like to discuss? 

User: I think we've covered a lot today. I'm just glad to have a plan now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Zhang Wei. This is an important step in your journey. I believe you have the ability to manage these challenges. If you encounter any difficulties, remember that’s part of the process. You can always reach out if you need support. I'm looking forward to hearing about your practice next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I'm excited to get started!

Consultant: You're welcome! I'm looking forward to our next session. Good luck, and remember to celebrate those small successes!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! It's great to see you again. I’m looking forward to our session today. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit more confident about my abilities, especially after the positive feedback I received during the training at work. But I still struggle when talking to new clients, and I find myself stuttering in those situations.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear you’re feeling more confident! It sounds like the training had a positive impact on you. However, it seems that speaking with new clients still causes you anxiety. Can you tell me more about what goes through your mind in those moments when you feel anxious?

User: Well, I start to think about how I might mess up, and that makes me more nervous. I worry that they will judge me or lose interest in what I’m saying because of my stutter.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming, and it's understandable that they increase your anxiety. Let's explore this further. When you have those thoughts about messing up or being judged, how do they make you feel in that moment?

User: I feel anxious and sometimes even embarrassed. It's like my mind goes blank, and I just want to escape the situation.

Consultant: It sounds very distressing to feel that way. You've mentioned wanting to escape. Can you think of any specific times when this has happened recently? What were the circumstances?

User: I remember a recent call with a new client. I was talking about our product, but I suddenly felt tongue-tied. I couldn’t get my words out, and I panicked.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. The feeling of being tongue-tied in a call can definitely trigger those anxious thoughts. Let’s talk about some strategies you could use in those situations. What do you think would help you feel more at ease when speaking with new clients?

User: I think maybe if I had a script or key points written down, it might help me stay on track and feel less flustered.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Having a script can provide you with a sense of security. How about we work on identifying a few key points or phrases you could use with new clients? This could give you a solid foundation to build your confidence.

User: Yes, I’d like that. Maybe I could highlight the product benefits clearly, so I know what to focus on.

Consultant: Absolutely, emphasizing key benefits is a smart strategy. Along with that, we could also consider practicing your delivery. Would you be open to recording yourself speaking about these points? It can help you become more aware of your speech and gain confidence.

User: Recording myself? That sounds a bit frightening, but I see how it could help. I might feel more comfortable doing it at home first.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan! Start by practicing at home where you feel safe. Once you’re comfortable, you can gradually share parts of your recording with me or even trusted colleagues for feedback. How does that sound?

User: I think that could really help. Getting feedback would make me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Yes, and remember, the goal is to create a supportive learning experience for yourself. Now, let’s also think about how to handle those moments when you feel anxious. Have you tried any relaxation techniques when you start feeling anxious before a call?

User: I haven’t really thought about that. I usually just get caught up in the moment.

Consultant: That’s quite common. It might be helpful to have a few relaxation techniques you can use before speaking. Techniques such as deep breathing exercises or visualization can assist in calming your nerves. Would you be interested in trying some out together?

User: Yes, I would like to try that. I could use that before calls.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment to practice a brief deep breathing exercise now. Let’s inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold for a moment, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of four. Ready? 

User: Okay, let’s try it.

Consultant: Inhale… 1, 2, 3, 4. Hold… 1, 2, 3, 4. Now exhale… 1, 2, 3, 4. How did that feel?

User: It felt nice to take a moment to breathe, actually. I can see how that might help me calm down before a call.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Incorporating small practices like this into your routine can really help manage anxiety. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize your action steps. You plan to create key talking points, practice at home, and use relaxation techniques before calls. Does that sound good?

User: Yes, that sounds like a solid plan. I feel more confident now about implementing these strategies.

Consultant: I'm really pleased to hear that, Zhang Wei! You’ve made great progress today. Remember, it’s all about practice and being kind to yourself during this process. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel good about it. I appreciate the support and the useful strategies we discussed. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in your ability to grow and face these challenges. If you need to talk again or have any concerns, you know where to find me. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! I'm glad you're here today. How are you feeling after our last session where we talked about your experience with stuttering and its impact on your confidence?

User: Hi! I feel a bit more relaxed now. Sharing my experiences with others during the group session really helped me. I realized I'm not alone in this.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like connecting with others was beneficial for you. Could you share a bit more about how that experience has affected your anxiety, especially when communicating with new clients?

User: Well, I still feel anxious sometimes, but talking with the group helped me understand that it's okay to feel this way. I was able to express some of my fears, and I felt more supported.

Consultant: It sounds like the support from your peers has been encouraging. What specific fears did you express that stood out to you?

User: I think I mentioned how I worry about making a bad impression on clients. The thought of stuttering makes me hesitant to start conversations.

Consultant: I see. It’s natural to want to make a good impression. When you worry about stuttering in those situations, what thoughts come up for you? How does that make you feel?

User: I often think that clients will judge me harshly, which just makes me more anxious. I feel embarrassed and sometimes even want to avoid meeting them altogether.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Zhang Wei. It's understandable to feel embarrassed when facing such challenges. Let's explore those thoughts a bit. Is there any evidence or experiences you've had that contradict the belief that clients will judge you negatively?

User: Actually, I remember one time, a client was very patient and even shared his own stuttering experience. It made me realize that many people are understanding.

Consultant: That’s a vital insight! It sounds like you’ve experienced understanding from clients before. How did that positive encounter make you feel compared to when you think about the negative judgments?

User: It definitely made me feel more hopeful, but I forget those moments when I’m nervous. I wish I could hold on to that feeling of support more.

Consultant: That’s a strong realization. It could be helpful to recall those positive experiences in moments of anxiety. Would you like to practice ways to remind yourself of that support when you're feeling overwhelmed?

User: Yes, I would really benefit from that! It’s hard to remember those moments when I’m so anxious.

Consultant: Great! One approach is to create a "support reminders list." You could jot down those positive experiences and any supportive words from others. Would you be open to keeping a journal for these reflections?

User: That sounds helpful! I think it might help me regain focus. 

Consultant: Excellent! As you keep this journal, we can also practice some positive affirmations that you can tell yourself just before you meet a client. For example, "I am capable and have strengths to share." What do you think?

User: I like that idea! I tend to forget my strengths in stressful moments. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing your strengths is key. Alongside the journal, we can create a small list of strengths together. What would you say are some of your strengths as a salesperson?

User: I consider myself good at understanding client needs and building rapport. I’ve received positive feedback on that before.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strengths! Building rapport can help alleviate some of your anxiety with clients. If you remind yourself of these strengths before interactions, how might that change your experience?

User: I think it might help me feel more confident and less focused on stuttering. 

Consultant: Exactly! Bringing attention to those strengths can shift your focus from anxiety to your abilities. After this session, how about you try sharing your thoughts in another group session? It could reinforce your progress.

User: That sounds like a great opportunity. I’ll definitely try to share more. 

Consultant: I believe you will do well. Let’s also set a goal for our next session to discuss how it went and any new feelings or thoughts that arose from the experience. Does that sound good?

User: Yes, I'm looking forward to that. I feel more optimistic about sharing with others now. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s all about taking small steps forward. We can also discuss other situations that trigger your anxiety if you'd like. 

User: I’d like that. Sometimes, interactions at work feel overwhelming, especially with new faces.

Consultant: That makes sense. Overwhelming interactions can amplify anxiety. Would it be helpful to role-play a few of those situations before our next session?

User: Yes, practice would help me a lot! 

Consultant: Perfect! We can do some role-playing to make you feel more prepared. Remember, every effort you make is progress. Keep focusing on your positives and support systems until our next meeting. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember, you've made significant strides. In our next session, we can review your journal and role-play exercises. Take care until then! 

User: I will! Looking forward to it.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Wei! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling much better, actually. My confidence has improved quite a lot, especially after successfully leading the weekly meeting at work. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Leading the meeting sounds like a significant accomplishment. How do you think this experience has impacted your feelings about your speech difficulties?

User: I think it has made me worry less about my stuttering. I felt more confident speaking in front of my colleagues, and I received positive feedback, which really boosted my spirits. 

Consultant: It's excellent that you received positive feedback and that you're feeling more confident. It sounds like you're making great progress. What strategies do you think have helped you most in overcoming your previous anxieties?

User: I’ve been trying to focus on my strengths and remind myself that everyone has their imperfections. It’s helped me to be more patient with myself when I speak. 

Consultant: That’s a great approach, Zhang Wei. Focusing on your strengths and practicing self-compassion can be very effective. Are there moments when you still find yourself feeling anxious about communication?

User: Sometimes, yes. When I’m meeting new clients, I still feel that anxiety creeping in. I worry that my speech will not be fluent and that they might judge me. 

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel anxious in new situations. Let’s explore these feelings a bit more—what thoughts go through your mind when you think about speaking with new clients?

User: I often think, “What if I stumble over my words?” or “What if they don't take me seriously because of my stutter?” 

Consultant: Those thoughts can indeed create a lot of stress. It sounds like you might be caught in a cycle of negative thinking. If a friend had similar thoughts, what would you advise them to focus on instead?

User: I would probably tell them to remember their capabilities and to focus on the value they bring to the conversation, not just on the delivery. 

Consultant: That’s a very wise response! It seems like you already have the tools to challenge those thoughts. How about we practice reframing those negative thoughts together? 

User: Sure, I think that might help. 

Consultant: Great! When you think, “What if I stumble over my words?” can we reframe it to something more constructive? For example, “It’s okay to be imperfect, and I can still convey my message effectively.” Would that work for you?

User: Yes, I like that. It feels more supportive rather than critical. 

Consultant: I'm glad you find it helpful! The next step is to test this out in real-life situations. How do you feel about setting a small goal for your next client meeting to practice this mindset?

User: That sounds doable. Maybe I can remind myself of that reframe right before the meeting. 

Consultant: Perfect! Preparing that thought in advance can make a difference. Let's talk about how you'll evaluate your experience after the meeting. What do you want to focus on evaluating afterwards?

User: I think I want to focus on how well I managed my feelings of anxiety during the meeting and whether I could communicate my points effectively. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Reflecting on how you managed anxiety and communicated will provide valuable insights. Would you like to discuss any potential triggers that could arise in these situations?

User: Yes, I've noticed that unforeseen questions from clients tend to trigger my anxiety. 

Consultant: That’s important to recognize. How about we develop a strategy for handling unexpected questions? One approach could be taking a moment to breathe and gather your thoughts before responding. 

User: Yes, I think pausing before responding would help a lot. I often rush my answers because I’m nervous. 

Consultant: Exactly! That pause can give you a moment to collect your thoughts and respond more calmly. How do you feel about incorporating that into your meetings?

User: I’m definitely willing to try that out. 

Consultant: Fantastic! It sounds like you’re really committed to this process. As we wrap up, let’s reflect on your progress. What do you feel has been your biggest achievement since we started these sessions?

User: I believe accepting my imperfections and feeling supported by my colleagues is my biggest achievement. I realize that I can still perform well despite stuttering. 

Consultant: That's a great realization! Acknowledging your worth beyond your speech is a powerful step. How would you like to maintain this positive outlook moving forward?

User: I think I’ll keep practicing my reframes, and maybe even keep a journal of my successes. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Journaling can help reinforce your progress and boost your confidence further. Before we conclude, do you feel you have the tools now to continue managing your anxiety effectively?

User: Yes, I feel much more equipped now, and I appreciate all your support in helping me find these strategies. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you've made. Remember, it’s okay to return if you feel you need more support down the line. Take care, and I wish you all the best!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate it.
