Consultant: Hello, A! It's great to see you again. I remember that last time we talked about your feelings of self-doubt and anxiety. How have things been for you since then?

User: Hi! Thanks for having me. I've been feeling quite overwhelmed, to be honest. I often find myself comparing myself to others in school, especially to those I perceive as more talented or better at socializing. It makes me really self-critical.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you've been struggling with those comparisons and it's really weighing on you. Can we start by discussing what specific thoughts come to your mind when you compare yourself to your classmates?

User: Well, I often think things like, "They are so much better than me," or "I'll never be as good at this as they are." It just makes me feel really small and unworthy.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really challenging to deal with. When you think these things, what emotions do you typically experience? 

User: I feel anxious and sad. Sometimes I even get angry at myself for feeling this way, which isn't helpful at all. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel frustrated with yourself in those moments. It seems like these thoughts trigger a cycle of negative emotions. Let's explore those automatic thoughts further. Can you recall when you last felt this way? What was happening around that time?

User: Just yesterday, I was in a group project. I felt like everyone was contributing more than I was, and I ended up saying nothing. I felt embarrassed because I didn’t want to hold them back.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult. It’s common to feel pressure in group settings. When you didn't speak up, what thoughts were running through your mind?

User: I thought, "What if they think I'm useless?" and "I should have done better." 

Consultant: Those are powerful thoughts. Let’s take a closer look at one of them, like "What if they think I'm useless?" How true do you believe this thought is? Do you have any evidence that supports or contradicts it?

User: I guess there's no real evidence that they think that. They didn’t say anything negative to me, but I still felt that way anyway. 

Consultant: That's an important realization. It sounds like the thought may not be based on actual feedback from others. Let's challenge it a bit—if a friend were in your situation and thought, "What if they think I'm useless?" how would you respond to them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has different strengths and that they're not useless at all. 

Consultant: Exactly! You would remind them of their worth. It's helpful to apply that same kindness to yourself. Let's work together to create an alternative thought that feels more supportive. How about trying something like, "I have valuable contributions to make, even if they look different from others"?

User: That sounds really good! I like that thought. 

Consultant: Great! Now, let’s discuss how you can practice this new belief. Can you think of ways to remind yourself of it before or during group projects?

User: Maybe I can take a moment to breathe and remind myself of my strengths before speaking up. I just need to believe that my input matters.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Practicing that self-affirmation can help reduce anxiety. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel hopeful, actually! It feels nice to think that I have something to offer.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s important to acknowledge your self-worth and contributions. As we proceed, we can also explore activities that make you feel more confident. What type of things do you enjoy that bring you joy?

User: I love painting and sometimes I feel really good about it. 

Consultant: That's wonderful! Engaging in activities you're passionate about can boost your confidence. How about setting aside some time each week for painting? 

User: Yes, I’d love that! It makes me feel so relaxed and creative. 

Consultant: Fantastic! Let's also talk about how you could handle situations differently in the future, especially when you start to feel self-critical during group tasks. 

User: I think I’d like to practice speaking up, even if it’s just sharing a small idea. 

Consultant: That’s a great goal! Starting small can really help ease the pressure. Would you like to set a specific intention for your next group interaction?

User: Yes! I want to share at least one thought or suggestion without worrying too much about what others think. 

Consultant: Excellent! That’s a very achievable goal. Remember, each step you take is progress. As we wrap up our session today, what do you feel is the most valuable insight you've gained?

User: I realized that I need to be kinder to myself and that my thoughts are often not true. I want to challenge those negative beliefs more actively.

Consultant: That's a significant takeaway! As we finish, let's plan for our next session. You can reflect on how it went when you try sharing your thoughts in your group. We'll tackle more strategies to reinforce your progress. 

User: That sounds great! Thank you for all your help today. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, A! You've made important steps today, and I look forward to hearing how it all goes in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hi there! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been thinking a lot about what we discussed. I've felt quite ashamed about blaming my classmate for my lateness. It made me realize how often I try to avoid taking responsibility for my actions.

Consultant: It sounds like you've been reflecting deeply on your feelings and behaviors. Acknowledging that need for change is a significant first step. Can you tell me more about how that blame affected your emotions afterwards?

User: Yes, I felt really guilty after blaming her. I kept replaying the situation in my mind, feeling more and more regret. It’s like I want to change but find it tough to shake off that feeling of inadequacy.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel regret, especially when we recognize a pattern of behavior that doesn’t serve us well. When you think about that moment, what thoughts or beliefs did you notice coming up?

User: I kept thinking that I should be perfect and never make mistakes. I felt like I had to blame someone because admitting my fault would mean I’m not good enough.

Consultant: Those thoughts can feel quite heavy. It seems like there's a strong pressure for you to be perfect. If you saw a friend in your situation who faced a similar challenge, what would you say to her?

User: I would probably tell her that everyone makes mistakes, and it’s okay to admit when you’re wrong. But when it’s me, it feels different—like I have to be better.

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate perspective you have! It shows that you recognize the humanity in others. Let’s explore how you can apply that same kindness toward yourself. What if you allowed yourself to be imperfect?

User: I guess it might feel less stressful if I could just accept that mistakes happen. But I fear that if I accept makes mistakes, I might just keep making them.

Consultant: That’s a common concern. However, acknowledging our imperfections doesn’t mean we will stop trying to improve ourselves. What if we practiced a scenario where you confronted the situation differently next time? 

User: Sure! I think that could help. I could see how I might react differently instead of blaming others.

Consultant: Great! Let’s role-play a situation where you're running late again. This time, instead of blaming someone else, you take a moment to pause and reflect. How would you like to start this role-play?

User: Maybe I could say something like, "I’m sorry I’m late, I should have planned my time better."

Consultant: That sounds like a good start! How might that response make you feel compared to blaming someone else?

User: I think it would make me feel more in control and less guilty afterward. It’s like I'm acknowledging my mistake rather than deflecting it.

Consultant: Exactly! Taking responsibility can feel empowering. When you focus on how to improve instead of placing blame, you shift from feeling ashamed to feeling proactive. What thoughts do you think might come up as you practice this response in real life?

User: I might initially feel anxious about admitting my fault, but I hope to feel proud afterwards for being honest.

Consultant: That’s a powerful shift in mindset! Could we brainstorm ways to manage the anxiety you might feel in that moment?

User: I think I could remind myself that everyone makes mistakes. Maybe I could take a deep breath to calm down before speaking.

Consultant: Yes, deep breathing can be very beneficial! Practicing self-affirmations before you face these situations could also help. What would be a good affirmation for you?

User: I could say, "I am working to be better, and it's okay to make mistakes sometimes."

Consultant: That’s a wonderful affirmation! By repeating that to yourself, you could foster a more supportive internal dialogue. How do you feel about these strategies we’ve discussed?

User: I feel hopeful! I see that I have some tools to change how I react.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Remember, change takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks. As we wrap up today’s session, how are you feeling overall regarding your relationship with your boyfriend?

User: Honestly, I still worry about whether I’m good enough for him. I don’t want to push him away with my insecurities.

Consultant: That’s a very valid concern. Let’s explore that a bit. Have those feelings affected how you interact with him?

User: Yes, I sometimes pull back because I’m afraid of being rejected. I know it’s not fair to him.

Consultant: Recognizing that is really important. One way to combat those feelings is open communication. How about discussing your feelings with him and inviting his perspective? 

User: I think I could—though it’s really scary. What if he doesn’t understand?

Consultant: It’s natural to feel apprehensive. However, sharing your feelings can deepen your connection. How do you feel about bringing that up next time you talk?

User: I feel nervous but also a bit relieved that I could be honest. 

Consultant: That's a positive step! Let's work on ways to frame that discussion. Remember, this is a chance for both of you to understand each other better. I believe in your ability to have that conversation. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support today. I feel like I have a clearer plan moving forward.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m glad you found our session helpful. As we conclude today, what’s one main takeaway you’re taking with you?

User: I’ll remember that acknowledging my mistakes doesn’t define me, and I can still strive to improve. 

Consultant: That’s an insightful takeaway! I’m proud of you for recognizing that. Remember, I’m here whenever you need to talk again. Take care! 

User: You too! Thank you for everything.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you here today. I remember that you've been working on your feelings regarding your relationship. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been quite anxious lately. I had a small argument with my boyfriend, and now I can't stop worrying that he might leave me. It's really unsettling.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially after a disagreement. Can you share more about what specifically worries you about the situation with your boyfriend?

User: I keep thinking that maybe I'm just not worth it for him. I have this nagging feeling that he should be with someone better, and it's making me doubt myself.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. So it sounds like you're feeling inadequate and questioning your worth in this relationship. What kind of thoughts come to mind when you feel this way?

User: I often think that I'm too much of a hassle for him. Like, why would he want to be with someone who gets anxious and insecure easily? It feels like I'm just pushing him away.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite heavy, and it sounds like they contribute to your anxiety. Can we explore how accurate these thoughts are? What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts them?

User: I mean, he tells me he likes me, but then I think maybe he just feels sorry for me. It's hard to shake off that belief.

Consultant: It's common to have doubts, and it can be helpful to reflect on what he appreciates about you. If a friend were in your situation, what might you tell them about their worth?

User: I would probably remind them of all the good things they bring to a relationship and how they are loved for who they are. 

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! Now, let's try to think about how you can apply that to your own situation. What could you tell yourself that might challenge those negative thoughts about your worth?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that I have qualities that he values. I just need to focus on the positive aspects instead of dwelling on my fears.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive strategy! What are some specific qualities you believe he appreciates about you?

User: I think he likes my supportiveness and that I make him laugh.

Consultant: Those are wonderful qualities! How about we set a small task for you? For the next week, I’d like you to notice and list situations where he shows appreciation for you. How does that sound?

User: I think that could help me. It would be good to have concrete examples to counter my worries.

Consultant: Absolutely! This can be a valuable way to acknowledge the positive aspects of your relationship. Whenever you catch yourself spiraling into negative thoughts, referring back to your list can help ground you. 

User: I’ll definitely try that! I still feel anxious though, especially if I think about us arguing again.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Can we work on facing this fear a bit? What would it look like if you were to have a disagreement but still feel secure in your relationship?

User: I guess it would mean knowing that we could talk things through and that we’d both work to understand each other rather than just give up.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like communication is key for you. What steps can you take to foster that kind of open dialogue with him after a disagreement?

User: I suppose I could express how I feel about our arguments and ask how he feels too. That way, it doesn’t feel like we're just fighting.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Expressing your feelings and prompting him to share his can definitely strengthen your connection. How confident do you feel about initiating such a conversation?

User: I’m a bit nervous, but I think it could be worth it. I just need to believe that it’s okay to be vulnerable with him.

Consultant: Remember, vulnerability can actually deepen intimacy in a relationship. Let’s make this a goal for you to express your feelings openly. How about trying this in the next conversation you have with him?

User: That sounds good. I’ll try to be more open, even if it feels uncomfortable at first.

Consultant: That’s a brave step! It's all about gradual exposure to these fears. Would it help to prepare some phrases or feelings you want to express, to feel more equipped when that moment comes?

User: Yes, that could help me feel less anxious about how to start the conversation. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Write down those thoughts or feelings. Before our next session, reflect on how it felt after your discussion. Share what worked and what didn’t. 

User: I’ll definitely do that! I feel a bit lighter just thinking about it.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, let’s recap what you’ve learned. You’ve acknowledged your feelings, recognized your worth, and planned to communicate openly. What has been your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I think realizing that I have qualities that he values and that it’s important to communicate about my feelings has helped a lot.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic insight! Remember, accepting compliments and recognizing your worth is vital. We’ll explore more on this in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to practicing what we've discussed.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in you, and I’m here to support you. If you need to reach out before our next meeting, don’t hesitate. Take care!

User: I will, thanks! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're joining me today. I remember our last session focused on the challenges you faced with accepting compliments from others. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I've been thinking about what we discussed. I realize I tend to avoid compliments, which makes me feel uncomfortable. But I really want to change that and feel more confident.

Consultant: It's great to hear you're reflecting on this! Acknowledging your feelings is an important step. Can you share an experience from the past week where you received a compliment? How did it make you feel?

User: Well, during a group project, a classmate praised my leadership skills. I just smiled, felt awkward, and quickly changed the subject. I didn’t know how to respond.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like receiving praise made you feel uncomfortable, which led you to deflect it. What do you think made you feel awkward in that moment?

User: I guess I felt like I didn't deserve the praise. I keep thinking I'm just doing what anyone else could do. 

Consultant: That’s a common thought—underestimating your accomplishments. What evidence do you have that supports the idea you don’t deserve compliments? 

User: I suppose I just feel like I’m not as good as others. It feels like I'm just lucky or something.

Consultant: It's important to challenge those thoughts. If a friend had done well and received compliments, would you think they didn’t deserve it? What would you say to them?

User: No, I would tell them they worked hard and earned it. It’s different when it comes to me, though.

Consultant: Exactly! You can recognize the effort in others. Now let's use that perspective for yourself. What if those accomplishments and qualities you notice in others are also true for you? 

User: That sounds nice, but it feels difficult to believe. I want to see myself in that positive light.

Consultant: It’s a process, and it starts with small steps. How about we try acknowledging a specific strength you have? What’s one thing you think you’re good at?

User: I think I’m good at organizing events. People often enjoy what I plan.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! You have a talent that others appreciate. This is a strength you can recognize in yourself. How would it feel to accept compliments about your organizing skills, rather than deflecting them?

User: I think I would feel happy, maybe even proud. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It’s okay to feel proud of your achievements. Let’s practice how you might respond next time someone praises your organizing skills. 

User: Okay. Maybe I could say "thank you" and share a bit about what I enjoyed during the planning?

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Engaging with the compliment allows you to embrace it rather than avoid it. Can you think of a situation coming up where you might have a chance to practice this?

User: Yes, there's an upcoming event I’m organizing. I might get feedback about it afterward.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful opportunity! When someone compliments you on the event, remember to acknowledge it. What specific thoughts will you remind yourself of in that moment?

User: I’ll remind myself that it’s okay to feel proud and that others value my efforts.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mantra! How does it feel to think about sharing your accomplishments with others in this way?

User: It feels empowering. I like the idea of being open about my successes.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful shift. Over time, this can lead to a stronger sense of self-assurance. We can explore these feelings further, but for now, let’s set a goal for your upcoming event regarding compliments.

User: How about I aim to accept at least one compliment and respond positively?

Consultant: That sounds like a great goal! Remember, it’s a step-by-step process. When you accept a compliment, you’re validating your hard work. 

User: Yes! I’ll definitely try to keep that in mind.

Consultant: Excellent! As we wrap up, how are you feeling about the progress you've made today?

User: I feel more optimistic. I’m excited to challenge my old habits and work on accepting compliments.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It's great to see your willingness to change. Remember, you're not alone in this journey—I'm here to help you through it.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session. Keep practicing, and take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, A! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling surprisingly good. Participating in the psychological salon and sharing my successes helped me open up more.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Sharing your achievements can be a powerful way to reinforce positive feelings. Can you tell me more about how that experience impacted you?

User: It felt empowering to speak about my accomplishments. I received positive feedback from others, and it made me more confident in myself.

Consultant: It sounds like that support from others really resonated with you. How did you feel during and after sharing your experiences?

User: During the sharing, I felt nervous at first, but once I started talking, I felt lighter and connected with the group. Afterward, I was really proud of myself.

Consultant: That's a great development! It's incredible how sharing can help alleviate those initial nerves. Did you notice any changes in your thoughts or feelings about yourself after this experience?

User: Yes! I realized that my achievements are worth sharing and that people appreciate hearing about them. It helped challenge my self-doubt.

Consultant: That's an important insight. Recognizing the value of your experiences can significantly shift your self-perception. How do you see this newfound confidence affecting your daily life?

User: I think it will encourage me to participate more in class and maybe even take on leadership roles in the student council. 

Consultant: That's an excellent aspiration! Seeking out leadership opportunities is a fantastic way to build on your confidence. Are there specific situations where you feel hesitant to share or participate yet?

User: Sometimes, I still hesitate to speak up in larger groups or when I feel less knowledgeable than others.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. Let’s explore this a bit—what thoughts go through your mind when you find yourself in those situations?

User: I often think that others will judge me or that my opinions aren’t valuable. 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy. Let's challenge them together. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts the idea that others would judge you harshly?

User: I guess I can't really know what others are thinking. There were people who encouraged me during the salon, so maybe it's not as bad as I think.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re recognizing that you don’t have proof of those negative judgments. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell her?

User: I’d say everyone has their unique perspective, and sharing can help all of us learn from each other.

Consultant: Exactly! Your voice is valuable and can contribute to a richer discussion. Looking ahead, what steps can you take to practice sharing your thoughts more in those larger groups?

User: I might start by preparing a few points before discussions so I feel more ready. Just small contributions to begin with.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical approach! Gradually sharing your thoughts can help ease the pressure. How does that plan make you feel?

User: It makes me feel excited but also a little anxious. I want to overcome that anxiety. 

Consultant: Those mixed feelings are completely natural. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Would you be willing to try out your plan in the upcoming week, and we can discuss how it goes?

User: Yes, I’d love to! I think having that goal will help me focus on my growth.

Consultant: That's the spirit! I believe this can really support your journey. As we wrap up today, let's reflect on your progress and what you've learned about yourself.

User: I feel really good about recognizing my strengths and how sharing can help me.

Consultant: Fantastic! You've made significant strides in understanding the importance of sharing and accepting yourself. How can you maintain this positive mindset moving forward?

User: I can remind myself of the positive feedback I received and intentionally seek opportunities to share.

Consultant: That's a solid plan! Keeping those reminders close will help you thrive in your journey. As this session comes to an end, I'm proud of the growth you've shown, and remember, you’re welcome back anytime you need support. 

User: Thank you! I feel more confident and ready to face challenges now. I appreciate your guidance!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm excited for your journey ahead. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, I'm so glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. My relationship with my boyfriend has really improved, and I feel more confident discussing our issues. It's nice to have smoother communication with friends and family too.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re experiencing some significant positive changes. What specific aspects of these improvements make you feel most satisfied?

User: I think it's the feeling of being able to openly share my thoughts and emotions. I don't feel as anxious about our conversations anymore, and I really appreciate that.

Consultant: It sounds like you've developed a stronger sense of security in your relationships. How do you think this newfound confidence has impacted your daily life or your interactions with others?

User: I feel more engaged in my classes and with my peers. I'm participating more in discussions and not holding back my opinions. It’s a nice change for me.

Consultant: That’s excellent! It seems like your confidence is positively influencing your academic and social life. Can you identify any specific strategies or thoughts that helped you achieve this sense of confidence?

User: I’ve been practicing positive self-talk. I also remind myself that it’s okay to express my opinions and that people value what I have to say.

Consultant: Positive self-talk can be very powerful! How did you start incorporating that into your routine? Was there a particular moment or realization that led you to this practice?

User: I guess it started after our previous sessions. I realized how important it is to encourage myself instead of doubting my capabilities all the time.

Consultant: That insight is a significant step towards maintaining your progress. Have you noticed any particular situations where you still feel some self-doubt creeping in?

User: Sometimes, when I meet new people, I still feel a bit insecure. It’s like the fear of judgment comes rushing back at those moments.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel some insecurity in new situations. What thoughts go through your mind during those moments of doubt?

User: I often worry that they won’t like me or think I’m not interesting. Sometimes, it's hard to shake off those thoughts.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me. How might you challenge those thoughts when they arise? What alternative thoughts can you remind yourself of in those situations?

User: I guess I could remind myself that everyone feels nervous sometimes, and that it's okay to just be myself. I could also focus on what I like about others instead of worrying so much about their opinions of me.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy approach! Shifting the focus to others can lessen the pressure on yourself. How do you plan to practice this mindset when meeting new people in the future?

User: I could set a small goal to strike up a conversation with someone new without overthinking it. Just relax and be present in the moment.

Consultant: That's a fantastic plan! Setting small, achievable goals can help reduce anxiety and enhance your social interactions. What supports can you put in place to help you reach these goals?

User: I could ask a friend to join me in social situations, so I won’t feel alone. I could also remind myself of the progress I’ve made.

Consultant: Having a supportive friend can make a big difference! It sounds like you have a good vision for how to keep moving forward. As we wrap up our sessions today, let’s reflect on the progress you've made overall.

User: Sure! I feel like I’ve come a long way since we first started. I used to feel overwhelmed and uncertain about my relationships, but now I feel much more in control.

Consultant: It’s amazing to see such growth! What strategies do you think will be most effective for you in maintaining this progress in the future?

User: I think continuing with positive self-talk and being proactive about my relationships will really help. I want to keep challenging myself to be open and vulnerable with others.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies for sustaining your growth. Remember, maintaining this positive mindset takes practice, but you’ve definitely built a strong foundation. If you ever feel like you’re struggling again, know that you can always reach out for support.

User: Thank you! I appreciate everything. I feel much better equipped to handle things now.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! Today marks the conclusion of our sessions, but always remember the tools and insights you've gained. You’ve shown great strength in your journey. Best of luck with everything ahead!

User: Thank you so much! I feel really hopeful about my future.
