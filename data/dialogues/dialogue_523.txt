Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I don’t know. I feel like I keep getting in trouble at school, and it’s making me a bit confused and frustrated. 

Consultant: It sounds like school has been tough for you lately, and I can see how that would make you feel frustrated. Can you tell me more about what has been happening at school?

User: Well, I keep getting yelled at by my teacher because I'm not paying attention. I just zone out and then she gets mad at me.

Consultant: I can imagine that could be really overwhelming for you. When your teacher gets upset, how does that make you feel?

User: I feel really embarrassed, and sometimes I think they don't like me. I just want to do better, but it’s hard to focus.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling a lot of pressure to improve. Let’s dig deeper—when you find yourself zoning out, what kinds of thoughts are going through your mind at that moment?

User: I don't know... maybe I'm thinking about what I want to do after school, like playing games or hanging out with my friends.

Consultant: That's understandable! It might be easier to think about fun things than what’s happening in class. Do you think those thoughts distract you from paying attention?

User: Yeah, they do! I guess I just want to escape for a bit.

Consultant: That makes sense. It seems like you’re looking for a break from schoolwork. Let’s explore this a little more. What do you think happens when you’re not paying attention and your teacher calls on you?

User: I feel panicky and just guess what to say, but usually, it’s wrong. Then I feel dumb.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s normal to feel anxious in those situations. How does feeling dumb affect your willingness to participate in class?

User: I don’t want to raise my hand anymore because I’m scared of messing up. 

Consultant: I understand. It seems like that fear is holding you back. Let’s think about some ways to change that feeling. Have you ever thought about what might happen if you took a guess and it turned out to be wrong?

User: I guess it wouldn’t be the end of the world, but it feels like it in the moment.

Consultant: That's a great observation. Sometimes, we can be our own worst critics. What if we tried to reframe those thoughts? What would it look like if you saw guessing as an opportunity to learn instead of a chance to fail?

User: That might help. But it’s hard to think about it that way when I'm in class.

Consultant: It definitely can be hard! How about we try practicing some ways to shift your thoughts before class? Maybe we can come up with a short phrase you can remind yourself of when you feel anxious.

User: Yeah, that could work. 

Consultant: Awesome! Let’s think of something empowering—maybe something like, “It’s okay to make mistakes; I’m learning.” How does that sound to you?

User: I like that! I think saying that in my head could help.

Consultant: Great! We can also practice some relaxation techniques together that you can use before class to help calm your nerves. Would you like to try that?

User: Yes, I’d like to learn! 

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s start by taking some deep breaths together. Breathe in deeply through your nose... and out through your mouth... Good! How does that feel?

User: It feels nice. I like this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Deep breathing can be a helpful tool. We can use these techniques when you start feeling anxious or distracted in class. Let’s work on integrating this into your routine. What do you think?

User: I think I can try that.

Consultant: Perfect! It’s all about gradual steps. Now, can we talk about a time lately when you felt those impulses to act out in class? What was happening?

User: Um, I was playing with my pencil and not paying attention. The teacher noticed and told me to stop, but I just kept tapping it.

Consultant: That’s a great example. It sounds like you were having a hard time controlling that urge. What do you think made you keep tapping the pencil?

User: I don’t know. I wanted to do something else and it was fun to play with it. 

Consultant: Understandable! When you find yourself wanting to play with something, how can you remind yourself of the goal of focusing in class?

User: Maybe I could squeeze a stress ball or something instead?

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Having a different outlet can be very helpful. Let’s try to establish a plan for you to use that when you feel the urge to play with things in class. 

User: Okay, I’ll try that this week! 

Consultant: Fantastic! It sounds like you’re making some great plans. As we wrap up for today, let’s review what we’ve discussed. What strategies do you feel most confident about using going forward?

User: I really like the breathing and the phrase about learning from mistakes. 

Consultant: That’s great! Those will be powerful tools for you. Remember, it’s all about practice, and it’s okay to take your time. I believe in you, and I’m here for any support you need. 

User: Thanks! I feel a bit better now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’ve done some important work today. Next time we meet, we can continue to explore how these strategies are working for you. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything before then!

User: I will. Thank you for helping me! 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and I look forward to seeing you soon!

Consultant: Hello there! I'm glad you're here today. Let's take a moment to talk about what's been going on for you. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Well, I’ve been feeling really confused and bad about something that happened during a class activity. I got into a fight with a classmate, and I can't stop thinking about it. It makes me feel very guilty.

Consultant: I can see that this has really been bothering you. It's completely normal to feel confused and guilty after a conflict. Could you tell me more about what led to that fight?

User: We were playing a game, and I thought my classmate was cheating. I got really angry and just pushed him. I didn't mean to, but I lost control.

Consultant: It sounds like you were feeling really upset at that moment. Anger can really take over our feelings sometimes. How did you feel after the fight was over?

User: I felt bad—really bad. I didn’t want to hurt anyone, but I couldn’t stop myself. I keep replaying it in my head, and now I'm worried about what my friends and teachers think of me.

Consultant: It's understandable to worry about others' opinions, especially after an incident like that. You mentioned losing control over your emotions—what do you think triggered that reaction?

User: I think I was just really frustrated because I felt like nobody was taking the game seriously. I didn’t want to get embarrassed in front of everyone.

Consultant: Frustration can build up and lead to strong reactions. When you felt that frustration, did you notice any specific thoughts running through your mind?

User: I thought, “This isn't fair!” and “I hate it when people cheat!” It just made me so mad, I didn’t think before I acted.

Consultant: Those thoughts are very powerful and can lead to strong emotions. Let’s work on identifying how those thoughts link to your feelings. How did you feel physically when you thought those things?

User: I felt my heart racing, and my stomach was in knots. It was like I couldn’t control my body.

Consultant: Those physical sensations can signal intense emotional states. It seems like your body reacted before your mind could catch up. What if we try to find a way to pause before reacting next time? What could help you in those moments?

User: Maybe I could take a deep breath or count to ten before I act. That might help.

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! Taking a moment to breathe can really help you regain control. What other strategies can you think of to express your feelings without losing control?

User: I could talk to someone instead of just acting out. I think I need to express my feelings more instead of just keeping them inside.

Consultant: Absolutely! Talking it out is a fantastic way to manage those feelings. How do you think you could practice sharing your feelings with others in a safe way?

User: I could try talking to my grandparents more about how I feel. They always listen, even if they don’t understand everything.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Sharing with those who care about you can build that communication. How do you feel about trying that in the coming week?

User: I feel a little nervous but also hopeful. It might help me not feel so alone.

Consultant: It makes sense to feel nervous, but taking that step could really strengthen your connections. We can also role-play. Want to try practicing how you might express your feelings with a friend or your grandparents?

User: Yes! That sounds helpful.

Consultant: Let’s imagine a scenario where you're feeling frustrated again. Can you describe what the situation might be like?

User: Maybe if my friend wins and I feel he didn’t play fair, I could say something like, “I felt frustrated during the game, and I think we should talk about it.”

Consultant: That’s a great start! You’re expressing how you feel and inviting a conversation rather than reacting angrily. How might your friend respond to that?

User: I think he might understand. If I tell him how I feel, he could see it from my perspective.

Consultant: Exactly! It shows you’re willing to communicate and resolve things peacefully. Being open can really improve those social connections. 

User: Yeah, I really want to get better at this. It’s tough sometimes.

Consultant: It can be challenging, but remember, every small step you take builds your confidence. How are you feeling about your ability to express yourself better now?

User: I feel a little more confident. It’s good to think I have other options besides getting angry.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! Capturing those options can help you manage your emotions. How will you remind yourself of this in the future?

User: I could write it down and put it somewhere I can see it.

Consultant: Excellent plan! Having reminders can be very helpful. Now that we've discussed these strategies, what would you like to focus on next time we meet?

User: I think I want to explore more about how I can deal with my feelings when they get too intense.

Consultant: Absolutely, we can delve further into that. I’m looking forward to our next session. Remember, you’re doing great work on understanding your emotions and finding healthier ways to express them. See you next time! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. See you!

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're here today. Let's talk about how you've been feeling. What’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling pretty down. I tried to make friends during my extracurricular activities, but it didn't go well. I’m starting to feel like I can’t socialize properly.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're feeling disappointed after those attempts to connect with your peers. Can you tell me more about what happened? What did you hope would happen?

User: I thought I could join in some games and have fun, but when I tried to talk to them, they seemed to ignore me. It made me feel like I don’t have what it takes to make friends.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, and it's completely understandable to feel that way after such experiences. How did that situation make you feel about your social skills?

User: I definitely feel less confident. I thought I could be friendly, but now I'm scared to try again because I don't want to be ignored again.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel apprehensive after what you experienced. Lets explore this further. Can you recall any thoughts that crossed your mind in that moment when you felt ignored?

User: I kept thinking that I must be boring or not interesting enough for them to want to talk to me.

Consultant: That thought must have hurt, and it's pretty common to assume the worst about ourselves after an experience like that. Instead of being boring, what do you think are some things that make you interesting?

User: I like playing soccer, and I also enjoy video games. I’m good at them.

Consultant: Those are great interests! Many people enjoy sports and video games, and they can be great conversation starters. Would you be willing to share those interests with others next time you interact?

User: I guess I could, but what if they still don’t want to talk to me?

Consultant: It's natural to worry about that, but remember that not every interaction will lead to a deep friendship. It's about finding the right connections. If someone doesn’t engage, it reflects more about them than you. What if we practice how you might bring those topics into a conversation?

User: Okay, that sounds good. How would I start?

Consultant: You might start with something like, “Hey, do you play soccer? I love it!” This not only shares your interest but invites others to join the conversation too. How does that approach sound to you?

User: It sounds a lot easier than I thought! I still feel a bit anxious, though.

Consultant: That’s totally valid. It’s completely normal to feel a bit anxious when reaching out to others. We can work together on strategies to help manage that anxiety. Would you like to discuss how you can prepare yourself before these interactions?

User: Yes! I want to know how to feel less scared.

Consultant: One way is to practice some calming techniques, like taking deep breaths before you engage with others. Another way could be to visualize a positive outcome before going into social settings. How do you feel about trying those strategies?

User: I think that could help a lot. I like the idea of imagining it going well.

Consultant: Great! Visualization can really set a positive tone. Let's also think about small steps to take. What if you aimed to say hello to one new person each time you attend a group activity? How would that feel to you?

User: That sounds manageable. Just one hello seems like it wouldn’t be too hard.

Consultant: Exactly! It's about taking it step by step. After you’ve tried it, we can discuss how it went and adjust your approach if necessary. What kind of support would help you feel more confident while trying this?

User: Maybe just knowing that I can talk about it here would help. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! This space is always open for you to share your experiences. You’re building the foundation for new interactions—remember, it’s okay to feel nervous, but each step, no matter how small, is progress. 

User: Thanks! It helps to talk about it. I just hope I won't feel super sad again.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. We can work on strategies together to handle those feelings if they come up. It's okay to feel nervous, but you’re taking steps to change things. What's one positive thing you can focus on as you try this out?

User: Maybe I can think about the fun I might have during the activities.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset! Focusing on potential fun is a great way to shift your perspective. Let’s keep that as your goal for future interactions. 

User: I feel a tiny bit better thinking like that. I really hope I can make friends.

Consultant: I’m confident that with that positive approach and the strategies we’ve discussed, you’re on the right track. Remember, it's okay to take your time. 

User: Thanks! I feel a bit proud of myself for having a plan.

Consultant: You should be proud! Having a plan is a great step forward. It's normal to still have worries, but acknowledging your progress is important. How do you feel about the possibility of facing those worries now?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I guess there’s always a chance things could go better next time.

Consultant: Absolutely! Each new experience is a chance for a different outcome. Keep that optimism close. We’ll continue to build on this progress in our future sessions, too. 

User: Thanks for listening. I really appreciate it. 

Consultant: It was my pleasure! I’m here to support you, and I look forward to hearing how your interactions go. Remember, you can always return if you need to talk more.

Consultant: Hello there! Welcome to today’s session. I’m glad to see you. I’d love to hear about how you’ve been feeling since our last meeting, especially with that performance at school.

User: Hi! Thanks! I felt really proud when I performed in front of everyone. My teacher even praised me, and it was nice to hear. But now, I’m worried that if I have to perform again, I might mess up.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you felt proud and received praise! That’s a fantastic achievement. I understand you're feeling anxious about the possibility of performing again. Can we explore those worries a bit? What exactly makes you feel like you might mess up again?

User: I guess I'm just scared that I won’t do as well next time. What if I forget my lines or make a mistake? 

Consultant: It makes sense to feel nervous about that. Fearing mistakes can be tough, especially after a positive experience. Let's try to break that down—when you think about forgetting lines, what thoughts come to your mind?

User: I think everyone will laugh at me or be disappointed. 

Consultant: That sounds really difficult to cope with. It’s understandable to worry about what others think. But let's look at this together—how likely do you think it is that everyone would actually laugh or be disappointed if something goes wrong?

User: I think it’s pretty likely… Well, some of my friends might laugh.

Consultant: I hear you. It feels like a real fear. However, do you think your friends would be supportive too, especially after they saw you perform well last time? 

User: Yeah, they probably would be supportive. But still, I feel nervous.

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s normal to feel nervous, especially when you care about doing well. Can we try to think of a time when something didn’t go perfectly but still turned out okay? How did that feel for you?

User: Well, once I forgot part of a project presentation, but my teacher just helped me get back on track. It wasn’t too bad.

Consultant: That’s a great example! It shows that even when things don’t go as planned, support is often there when we need it. How did you feel after realizing that?

User: I felt relieved. It was good to know that I still had help.

Consultant: Relief is such a positive feeling! Let’s focus on that. Next time, if you're feeling nervous about forgetting your lines, remember that it’s okay to ask for help. What could help you feel more prepared before the next performance?

User: Maybe practicing with my friends or even in front of my grandparents.

Consultant: Practicing with your friends and grandparents sounds like a fantastic idea! It could help boost your confidence. How do you think that practice would make you feel about performing again?

User: I think it would make me feel more confident, but I still worry about messing up.

Consultant: It's okay to have those worries; you're certainly not alone in feeling that way. What if we worked together on some positive reminders for you? What would you tell yourself to help feel more confident right before you perform?

User: I could say that I did well last time and that it’s alright to make mistakes.

Consultant: Exactly! Reminding yourself of past successes and that it’s okay to not be perfect can really help. How about we set a small goal for you this week? Maybe to practice once with someone and think about that positive reinforcement?

User: That sounds good! I’ll try to do it with a friend.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! I believe that practicing will help you feel a lot more at ease. Let’s also make sure you're keeping track of these positive moments. How about writing down how you feel after practicing or any thoughts you had about the performance?

User: I can do that! I think it will help me remember the good feelings.

Consultant: Wonderful! Keeping a record can help reinforce those positive experiences. By reflecting on your successes, we can work on shifting the focus away from fear of failure. Do you feel ready to start focusing on these steps?

User: Yes! I’m excited to see how it goes!

Consultant: I'm really proud of your willingness to try new things! As we continue our sessions, we can explore what inspires you and helps you stay engaged. Would you like to share other activities that interest you?

User: I like drawing and playing soccer! But sometimes I lose interest in them.

Consultant: That’s interesting! Drawing and soccer can be really fun activities. It’s common to lose interest, so let's think about how you can keep those activities engaging. What do you think you could do to maintain your interest in them?

User: Maybe I can draw different things or try to learn new soccer tricks.

Consultant: Great ideas! Variety can definitely keep things exciting. Trying out new techniques in your drawings or practicing different soccer moves could reignite your passion. How do you feel about exploring these activities in a new way?

User: I feel curious! I think I’d like to try that.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Curiosity is a wonderful feeling to embrace. Let's continue nurturing that as we progress. Remember, it’s all about exploring and having fun in what you do. Keep tracking your feelings about these activities, and we’ll review them together next time.

User: Thanks! I’m really looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: Me too! I'm eager to hear all about your progress with practice and your interests. Keep up your positive mindset, and I’ll see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really happy to see you today. How have you been feeling lately with your new activities?

User: Hi. I've been trying some new classes, but I find I get bored really quickly. There's something I like at first, but then I just want to stop. I wish I could find something I really enjoy.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a bit frustrated with how quickly your interests change. It's completely normal to explore different things. Can you tell me about one of the activities you've tried? 

User: I joined a painting class because I thought it would be fun. At first, I was really excited about it, but after a few sessions, I just didn't want to go anymore.

Consultant: I see. You started out enthusiastic about painting but lost interest after a while. What do you think caused that shift for you?

User: I think it was hard for me to see my progress. I wanted to be good at it right away, but I just felt like I wasn't improving at all.

Consultant: It sounds like the pressure to improve quickly might have affected your enjoyment of painting. Many people feel that way when starting something new. What would it feel like to accept that progress takes time?

User: I guess it would be less stressful. But I often feel like I just want to be good at something right away, or else I lose interest.

Consultant: That makes sense, and many people can relate to wanting instant success. What if we framed the experience of learning as a journey rather than a race? How might that change your approach to trying new activities?

User: Maybe I would enjoy the classes more if I didn’t worry about being perfect right away. I could just focus on having fun.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on fun and creativity can help reignite your interest. Could you think of an activity or hobby where you feel comfortable exploring without the pressure of perfection?

User: I used to like building things with LEGO. I think I could enjoy that again because there’s no right or wrong way to do it.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Building with LEGO could be a fun way to express creativity without the stress of comparison or expectations. Would you like to set some goals around that for our next session?

User: Yes, I’d like to try that! Maybe I could set aside some time each week to just build whatever I want.

Consultant: That sounds fantastic! Setting aside dedicated time to explore building with LEGO could really help you reconnect with that joy of creating. How do you feel about starting this new goal?

User: I feel excited about it! I think it’ll be nice to have that time just for myself.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s important to create time for yourself. Let's also think about how you can sustain this interest over time. What are a few ideas you have for keeping yourself motivated?

User: Maybe I could set little challenges for myself, like building something different each time. That could keep things interesting.

Consultant: That's a wonderful strategy! Little challenges can definitely keep your creativity flowing. Can we think of one specific challenge to start with for your next session?

User: I could try to build a small car! That sounds fun.

Consultant: Building a car sounds like a fantastic challenge! When we meet next time, we can discuss how that experience went. I'm really looking forward to hearing about it.

User: Thanks! I feel a lot better about trying new things now.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! It’s a pleasure to see your enthusiasm returning. Before we finish today, what will you take away from our conversation that can support your progress?

User: I think I’ll remember to focus on having fun and being okay with not being perfect at first.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway! Keep reminding yourself that the process can be just as enjoyable as the outcome. We’ll keep building on that in our next session. 

User: Definitely! I’m really looking forward to it.

Consultant: Great! Just remember, it's all about exploration and having fun. I believe you'll do wonderfully. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello there! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel more confident about my performance at school. My teachers have noticed some improvements in my behavior, and I'm starting to look forward to my classes.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! It sounds like you're making some great strides in your school life. Can you tell me more about what specific changes you've noticed in your behavior or how you feel in class?

User: Well, I used to get really distracted and didn’t pay attention, but now I find it easier to focus. I also feel less anxious when speaking in front of the class. 

Consultant: Wow, those are significant improvements! Reducing distractions and feeling more comfortable speaking up can really enhance your learning experience. What do you think made it easier for you to focus and engage more during classes?

User: I think I’ve been trying to stay more organized with my notes and assignments. Also, I feel like my teacher is more supportive, which helps a lot.

Consultant: It sounds like organization and support from your teacher have played a key role in your progress. Can you share how you’re keeping your notes organized? Any specific strategies that have been helpful?

User: I use a planner to write down my homework and tests. I try to check it every evening so I know what to do the next day. It really helps me stay on track.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Using a planner not only keeps you organized, but it also helps reduce anxiety about forgetting important tasks. How do you feel when you see everything planned out in your planner?

User: I feel relieved and more in control. It’s like I know what to expect, so I don’t have to worry as much.

Consultant: That sense of control can be so powerful! It’s excellent that you’re finding relief by being organized. Have you noticed any changes in how you interact with your grandparents or your friends since you've felt more confident at school?

User: Yes! I’ve been talking more with my grandparents about my day and what I learn in school. I think it makes them happy to hear about it, and I feel closer to them.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Engaging in conversations with your grandparents can really strengthen your relationship. It also allows you to share your successes and experiences, which is important. What do you think about those conversations? How do they make you feel?

User: They make me feel good because they listen and seem proud of me. It feels nice to share my experiences with them.

Consultant: That’s beautiful! It’s great to have that support and to feel valued for your achievements. As you continue with your studies and build on these positive relationships, what do you hope to accomplish next in school or at home?

User: I want to keep improving and maybe try out for a school club or a sports team. I think it would be fun to meet new friends.

Consultant: Joining a club or sports team sounds like an excellent idea! It can provide opportunities to meet new people and develop new skills. What kind of club or sport interests you the most?

User: I’m thinking about joining the soccer team. I love playing soccer during recess, and it would be cool to play more seriously.

Consultant: Soccer sounds like a fantastic choice! It not only allows you to enjoy the sport but also helps you connect with others who share the same interest. How do you feel about stepping into that new environment with the team?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited. I want to make new friends and learn more about playing soccer.

Consultant: Those feelings of excitement and nervousness are completely normal when trying something new! Remember, it’s all about having fun and learning. How about we brainstorm some ways you can prepare for joining the team and easing those nerves?

User: That would be helpful! I guess I could practice some skills at home and maybe talk to some kids on the team before tryouts.

Consultant: Great ideas! Practicing at home can boost your confidence, and talking to kids on the team will help you feel more comfortable. What skills do you think you’d like to focus on while practicing?

User: I want to work on my passing and dribbling since I think those are important for the game.

Consultant: Focusing on passing and dribbling is a smart move! Those skills are essential for teamwork and maintaining control of the ball. Perhaps you could set some small daily goals for your practice sessions. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I can start with a few minutes each day and gradually increase as I feel more comfortable.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! You’re setting yourself up for success with manageable goals. As we wrap up today’s session, do you feel that we've addressed your current achievements and any concerns moving forward?

User: Yes, I feel good about what we talked about today. I appreciate your help and feel more prepared for the next steps.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Remember, maintaining that positive mindset and staying organized will continue to support you. If you ever need to talk again or seek guidance, I’m here for you. Keep up the excellent work, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time!

User: Thank you! I will keep practicing and see you next time!
