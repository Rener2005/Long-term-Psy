Consultant: Hi Zhang Lan! I'm glad to see you again today. Last time we spoke about feeling anxious in social situations and how that impacts your self-esteem. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty much the same. I still struggle with my social anxiety and feel like a complete failure. It's hard to connect with my classmates, and I often sit alone during breaks.

Consultant: I hear you. That sense of isolation can be really tough. You mentioned feeling like a "complete failure." Can you tell me more about what led you to feel that way?

User: Whenever I try to approach someone or join a conversation, I get really anxious, and my mind just goes blank. I think they must be judging me, which makes me feel even worse. 

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of pressure when it comes to social interactions. What thoughts do you have right before these interactions that contribute to your anxiety?

User: I think things like, "They won't want to talk to me," or "I'll embarrass myself." These thoughts just scream in my head.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite intense and negative. Let’s explore that. How much evidence do you think supports the idea that they wouldn’t want to talk to you or that you would embarrass yourself?

User: I guess I don’t have concrete evidence. I just assume it because of my past experiences. I often feel ignored or out of place.

Consultant: It's understandable to rely on past experiences to inform your current thoughts. But sometimes, our past doesn't dictate our present or future. If a friend were in your shoes, what might you tell them about those thoughts?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to feel nervous but that they shouldn’t assume the worst. People might be more understanding than we think.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate way to look at it! What if you tried to apply that same kindness to yourself when you face these social situations? 

User: That sounds nice, but it's hard to feel that way about myself. I just don’t believe it. 

Consultant: I understand. It takes practice. Let’s consider small actions you can take to challenge those thoughts. Could you think of an easy social situation—maybe a casual greeting with a classmate you know?

User: I could try to say hi to someone in my group. It doesn’t seem that hard, I guess.

Consultant: That’s a great start! It’s a small step, but small actions can lead to greater confidence over time. How would you feel about trying that this week?

User: I feel a bit anxious just thinking about it, but I also want to try. I at least want to see if it really isn’t as bad as I think.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Remember, it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about it. After you try it, we can discuss how it felt. What’s another way we might build on that experience?

User: Maybe I could try talking to someone more than just greetings, like asking about class assignments or something similar?

Consultant: Yes, that’s a progressive step! Engaging with more depth can help build a connection. What do you think might help ease your anxiety in that moment?

User: I guess reminding myself to take a deep breath and to focus on the other person instead of my worries.

Consultant: That sounds like a helpful practice. When you're focused on the conversation, it can help take the pressure off you. What’s one thought you could counter your anxious thoughts with during that moment?

User: Maybe I could think, "This is just a conversation, and it’s okay to be nervous."

Consultant: That’s a wonderful affirmation! It’s about progress, not perfection. How do you feel about discussing your progress when we meet next time?

User: I think that would be helpful. I’d like to share how it went, even if it feels a bit scary.

Consultant: Absolutely, it will be a safe space. Remember, every little effort counts. Before we wrap up today, what’s one takeaway you want to remember from our session?

User: I think it's that my thoughts don't have to dictate my experiences, and I can try to be kinder to myself.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway, Zhang Lan. Kindness toward oneself can open new doors. We’ll explore this more next time. Don’t hesitate to jot down your feelings or experiences; it will be a great discussion point. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Lan! I'm glad you came in today. I’d like to start by understanding how you've been feeling since our last session. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite anxious because I've tried joining some social events recently, but I just ended up feeling really nervous and escaping from them. I don't know why I can't just enjoy being around others.

Consultant: That sounds challenging, Zhang Lan. It seems like you have the desire to connect with others, but the anxiety is overwhelming. Can you tell me more about the specific thoughts that ran through your mind during these social events?

User: When I'm at these events, I keep worrying that everyone is judging me. I think things like, "What if I say something stupid?" or "They probably don't want me there." It feels suffocating.

Consultant: It seems like those thoughts are creating a lot of pressure for you. When you focus on the idea that others are judging you, how does that make you feel emotionally?

User: It makes me feel really uncomfortable and trapped. I just want to disappear or leave the situation. It's like my heart races and I can't think straight.

Consultant: I can understand how that would be very distressing. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit more. When you think "What if I say something stupid?" how often do you find that to be true in your experiences?

User: I guess it’s not really true... I usually have more positive interactions than I think. But in the moment, all I see are the negatives. 

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Zhang Lan. It sounds like there’s a disconnect between your thoughts and reality. What might be a more balanced way to think about social interactions?

User: Maybe something like, “Even if I say something awkward, it's okay. People probably won’t think about it for long.” 

Consultant: That's a much healthier perspective! It allows room for imperfection, which is part of being human. How do you feel about trying to remind yourself of this thought when you're in a social setting?

User: I think that could help, but I’m still scared. What if I can’t remember it when I’m anxious?

Consultant: It’s completely normal to be worried about maintaining that perspective when anxiety strikes. We can develop strategies to help you integrate this thought into your experience. Would you be open to doing some practices outside of our sessions to help reinforce these ideas?

User: Yes, I’d like to try, but I’m not sure how to start.

Consultant: A great way to begin is by preparing for a specific social situation. Next time you plan to attend an event, could you write down this balanced thought and keep it with you? When you start to feel anxious, take a moment to read it.

User: That sounds doable. I can write it on a small card. 

Consultant: Excellent! Another step could be to practice exposing yourself to smaller, less intimidating social situations first. What’s a low-pressure event you could participate in soon?

User: Maybe just hanging out with a couple of friends at a café. It's less overwhelming than a big party.

Consultant: That’s a perfect start! Focus on enjoying the moment without overthinking your actions. How do you think you might feel afterward?

User: I hope I’ll feel proud of myself for going through with it, even if I mess up a bit.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! Remember, every small step counts. Allowing yourself to make mistakes is part of learning and growing. After your café visit, let's review how it went together. 

User: Alright, I’ll try to keep that in mind. I hope I can actually enjoy it.

Consultant: With practice, I believe you can start enjoying those moments. What else do you think would help you as you approach this meeting with friends?

User: Maybe thinking about topics to discuss in advance? I often blank out and feel awkward about silence.

Consultant: Great idea! Preparing a few conversation starters can help ease your anxiety. Would you like to brainstorm some topics together?

User: Sure, I could think of some things related to classes or shows we all watch.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Having those ready might help you feel more confident. Is there anything else you’d like to explore or ask about today?

User: Just that I feel a bit overwhelmed thinking about all this. What if I can’t do it?

Consultant: It’s natural to feel that way, especially when facing new challenges. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. What if we establish a follow-up session to discuss your experiences and feelings afterward?

User: That would be great! I'd appreciate the chance to talk about it if things go well or if they don’t.

Consultant: I’ll look forward to hearing about your experiences, no matter the outcome. You’re doing a tremendous job by taking these steps, Zhang Lan. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel a bit lighter, actually. It's nice to talk about my worries and find ways to cope.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! I’m proud of you for opening up. Remember, you have the tools now, and I believe you can face those situations with more confidence. 

User: Thanks! I’ll try my best. 

Consultant: You’re welcome, Zhang Lan! Keep focusing on the positive changes you’re making. I’m here to support you whenever you need it.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Lan! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been thinking a lot about that presentation I messed up. I still feel really embarrassed and think I'll never be able to perform in front of others.

Consultant: I can hear that this experience is weighing heavily on you. It’s completely understandable to feel embarrassed, especially when something doesn’t go as planned. Can you share more about what thoughts have been going through your mind since that presentation?

User: I keep thinking that I must have looked foolish, and that everyone must be judging me. It makes me anxious just thinking about speaking in class again.

Consultant: It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of pressure from your own thoughts. You mentioned feeling judged by others—how does that influence your emotions and actions?

User: It makes me feel really low and I just want to avoid speaking up altogether. I feel like I'm just not capable of doing it.

Consultant: It’s tough to feel that way, but I want to help you challenge those thoughts. Let's explore: are there any specific situations where you felt you performed well in the past, even if they were small moments?

User: I think I did okay when I participated in a group discussion last month, but it was a lot less pressure than a presentation.

Consultant: That’s a great start! It shows you do have the ability to engage in those situations. What about that group discussion made you feel more comfortable?

User: I guess it was because I was with friends, and we were just sharing ideas rather than being evaluated.

Consultant: Building on that comfort is key. Let’s try to replicate that feeling. What if we plan a couple of small speaking opportunities with friends or in lower-stakes situations? How does that sound to you?

User: That makes sense. It could help me practice without the fear of judgment.

Consultant: Exactly! It can be helpful to ease into it. Perhaps you can start by sharing something simple during a casual conversation. How do you feel about that idea?

User: I think I could try that. It would probably feel less intimidating.

Consultant: That’s a positive approach! Let's also consider how you can manage your anxiety as these situations arise. What kinds of feelings do you experience before the thought of speaking?

User: I start feeling really jittery and my heart races. Sometimes, I even feel a bit sick.

Consultant: Those are very common physical responses to anxiety. We can learn relaxation techniques to help manage those feelings. Would you like to try a quick breathing exercise here together?

User: I’d be willing to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment to breathe deeply together. Inhale slowly through your nose for four counts… hold for four… and exhale through your mouth for six. Let’s do that a few times.

User: *follows the breathing exercise*

Consultant: How did that feel for you?

User: I feel a bit calmer now. It helps to focus on my breathing.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Incorporating this kind of technique before speaking can be very beneficial. Can you practice this in the upcoming days before you talk to anyone?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. I’ll need to remind myself though.

Consultant: It's perfectly fine to need reminders! You can write it down or set a reminder on your phone. What about the next step? Are there any upcoming opportunities where you could practice speaking again?

User: Well, I do have a group project coming up. I could try to contribute more during our meetings.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant opportunity! Setting a goal to share at least one idea during your meetings could be a great way to practice. What’s an idea you might feel confident sharing?

User: Maybe I could suggest a topic for our project. I feel more knowledgeable about that.

Consultant: That sounds excellent! By suggesting a topic, you're not only contributing to the project but also participating in the discussion. What thoughts come up for you about doing this?

User: I'm a bit nervous, but I think I can manage it with my breathing technique.

Consultant: You’re approaching this with a constructive mindset! That combination of breathing exercises and contributing to your group can really help boost your confidence. As we wrap up today, what will be your main focus until we meet again?

User: I will practice the breathing technique and aim to suggest my topic in the group meeting. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan. I’m proud of you for taking these steps. When we meet next, we can discuss how it went, and we’ll continue to build on your progress. Remember, each step counts. 

User: Thank you! I'm looking forward to our next session. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhang Lan! Keep practicing, and know I’m here for you. See you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Lan! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I attended a few club meetings, and there were moments when I felt accepted. But I’m still struggling with my self-esteem and my tendency to be introverted.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're experiencing some positive moments in those club meetings! Recognizing those feelings of acceptance is an important step. Can you share what specifically made you feel accepted in those situations?

User: There was this one time when I shared an idea during a discussion, and some people actually responded positively. It made me feel like I could contribute, even though I still felt nervous.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant breakthrough! Contributing to a discussion can really enhance your sense of belonging. How did you feel after sharing your idea and receiving positive feedback?

User: I felt a little proud of myself for speaking up, but I still questioned whether I really belong in that group. Sometimes I wonder if they think I'm just quiet and irrelevant.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those doubts, especially when you're stepping out of your comfort zone. Let's explore this thought a bit more. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that they might think you're irrelevant?

User: I guess I don't really have any direct evidence, just my own insecurities. I often second-guess myself and think they might not value what I say.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. It might help to consider how you would support a friend who feels the same about their contributions. What would you tell them?

User: I would probably remind them that everyone has something valuable to say, and that their opinions matter. I wish I could believe that for myself, too.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate way to think! It seems like you recognize the value in others’ contributions. How might you apply that same perspective to your own thoughts and experiences?

User: I suppose I could try to remind myself that my thoughts and ideas are worth sharing as well. Maybe I can gradually practice being more vocal in those settings.

Consultant: That’s a great idea, Zhang Lan! Practicing can help build your confidence over time. We can set small goals for you to gradually express yourself more in these social settings. How do you feel about that?

User: That sounds doable. I think starting with small contributions might ease my anxiety. I’ll try to focus on that.

Consultant: Excellent approach! Let's also keep track of your feelings and experiences after each meeting. This can help you observe any changes in your perception of yourself over time. How do you feel about keeping a journal of your social interactions?

User: I think that could be helpful. It would be nice to look back and see how I felt in those moments and if it changes over time.

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping a journal will allow you to reflect on your experiences. After each social activity, note what you shared, how you felt, and any feedback you received. This can reinforce the positives. Do you think you can commit to that?

User: Yes, I can definitely try to do that. I think it will help me process my feelings and see the progress I make.

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember, it’s all about acknowledging your growth, no matter how small. Are there any specific social events coming up that you’re looking forward to participating in?

User: There's a group project starting soon, and I’m a bit nervous about it. But I also feel like it could be an opportunity to speak up more.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic opportunity! Group projects can really help you practice collaboration. What are your thoughts on how you can contribute to this project while also pushing past your comfort zone?

User: I could prepare my ideas beforehand and make it a point to share at least one suggestion during our first meeting. That feels manageable.

Consultant: Preparing in advance sounds like a great strategy! It can help ease some anxiety about speaking up. Would you like to set a specific goal for how you’ll share your ideas during that meeting?

User: Yes! I think I could aim to share at least one idea and ask for others’ opinions on it. That way, I’d also be inviting them to engage with me.

Consultant: That's a brilliant plan! Inviting input can make the interaction feel more collaborative, reducing the pressure on you. How confident do you feel about this goal?

User: I feel a bit anxious, but also excited. I think I can do it if I remind myself to focus on the conversation with my teammates rather than just my own fear.

Consultant: I love how you're reframing your focus! Concentrating on the interaction rather than solely on your anxiety can be liberating. Let’s discuss how you might deal with any anxious feelings that arise during the meeting.

User: I guess I could remind myself of my previous experiences where things went well and that my anxiety doesn’t have to dictate my actions.

Consultant: That’s a powerful reminder! Reflecting on positive past experiences can indeed help calm your nerves. What else could you do in the moment if you start feeling anxious while speaking?

User: I could take a deep breath or pause for a second to collect my thoughts. That might help me feel more grounded.

Consultant: Those are excellent techniques! Deep breathing and pausing can give you the space to regain composure. What emotions do you hope to feel during this group project?

User: I hope to feel more connected to my classmates and perhaps a sense of accomplishment for contributing to the project.

Consultant: Those are wonderful emotions to aim for! It sounds like you’re making great strides in shifting your perspective about social interactions. What will be your next steps after the project?

User: I’ll keep reflecting on my journal, and I plan to continue participating in club activities. It feels important to maintain that momentum.

Consultant: Absolutely! Continuing that engagement is key to reinforcing your growth. As we approach the end of our session today, how do you feel about the progress you've made and the goals you've set?

User: I feel optimistic. I’m starting to see that I can take small steps to improve my confidence. It’s nice to acknowledge that.

Consultant: You should feel proud! Noticing those small victories is what will help build your confidence further. Remember, each step you take is meaningful. Before we conclude, is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?

User: No, I think we covered a lot. I feel ready to give these ideas a try!

Consultant: That’s great to hear! I believe in your ability to make positive changes. Keep focusing on your growth, and when we meet again, we can review your experiences. Take care until then!

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello Zhang Lan! I’m glad you’ve come for this session. It seems you've been reflecting on your abilities lately. How are you feeling about your recent experiences with taking on more responsibilities?

User: Hi! I feel a bit proud of myself for taking on leadership roles in organizing that campus event. But at the same time, I keep doubting my social skills. I wonder if I'm really good enough.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you’re feeling proud! Taking on such responsibilities is a big step, and it's normal to have mixed feelings about it. Can you tell me more about the specific situations where you felt both pride and doubt?

User: Well, during the meetings, I felt confident when I was sharing my ideas. But then I would later think that maybe my suggestions weren’t good enough or that I was just talking too much.

Consultant: It sounds like you have moments of confidence followed by self-doubt. Let's explore those thoughts—what evidence do you have that your suggestions weren't good enough?

User: I guess I don't really have any concrete evidence, but sometimes I saw others not reacting positively or just staying quiet.

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry about how others perceive your contributions. However, quietness doesn't always mean they disagree or feel negatively. What do you think a more balanced perspective might look like regarding your suggestions?

User: Maybe I could think that some people just need time to process ideas, or that not everyone shows their enthusiasm outwardly.

Consultant: That's an excellent insight! Recognizing that reactions vary among people can help you feel more secure in sharing your thoughts. Let's set a small goal for your next meeting. What would you feel comfortable aiming for?

User: I think I could aim to speak up at least twice during the next meeting, maybe share one idea and ask for feedback afterward.

Consultant: That sounds like a great goal! Speaking up twice gives you structure and a chance to gain feedback on your ideas. How do you think accomplishing this will make you feel?

User: I hope it will make me feel more confident. If I can do that, it might help me believe in myself more.

Consultant: Absolutely! Achieving this goal can definitely boost your belief in your abilities. How can we prepare for the next meeting to help you feel more confident when speaking?

User: Maybe I could jot down some points I want to bring up beforehand to stay focused?

Consultant: That's a fantastic strategy! Preparing points can help you feel more organized and reduce anxiety. Would it help if we reviewed these points together before the meeting?

User: Yes, that would be great! It would make me feel more prepared and less anxious.

Consultant: Perfect! We can dedicate some time to that in our next session. Reflecting on today, how do you feel about your journey with social responsibilities so far?

User: I feel a little more encouraged. It's nice to recognize that I can set small, achievable goals instead of feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Setting small goals can make a big difference. As we move forward, what other areas would you like to focus on in terms of building your confidence?

User: I think I want to work on handling situations where I feel rejected or ignored by my peers. I tend to take it really personally.

Consultant: That's a very valid concern. It can be tough when we feel dismissed. Let's aim to explore how those situations make you feel and how we can challenge those feelings together.

User: That sounds helpful. I often think that if someone doesn’t respond quickly, they must not care.

Consultant: That’s a common thought! Let’s focus on reframing that. When someone doesn’t respond right away, what else could you tell yourself instead of assuming they don’t care?

User: Maybe I could think that they are busy or distracted. I guess their silence doesn’t always mean rejection.

Consultant: Exactly! A different perspective can really change how we respond emotionally. How do you think adopting this new viewpoint will affect your interactions?

User: I think it might help me feel less anxious in social situations. I won't take things so personally.

Consultant: That's a healthy outlook! Reducing that emotional weight can lead to more genuine interactions. As we review everything so far, what do you see as your biggest takeaways?

User: I’ve realized that communication and setting small goals can really help. Also, it’s important to challenge my initial negative thoughts.

Consultant: Those are excellent reflections! You've made significant progress. For our next session, let’s continue working on those small goals, and we can also discuss techniques for handling feelings of rejection. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I feel excited to work on it.

Consultant: I'm looking forward to it, too! Remember, you are making great strides toward confidence in social contexts. Keep celebrating those small victories.

User: I will! Thank you for your help today!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Zhang Lan! I'm here to support you. I believe in your ability to continue growing. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Lan! I'm really glad to see you here today. Last time, we discussed your recent success in the student project and how it has positively impacted your confidence and social interactions. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hello! I've been feeling really good, actually. I feel more confident in participating in team activities now. It’s a nice change from how I used to be.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like your experience has really boosted your confidence. I'm curious, what do you think has contributed the most to this positive change for you?

User: I guess getting positive feedback from my classmates made a big difference. It was encouraging to see that they appreciated my contributions.

Consultant: Positive feedback can be incredibly affirming. It’s great to see that you’re more willing to engage with your peers. How do you think we can build on this progress to ensure you continue feeling confident and connected in social situations?

User: I’d like to keep this momentum going. Maybe I could set some goals for myself related to social activities or participating more in class discussions.

Consultant: Setting specific goals sounds like a solid plan. What kinds of social activities or class discussions are you thinking about? Are there any particular areas where you'd like to challenge yourself?

User: I want to speak up more in group settings. Sometimes, I still hesitate to share my ideas. Also, maybe join a club to meet new people.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Challenging yourself in group settings can help strengthen your communication skills. How do you feel when you think about sharing your ideas with others? 

User: It makes me a little nervous, to be honest. I worry that they might not like what I say or that I might embarrass myself.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous in those situations. Let's explore those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that others won't appreciate your input?

User: Well, sometimes I remember situations where I felt ignored or where people didn't seem to respond positively. 

Consultant: I understand. It’s natural to hold on to negative experiences, but it’s important to recognize that they don’t define your worth or future opportunities. Could there be times where you shared your thoughts, and they were well-received?

User: Yes, actually. In the recent project, I felt my ideas were welcomed. Maybe I should focus on that instead of the past.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on your recent successes can help reshape your perspective. What steps can you take to remind yourself of your ability to contribute positively in conversations moving forward?

User: I could keep a journal of my experiences and the positive feedback I receive. That way, I can look back on it when I feel nervous.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Journaling can be a powerful tool for reinforcing positive reflections. Besides keeping a journal, are there any specific coping strategies you'd like to practice when you start to feel that anxiety emerge?

User: Maybe deep breathing exercises could help if I feel nervous before speaking.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a great technique! It can help calm your nerves and center your thoughts. Would you like us to practice a simple deep breathing exercise together now?

User: Yes, I’d like to try that!

Consultant: Great! Let's take a moment together. Close your eyes if you feel comfortable. Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose for a count of four... and now exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Let’s repeat that a few times. How does that feel for you?

User: It feels calming. I think I could definitely use this before class or when speaking up.

Consultant: I'm glad it's working for you! Remember, integrating these techniques into your routine can make them more effective. As we prepare to wrap up today, how do you feel about the progress you’ve made in our sessions so far?

User: I feel really good about it. I'm more aware of my thoughts and I have strategies to handle my anxiety. I appreciate the support!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Zhang Lan! You've accomplished so much. Before we end, let’s summarize your goals: You plan to speak up more in group settings, join a club, and use journaling and deep breathing to manage anxiety. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds great! I feel ready to take on these challenges.

Consultant: Fantastic! Remember to take it one step at a time and be gentle with yourself. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don't hesitate to reach out. This concludes our session today, but I believe you have the tools to continue managing your emotions. You can always come back for more support if needed!

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate everything you've done.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhang Lan! I'm proud of your progress. Take care, and I wish you the best in your journey ahead!
