Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you could make it today. Before we dive in, I'd like to understand how you've been feeling recently. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi! Thanks for having me. I've been really anxious lately about school. I just started high school, and I'm struggling with living in the dorms and balancing my studies. My first English exam didn’t go well, and I'm feeling really down about it.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot right now, especially with the transition to high school and the pressure of your first exam results. Can you tell me a bit more about how these feelings of anxiety have been affecting you day to day?

User: Sure. I’ve been feeling really tense all the time. I’m having trouble sleeping and I don’t feel like eating much. I keep replaying that exam in my head and feel really disappointed in myself.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable to feel that way, especially with high expectations from yourself and others. I’m here to help you work through these feelings. Can we explore what specifically about the exam is causing you the most distress?

User: I think I really expected to do well because I’ve always been good at English. When I got my grade, I just felt like I let everyone down, especially my parents.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel disappointed when we hold ourselves to high standards, especially if we’ve performed well in the past. What do you think your thoughts were right after you saw your grades? 

User: I just kept thinking, “I’m not good enough” and “I’ll never be able to keep up with my classmates.” It felt like I failed.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very powerful, and it’s understandable to feel overwhelmed by them. Let’s take a moment to challenge those thoughts. How much evidence do you have that you’re not good enough, or that you won’t be able to keep up with your classmates?

User: Well, I guess I don't have concrete evidence. I used to do well, but this one time makes me feel like everything has changed.

Consultant: Exactly. One exam doesn’t define your abilities or your future potential. If a friend shared similar feelings after a setback, what would you tell them? 

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to have a bad exam and they shouldn’t be too hard on themselves.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! It’s often easier to offer kindness to others than to ourselves. How might you apply that kind of kindness to your own situation?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s just one exam and that I can improve next time.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization. Recognizing that setbacks are part of learning can really help reduce pressure. Let’s also think about what actions you can take to support yourself moving forward. What small steps could you take to help you study more effectively or manage your anxiety?

User: Maybe I could create a more structured study schedule and take breaks to relax instead of just cramming at the last minute. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Structure can often help ease anxiety. What activities can you include in your breaks that help you feel more relaxed?

User: I enjoy drawing, so maybe I could draw during my breaks. 

Consultant: Drawing sounds like a great way to express yourself and relax! It’s important to take care of your mental health while studying. How do you feel about incorporating that into your routine?

User: I think it could help. I haven’t done much drawing lately because I've been too stressed about school.

Consultant: It’s understandable, but making time for activities you enjoy can be incredibly beneficial. As we work together, let’s remind you to include those moments of self-care. How are you feeling about using some of these strategies we discussed?

User: I feel hopeful that I can change how I approach studying, even if it’s not a quick fix.

Consultant: That’s a great outlook! Change takes time, and being kind to yourself along the way is essential. Before we wrap up, let’s recap what you've learned today. What do you think your biggest takeaway is from this session?

User: I think the biggest thing is to not be too hard on myself and to remember that it’s okay to have setbacks. I need to focus on improving progressively.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway! It sounds like you’ve gained some helpful insights today. As we prepare for our next session, think about the strategies you want to apply and any challenges you might face. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection.

User: Thank you! I feel a bit lighter just talking about it today. I’ll try to keep a more positive mindset moving forward.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’re making valuable strides. Don’t hesitate to seek support whenever you need it. Until next time, take care of yourself, and I look forward to hearing about your progress. 

User: Thank you! I will, and I’m looking forward to our next session too.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling lately, especially with school?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better about my anxiety, but I still feel really overwhelmed when it comes to my studies. There's this constant pressure to keep my grades up, and I find myself worrying a lot about it.

Consultant: It sounds like you're managing your anxiety a bit better, which is a positive step! However, the pressure from your studies and the expectations from your family seems to still weigh heavily on you. Can you share more about what specifically makes you feel overwhelmed in your studies?

User: Well, I have so many subjects to study for, and I always feel like I have to excel in every single one of them. Whenever I study, I just can't seem to focus for long, and the thought of not meeting my parents' expectations really stresses me out.

Consultant: I see. It’s tough feeling like you must excel across all subjects, and that pressure from your parents is affecting your focus. Let’s explore this a bit—what thoughts run through your mind when you think about your parents' expectations?

User: I keep thinking that if I don't get good grades, they'll be disappointed in me. It feels like my worth is tied to my performance. 

Consultant: That’s a lot of pressure to carry. It’s understandable to want to make your parents proud, but it seems this belief weighs on you heavily. How does this affect your emotions when you're studying?

User: I feel anxious and sometimes even a bit hopeless. It's like I freeze up and can't get started or I start thinking about how I'll never be good enough.

Consultant: It makes sense to feel anxious when you believe that your self-worth depends on your grades. Let’s examine that belief—what evidence do you have that not getting good grades would mean you’re not good enough?

User: I guess I don’t have any solid evidence. I know they love me, but I often think if I let them down academically, they might love me less.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re recognizing some cognitive distortions in your thinking. Your parents’ love is not solely dependent on your academic achievements. Let’s think of a time when you felt proud of yourself for something other than your grades. Can you recall one?

User: Yes! I remember receiving compliments for a painting I did. That made me really happy and proud.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! You achieved something based on your passion and creativity. How can we apply that sense of pride to your studies? 

User: Maybe I could try to focus on learning and enjoying the process rather than stressing about grades all the time.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on the process of learning could relieve some of that pressure. What small steps can you set to shift your focus from grades to finding joy in studying?

User: I could start by setting aside time each day just to explore subjects I'm interested in, rather than only doing what’s required for exams.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! By engaging more with subjects you enjoy, you're more likely to retain information and feel less pressure. How do you feel about implementing that strategy?

User: I feel hopeful about it. It sounds like a good way to ease my anxiety while still being productive.

Consultant: That’s important! Also, how about setting realistic expectations for yourself regarding your scores? What would that look like in your view?

User: I think I could aim for improvement rather than perfection. Understanding that it’s okay to make mistakes along the way could help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Seeing mistakes as learning opportunities is a great shift in mindset. Let’s explore some potential study techniques that might support this new approach. What have you tried in the past?

User: I’ve mostly relied on cramming the night before exams. It usually doesn’t work out very well.

Consultant: Cramming often adds to the stress, for sure. How about we look at creating a more structured, consistent study schedule? This can help you feel more prepared without the last-minute anxiety.

User: That sounds like a good plan. I think having a schedule would help me feel more in control.

Consultant: Great! Let’s work on outlining a simple weekly schedule together. We can include time for your interests, studying, and breaks. How does that sound?

User: I like that idea. Balance is key, right? 

Consultant: Exactly! Balancing your studies and passions is vital for your well-being. As we wrap up today, what key takeaway do you have from our session that you’d like to focus on going forward?

User: I’d like to focus on shifting my mindset from perfectionism to progress and enjoying my studies more.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway. I believe that with this approach, you’ll begin to feel more empowered. Remember, it’s about celebrating your growth and the effort you put in, not just the final results. Until next time, take care!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today. I’ll work on these strategies.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you could join me for today's session. I know you’ve been experiencing some pressure regarding your studies. Could you start by sharing how you’re feeling about that?

User: Hi! Thank you. I’ve been feeling really anxious because my recent exam results were disappointing. I’ve been trying so hard, but I just can’t keep up with my studies. It makes me worry about my future.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It's understandable to feel anxious when you're facing such high expectations and pressures. Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you about your future in relation to your studies?

User: I worry that if I don’t do well in school, I won’t get into a good university. My parents have really high expectations, and I feel like I’m letting them down. 

Consultant: I can see how that pressure from your parents can add to your anxiety. It sounds like their expectations weigh heavily on you. Have you had any conversations with them about how you’re feeling?

User: No, not really. I don’t know how to explain that I’m struggling. I don’t want to disappoint them even more.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. Many people find it hard to share their struggles, especially when they fear disappointing others. What do you think might happen if you opened up to them about your challenges?

User: I guess they might understand, but I also fear they’ll be upset. It’s just hard to talk about it.

Consultant: That fear of their reaction is completely valid. It might help to think about how they might feel knowing that you’re trying your best and just looking for support. What do you think you would need from them to feel better about the situation?

User: I think I just need them to understand that I’m trying my best, and maybe to be a bit more patient with me. 

Consultant: That sounds reasonable. Having your parents’ support could indeed ease some of that pressure. Now, let's shift focus a bit. You mentioned feeling anxious about your studies. Can you tell me what specific thoughts come to mind when you think about your exams and your performance?

User: I often think that if I don’t get good grades, it means I’m not smart enough. It feels like I’m destined to fail.

Consultant: That’s a very heavy belief to carry. It seems like you're linking your self-worth to your grades, which can be really detrimental. Can we explore some evidence for and against that belief? What would you say to a friend who thought they weren’t smart enough because of a poor exam?

User: I would tell them that one bad exam doesn’t define their intelligence. But for myself, it’s different. I feel more pressure.

Consultant: It’s quite common to be more critical of ourselves. What if we tried to apply that same kindness and understanding to your own situation? What might you say to yourself about your performance in that case?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that it’s just one exam and I can improve next time. 

Consultant: Yes! That’s a much healthier perspective. Recognizing that one exam doesn’t define your abilities can help alleviate some of that anxiety. How do you think you could remind yourself of this when exam time approaches?

User: I could write it down or set reminders to tell myself that it’s okay to not be perfect. 

Consultant: That's a great idea! Having visual reminders can help you stay grounded. Now, let’s talk about your studying strategies. What do you currently do to prepare for your exams?

User: I usually just read my notes and try to memorize everything, but I feel overwhelmed with so much information.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when there’s a lot to memorize. Have you tried breaking down the material into smaller sections or using different study techniques, like summarizing or teaching the material to someone else? 

User: I haven’t tried teaching it to someone else. That sounds like it could help me understand better.

Consultant: Absolutely! Teaching is a powerful way to reinforce your understanding. Additionally, how would you feel about trying to incorporate some active learning techniques, like flashcards or practice quizzes, into your study sessions?

User: I think that could be helpful! I’ll give it a try.

Consultant: That sounds fantastic! Additionally, what kinds of breaks or self-care practices do you currently have in place when studying?

User: I don’t really take breaks; I usually just push through until I’m done. 

Consultant: It’s easy to feel like we need to keep going, but regular breaks can actually enhance focus and retention. Maybe you could experiment with taking short breaks every hour or so? What activities could you enjoy during those breaks?

User: I like drawing, so I could do that. 

Consultant: Drawing sounds like a wonderful way to relax and recharge your mind! It’s important to take those mental breaks. As we near the end of our session, let’s reflect on your journey. You’ve discussed several insights today regarding your thoughts and study habits. How do you feel about the strategies we’ve covered?

User: I feel a bit lighter, to be honest. I think I have some good ideas to try now.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that!It seems like you’re becoming more resilient by recognizing that your worth isn’t solely defined by your grades. As we wrap up today, what will you take away with you, and how will you continue to work on feeling more confident about your studies?

User: I’ll remember that I can improve, and I’ll be kinder to myself about my performance. I’ll also try out some new study methods and make time for drawing.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, every small step counts towards your progress. You've shown a lot of growth today, and I'm confident you'll continue to build that confidence. If you need support in the future, feel free to reach out anytime. 

User: Thank you so much for your help! I really appreciate it. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of you for taking these steps. Take care, and I wish you the best with your studies.

Consultant: Hello! Welcome back to our session today. How have you been feeling since our last meeting? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good. I really enjoyed working on that group project with my classmates. It gave me a sense of accomplishment and made school feel more manageable.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It seems like collaboration has positively impacted your experience at school. Can you tell me more about how that felt for you?

User: Sure! It was nice to work together and share ideas. I felt more confident speaking up in group discussions. It felt like I was finally being heard.

Consultant: That sounds very empowering. Feeling heard is important, especially in a school environment. How do you think this experience has affected your confidence in other areas of your life?

User: I think it has helped a lot. I've been feeling more comfortable cheering on my classmates during our comic club activities, and I'm not as worried about how others view me.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re really starting to embrace your presence in those settings. What specific changes have you noticed in your feelings or behavior since participating in those activities?

User: I used to feel really shy and hesitate to participate, but now I find myself joining discussions and even contributing ideas. It’s a nice change.

Consultant: That's fantastic progress! Building those skills can really change how you view yourself and your abilities. How does this newfound confidence relate to your hobbies, like drawing?

User: My drawing has improved too! I feel more inspired to create and share my art. I also joined an online group where I can post my work and get feedback.

Consultant: That’s impressive! Engaging with others about your art can be a great way to boost your self-esteem and creativity. How does receiving feedback make you feel about your art?

User: Honestly, I was a bit nervous at first, but the encouragement I've received has been really motivating. I feel like I can take constructive criticism better now.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re taking feedback positively! That shows growth in your self-awareness and resilience. Are there any specific thoughts you have during these moments that change how you feel about yourself?

User: I used to think that my art wasn’t good enough, but now I remind myself that improvement takes time and that learning from others is part of the process.

Consultant: That's a valuable mindset to have! It shows you’re challenging those negative thoughts that might have held you back. Can we explore any remaining doubts or worries you might still experience?

User: Sometimes I still worry about competition with other artists. I fear that I might never match their skill levels.

Consultant: It’s normal to experience that kind of competition at times. Let’s question that thinking—what evidence do you have that you can’t match their skills over time?

User: I guess I don't really have any concrete evidence. It's just that I see their art and feel overwhelmed by how talented they are.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but remember, everyone starts somewhere. If you were to share advice with a friend feeling the same way, what would you say to them?

User: I’d tell them to focus on their own progress and to keep practicing. Everyone has their own journey, and comparison doesn’t help.

Consultant: That’s solid advice! Could you apply that same perspective to your own experiences? Focusing on your journey instead of comparing to others?

User: Yes, I think that's a good approach. I can remind myself of how much I’ve improved and enjoy the process of creating without the pressure.

Consultant: Absolutely! Celebrating your progress is crucial. Let’s also think about how you can maintain this positive momentum. Are there activities you enjoy that we can integrate more into your routine?

User: I love sketching every day, and I’ve been wanting to start a new project, maybe something more ambitious like a comic strip!

Consultant: That sounds exciting! Setting aside time for projects you are passionate about can really enhance your creativity. How do you plan to incorporate more of that into your schedule?

User: I could set aside some time after school each day dedicated to sketching or brainstorming ideas for my comic strip.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! Having dedicated time will help you prioritize your passions. How will you remind yourself to stick to this schedule when life gets busy?

User: I think I could use reminders on my phone and maybe also share my goals with my family so they can support me and check in on my progress.

Consultant: Involving your family is a great strategy! They can help hold you accountable and celebrate your achievements. As we continue to explore your interests, how does it feel to know you have a solid support system?

User: It feels reassuring. I know they want the best for me. Having them cheering me on boosts my motivation.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Encouragement from loved ones can greatly strengthen your sense of self-worth. As we wrap up today, let's summarize the progress you've made and set some goals for the next steps.

User: Well, I’ve increased my confidence by participating in school activities and joined an online art group. My goal is to keep sketching daily and start my comic strip.

Consultant: You’ve outlined some meaningful achievements and goals! It’s clear you’re on a path of positive growth. How do you feel about your ability to maintain this momentum moving forward?

User: I feel hopeful! I think I can keep this up, especially with my family’s support. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic attitude! Remember to lean on those support systems as you continue your journey. I’m proud of what you've accomplished. If you need to talk again, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate all the guidance. I feel much more confident about moving forward now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Goodbye for now!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. I remember in our last session, you shared about your recent success in the speech competition. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel really proud of myself for doing well in the competition. It has boosted my confidence a lot. I find myself looking forward to future challenges now. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like that experience has really motivated you. How do you think you can use this newfound confidence to pursue your interests further?

User: I’ve been thinking about practicing more for future competitions and maybe even trying to join some clubs related to public speaking or even art. I want to keep this momentum going. 

Consultant: That's a great plan! Joining clubs can provide you with more opportunities to develop your skills. What specific steps do you feel you can take to get involved in these activities?

User: I could start by researching clubs at school and maybe talk to my teachers or classmates for recommendations. I just need to overcome my initial shyness about meeting new people.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel shy, especially when facing new social situations. Can we explore what specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about approaching these new experiences?

User: I often fear that people might judge me or that I might not fit in. Sometimes, I think maybe I’m not good enough to be in those clubs.

Consultant: I can understand why those thoughts would hold you back. Let’s challenge those thoughts a bit. How much evidence do you have supporting the idea that you won’t be accepted or that you’re not good enough?

User: I guess there’s not much evidence. I did well in the competition, and my classmates were really supportive. Maybe I’ve just been thinking negatively.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. You've already proven yourself capable in public speaking, and your classmates have shown support. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about joining a club?

User: I would tell them that they should just try it out and not worry too much about fitting in. Everyone feels out of place sometimes, right?

Consultant: Exactly! You seem to have a kind perspective toward others. It might be helpful to take that same approach toward yourself. Let’s brainstorm some actions you can take that reflect this kinder self-talk. 

User: Perhaps I can start by attending a club meeting just to observe before I decide to join. That might help ease my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Observing first can give you a sense of the environment without the pressure of participating right away. How would you feel about setting a specific goal for when you plan to attend a meeting?

User: I think I could do that next week. It gives me just enough time to prepare.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! As we move forward, what other areas in your life or interests would you like to explore and develop, based on your current positive mindset?

User: I really love painting, and I’ve thought about possibly taking some art classes. I’d love to get better at it.

Consultant: That’s exciting! Engaging more with art could be both fulfilling and a great outlet for your emotions. What steps do you think you could take to find art classes or groups?

User: I could look online for local art classes or community centers. Maybe I could even sign up for an art class at school.

Consultant: Those are excellent avenues to explore! How does the thought of pursuing art feel to you right now?

User: It feels really good. I feel energized thinking about expressing myself through painting and meeting other people who love art.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! It's great to hear you feeling energized. Let’s talk about how you can maintain this positive energy moving forward. What strategies can you implement to remind yourself of these fulfilling experiences?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal to reflect on my experiences and feelings after trying new things. It might help me track my growth.

Consultant: A journal sounds like a fantastic idea! Reflecting on your experiences can help reinforce your progress and keep you motivated. How often do you think you would like to write in your journal?

User: I think I could commit to writing every week after a new experience or meeting. 

Consultant: That sounds very doable! Writing weekly can create a great habit of reflection. As we wrap up today’s session, how are you feeling about your plans for the upcoming weeks?

User: I feel excited and more confident about trying new things. I really appreciate your support in helping me organize my thoughts.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! You've made excellent progress in recognizing your strengths and planning for your growth. Remember, it's all about taking one step at a time. If you find yourself facing challenges, don't hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I will definitely keep that in mind. I'm looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: I’m looking forward to it too! Keep nurturing that positive mindset, and take care in the meantime. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I’m really glad you’re here today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I feel quite good, actually. I’ve been enjoying my studies and getting involved in more activities related to my art. It’s been fulfilling.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re making some great progress. Can you share a bit more about what specific activities you've been involved in that you find fulfilling?

User: Sure! I recently joined an art club at school, where we get to paint and share ideas with each other. It’s been really nice to connect with others who share the same interest. 

Consultant: Connecting with like-minded peers can be incredibly rewarding, especially in a creative space. How has participating in this club impacted your feelings about art and yourself?

User: I feel more confident in my abilities, and it’s nice to receive positive feedback from my peers. Sometimes, I even surprise myself with what I create. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It sounds like your experiences in the art club have really boosted your self-esteem and allowed you to express yourself. Have you set any goals related to your art or your involvement in the club?

User: Yes, I’d love to prepare a piece for an upcoming school exhibition. It feels a little daunting, but I'm excited at the same time!

Consultant: It’s normal to feel a mix of excitement and apprehension with such a challenge. How do you think preparing for this exhibition will help you grow as an artist and as a person?

User: I think it will push me to be more disciplined with my practice and maybe help me overcome my fear of judgment. It’s important for me to learn how to showcase my work.

Consultant: You’re absolutely right. Facing that fear can be a huge step forward. Let’s explore a bit deeper: what thoughts or feelings come to mind when you think about showing your work to others?

User: I feel nervous and worry a lot about what people will think. What if they don’t like it? 

Consultant: Those thoughts are completely understandable! It’s common to worry about others' opinions. Let’s take a moment to challenge those thoughts. Is there evidence that supports the idea that people would react negatively?

User: Not really. I’ve received compliments before, but I guess I focus more on potential negative feedback. 

Consultant: It’s interesting how our minds can tend to latch onto negatives. What if you tried to remind yourself of past positive experiences and the supportive environment in your art club? How might that change your mindset?

User: I think that could help! It would remind me that not all feedback is bad. I just need to focus on enjoying the process.

Consultant: Exactly! Enjoying the creative process can really help alleviate some of that pressure. Let's think about how you can integrate that mindset as you prepare for the exhibition. What steps do you think you can take to stay focused on the joy of creating?

User: I guess I could set aside time just to explore new techniques without the pressure of showing it to anyone. That might help.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! By allowing yourself space to experiment, you can relieve some of the pressure. How do you feel about creating a schedule that includes both your exhibition preparation and that exploration time?

User: I’d definitely like that. Balancing both could keep me motivated and less anxious about the exhibition.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s take a moment to outline how your schedule might look and what kind of activities you want to include. What comes to mind for the exploration part?

User: Maybe I can do one or two sketches a week and try different styles. It would be fun to experiment with colors too.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Trying new techniques can spark creativity and keep your passion alive. How do you feel about adding that into your weekly routine?

User: I feel excited! It sounds like a great way to keep the stress at bay while also preparing for the exhibition.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As you embark on this journey, remember the importance of self-compassion. It’s okay to make mistakes along the way. How can you practice being kind to yourself in this process?

User: I could remind myself that every artist goes through ups and downs, and that it’s not the end of the world if something doesn’t turn out perfectly.

Consultant: Absolutely! That mindset will serve you well. As we begin to wrap up today, what would you say is your biggest takeaway from our session regarding your upcoming exhibition?

User: I think I’ve realized that it’s not just about the end result, but also about enjoying the process and allowing myself to grow. 

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! Let’s celebrate that progress together. As we conclude this session, is there anything else you want to discuss or reflect on before we end?

User: No, I think we covered everything I wanted to talk about. Thank you for helping me see things differently!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Keep nurturing your creativity, and I look forward to hearing about your journey next time. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support before our next session. Goodbye for now!

User: Goodbye! Thank you again!
