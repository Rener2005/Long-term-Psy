Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm really glad to see you today. I want to create a safe space for you to express how you’re feeling. So, can you share what’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really overwhelmed since that criticism during our class activity. I can't stop thinking about it, and it's affected my mood. I’ve become really negative about my classmates.

Consultant: It sounds like that criticism hit you hard and has led to some feelings of frustration and negativity towards your classmates. Can you tell me more about how that experience affected you emotionally?

User: I just felt humiliated in front of everyone. Now, I dread interacting with my classmates. Sometimes, I think they might also be judging me. I wish I could just move past this.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling judged and humiliated like that. It’s understandable that you’d want to withdraw from those interactions. What kind of thoughts go through your mind when you think about your classmates now?

User: I often think they see me as someone who's not good enough, or they look down on me. It feels like everyone is against me, and I don't see the point in participating in class activities anymore.

Consultant: It seems like you’re experiencing some very strong feelings and thoughts, believing that your classmates look down on you. How do these thoughts make you feel about yourself?

User: They make me feel worthless and really anxious. I keep thinking that I can't do anything right. I just wish I could feel confident and not care what they think.

Consultant: It's normal to feel anxiety and low self-worth in situations like this. I'm curious, have you found yourself in similar situations before, or is this particularly intense right now?

User: I’ve had similar feelings before, but this time feels different, like it’s hitting me harder. I don’t know how to deal with it.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like this situation has brought up some past feelings, intensifying your current distress. Let’s explore these thoughts a bit more. What evidence do you have that your classmates are judging you negatively?

User: I guess there isn’t any concrete evidence. I just think about that one incident and how it made me feel. But I can’t shake the thought that they all see me that way.

Consultant: It’s understandable that one negative experience can linger and color your perspective. Let's try to challenge that thought together. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their classmates' potential judgments?

User: I’d probably tell them not to take it personally and that it’s just one moment. But I can’t seem to apply that to myself.

Consultant: Exactly, helping others often feels easier than helping ourselves. Can we explore the possibility that your classmates may not be thinking about you as much as you believe they are? How would that change your perspective?

User: If I thought they weren't thinking about me, maybe I'd feel less pressure. But it's hard to shake off that idea.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! It can help to remind ourselves that people are often more focused on their own lives. Can we consider some little experiments to test this idea? Perhaps engaging in a class activity and noticing how your classmates react?

User: That’s scary to think about, but I see your point. Maybe I can try to participate and see what happens.

Consultant: I think that’s a courageous step! How about we brainstorm some small, manageable ways for you to engage with your classmates again, maybe starting with something simple?

User: Maybe I could ask a question during class or just say hello to someone. That feels doable, but I’m still nervous.

Consultant: Those are excellent starting points! It’s normal to feel nervous, but these small actions can be really powerful. Would you like to set a goal for how often you might try to engage with just one classmate this week?

User: I can aim to say hello to someone at least once a day. That feels manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process. Let's also think about how you can handle any negative feelings that might come up afterwards.

User: I could try to remind myself that their opinions aren’t everything. I should focus on feeling good about myself.

Consultant: Absolutely! That self-affirmation is crucial. Keep practicing this self-compassion, and we can check in on how that goes in our next session. How are you feeling about our discussion today?

User: I feel a bit lighter discussing this. I see a few steps I can take, which is encouraging. Thank you!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You've already taken significant steps by acknowledging your feelings and thinking about how to change your approach. Remember, progress takes time, and I’m here to support you. 

User: Yes, it does! I hope next time I can share some positive experiences from trying to engage with my classmates.

Consultant: Definitely! I’m looking forward to hearing all about it. For now, let's summarize what we discussed and your goals moving forward.

User: Sure! I want to focus on saying hi to classmates daily and challenge my negative thoughts about how they see me.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! I believe in your ability to achieve this, Wang. If you encounter any difficulties, don’t hesitate to reach out. Remember, you are not alone in this journey.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support so much. I feel like I can start making some changes now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’re making. We can explore more strategies in our next session if needed. Until then, take care and be gentle with yourself! 

User: Thank you! See you next time!

Consultant: Hello Wang! I'm glad to see you today. I know you've been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately. Can you share with me what has been on your mind?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel really regretful about an argument I had with a classmate about seating arrangements. It made me realize just how powerless I feel when it comes to interacting with others, and it's been bothering me a lot.

Consultant: It sounds like that situation really impacted you. You're feeling regret and a sense of powerlessness in social interactions. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling since that argument?

User: I’ve been feeling really anxious and frustrated. I can't stop thinking about what they must be thinking of me, and it's like I can't control my reactions anymore.

Consultant: It seems like you're really struggling with worries about others’ perceptions of you. This can be tough. What do you think might help you regain a sense of control over your reactions?

User: I wish I could just manage my emotions better and not react so impulsively. It feels like I’m always on edge. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight. Managing emotions is definitely possible. In our sessions, we can work together to identify and challenge some of those impulsive thoughts. For now, what do you think would look like a positive change in your interactions with classmates?

User: I hope that I can communicate calmly and not let my emotions take over. I want to feel confident in expressing myself without fear of conflict.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Feeling confident in expressing yourself is very important. Let’s explore some of the thoughts that you have when you feel anxious about these interactions. Can you recall what thoughts went through your mind during the argument?

User: I kept thinking that I was being judged, and that if I spoke up, I’d just make things worse. It felt like everything I said was wrong. 

Consultant: It sounds like you were caught in a cycle of negative thoughts—believing that you would be judged harshly and that speaking up might lead to more problems. What do you think of that perspective now? 

User: I realize it may have been a bit extreme. But in the moment, it felt so real and overwhelming. 

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. It’s common to experience such intense emotions. Let’s try to challenge that idea. What evidence do you have that speaking up would have made things worse? 

User: I don't really have any solid evidence. It’s mostly just how I feel in the moment.

Consultant: That’s helpful to recognize. Feelings can sometimes guide us, but they aren’t always accurate. If you could think of another way to view that situation, what might that be? 

User: Maybe that speaking up could actually lead to a solution instead of a problem. If we address the issue calmly, it might help.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re beginning to reframe that perspective. Addressing issues calmly can lead to positive outcomes. What steps can you take next time to help yourself stay calm and express your thoughts? 

User: I suppose I could take a deep breath first and remind myself that my opinion matters, and people might not judge me as harshly as I think.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Taking a deep breath and reminding yourself of your value can ground you in the moment. Is there anything else that you feel could help in such situations? 

User: I think maybe practicing some assertiveness could help. I do want to communicate better without feeling overly anxious.

Consultant: Practicing assertiveness is a wonderful idea! It can really help you express yourself confidently and manage those anxious feelings. Would you like to role-play a situation where you can practice expressing your needs or feelings? 

User: Yes, I would like that. I think it might help to see how it feels to handle it differently. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s set up a scenario based on what you experienced. Imagine we’re back in that discussion about seating. Practice expressing your feelings and needs. 

User: Okay... I might say something like, "I feel uncomfortable with the current seating arrangement. Can we discuss this?"

Consultant: That’s excellent! You’re stating your feelings directly and inviting a discussion. How does saying that make you feel? 

User: It actually feels empowering to say that out loud! Like I can take control of the situation instead of letting it control me.

Consultant: That’s a positive realization! Feeling empowered can change your interactions. It’s a big step towards regaining control over your feelings. What do you think you can do to reinforce this practice in real life? 

User: I think I need to remind myself regularly that my thoughts and feelings are valid and deserve to be expressed calmly.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Regular reminders can help reinforce new habits. As we conclude our session today, let’s recap what you've learned. What are the key takeaways? 

User: I’ve learned that I can challenge my anxious thoughts, practice assertiveness, and manage my feelings better. I can be calm and confident in my interactions.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve made great progress today. Remember, it’s about small steps, and each time you practice, you are building your confidence. If you ever feel overwhelmed again, just reach out. You’ve got this!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support and guidance. I feel more hopeful about handling these situations now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of the steps you’ve taken. Looking forward to our next session together. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Wang! It's great to see you again. I remember we talked about how your skin allergy has been affecting your social interactions. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really anxious about my skin. I try to avoid socializing as much as possible. Whenever I think about going out or talking to my classmates, I get really embarrassed and just want to hide.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It seems like the embarrassment from your skin condition is making it hard for you to engage with others. Can we talk a bit more about specific situations where you felt this embarrassment?

User: Well, just last week, I managed to go to class, but when I spotted some friends, I felt this overwhelming urge to leave. I thought they would judge me because of my skin. So, I just walked out instead.

Consultant: It sounds like you had a really difficult moment, wanting to connect but feeling too ashamed to stay. What thoughts were running through your mind at that moment? 

User: I kept thinking, "What if they think I look disgusting?" or "They probably find me annoying." These thoughts made me feel horrible.

Consultant: I can see how those thoughts would be really distressing. It’s understandable to fear judgment, but I'm curious—how accurate do you think those thoughts are? What evidence do you have for or against them?

User: I guess I don't really have solid evidence that they'd actually think that way. But it just feels so real when I'm anxious.

Consultant: It’s common for anxiety to amplify those fears and make them feel very real. What would you say to a friend who was feeling the same way about their appearance and fear of judgment?

User: I would tell them that everyone has their struggles and that their worth isn't based on looks. But when it comes to myself, it's hard to believe that.

Consultant: That's a compassionate perspective for a friend. Now, let’s try something. Imagine you're in a social situation again. What if we could create a safe space here to imagine it, challenge those negative thoughts and see if there's a different way to view it?

User: That sounds okay, I guess. What do you mean by creating a safe space?

Consultant: Creating a safe space means we visualize the situation but do it in a way that feels secure. You can express your feelings, and we can work through them together. Can you start by describing a social event you feel anxious about?

User: Maybe a group study session with classmates. I worry they'll notice my skin condition and avoid me.

Consultant: Let’s explore that. If your classmates notice, what do you think they would actually say or think? Would they react as negatively as you fear?

User: I imagine they’d whisper or talk behind my back. But I guess I don't know for sure…

Consultant: Right. It often helps to differentiate between what we fear and what could be the reality. What if instead of responding with avoidance, you approached that situation differently? 

User: I haven’t really thought about that. Maybe I could try to join in and see what happens. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! What small step could you take to practice joining in? It could be just introducing yourself or sharing a thought on the topic.

User: I could try just saying "hi" to them when I see them next. That feels manageable.

Consultant: Absolutely! Starting with a small "hi" is a great approach. Let’s also think about how you'll challenge those negative thoughts when they arise during that interaction. What could you remind yourself?

User: I could tell myself that my friends would care more about who I am rather than what my skin looks like.

Consultant: That's a powerful reminder. You can affirm your value as a person. Remember, it’s okay to feel anxious. What matters is that you’re taking steps forward. 

User: Yes, I see what you mean. I might feel anxious but I can still engage.

Consultant: Exactly! Progress often comes in steps. Let’s summarize your plan: you're going to say "hi" to your classmates next time and remind yourself of your worth. How does that sound?

User: That sounds really good. I feel a little more confident just thinking about it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember that it’s okay to take your time with this. How do you feel now about your social interactions compared to when we first started our session?

User: I feel a bit lighter. I realize I don’t have to hide all the time. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful progress! Before we finish today, what strategies do you think will help you maintain this mindset as you move forward?

User: I think I’ll keep reminding myself of my own worth and maybe even journal my feelings about these experiences.

Consultant: Great plan! Journaling can help clarify your thoughts and feelings. As we wrap up today, remember that you’re not alone in this journey. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate the support. It feels good to have a plan.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm proud of the steps you’re taking. If you feel overwhelmed, remember that you can come back for more sessions to share your experiences. 

User: I will. Thanks again for everything. 

Consultant: Take care, Wang. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
###################
Consultant: Hi there! I'm glad you're here for our session today. Let's start by discussing how you've been feeling lately, especially in relation to your school life.

User: Hi! I've been feeling really low and overwhelmed. I got in trouble for skipping classes, and it’s made me feel really disappointed in myself. I don’t even know how to get back on track.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling quite lost and disappointed about your situation. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when facing disciplinary actions. Can you tell me more about what you’ve been thinking and feeling since this happened?

User: I’ve been thinking that I’m a failure because I can’t keep up with my studies and now getting into trouble just confirms that. I feel disconnected from my classmates and like I don't belong.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy. It’s tough to feel that way, especially when you're struggling. Let’s explore your feelings a bit more. What specific thoughts run through your mind when you think about your academic performance or your place in the class?

User: I often think that I’ll never improve and that my future is bleak. I feel like everyone else is doing better than I am, and I just can't catch up.

Consultant: It's really hard when you feel stuck in that mindset. When you say you believe your future is bleak, what evidence do you have that supports that thought? Can we look at things from a different angle?

User: I guess I don't have any solid proof; it's more of a feeling. I just wish I could feel more hopeful and less anxious about everything.

Consultant: That’s a great observation! Recognizing that these thoughts may not have solid evidence can be the first step to changing them. If a friend of yours was in a similar situation, what would you tell them about their feelings and future?

User: I would probably tell them not to give up and that it’s okay to ask for help. But somehow I find it hard to apply that advice to myself.

Consultant: It’s common to give better advice to others than ourselves. How about we create a small plan to start taking steps towards improving your situation? What’s one small goal you could set for yourself this week?

User: Maybe I could try to attend all my classes for the upcoming week. That seems manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic goal! Attending classes can help you reconnect with your studies and your classmates. What might help you stick to that goal?

User: I think if I set reminders or maybe even ask a friend to check in with me, that could help.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Having reminders and a supportive friend can make it easier to stay accountable. Let’s talk about how you can also start building those connections with your classmates. Are there any group activities or clubs that you’ve been interested in?

User: I haven't really thought about joining any clubs. I guess I'm nervous about meeting new people since I feel so out of place.

Consultant: It’s totally understandable to feel nervous. How about starting small—maybe just reaching out to a classmate to study together? That could provide a low-pressure way to connect.

User: That sounds less intimidating. I can try asking someone if they want to study for our next exam together.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Building a support system can really help alleviate some of that anxiety and help you feel more included. How do you feel about setting that as your goal as well?

User: I’m feeling a bit excited about it. It feels good to have something positive to focus on.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Keeping a positive focus can really shift how we feel about our situation. As we continue our sessions, we can keep setting these small goals and build on your progress. For now, let’s reflect on what we’ve talked about today. How do you feel about what we’ve worked on?

User: I feel more hopeful. I think setting those small goals will help me regain some control over my life and schoolwork.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! It’s about taking those small steps towards creating the change you want to see. Remember, it’s okay to feel a little anxious as you make these changes—it can be part of the process. As we wrap up today, what have you learned that you want to carry forward?

User: I’ve learned that I need to be kinder to myself and also that it’s okay to ask for help from others. I really want to make an effort to connect more.

Consultant: That’s a valuable takeaway! Being compassionate with yourself is vital, and reaching out to others can foster connection. I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress and how these small steps work out for you in our next session. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey, and I'm here to support you.

User: Thank you! I feel more confident about moving forward now.

Consultant: You’re welcome! It’s been great working with you today. Keep those goals in mind, and I’m excited to hear about your experiences next time. Take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello Wang! I'm glad you're here today. It seems like you’ve had some positive experiences recently. How are you feeling about your interactions in class?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel better after that group activity. It was nice to feel accepted and supported by my classmates. I want to build on that and continue to engage more with them.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful step forward! It's great that you felt that sense of support. Can you tell me more about what specific moments during that activity made you feel accepted?

User: Well, during the discussion, my ideas were valued, and my classmates listened attentively. I’ve never experienced that in a group before, which made me feel really good.

Consultant: That’s amazing to hear! Feeling valued is essential in any group setting. How did that shift your thoughts about participating in future activities?

User: It makes me want to participate more. Before, I was nervous about speaking up, but now I feel like I can contribute without being judged.

Consultant: It’s great to see your confidence growing! You mentioned feeling nervous before. What thoughts do you usually have when you feel nervous about speaking up?

User: I often think that my ideas aren’t good enough or that people will criticize me. It stops me from sharing my thoughts.

Consultant: Those are tough thoughts to deal with. Let’s explore those feelings together. What evidence do you have that supports those negative thoughts? Have you experienced any situations where your ideas were appreciated?

User: I guess I don’t have much evidence that others will criticize me, especially after what happened in the last activity. But sometimes, I just can’t shake that worry of being wrong.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to have worries like that. However, let’s take a moment to consider the positive feedback you received recently. How might that change the validity of those negative thoughts?

User: I see your point. The feedback showed that my ideas were helpful and valued. Maybe I should focus on that more and try not to dwell on my worries.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach! Now, let’s talk about some small social goals you could set for yourself. What’s one thing you could do in the next week to engage more with your classmates?

User: I could start by sharing at least one idea during our next group discussion. It feels manageable, and I hope it can help me feel more comfortable.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent goal! Sharing an idea will not only help build your confidence but also reinforce that sense of acceptance. How do you plan to prepare for that moment?

User: I think I’ll write down my thoughts beforehand so I feel more organized. That way, I won’t blank out when it’s my turn to speak.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Preparing in advance can really help ease anxiety. How do you think you will feel after you successfully share your idea in the group?

User: I believe I’ll feel proud of myself. Just thinking about it makes me hopeful!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset to have! Let’s also think about how to handle it if you start to feel those anxious thoughts creeping back in. What strategies can you use to challenge those thoughts?

User: I could remind myself of the positive feedback I’ve received and the supportive environment. Maybe I can even do some deep breathing to calm my nerves.

Consultant: Excellent strategies! Remembering those positive experiences and using calming techniques can really empower you. As we move forward, what other aspects of your social experiences would you like to improve?

User: I want to get better at listening to others and engaging in conversations. Sometimes, I feel like I don’t know what to say back.

Consultant: That’s a valuable goal! Active listening can greatly enhance your interactions. How can you practice listening more actively in your conversations?

User: Maybe I can focus on asking more questions to show that I’m interested in what others are saying. It might help me feel more connected.

Consultant: Absolutely! Asking questions is a great way to engage and shows that you value the other person’s input. What’s one question you could ask in a conversation to start practicing this?

User: I could ask about their opinions on the topics we discuss in class. It opens up dialogue and helps me practice listening.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Engaging with others through questions is an excellent way to build relationships. How do you feel about taking this approach in your next class?

User: I’m excited! It feels like a good challenge, and I think it will help me connect better with my classmates.

Consultant: I’m thrilled to hear that enthusiasm! You’re making great progress in developing your social skills. As we wrap up today, what are the key takeaways you want to remember from our session?

User: I want to remember to focus on the positive feedback I’ve received, prepare my thoughts beforehand, and practice active listening by asking questions.

Consultant: Those are wonderful insights! I’m proud of the progress you've made and the goals you are setting for yourself. Keep these strategies in mind as you move forward. Remember, it’s a process, and you’re doing great. How do you feel as we conclude today’s session?

User: I feel hopeful and more confident about approaching my classmates. Thank you for your support!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad to hear you feel that way. Remember, it's important to celebrate your progress, no matter how small. If you need anything in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a lot better. My emotions have become easier to manage, especially during my classes. Participating in campus activities has really brought me some positive feelings, and I'm more hopeful about the future now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made significant progress in managing your emotions and finding joy in activities. Can you tell me more about how you’ve been feeling during your classes and what changes you've noticed?

User: Well, I used to feel overwhelmed in class, but now I’m better at focusing and not getting distracted. My sleep schedule is also improving; I can fall asleep at night without too much trouble.

Consultant: That’s a great observation. Improved focus in class and better sleep can really contribute to your overall well-being. Have there been any specific techniques or strategies that you’ve found helpful in managing your emotions during class?

User: I’ve started taking deep breaths when I feel anxious, and I try to remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes. Just being aware of my feelings helps a lot.

Consultant: Deep breathing and self-compassion are excellent strategies. It shows you’re taking active steps to manage your emotions. Since we’re looking to evaluate your progress and explore your growth, what areas do you feel you’d like to focus on moving forward?

User: I think I’d like to continue improving my social skills. Sometimes, I still feel nervous when meeting new people or participating in group discussions.

Consultant: That’s a valuable goal. Improving your social skills can enhance your overall confidence and help build connections. What specific situations make you feel the most anxious socially?

User: I usually get nervous when I have to speak up in a group or introduce myself to new people. I worry about how I’ll come across.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. You’re not alone in experiencing social anxiety. Have you tried any strategies for those situations, or has anything worked for you in the past?

User: Not really. Mostly I just try to avoid those situations, but I know that’s not really helping.

Consultant: Avoidance can sometimes feel like the easy way out, but gradually facing those situations can help reduce anxiety over time. How would you feel about setting a small challenge for yourself to practice speaking up in a low-pressure environment?

User: That sounds nerving but also exciting! I think it would help me build confidence.

Consultant: Absolutely! Maybe you could start by sharing your thoughts in a small group of friends or during a class discussion. How does that sound to you?

User: That makes sense. I think I could handle that. It might push me out of my comfort zone, but in a good way.

Consultant: Stepping out of your comfort zone is a fantastic way to grow. Also, setting small goals can make it feel more manageable. What do you think your first step could be?

User: I could aim to speak at least once in my next class discussion. Just sharing a thought would be enough.

Consultant: That’s an excellent first step, Wang! Remember to be kind to yourself no matter how it goes. How do you feel about setting up a plan to reflect on this experience after your discussion?

User: I think reflecting on it will help me see how I handled it and what I can improve. I’ll definitely want to talk about it in our next session.

Consultant: Perfect! Having that reflection time will be valuable. Is there anything else you’d like to work on today, or do you feel ready to set that plan in motion?

User: I think that’s enough for now. I feel good about our plan, and I’m excited to see how it goes.

Consultant: That's great to hear! You’ve made progress dealing with your emotions and planning for social interactions. I believe you're on a solid path toward continued growth. For our next session, we’ll check on how your plan went and make adjustments if needed.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I feel much more motivated now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure to work together. If you encounter any challenges or need additional support, feel free to reach out. Have a great week, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences!

User: Thanks! I will. See you next time!

Consultant: See you next time, Wang! Take care!
