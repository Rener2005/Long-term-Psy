Consultant: Hello Li! I'm glad to see you today. Let's start by talking about how you've been feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really ignored and it seems like everything is getting to me. My skin has been itching a lot, and I can’t help but feel upset and frustrated.

Consultant: I hear you, it sounds like you’re going through a tough time with both your skin issues and your emotions. Can you tell me more about what you think is causing these feelings of frustration?

User: Well, I recently didn’t get into college, and it made me feel like a failure, especially since my twin sister is getting so much attention for her achievements. It feels like I’m just in the background.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel overshadowed, especially when you compare yourself to your sister. How do you think this situation is affecting your skin condition and emotional state?

User: I think when I feel stressed or anxious, my skin gets worse. It’s almost like my emotions are linked to my physical symptoms, but I don’t really know how to handle it.

Consultant: That’s an important observation. It seems like your emotional state may be influencing your skin issues. Let’s explore this connection further. Can you recall any specific moments when your emotions were particularly intense, and then your skin reacted?

User: Yes, definitely. Whenever I get really anxious about something, like not measuring up in front of others, I notice my skin starts itching more. 

Consultant: It sounds like there might be a cycle at play here, where your anxiety leads to skin irritation, which in turn may increase your anxiety. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that accompany these feelings?

User: I often think things like, “I’m not good enough,” or “I’ll never be as successful as my sister.” These thoughts make me feel worse.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really harmful, and it makes sense that they would contribute to your emotional and physical distress. Let's take a moment to examine those thoughts. How much evidence do you think supports the idea that you’re not good enough?

User: I guess there isn’t really much evidence. It’s more about how I feel rather than any actual proof. 

Consultant: That’s a crucial insight. Just because a feeling exists doesn’t mean it's an accurate reflection of reality. If a friend were in your situation, how might you advise them to think about their worth?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone has their own path and just because someone else is successful doesn’t diminish your own value. 

Consultant: Exactly! You have that wisdom within you. Let's work on applying that understanding to yourself. What would it feel like for you to adopt a kinder perspective towards yourself?

User: I think it would be a relief to feel okay about my own journey. But it's hard to change my inner dialogue.

Consultant: It is indeed challenging, but it’s a process. We can start small by practicing reframing those negative thoughts when they come up. What’s a small step you could take this week to begin that practice?

User: Maybe I can try to write down my thoughts whenever I feel inadequate and then write a positive counter-statement beside it?

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! By doing that, you're actively challenging those negative beliefs. How do you feel about this exercise?

User: I feel hopeful but also a bit unsure if I can stick with it. 

Consultant: It's natural to feel unsure, especially with new practices. Remember, progress takes time. We could set a plan to check in on this exercise in our next session, would that work for you?

User: Yes, I would like that! I think having that accountability will help.

Consultant: Great! Alongside this, are there any activities you enjoy that can help alleviate stress, like hobbies or spending time with friends?

User: I enjoy painting, but I haven’t done it in a while. I used to find it quite relaxing.

Consultant: Painting could be a great way for you to express your feelings and decompress. How about setting aside some time this week to engage in that? 

User: That sounds like a good idea! I think I’ll try to paint at least once this week.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about taking small steps. As we continue our sessions, we’ll explore how these changes affect both your emotions and skin symptoms.

User: Thanks, I appreciate the support. I’m really looking forward to making some progress.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Li! It’s wonderful to see your motivation. Let’s keep focusing on understanding those connections and finding ways to empower yourself. I’m here for you every step of the way.

User: Thank you. I feel a bit more hopeful about everything now. Though I’m still worried about whether I can truly change my situation.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those worries. Change doesn’t happen overnight, but even small efforts can lead to significant shifts over time. Remember to be patient with yourself.

User: I will try. I just want to make sure I fight through this feeling of being lost.

Consultant: That determination is commendable! Working through those feelings, one step at a time, can really help. We’ll build your confidence together. 

User: I hope so, I really want to believe that I can manage my emotions better. 

Consultant: Believing in yourself is key! I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time, Li. Keep practicing your exercises and be kind to yourself.

User: I will, thank you for your guidance today. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m here to support you. See you next time, and take care in the meantime!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I’m glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, not much has changed. The pressure at work has gotten heavier, and my skin condition has worsened again. I feel overwhelmed and frustrated.

Consultant: I understand that you're feeling overwhelmed, especially with the added pressure at work and the impact it’s having on your skin. Let's dive a little deeper into how all of this is affecting you. What specific thoughts have been running through your head regarding your skin condition and work stress?

User: I keep thinking that no matter how hard I try, my skin will never get better. It feels like I'm stuck in a vicious cycle. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling like you're stuck. Can you share what emotions come up when you have those thoughts about your skin? 

User: I often feel hopeless and angry at myself. It’s frustrating because I can't seem to do anything right.

Consultant: Those feelings of hopelessness and frustration are completely valid, considering the situation. Let's focus on those thoughts you have about your skin not getting better. Do you feel they're extreme or perhaps not entirely accurate?

User: Yes, I guess I tend to think that way a lot. I just worry it will never improve, and I feel like I should be doing more.

Consultant: That awareness is an important step. What evidence do you have that supports or challenges that thought about your skin never improving? 

User: Well, sometimes it gets a little better with treatment, but then it flares up again. I suppose I only focus on the bad moments.

Consultant: It sounds like you are focusing mainly on the setbacks rather than the moments when you felt improvement. How might it feel to acknowledge those small successes as well?

User: I guess it would be better, but it’s really hard to remember those moments when I’m feeling down.

Consultant: It makes sense that it's hard to focus on the positives when you're feeling low. One strategy we could consider is creating a kind of ‘success journal’ where you note down those small improvements or achievements. What do you think about that idea?

User: That might help. I could look back at it when I'm feeling particularly frustrated.

Consultant: Great! It’s a way to gradually shift your focus toward the positive aspects. Now, let’s also talk about your work stress. How has that been impacting your emotions and skin?

User: The stress at work makes me anxious, and when I'm anxious, I tend to scratch more, which makes my skin worse.

Consultant: It sounds like there's a cycle there—work stress leading to anxiety and then worsening your skin condition. What might be some ways to manage that stress at work? 

User: I haven't really thought about it. I just try to keep my head down and get through the day.

Consultant: That’s a common approach, but it’s important to find ways to take breaks and manage that stress. Could we brainstorm some specific activities or techniques that might help you relieve stress during your workday?

User: I like the idea of taking short breaks! Maybe some deep breathing exercises would help me calm down?

Consultant: Deep breathing is a fantastic strategy! It can help you manage anxiety in the moment. Would you like to practice a few techniques together now?

User: Sure, I think that could be helpful.

Consultant: Let's take a moment. Close your eyes if you feel comfortable. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold it for a count of four, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Let’s do that a few times. How does that feel?

User: It feels nice to take a moment for myself. I can see how that could help during stressful times.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. Integrating these moments into your day can make a real difference. Let's also work on communication with your family. How do you currently express your feelings to them? 

User: I tend to keep my feelings to myself. I don’t think they would understand my struggles.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Building communication can feel daunting, but we can develop some strategies for expressing your feelings. What would it look like for you to share your thoughts with them?

User: Maybe I could just start by telling them when I'm feeling anxious, rather than hiding it.

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! Practicing small, honest conversations about your feelings could gradually strengthen your support system. How do you think they would respond if you opened up a little?

User: They would probably be surprised but also supportive. I know they care about me.

Consultant: That’s a good sign! It might help to brainstorm a few phrases you could use when you feel ready to share. Would you like help with that?

User: Yes, that would be useful. 

Consultant: Let's craft a simple sentence you can use, like “I've been feeling really anxious lately, and I could use some support.” How does that sound?

User: That sounds okay. It feels a bit scary to say, but I think it’s a step I need to take.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel scared. Taking that first step can be empowering. You’ve made some significant progress today, Li. How do you feel about the strategies we discussed?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I like the idea of the success journal and trying to communicate with my family.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, progress takes time. As we wrap up today, what’s one key takeaway you’d like to focus on moving forward?

User: I want to focus on using the success journal and reaching out to my family when I need support.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. I believe with these strategies, you can cultivate a more positive mindset. Remember, I'm here to support you, and you’re not alone in this journey. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care of yourself, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you today for our session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite lonely. I tried talking to my parents about the pressure I've been facing, but it didn’t go well. I felt like they didn't understand me at all, and it led to an emotional outburst.

Consultant: I’m really sorry to hear that. It sounds frustrating to feel misunderstood by your family, especially when you're seeking support. Can you tell me more about how that conversation went and what feelings came up for you?

User: Well, I tried to explain my feelings about work and the itchiness that's been bothering me for a long time. But it seemed like they dismissed it as just stress. It made me feel helpless and angry.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel helpless and angry when you’re looking for understanding and it feels like you’re not being heard. What do you wish had happened differently in that conversation?

User: I wished they could have listened to my feelings without downplaying them. Maybe they could understand the impact all of this is having on me.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. You want a space where your feelings are truly acknowledged. Let’s work on some effective communication techniques that could help you express your needs and feelings in a way that might foster better understanding. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good, but I’m not sure how to do that. I often get emotional and it’s hard to find the right words.

Consultant: That’s completely okay, feeling emotional can make communication challenging. One approach we can consider is using "I" statements, which focus on your feelings rather than placing blame. For instance, you could say, “I feel overwhelmed when I think about my work stress,” instead of saying, “You never listen to me.” Would you be willing to try formulating some of your feelings into "I" statements?

User: I can try that. I guess I just don’t want to sound confrontational.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize that! Using "I" statements tends to come across as less confrontational and more expressively personal. Would you like to give it a shot, starting with the feelings you just shared?

User: Okay, I could say, “I feel overwhelmed when I think about my work and my skin problems.” But what if they react negatively to that?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It can be tough to anticipate how others will react. However, the purpose of this approach is to help them understand your perspective better. If they react negatively, it could be helpful to remind yourself that their reactions are not a reflection of your feelings. You can’t control how they respond, but you can control how you express yourself. How does that sound to you?

User: That makes sense. I think I just need to focus on what I can control. 

Consultant: Absolutely. Focusing on what you can control is empowering. Besides using "I" statements, are there other ways you think you could create a more open environment for dialogue with your parents?

User: Maybe I could try to choose a calm time to talk, instead of when we’re all stressed out?

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Timing can make a huge difference in how conversations unfold. Creating a calm environment can help both you and your parents feel more at ease. How do you think you’ll approach this in your next conversation?

User: I could ask them to sit down with me when they’re relaxed, and then I can share how I’m feeling. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Practice the "I" statements and choose a good time–let’s keep it simple. Afterward, how will you assess how the conversation went?

User: I think I’ll pay attention to how well they’re listening and whether I feel heard. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great approach! Being mindful of how you feel during that conversation can provide valuable insights. If it doesn’t go as planned, it’s important to remember that improving communication is a process. Would you feel okay about discussing this in our next session?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful. I really want to improve this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Change takes time, and it’s wonderful that you are open to trying new methods. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today or any other support you need?

User: Not really, I just want to focus on trying out these techniques.

Consultant: That’s totally understandable, and it sounds like a good focus. Remember, it's okay to take small steps. I look forward to hearing how it goes. Until next time, take care of yourself, Li. 

User: Thank you. I'm looking forward to it too!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you today. Before we get started, how have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi there! I've been feeling a bit anxious, but also hopeful. I tried that new skin care method, and my skin seems to be improving. However, I still sometimes feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: It's great to hear that the new skin care method has helped improve your skin condition! It sounds like you're moving in a positive direction. Can you tell me more about the moments when you feel overwhelmed?

User: Sure. Sometimes, when I think about my skin issues, I get frustrated and angry, especially when it flares up. I wish I could just handle it better.

Consultant: I completely understand; dealing with skin issues can be really challenging and can stir up a lot of emotions. When those feelings of frustration arise, what thoughts go through your mind?

User: I often think that I should be able to fix it quickly or that I'm not doing enough to help myself. Those thoughts make me feel worse.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem really heavy. It’s natural to want quick fixes, but it can create pressure. Can we explore some alternative thoughts or beliefs that might be helpful for you in those moments?

User: I guess I could remind myself that improvement takes time and that I’ve already made a positive change. But sometimes it's hard to believe that.

Consultant: That's a wonderful insight. How about we practice saying that to yourself when those frustrating feelings arise? It could be a reminder that patience is part of the journey. 

User: That makes sense. I just worry I'll forget to do that in the moment.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to forget, especially during stressful times. We could practice together ways to incorporate those reminders into your daily routine. Would that help?

User: Yes, I think that could be really helpful. Maybe setting reminders on my phone would work?

Consultant: Setting phone reminders sounds like a great idea! It’s a simple yet effective way to keep those positive affirmations at the forefront of your mind. What else could you do to support yourself during this time?

User: I suppose I could try some relaxation techniques or maybe establish a daily routine for my skin care. Those might help me feel more in control.

Consultant: Absolutely! Establishing a routine can be very empowering. Would you like to discuss some specific relaxation techniques and skin care practices you could incorporate?

User: Yes, I would love that! I’ve heard of things like deep breathing and maybe even some mindfulness practices.

Consultant: Both deep breathing and mindfulness are excellent strategies to reduce stress and increase your awareness of the present moment. We could try a simple breathing exercise together now, if you would like.

User: That sounds good! I’m all in.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in together, hold it for a moment, and now slowly release it. Focus on how your body feels with each breath. How does that feel for you?

User: It feels calming! I can already feel a little bit of tension releasing.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Practicing this daily can help ground you when stress feels overwhelming. Now, let’s discuss the practical steps you can take for your skin care routine. What changes do you want to make?

User: I want to stick with the new method, but I need to establish a regular schedule so that I don’t skip it when I'm busy.

Consultant: Setting a schedule sounds like a good plan. How about dedicating a specific time each day that works best for you, perhaps in the morning or before bed?

User: I think doing it at night would be better since it would help me unwind before sleep.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely way to end your day! Let’s outline a simple night-time routine for you. What steps would you like to include?

User: I could start with a gentle cleanse, then apply the new product, and maybe finish with some moisturizing. Keeping it simple might work best.

Consultant: A simple routine is often the most sustainable, especially when you’re busy. This way, you can feel accomplished every night! How does that sound?

User: It sounds manageable. I like that it won’t take too much time.

Consultant: Perfect! How about we set a small goal for you to try this routine over the next week? We can check in and adjust as needed.

User: Yes, that makes sense. I like having a goal to work towards.

Consultant: Fantastic! You’re on the right path with your skin care and emotional regulation. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. How else can I support you during this process?

User: Just having these conversations really helps. I feel more grounded and capable to tackle things.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that, Li! It's important to recognize the strength you have within you. As we approach our next session, think about any strategies or insights you've found helpful to share.

User: I will! I also want to reflect on my feelings about progress and how to maintain my positive mindset.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! I look forward to our next session to hear about your reflections and experiences. You've made significant strides today. Keep believing in your capabilities, and remember, I’m here to support you.

User: Thank you so much! I feel more confident already. See you next time!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li! Take care until we meet again.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better overall. I got praised by my supervisor at work for my performance, which made me feel recognized. But I still worry about keeping my emotions stable.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear about the praise at work! Recognition can really boost our self-esteem. Let’s talk about how we can maintain and build on this positive emotional state. What specific thoughts or feelings do you experience when you receive positive feedback?

User: When I receive feedback, I feel happy and validated. But I also worry that it might not last. I fear that if I don’t do well next time, my confidence might drop again.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way. It sounds like you're experiencing a push and pull between enjoying the recognition and fearing that it could be temporary. What kind of thoughts go through your mind that lead to this fear of losing your confidence?

User: I often think that I might not be able to replicate my previous success. I keep telling myself it might just be luck or that others might perform better than me.

Consultant: I see. It seems like you might be dealing with some negative thoughts about your abilities. Can we explore those thoughts a bit more? What evidence do you have that suggests your success was just luck?

User: Well, I guess I don’t really have strong evidence. I mean, I did put in a lot of work and effort, but I still find it hard to believe that I'm truly good at my job.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize the effort you put in! Sometimes, our minds can trick us into thinking that we haven’t earned our success. If a friend were in your situation, what would you say to her about her accomplishments?

User: I’d probably tell her that she deserved it because she worked hard and that she shouldn’t doubt herself. 

Consultant: Exactly! You seem to have a lot of compassion for others. Now, let’s try to apply that compassion to yourself. What if you challenged your doubts and reminded yourself of the hard work you put in? How might that change your feelings about your abilities?

User: I think it could help me feel more confident if I really acknowledged my hard work instead of downplaying it. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Li! Acknowledgment can be powerful. Let’s create a small plan: how can you remind yourself of your achievements daily? Maybe a journal or a list of your accomplishments?

User: Yes, I can definitely start a journal. I think writing down my successes might help me remember them better.

Consultant: Wonderful! Journaling can be a fantastic way to reinforce positive thoughts. Along with that, are there any specific strategies you can think of to deal with anxiety if it arises from your fears about performance?

User: Maybe I can practice deep breathing or take small breaks when I start feeling anxious. I’ve heard that can help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Deep breathing and taking breaks are effective strategies to manage anxiety. It sounds like you have a solid plan. As we work on these strategies, how do you envision your emotional state evolving in the coming weeks?

User: I hope I can feel more in control of my emotions. I want to embrace my achievements and face my work with more confidence.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, Li! Embracing your achievements is crucial for maintaining that emotional stability. What do you think could be the first step towards reaching this goal as you approach your work week?

User: I think my first step could be to start that journal right away and remind myself of my recent achievements. 

Consultant: Excellent choice! Starting today will set a positive tone. As we wrap up this session, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our conversation today?

User: I feel like I’ve realized that I need to be kinder to myself and recognize my hard work. This has helped me feel more secure about my performance.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Self-compassion is key to confidence. Do you feel you’re leaving today with a clearer plan for maintaining your emotional state and recognizing your achievements?

User: Yes, I feel really good about the steps I can take now, especially starting that journal!

Consultant: That's fantastic! Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. I'm here to support you on this journey. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. See you then!

User: Thank you so much! I’m looking forward to it too!
###################
Consultant: Hello Li! I'm delighted to see you today for our session. How are you feeling right now about your progress and what we’ve covered in our previous meetings?

User: Hi! I'm feeling pretty good actually. I’ve been reflecting on what we talked about last time, and I feel more optimistic about my health management after joining that study group.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like joining the group has had a positive impact on your outlook. Can you tell me more about what you learned and how it has influenced your mindset?

User: Sure! I learned a lot about nutrition and exercise, which made me feel like I have more control over my health. It's nice to have practical strategies to implement. I feel like I can actually make a difference in my condition.

Consultant: It's great that you're feeling empowered by the knowledge you've gained! What specific strategies or ideas resonated with you the most from the group discussions?

User: One thing that stood out was the importance of regular exercise and a balanced diet. I’ve started incorporating more fruits and vegetables into my meals, and I even went for a jog yesterday!

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic step forward! How did you feel after jogging? Did it have any impact on your mood or state of mind?

User: I felt really good afterward! It was refreshing, and I noticed I was in a better mood for the rest of the day. It's surprising how much a little exercise can change things.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! It seems like physical activity is not only beneficial for your body but also positively affects your emotions. Have you thought about ways to make exercise a regular part of your routine?

User: I want to! I think setting a specific schedule could help. Maybe a couple of times a week to start with, so it doesn’t feel overwhelming.

Consultant: Absolutely, setting a manageable schedule is key. Let’s brainstorm a possible plan for how you can incorporate those exercise sessions into your week. What days do you think would work best for you?

User: I think I could manage Tuesdays and Thursdays after work. That way, I can unwind a bit before heading home.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! How do you anticipate you might feel after sticking to this routine for a few weeks?

User: I hope to feel more energetic and maybe even more confident. I’d like to see noticeable improvements in my mood and health.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful intention. Confidence often grows with progress. It’s important to reflect on how these changes make you feel. What about your emotional state? Have you noticed any changes in your mood since starting this journey?

User: I think so. I’m feeling less irritable than before. I’m starting to appreciate those little moments of joy more, which is a nice change.

Consultant: That’s encouraging to hear, Li! Connecting with moments of joy can significantly enhance your overall well-being. Do you find that participating in the study group has influenced this positive shift in your emotional state?

User: Definitely! Being around others who are also invested in their health is inspiring. It motivates me to stay on track and share experiences, which I find very valuable.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re able to draw motivation from your peers. Social support can be incredibly beneficial. As we reflect on your journey, what do you feel has been your biggest achievement so far?

User: I think gaining a better understanding of my health and making those first steps towards change have been the most significant achievements for me.

Consultant: That’s an important realization and a significant step towards personal growth. Looking ahead, what are some areas where you would like to focus on or explore further as you develop your long-term personal growth plan?

User: I’d like to learn more about stress management techniques. Sometimes I still feel overwhelmed, especially with daily pressures at work.

Consultant: That’s a valuable area to explore. Learning to manage stress effectively can enhance your overall wellness. Would you be interested in developing some strategies together to help with that?

User: Yes, I would love that! I think having specific methods to deal with stress would make a huge difference.

Consultant: Great! We can start with identifying what typically triggers your stress and how you currently respond to those triggers. Can you share a recent situation where you felt stressed?

User: Recently, I had a busy day at work where everything piled up at once, and I felt panicked. I ended up needing to take a break because I couldn’t focus.

Consultant: It makes sense that those overwhelming days can trigger panic. Let’s look at ways to cope better during busy times. What have you found helpful in the past for managing those feelings?

User: I sometimes take deep breaths or step outside for a moment, but it doesn’t always calm me down.

Consultant: Those are effective techniques! How about we explore some other methods together? We could discuss mindfulness exercises or even planning short breaks to refresh your mind during busy moments. Would that interest you?

User: Yes, I think that sounds really helpful! Mindfulness could be a good path to explore.

Consultant: Fantastic! Mindfulness can provide tools to help you stay grounded during stressful periods. Let’s plan to practice some simple mindfulness activities together then. How does that sound?

User: That sounds wonderful. I’m excited to learn more.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! We can set a plan for our next session to introduce some mindfulness practices. Before we close today, is there anything else on your mind that you’d like to discuss?

User: I think we’ve covered a lot today. I feel really positive about the direction I’m heading.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Let’s plan our future sessions around your goals. Remember, you’ve made remarkable progress. I’m confident that you can continue on this path. If you need support, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you! I appreciate all the help and feel hopeful for the future.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Take care and see you next time!
