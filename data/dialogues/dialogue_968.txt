Consultant: Hi there, Xiao Zhe! I'm really glad you decided to come in today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hello. Honestly, I've been feeling really terrified of school. I haven't gone for the past two weeks because I think everyone will laugh at me.

Consultant: It sounds really tough. Your fear of being laughed at must be very overwhelming. Can you tell me more about what happened in chemistry class that made you feel this way?

User: During the class, the teacher called on me, and my mind went completely blank. I was so anxious that I felt like I couldn't breathe, and I just wanted to run away.

Consultant: That sounds like a really intense experience for you. It’s understandable to feel anxious after something like that. What else have you been feeling since then?

User: I just feel so stressed out thinking about going back. My heart races, and I start sweating just thinking about it. I don't know how to face my classmates again.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel anxious when faced with such situations. Your body is reacting strongly, which is quite common when we feel threatened. What do you think would help you feel a bit better about returning to school?

User: I just want to not feel so anxious and maybe be able to get through the classes without freaking out.

Consultant: That’s a great goal! Let’s explore what anxiety is a bit more. Anxiety can sometimes distort our thoughts and make us think the worst is going to happen. What thoughts go through your mind when you think about going back to school?

User: I keep thinking that everyone is judging me or that I'll embarrass myself again.

Consultant: Those are very understandable thoughts, but let’s look at them closer. How likely do you think it is that everyone will judge you harshly if you have a slip-up?

User: I guess it’s probably not as bad as I think, but it still feels very real to me.

Consultant: It makes sense that it feels very real; when we are anxious, our minds often exaggerate the threats. What if we tried to challenge that thought a bit? If you were to give advice to a friend in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably tell them to just try their best and not worry too much about what others think.

Consultant: That's really insightful! If you could adopt that same perspective for yourself, how might it change things for you?

User: I guess it might help me feel less pressure. But I still feel so much pressure from my mom to succeed.

Consultant: That pressure can be really heavy. Can you share a bit about how that affects you? 

User: I feel like I'm letting her down if I don’t do well, and it makes the anxiety worse.

Consultant: Feelings of guilt can amplify stress, especially when there's added pressure from loved ones. What would it look like to start reducing that pressure a little?

User: I think maybe if I could talk to her about how I feel, it might help.

Consultant: Opening up could certainly strengthen your relationship and ease some of that weight you feel. What are some steps you could take to approach that conversation with her?

User: I could write down what I want to say and maybe even practice it first.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical approach! Practicing what you want to say can make you feel more confident. Is there a specific time you think would be best to have that conversation?

User: Probably after dinner when she’s in a good mood.

Consultant: That’s a good idea. Making sure you both feel comfortable is important. When you think about this conversation, how does it make you feel?

User: I still feel a bit scared, but maybe also a little hopeful that she’ll understand.

Consultant: Hope is an important feeling to hold onto. We can also work on some techniques you can use to manage that anxiety when it comes up. Would you like to try some simple breathing exercises together?

User: Yeah, I think that could help.

Consultant: Great! Let’s try this together. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and exhale through your mouth for a count of four. Ready? Let’s do it together three times.

User: *breathes in deeply* Okay, that feels a little better.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Breathing exercises can be very helpful when you feel anxiety creeping in. Along with this, do you think you can think of one positive thought about yourself or a situation at school that could help you feel a bit better?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that I’ve done well in the past, like during exams.

Consultant: That’s an excellent thought to hold onto! Reminding yourself of your past successes can really help ease anxiety. As we wrap up today, what will you take away from this session to help you moving forward?

User: I think I’ll try to practice talking to my mom and using the breathing exercises when I feel anxious.

Consultant: That sounds really positive. As you move forward, remember that it’s okay to reach out for help, and I’m here for you if you need support. Let’s plan to check in again soon. You’re doing great, and I believe you can manage this!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhe! I'm glad you're here for our session today. I'd like to start by understanding how you've been feeling recently, especially with everything going on at home and school.

User: Hi. I've just been feeling really overwhelmed, especially with my mom constantly pressuring me about school. I haven't even been going to school for the past two weeks. I just feel so guilty and like I've let her down.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy burden of guilt and pressure from your mom's expectations. Can you tell me more about what’s been happening with her and your feelings towards school?

User: Well, every time I try to talk to her about not wanting to go back, she just yells at me. It’s like she doesn’t understand how hard it is for me. I’m scared of failing and disappointing her even more.

Consultant: I hear you, Xiaozhe. It must be very difficult to feel both scared and pressured at home. Can we explore what specific thoughts you have when you think about going back to school? What runs through your mind?

User: I keep thinking that everyone at school will judge me and that I won't be able to catch up. It feels like I’m stuck and that I’ll always be behind.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. Let’s try to break this down a bit. When you think that everyone will judge you, what emotion does that bring up for you? 

User: Mostly, I feel anxious and a bit hopeless. I just don’t see how I can ever get back on track.

Consultant: It's okay to feel anxious and hopeless, especially in a situation that feels overwhelming. Let’s reflect on this thought for a moment. How much evidence do you have that people at school are actually judging you? Can you think of any experiences that might suggest otherwise?

User: I mean, I don't really know for sure. I just assume they will because I haven't been there. Maybe I’m just overthinking it?

Consultant: It sounds like your mind might be jumping to conclusions without having all the facts. Sometimes, our fears can distort how we see a situation. If a friend of yours was in your shoes, what advice would you give them about facing school again?

User: I guess I'd tell them to just go back and see how it goes, maybe it won't be as bad as they expect. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight! You recognized that the actual experience might not match the fear. What if we created a plan for you to face this gradual return to school? It could help reduce some of that anxiety you're feeling.

User: Yeah, I’d like that. But what if I really can’t do it?

Consultant: It’s perfectly fine to feel uncertain. Let’s think of it as taking small steps. How about we outline a few manageable tasks that could help prepare you for going back, like reaching out to a friend first or visiting the school briefly? 

User: That sounds possible. Maybe I can just check in with a friend.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Connecting with a friend can help you feel less isolated. Once you’ve had that small interaction, how do you think that might impact your feeling about going back to school?

User: I think it might make me feel a bit more comfortable and less alone in this.

Consultant: Exactly! Knowing that someone is there can help ease your anxiety. How do you feel about trying to reach out to your friend this week?

User: I think I will try. I really don’t want to stay stuck like this forever. 

Consultant: That’s a positive attitude, Xiaozhe. Let’s also talk about how you can manage your feelings with your mom when she brings up school. Have you thought about how you might express your feelings to her?

User: I want to tell her it’s hard for me, but I’m afraid she won't understand and will just get angry again.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel hesitant, especially if past conversations haven’t gone well. We could think of ways to express your feelings calmly and honestly, so it might help her understand what you’re going through. How does that sound?

User: That might help. Maybe if I explain it better, she’ll get it.

Consultant: That's a constructive approach. We can work on some phrases you could use to communicate how you're feeling. Would that be helpful for you?

User: Yes, I think so. I just need some help figuring out what to say.

Consultant: Let's start with a simple sentence. You might say something like, "Mom, I know you want the best for me, but I’m feeling really anxious about school." How does that sound to you?

User: I could say that. I just hope she will listen.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re willing to try. If she doesn’t respond the way you hope, remember that it’s okay to take a step back and revisit the conversation later. Your feelings are important, and communication is a skill we can build together.

User: Yeah, I guess it’s okay to try again later if it doesn’t work out.

Consultant: Absolutely. It’s about making progress, not perfection. As we work together, we’ll keep identifying ways to improve how you feel, both at home with your mom and when it comes to school.

User: I’d really like that. I just want to feel less stressed and more confident again.

Consultant: That’s our goal! Let’s keep working on building your confidence and reducing your stress. Before we meet again, try reaching out to your friend and think about how to express your feelings to your mom. How does that feel for our next steps?

User: That feels good. I’m hopeful I can do this. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, you’re not alone in this process. We’ll tackle it together. If you encounter any challenges along the way, we can address them in our next session. 

User: Thank you. I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaozhe. I look forward to hearing how things go, and remember to be kind to yourself during this time. See you in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhe! I'm really glad to see you today. I know it's been a challenging time for you lately. How are you feeling about your studies and everything else?

User: Hi. To be honest, I've been feeling pretty overwhelmed. I haven’t been able to go to school for two weeks now, and I just can’t concentrate. It’s like I’m stuck.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiaozhe. Feeling stuck can be very frustrating, especially with everything happening in your life. Can you share more about what specifically has been making it hard for you to concentrate?

User: Well, I keep thinking about how I haven’t been able to keep up with my classmates. Then, when I try to study, my mind goes blank, and I feel like I’m failing.

Consultant: I see. It’s understandable to feel that way, given the expectations you feel from your mom and the pressure of falling behind. Can you tell me more about what thoughts come to your mind when you think about your studies?

User: I often think that I’m not smart enough or that I’ll never catch up. It just makes me feel like giving up.

Consultant: Those thoughts must be really heavy to carry. It seems like you’re dealing with a lot of self-doubt and fear of failure. Let's work together to challenge some of those thoughts. What evidence do you have that you aren’t smart enough or that you can’t catch up?

User: I guess I don't really have any proof. It’s just how I feel. When I look at my grades, they make me anxious.

Consultant: It's a common reaction to focus on grades, but they don't define your abilities. If a friend was feeling this way about their grades, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably say that grades aren’t everything and that they should keep trying. 

Consultant: Exactly! You have the wisdom to support others, which means you can also use that same kindness toward yourself. Let's try to replace some of those negative thoughts with positive ones. What would a more balanced thought be regarding your studies?

User: Maybe instead of thinking I'm failing, I could think that I'm just facing a tough time and I can improve with effort? 

Consultant: That’s a great shift in perspective, Xiaozhe! Focusing on improvement rather than failure opens up room for growth. Let’s set some small, achievable goals for you to gradually work on. What’s one small study goal you could set for yourself this week?

User: Maybe I could try to study for just 20 minutes a day? 

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a manageable goal. Focusing on short bursts can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed. How do you feel about that plan?

User: I think it feels doable. I haven’t tried studying at all lately, but this seems more manageable.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Remember, it’s important to celebrate those small successes. They’ll help build your confidence. How about we also think of some activities you enjoy, which can make studying more fun for you?

User: I like drawing and playing games. Maybe I could use drawing as a way to illustrate what I study?

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! It can help you engage with the material in a more creative way. Let’s combine drawing with your study goal. You can illustrate key concepts for those 20 minutes. 

User: Yeah, that sounds fun! I might actually look forward to studying if I can do that.

Consultant: Absolutely! Changing your approach can make a big difference. How do you feel about starting this plan over the next few days?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful, to be honest. It’s nice to have something to look forward to, and it gives me a bit of structure.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiaozhe! It's key to have a plan and structure, especially during challenging times. Remember to check in with yourself during this process. How do you think your relationship with your mom might improve as you start to follow this plan?

User: I think if I can show her that I'm trying, she might be less critical and more supportive.

Consultant: That sounds like an insightful connection. Building that trust through your efforts could help improve your relationship. Can you share how you might communicate your plans to her?

User: I could tell her that I’m working on a study routine and that I want to show her my drawings. Maybe she’d get excited about it.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Sharing your progress can foster a more encouraging environment. As we wrap up today, what’s one key takeaway you want to remember from our session?

User: I think it’s that it’s okay to take small steps and that I shouldn’t wear myself out trying to meet expectations all at once.

Consultant: Absolutely! Small steps are powerful. You showed great insight today, and I’m proud of you for opening up about your feelings. Let’s continue to build on this in our next session. How do you feel about our time together today?

User: I feel relieved and a bit motivated. I’m looking forward to getting back to studying.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! I'm excited for you. Remember, you can always return if you need support. Take care, Xiaozhe, and I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Zhe! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better about my relationship with my mother. We've had some positive talks lately, but I still feel confused about school and my studies.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that your relationship with your mother has improved. That must be a relief for you. Can you share more about what specifically confuses you regarding school?

User: Well, I haven't been going to school for the past two weeks, and I'm worried about how I'll catch up. I feel overwhelmed just thinking about it.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed after being away from school for a while. What would help you feel more comfortable about returning to school? 

User: I think if I had a plan for what to do when I get back, it might ease my worries. But I still dread facing my classmates after being gone.

Consultant: Having a plan sounds like a great idea! It could give you a sense of control and direction. How do you envision that plan looking?

User: Maybe I could start by talking to my teachers about catching up on missed work, and also reach out to a friend for support.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Connecting with your teachers and friends might really help. What thoughts come to mind when you imagine taking these steps?

User: I feel a bit anxious about talking to my teachers. What if they are upset with me for missing school? 

Consultant: It's natural to feel anxious about that. But remember, teachers usually care about their students' well-being and may understand your situation. What evidence do you have that might counter that worry?

User: Well, my teachers have always been nice, and they've tried to help me when I struggled in the past.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a good observation. It seems like you might be underestimating their understanding. What if you approached them with a positive attitude about your willingness to catch up?

User: I think I could do that. It might make things feel less stressful. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic approach! Focusing on your willingness to improve can shift the narrative to something more positive. How do you feel about setting small goals for your schoolwork once you return?

User: Setting small goals seems less intimidating. I could focus on one subject at a time.

Consultant: Great! By breaking it down, you can make the process more manageable. What would be your first small goal for your studies? 

User: I think my first goal could be to review the notes from the subjects I missed during the two weeks.

Consultant: That sounds very achievable! How do you think you'll feel after reaching that goal?

User: I think it would give me some confidence back. I could feel less anxious about returning if I know I’m catching up.

Consultant: Exactly! That sense of achievement can significantly help in building your confidence. What other small activities could you incorporate to keep yourself motivated as you transition back to school?

User: Maybe I could also set a routine for studying at home to help me get back into the groove.

Consultant: A routine is a fantastic idea! It will help create a sense of normalcy. How about starting with a short study block each day? 

User: Yes, starting with just 30 minutes of studying each day sounds manageable.

Consultant: Perfect! Consistency is key. It’ll help re-establish your study habits while easing you back. Besides studying, how else can you boost your motivation?

User: I could reward myself with something enjoyable after I complete my study sessions, like watching a show or drawing.

Consultant: That’s an excellent way to reinforce your motivation! Positive reinforcement can help you associate studying with enjoyment. How do you feel about trying this strategy?

User: I’m excited to try that! It makes studying sound less like a chore and more enjoyable.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. How are you feeling about going back to school after our discussion today?

User: I feel a mixture of nervousness and excitement, but more confident about facing it now. I think I can manage it.

Consultant: That’s a positive outlook, Xiao Zhe! It's perfectly normal to feel both nervous and excited. What will you do to remind yourself of this confidence when you return to school?

User: I could write down my goals and keep them with me as a reminder of what I've achieved and what I want to accomplish.

Consultant: That's an insightful idea! Keeping your goals visible can help guide you through any challenging moments. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the strategies and plans we discussed?

User: I feel optimistic and motivated! I believe I can face the challenges ahead with these plans.

Consultant: I'm thrilled to hear that! You’ve shown a lot of growth today, and I believe you have the tools to navigate your return. Remember that you can always come back if you need more support. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help and guidance.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I wish you all the best on your return to school. Stay positive, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Zhe! It’s great to see you today. I know you’ve recently started going back to school, and I’m eager to hear about how that's been for you. How are you feeling about returning to class?

User: Hi! I’m feeling a bit nervous but also curious. It’s been a long time since I’ve been in that environment, so I’m not sure what to expect. But I’m hopeful I can manage.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s completely normal to feel both nervous and hopeful in such a situation. Can you tell me a little more about what you're looking forward to and what concerns you might have?

User: I’m looking forward to seeing my friends again and just being in school. But I worry that I won’t keep up with the lessons or that I’ll be overwhelmed again.

Consultant: Those feelings of excitement mixed with worry are very common, especially after a long break. Let’s explore that a bit. What do you think would help you to feel more confident about keeping up with the lessons?

User: Maybe if I can prepare a bit before classes, like reviewing some study materials. But still, there’s this fear that I might not remember anything.

Consultant: Preparation sounds like a solid strategy! A lot of students feel more at ease when they prepare ahead of time. What if we think of a small way you could review material that feels manageable instead of overwhelming?

User: I could start with just a few key topics, I guess. And maybe do short study sessions instead of trying to study everything at once.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical approach! Short study sessions can help reduce that feeling of being overwhelmed. How do you feel about setting a small goal for this week related to your studies?

User: I think I could aim to review one topic per day. That wouldn’t be too bad, I hope!

Consultant: That's a wonderful goal! Focusing on one topic each day allows you to ease back into your routine without pressure. How do you feel about actually following through on that plan?

User: I feel a little bit more optimistic about it. It’s manageable, and I can take a break after.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Balancing study with breaks can help keep your motivation high. Let’s also discuss your feelings about being in school. What’s your plan for interacting with your friends when you return?

User: I hope I can just say hi and catch up. But what if they ask why I was away for so long?

Consultant: It's understandable to be concerned about that. You could keep it simple. You might just say that you needed some time off, which is perfectly okay. How would that make you feel?

User: I think that could work. It sounds less stressful than making up a long story.

Consultant: Yes, it definitely is. Being honest while keeping it light can help ease any tension. If they ask more, you could choose to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. And remember, true friends will just be happy to see you back!

User: That makes sense! I just have to remind myself that they care more about seeing me than the details.

Consultant: Exactly! It's a good reminder. How do you feel about initiating some conversations when you’re back?

User: I think I can do that. Just starting with small talk could help. 

Consultant: That sounds like a strong plan! Small talks can be a great way to rebuild connections. Now, let’s talk about how you can reward yourself for reaching those small goals you’ve set. What’s something you enjoy that could serve as a little reward?

User: I really like playing video games. Maybe I could play a little after I finish studying for the day.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect reward! Enjoying something you love can give you extra motivation to study and spend time in school. How do you think you’ll feel once you start following through with these strategies?

User: I guess I’ll feel proud of myself for sticking to my plan, and it might help reduce my anxiety.

Consultant: Absolutely! Acknowledging your achievements, no matter how small, is important. It builds confidence and can help you manage anxiety. Let’s reflect on our discussion today. What do you think are the key points you've taken away?

User: I think setting small goals, preparing ahead of time, and talking to friends will definitely help. 

Consultant: Those are excellent takeaways! It seems like you’re starting to build a solid plan. Remember, it's okay to feel nervous as you transition back. It’s all part of the journey. 

User: Thanks! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiao Zhe! I’m here to support you. Just remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. When we meet next time, let’s discuss how your week went and any other feelings that arose. You’ve got this!

User: I will. I’m looking forward to it!

Consultant: I look forward to hearing about your experiences! Remember, this is a journey, and every step counts. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhe! I'm really glad you could make it to our session today. It sounds like you've made some positive changes recently. How are you feeling about school and your interactions with classmates?

User: Hi! I’m feeling a bit more confident now. I’ve been going to school regularly and talking to my classmates. It feels nice to receive some positive feedback from my mom too.

Consultant: That's great to hear! You've been making progress in your school life and social interactions, which is a wonderful accomplishment. How do you think these changes are impacting your overall self-esteem?

User: I think it helps a lot. I feel happier when I’m at school and I enjoy talking with my friends. It's a nice change from how I felt a while ago.

Consultant: It's wonderful to see that you're experiencing happiness and enjoying your time with friends. What specific situations at school do you find most enjoyable or fulfilling?

User: I really enjoy group activities in class, like projects. Working with others makes me feel part of something. I also like lunch breaks when I can chat with my friends.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic way to connect with your peers! Engaging in group activities can really help reinforce your social skills. What do you think you can do to continue building on this positive experience?

User: Maybe I could try to initiate conversations more often, or suggest some fun activities to do during breaks. I want to be more outgoing.

Consultant: That's a great idea, Xiaozhe! Initiating conversations and suggesting activities can really help you feel more connected to your classmates. What kind of activities do you think you would enjoy proposing?

User: Maybe a game or a study group. Something that brings us together. I think it would be fun!

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful approach! Games and study groups can strengthen friendships and make school more enjoyable. What steps could you take to propose these ideas to your classmates?

User: I could talk to a few friends first and see if they’re interested. If they are, I could suggest it to the whole class.

Consultant: Excellent plan! Choosing a few friends to discuss it with first can help you gather support. How do you think you will feel after proposing these ideas?

User: I think I’d feel proud of myself. It would be nice to take the lead on something.

Consultant: Feeling proud is an important part of building your confidence! Taking the lead is a big step forward. If you encounter any challenges while suggesting your ideas, what might you do?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay if everyone doesn't say yes. I just need to keep trying.

Consultant: That's a healthy mindset! Recognizing that not every suggestion will be accepted is part of the process, and it won't define your self-worth. How can I support you in reinforcing this new assertiveness?

User: Maybe we could practice how to approach my friends about it so I feel more prepared.

Consultant: That's a great idea! We can role-play that conversation. How would you like to start the discussion with your friends?

User: I might say something like, “Hey! I was thinking we could do a fun game during lunch. What do you think?”

Consultant: That’s a solid opening! It sounds friendly and inclusive. If your friends respond positively, what’s your next step?

User: I’d ask them what games they like and see if they have any ideas for when we could do it.

Consultant: Perfect! That keeps the conversation flowing and shows you value their input. How likely do you think your friends would be to participate in this activity?

User: I think they’d be open to it. We usually enjoy games together.

Consultant: That's encouraging! Having that shared interest can strengthen the bond. As you continue to communicate with your friends, what do you believe you’ll learn from this experience?

User: I think I’ll learn to be more confident and maybe discover more about what my friends like too.

Consultant: That's a valuable takeaway! Gaining confidence while learning about your friends will enrich your friendships. As you embark on this journey, are there any concerns or worries you’d like to address before we wrap up today?

User: I’m a little worried that if I suggest something and it doesn’t go well, I might feel embarrassed.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way. Remember, every experience gives you an opportunity to learn. What can you remind yourself of in those moments to help you cope with potential embarrassment?

User: I could remind myself that it’s just one moment and that it doesn’t define who I am.

Consultant: That's a healthy perspective, Xiaozhe. You're more than just one moment or experience. As we conclude today’s session, what actions are you committed to taking before our next meeting?

User: I’ll try to speak with my friends about the game and maybe plan something for next week.

Consultant: That sounds fantastic! I believe you can do it. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember, you have the skills and courage to take these steps. Thank you for sharing today!

User: Thank you! I feel more ready to take action now. See you next time!
