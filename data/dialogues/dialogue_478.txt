Consultant: Hi Jimmy, it's good to see you again. I'm here to help you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, things have been pretty rough. I’m really angry about not getting that housing allowance, which just keeps me stuck on the streets. It’s so frustrating!

Consultant: I can see that this situation has been incredibly upsetting for you. Feeling stuck and angry is a natural reaction to such a tough circumstance. Can you share a bit more about what specifically has been bothering you the most?

User: Just the thought of being unable to secure a stable place. I thought the single room would be a turning point, but now it feels like a dream that just slipped away.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It sounds like the opportunity felt very promising, and when it didn’t work out, it shattered your hopes a bit. How does this situation affect your daily life right now?

User: It makes everything harder. I can’t focus on anything else; I get so worked up that I end up drinking to numb the pain, which isn’t helping at all.

Consultant: It’s tough to cope with such feelings, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It seems like alcohol is a way you try to escape the anger and frustration. Have you noticed any other feelings that come up when you think about your living situation?

User: I just feel hopeless sometimes. I don’t know how I can get out of this cycle. I keep thinking about how I’ll never find a proper place to live.

Consultant: Those feelings of hopelessness can be really overwhelming. It’s like a loop of negative thoughts. Can we explore what goes through your mind when you start feeling that way?

User: I just think I’ll always be without a home. I see others getting help, and it makes me feel even worse about myself.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re comparing your situation to others, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy. What evidence do you have to support the belief that you will always be without a home?

User: I mean, I’ve been homeless for a while now. It feels like all I can expect is to stay in this rut.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern given your experience, but it’s important to remember this doesn’t have to define your future. What would it look like for you to challenge that belief?

User: I guess it would mean thinking that there’s still a chance for improvement. But it’s hard to accept that when things keep going wrong.

Consultant: Absolutely, it's challenging to shift your mindset when you’ve faced repeated setbacks. What if we brainstormed together some small, actionable steps to help you feel more in control of your circumstances?

User: I could think about trying to get in touch with social services again, but I’m just not sure they can help me.

Consultant: Reaching out could be a good starting point, and you might be surprised by the resources available. What if you wrote down a list of potential contacts or services? Would that help?

User: Yeah, I could try that. But what if I get rejected again? That would hurt.

Consultant: That’s a real concern, and rejection can be disheartening. Remember, even if one contact doesn’t work out, it doesn’t mean that all hope is lost. What would you tell a friend in your shoes who fears rejection?

User: I would probably tell them to keep trying and not give up. It’s just easier said than done.

Consultant: True, it can be much easier to advise others than to follow our own advice. How about setting a goal for the week to reach out to just one resource and see what happens?

User: Okay, I can do that. It feels less daunting thinking about just one contact.

Consultant: That’s a great approach, Jimmy. It’s all about taking small steps. How can you prepare yourself emotionally for this outreach?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that I’m worthy of help and that it’s okay to ask for it.

Consultant: That’s a powerful reminder. You deserve support and help. Do you feel ready to take this step, and how might you celebrate it afterward, no matter the outcome?

User: I could treat myself to my favorite meal afterward. It might help me feel good about trying, regardless of the result.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Treating yourself is a great way to acknowledge your efforts. Let’s check in next time about how this step went and how you felt about it.

User: I’ll do my best. Thanks for helping me think this through. It gives me a bit of hope.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. We're working together to find those paths to a better quality of life. I look forward to hearing how it goes next time.

User: Thanks again for your support. I'll talk to you then.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Jimmy. Take care until next time, and good luck with your plan!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jimmy! Welcome to our session today. I’m really glad you’re here. To start off, could you share with me how you’ve been feeling lately and what has been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been struggling a lot. I used to have some hope of finding a place to live, but lately, with all the barriers I face in getting benefits, I feel more lost and disappointed. It's like I'm stuck in a hole that I can’t climb out of.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling quite trapped and it’s deeply affecting your emotions. Let’s explore this further. Can you tell me more about the specific barriers you’ve encountered that are making you feel this way?

User: Well, I’ve applied for benefits multiple times, but it seems like I keep running into the same issues. They require so many documents and I don’t know where to find them. When I think about it, it’s just overwhelming.

Consultant: I see how daunting that can be. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when faced with so many requirements. Among these challenges, what thoughts come to your mind? Are there any particular beliefs about your situation that make it feel even harder?

User: I guess I think I’m just not cut out for this life anymore. Sometimes it feels like I don’t deserve to have a stable home or support. Like, why would anyone want to help me after everything I’ve been through?

Consultant: That’s a really heavy thought, Jimmy. It sounds like you’ve been carrying a lot of self-doubt and feelings of unworthiness. Let’s dig into that a bit. What evidence do you have that supports the belief that you don’t deserve help or a stable home?

User: I mean, I made a lot of mistakes in the past. My drinking, the time I spent locked up, it all feels like a huge stain on my life. So it makes sense to me that no one would want to help me.

Consultant: It’s really important to acknowledge your past and the struggles you’ve faced. However, let’s also reflect on whether everyone is defined by their mistakes. If you were to advise a friend in a similar situation, what would you tell them about deserving support and a second chance?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone deserves help, no matter what they’ve done. But it’s hard to apply that to myself.

Consultant: Absolutely, and it’s a common struggle to separate the self from the past. What if we try to reframe those thoughts? Instead of focusing solely on your past actions, what strengths or lessons have come from your experiences that you can carry forward?

User: I’ve learned to rely on myself more, and I’ve also seen how hard it is to get back on your feet. I know I can help others in similar situations, I guess that means I’ve grown a little.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! Recognizing your growth shows resilience. Now, let’s focus on actionable steps. What small things could you do to reach out for help, considering your current strengths?

User: Maybe I could start speaking to local organizations that help with housing. It’s just that I feel nervous about asking for assistance again.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel nervous about that. Let’s break it down to make it more manageable. What if you made a list of organizations? You could approach them one at a time, focusing on just gathering information first, instead of asking for help right away.

User: That sounds doable. I could handle just finding information first without the pressure. 

Consultant: Great! And how would you feel after taking that step? Would it make you feel more empowered or less anxious?

User: I think it would feel good, like I’m taking control of my situation again. 

Consultant: Exactly! Taking small steps can help you regain that sense of control. Let’s talk about the support systems you have. Do you know people you could reach out to for encouragement during this process?

User: Not really. I’ve been quite isolated lately. 

Consultant: Isolation can make things feel even tougher. Would you be willing to explore re-establishing contact with a friend, family member, or support group? Having someone by your side might lighten that load.

User: I suppose I could try contacting an old friend. We used to help each other out during tough times.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step forward! It could also help you build a support network again. What might be your next steps after reaching out to your friend?

User: I guess I could speak about my situation and see if they might know of any resources too. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Opening up the conversation could lead to more ideas and potential help. Speaking of resources, we can think about local organizations together that might assist you. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. It feels less daunting when we break it down.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks can help reduce anxiety. As we start looking for those resources, remember to celebrate any progress you make, no matter how small.

User: I will try to keep that in mind. It’s just that I often feel like my progress is too slow.

Consultant: Slow progress is still progress, Jimmy. Each step you take—no matter the size—leads you toward your goal of stability. Let’s keep focusing on those steps together. How have you been feeling about the plans we discussed so far?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful, but there’s still some doubt lingering. 

Consultant: That’s completely normal. Allowing space for doubt while embracing hope is a part of this journey. What can we do to help reinforce that feeling of hope as you move forward?

User: Maybe I can set little goals for myself and keep track of them, like I used to do.

Consultant: Setting small goals is a great idea! Tracking them can give you a visual reminder of your achievements and progress. Which goal would you want to start with first?

User: I think I’ll start with reaching out to that friend today. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid first step, Jimmy. I believe that reaching out will help you feel connected again. Let’s summarize what we’ve talked about and set a plan for our next session. How are you feeling about our discussions today?

User: I feel cautiously optimistic. There’s a sense of direction now, and I’m willing to take action.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! I’m proud of the steps you’re willing to take. In our next session, let’s discuss how your outreach went and review any resources we find together. Remember, I'm here to support you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and understanding. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Jimmy! It's been a pleasure to work with you today. Keep that optimism alive, and I look forward to hearing about your progress. Take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hi Jimmy, it's great to see you again! I'm looking forward to continuing our work together. How are you feeling about everything going on in your life right now?

User: Hi. I feel like I'm on the right track with trying to understand community support projects. But I still have some doubts about whether they can really help me live independently.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel cautious, especially when considering new support systems. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts or feelings come up when you think about these community support projects?

User: I guess I worry that they might not live up to my expectations or that I won’t be able to stick with it. I sometimes think maybe I'm just fooling myself thinking I can really change my situation.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be tough to deal with. It seems like you might be having some negative beliefs about your ability to change your situation. Let’s take a moment to explore that. What is it that makes you feel like you might not be able to change?

User: It’s just that I’ve tried before, and it never really worked out. I ended up drinking again and back in the same old rut. I'm afraid of failing again.

Consultant: I hear you, Jimmy. It sounds like you've experienced some setbacks that make it hard to stay hopeful. But let’s pause and consider: what evidence is there that you can’t succeed this time? Have there been any small steps forward recently that might show growth?

User: Well, I have been going to some meetings and starting to talk with people about my situation. I guess that is a step... but I still feel like I’m waiting for something to happen.

Consultant: That’s a meaningful step, Jimmy! Attending meetings and engaging with others is significant. It's important to recognize those actions. What do you feel about setting smaller, achievable goals to keep you moving forward? 

User: Setting smaller goals sounds good, but I'm not sure what those would be. I just don't want to get too ambitious and end up disappointed.

Consultant: That’s completely fair. How about we brainstorm together what some realistic, smaller steps could look like? For instance, could you think about setting a goal around attending one meeting a week or reaching out to someone for support?

User: I could try attending one meeting a week. That seems doable. But again, I keep thinking about what if I can’t stick with it.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. What if we explore that fear a bit? What would happen if you missed a meeting or didn't meet your goal for some reason? How might you respond to yourself in that situation?

User: I guess I’d feel guilty or like I’m letting myself down. But maybe I could remind myself that it’s okay to stumble sometimes. It's part of the process, right?

Consultant: Absolutely, Jimmy! Remembering that setbacks are part of change is crucial. It’s kind of like learning to walk—you might fall a few times, but it’s how you get back up that matters. How can we remind you of this when you feel those doubts creeping in?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal of my thoughts and feelings each week? That way, I can see my progress and remind myself that improvement isn't always linear.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Keeping a journal can help you track your journey and reflect on both your successes and the areas where you’re struggling. How do you feel about starting this journal by the next time we meet?

User: I think I could try that. It might help me stay focused on my goals and realize that there are ups and downs.

Consultant: Great! Also, have you thought more about any additional support resources, like community programs or other people you might want to connect with?

User: I have. There are a few local programs that I heard about, and I’d like to find out more. I guess learning about them could be another goal.

Consultant: Definitely. Researching those programs and understanding what they offer can really empower you. How about scheduling some time over the next week to explore those options?

User: Yes, I could set aside some time to do that. I feel like taking these steps makes me feel more in control.

Consultant: That's a powerful feeling, Jimmy! Taking control of these aspects of your life can be incredibly empowering. As you explore these resources, how do you see yourself feeling as you continue to make progress?

User: I hope to feel more confident and maybe even proud of myself for making those efforts. 

Consultant: Absolutely! It's important to celebrate the progress you make. As we wrap up today, let's reflect on what you've gained from our session. What feels most valuable to you right now?

User: I think understanding that it's okay to have setbacks and realizing that I can take small steps forward makes me feel more hopeful. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Always remember, every small step counts. As we finish today, think about how you can maintain this motivation and keep reminding yourself of your progress. 

User: I will. Thank you for helping me see things in a different light!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Jimmy! Remember, it’s a journey, and I’m here to support you. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello Jimmy! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more hopeful lately. I'm participating in the recovery support group, and I’ve started to drink less. It feels good to be doing something positive.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant step forward, Jimmy! Engaging in the support group can be really beneficial. What changes have you noticed in your daily life since you started drinking less?

User: I feel a bit clearer mentally and more motivated to take care of myself. It’s still a struggle sometimes, but I’m trying to stay focused on my goals.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re feeling clearer and motivated! Staying focused on your goals is important. What are some specific goals you’re working towards right now?

User: I really want to get my own place to live. Right now, I'm just staying at a temporary shelter, and I want something more stable.

Consultant: Housing stability is a crucial goal, and it's fantastic that you’re actively pursuing it. What steps have you taken so far to work towards that goal of having your own place?

User: I’ve been looking for job opportunities and trying to save some money. I know that having a stable income will help me find a place of my own.

Consultant: That’s a solid approach! Finding a job will certainly contribute to your stability. How do you feel about your job search? Is it going well for you?

User: I’ve applied to a few places, but I haven’t heard back yet. Sometimes, I get anxious about whether I’ll be able to find work.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel anxious, especially when you’re waiting for responses. Can you tell me more about what thoughts go through your mind when you feel anxious about the job search?

User: I often think that I won't be good enough or that no one will want to hire me because of my past. It’s discouraging.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy to carry. It might be helpful to challenge those beliefs. Can we explore some evidence for and against those thoughts? For instance, what strengths do you bring to a potential job role?

User: I’ve got a lot of experience in manual labor, and I’ve learned a lot about teamwork in my previous jobs. I just doubt that they’ll look past my history.

Consultant: Those are substantial strengths! Teamwork and experience are highly valued in many jobs. What would you tell a friend if they shared similar doubts about their past affecting their job search?

User: I’d probably remind them that everyone has a past and that it doesn’t define their future. They just need a chance to show what they can do.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective! You deserve to give yourself that same kindness. It’s about what you can bring to the table now. How can we reinforce that positive mindset as you continue your search?

User: Maybe I can keep reminding myself of my strengths and try to see rejection as part of the process rather than a reflection of my worth.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reframing rejection as part of the journey can lessen the sting of anxiety. Would you like to come up with some affirmations or positive self-talk phrases to support you during this process?

User: Yes, I think that would help! Maybe something like, "My past doesn’t define my future. I am capable and worthy."

Consultant: That’s an excellent affirmation! Having such reminders can help counter negative thoughts. As you proceed, how can you take action steps towards applying that mindset?

User: I could keep applying to jobs and remind myself to focus on what I can do rather than what might hold me back.

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive plan! Taking small actions will gradually build your confidence. Would it also help to set up a timeline for your job applications?

User: Yes, setting a schedule for applying would help me stay on track, instead of waiting around for responses.

Consultant: A timeline can provide structure and keep momentum. How often do you feel you could reasonably apply for jobs?

User: Maybe I can aim for a few applications each week. That feels doable for me.

Consultant: Great! A few applications each week sounds manageable. You could also track your progress, which can provide a sense of accomplishment. How do you feel about that?

User: I like that idea. Seeing my progress might help keep my spirits up.

Consultant: Exactly! Tracking your progress can reinforce your efforts. How about we reflect on what accomplishments or milestones you can celebrate, no matter how small, as you move forward?

User: I could celebrate when I apply for jobs, or when I get responses back, even if they aren’t job offers. Just staying engaged is an achievement.

Consultant: Celebrating those small victories can be a fantastic way to maintain motivation. With your dedication to self-improvement, I believe you will reach your goals. How are you feeling about our session today?

User: I feel more hopeful and prepared to tackle my job search now. Thank you for helping me see things differently!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Jimmy! It’s great to see your optimism. As we wrap up, do you have any thoughts on how you’ll take today's insights into the coming week?

User: I’ll keep reminding myself of my strengths and stick to my job application schedule. I want to keep building on the progress I’ve made.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Remember, you’re capable of achieving your goals. Take care, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jimmy! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty stable, actually. Getting the transitional housing gave me a sense of hope. I’m excited about the idea of living independently.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It sounds like you're feeling more positive and motivated. What specific plans or steps are you thinking about to maintain this sense of stability as you work towards independence?

User: Well, I want to create a routine for myself. I’ve been thinking about setting up a daily schedule, but I’m not sure where to start.

Consultant: Establishing a routine is a great step. What activities do you feel are most important to include in your daily schedule?

User: I think I should include things like finding a job, working on my personal goals, and maybe some time for relaxation too. But sometimes I feel overwhelmed by it all.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when you’re trying to put everything together. Let’s break things down. Can you identify which of these activities feels the most manageable to start with?

User: I believe looking for a job is a priority. But I worry about the rejection or what happens if I don’t find one right away.

Consultant: That’s a common concern, Jimmy. It might help to remember that job searching can be a process, often with ups and downs. What could be a realistic goal for your job search in the short term?

User: Maybe I could set a goal to apply for a few jobs each week. That doesn’t sound too overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan! Breaking it down to a few applications each week makes it more manageable. How do you think you might feel after you complete those applications?

User: I guess it would give me a sense of accomplishment, even if I don’t get a response right away.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on the action of applying rather than just the outcome can keep you motivated. What other habits or routines could support you while you're job hunting?

User: I want to make sure I stick to some physical activity and maybe continue with some hobbies like reading. I think they keep my mind clear.

Consultant: Incorporating physical activity and hobbies is an excellent idea. What type of physical activity do you enjoy, and how often would you like to include it in your routine?

User: I used to like walking and even tried some light jogging. I think I could aim for a few times a week.

Consultant: Walking or jogging a few times a week can be very beneficial for your mental and physical health! How about we outline a basic weekly plan, including your job applications, physical activity, and time for hobbies?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful! I think I can visualize it better with a plan. Maybe I could start with three days for job applications, two days for physical activity, and set aside time for reading.

Consultant: That sounds like a balanced schedule. How might you feel when you’re able to follow through on this plan?

User: I think it would make me feel productive and keep me focused on my goals, which is what I want.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset to have! Staying focused on your goals will support your journey towards independence. If you face any challenges implementing your plan, how will you address them?

User: Maybe I could talk to someone or even write down my feelings about it. I know that might help me process any setbacks.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Writing down your feelings can help you work through challenges and keep track of your progress. It's about staying connected with your emotions as you navigate this change. 

User: Right, just thinking about these things makes them feel more manageable.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. With this plan, you are taking proactive steps towards your goals. Do you feel ready to start implementing your routine?

User: Yes, I feel more prepared now. I’m ready to put it into action!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Just remember that consistent small steps can lead to significant changes over time. How do you want to check in on your progress in the next session?

User: I think I could update you on how my routine is going and see if any issues come up that I need help with.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. You have a good sense of what you want to achieve, and I’m here to support you through that process. 

User: Thanks! I really appreciate your help in organizing my thoughts on this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Jimmy! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize what you’ve accomplished in this time together.

User: I’ve got a clearer plan for job hunting, along with incorporating physical activity and hobbies into my daily routine.

Consultant: That’s right! You have laid a solid foundation for your independence. Remember to be kind to yourself as you navigate this journey. You’re making positive changes, and that’s something to celebrate!

User: I will, thank you! I feel more optimistic about the future.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! Keep that optimism, and I look forward to our next conversation. If anything comes up, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care, Jimmy!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jimmy! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been doing pretty well, actually. I've got some stability in my short-term housing, and it feels good. I’m starting to think about long-term goals now.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step! It's great to hear about the stability you've found. Can you share what these long-term goals look like for you?

User: Honestly, I’m considering getting my own place and perhaps improving my job situation. I want to be independent and build a sustainable life.

Consultant: Independence and stability sound important to you, and it's wonderful that you're thinking about them. What do you see as the first step toward achieving that independence?

User: I guess I need to find a job that can support me enough to pay rent. I’ve had a few part-time gigs, but nothing steady.

Consultant: Securing a stable job is a crucial step. How do you feel about your current job prospects? Are there any specific roles or fields you’re interested in?

User: I’ve been looking at job listings, mainly in the food industry since that’s what I know. But I feel a bit uncertain about applying. It might bring back some stress.

Consultant: It makes sense to feel a bit anxious about applying for jobs, especially in a field you're familiar with. Could you describe what kind of stress you've experienced in the past related to job applications?

User: I think it's mostly fear of rejection. I’ve been turned down a lot in the past, and it kind of built up this worry that I'm not good enough.

Consultant: That fear of rejection can be difficult to manage. It sounds like those experiences linger with you. How do you think this fear affects your confidence in applying for jobs now?

User: It definitely makes me hesitant. Sometimes, I just want to avoid the whole process. But I know if I don't try, I won't get anywhere.

Consultant: You're showing insight into your feelings, which is a great start. Let’s try to challenge that fear together. What evidence do you have that reflects your abilities and strengths that could counter that feeling of not being good enough?

User: Well, I have skills from my past jobs, and I did receive positive feedback from colleagues and customers. I guess I have just focused too much on the negatives lately.

Consultant: It’s encouraging that you recognize the positive feedback you’ve received. Those skills are still with you, and they can contribute to your success. How could you remind yourself of these strengths when you feel doubt creeping in?

User: Maybe I could keep a list of those positive experiences and feedback. It might help me see things from a different perspective.

Consultant: That's a constructive idea, Jimmy! Having a visual reminder can be really powerful. How about we create a small action plan together to help you tackle your job applications? 

User: Yeah, I like that! I could start with the list, and then maybe reach out for help with my resume.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid starting point. Setting manageable goals will help you feel less overwhelmed. When do you plan to start working on your list?

User: I think I can start today. I’ll dedicate some time to it tonight.

Consultant: Fantastic! Committing to take that first step tonight is a great move. How about we discuss how you'll feel once you complete that list?

User: I think I’ll feel a sense of accomplishment, which could motivate me to continue.

Consultant: Absolutely! Feeling accomplished is vital for building momentum. Once you complete that list, you'll have a tool to boost your confidence when you start applying. 

User: I hope so. I really want to move forward with my life.

Consultant: Given the progress you've made so far – the stability you've created for yourself – I believe you can continue moving forward. What other supports can you put in place as you take these steps?

User: I guess I could talk to friends or anyone in my support network. They might help me stay accountable.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Sharing your goals with supportive friends can provide you that extra push to stay accountable. How can you communicate your plans to them?

User: I could invite them over and let them know how I'm feeling and what I'm planning. It's good to have their support.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan, Jimmy. Involving your support network will help you feel more connected as you go forward. 

User: Yeah, it really will. I feel good about talking to them.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You're making significant strides towards your goals. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel you’ve gained from our conversation?

User: I feel like I have actionable steps to take and that I’m not alone in this. I’ve also remembered my strengths.

Consultant: That's excellent to hear! Remembering your strengths is key to overcoming challenges. What’s your main takeaway for the future?

User: To keep reminding myself of the positives and to reach out for support when I’m feeling low.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway, Jimmy. I'm proud of the progress you've made. Just keep taking those small steps, and you’re heading in the right direction. 

User: Thank you so much. This really helped!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm here to support you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!
