Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you're here today. Before we dive in, I’d like to hear about how you’ve been feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. Lately, I feel really down, especially after that big exam where my performance was poor. I can’t shake off this feeling that my teachers don’t really care about me or my efforts.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of disappointment and concern about being overlooked. Can you tell me a little more about how you felt after that exam?

User: I just felt so embarrassed. I didn’t do well at all, and now I’m worried that my classmates will judge me. I’m afraid I won't be taken seriously.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel embarrassed, especially when you hold yourself to high standards. You mentioned feeling afraid of judgment from your classmates. Can you share what specific thoughts were running through your mind during that time?

User: I kept thinking that if my teachers don’t value my work, then my classmates probably won’t either. It makes me feel like I don’t matter.

Consultant: That’s a heavy thought to carry, Li. It seems you equate your teachers’ attention to your worth. How does this thought affect your emotions and actions at school?

User: It makes me anxious about going to school. I often feel like hiding or just not showing up at all because I’m scared of encountering that feeling of being ignored.

Consultant: I see how that can lead to avoidance. Let’s explore this more. What evidence do you have that your teachers don’t value your efforts? Is there anything that contradicts that thought?

User: Well, sometimes they do acknowledge others, and I feel like I’m just not in the spotlight. But I guess I haven’t reached out to them directly either.

Consultant: It’s good that you're recognizing that. Sometimes, when we feel overlooked, it gets easy to assume that it’s about our own worth. How about we consider the possibility that your teachers might not be aware of your feelings? 

User: That could be true. I haven’t really talked to them about how I feel.

Consultant: Would you be open to exploring how you could communicate your feelings to them? It might help you gain a different perspective on their support.

User: I think I could try that. But I’m still scared they won’t care.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. However, what if they actually appreciated your efforts? What would that look like for you?

User: I guess it would make me feel validated and more confident about my place in class. But I can’t help but think the worst.

Consultant: It's natural to worry about the worst-case scenario, but let’s challenge that thinking. If a friend were in your shoes, how might you encourage them to think about the situation differently?

User: I’d probably tell them that teachers have a lot of students and they can’t focus on everyone all the time. It's not always personal.

Consultant: That’s an excellent perspective! Can you try applying that same understanding to yourself? 

User: Yeah, I see how I’m being quite hard on myself. Maybe my feelings of being ignored aren’t as personal as I think.

Consultant: Exactly! Let’s explore some of the actions you can take. Are there small steps you could take to engage more with your teachers, even if it feels uncomfortable?

User: Maybe I could ask for feedback on my work next time. That could open up a conversation.

Consultant: That sounds like a great approach! By initiating a conversation, you not only show your willingness to improve but also give them a chance to support you. 

User: I really want to do that. But I’m still anxious about it.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel anxious, but remember, it's a step toward overcoming the feelings that hold you back. How can we plan to manage that anxiety when you decide to reach out?

User: Maybe I could practice what I want to say beforehand and remind myself it’s okay to ask for help.

Consultant: Practicing sounds like a solid strategy! Keeping those reminders nearby can boost your confidence. Let’s also think about some affirmations you can tell yourself before speaking to your teachers.

User: Affirmations? How would that work?

Consultant: Affirmations are positive statements that encourage self-belief. You might say, “I deserve attention and support” or “My efforts matter.” Would that be something you'd be willing to try?

User: That makes sense. I think I can do that.

Consultant: Wonderful! As we begin to wrap up today, let’s take a moment to reflect on what has been most helpful for you. What insights or tools do you feel you can carry forward?

User: I think recognizing that my self-worth isn’t dependent on teacher’s acknowledgment is crucial. Also, speaking up could really help improve my situation.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve made significant insights today. If you find yourself feeling down or anxious again, remember these strategies and affirmations. It’s all about taking small steps.

User: Thank you. I will try to remember that and work on these steps.

Consultant: I'm grateful you shared with me today, Li. You’re not alone in this, and you’re already taking steps towards feeling better. If you ever feel like you need support, know that I’m here for you. 

User: I appreciate it. I feel a bit lighter after talking. 

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to our next session together!

Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling lately, especially with your studies and upcoming exams?

User: Hi. I've been quite anxious, to be honest. No matter how hard I try, I still feel like I'm not performing well in class. It’s really wearing on me.

Consultant: I understand how overwhelming it can feel when you’re putting in effort but not seeing the results you hope for. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts or feelings come up when you think about your performance?

User: I guess I just keep thinking that others are doing much better than I am. I often tell myself, “I’m not good enough” or “I will never succeed.” 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound pretty heavy. It seems like you’re struggling with feelings of not being good enough. How do those thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: They make me feel really anxious and sometimes even a bit hopeless. When I start to study, I get this knot in my stomach, and I can't focus.

Consultant: It sounds like your thoughts about not being good enough are leading to significant anxiety and impacting your ability to study. Have you ever noticed any patterns in your thinking during these moments? For example, are there times when your thoughts seem particularly extreme or unrealistic?

User: Yeah, I think I tend to exaggerate how poorly I'm doing. I only focus on my mistakes instead of the things I do well. 

Consultant: That’s a crucial insight! Recognizing that tendency to focus on mistakes can help us shift the way you view your performance. What do you think could be an alternative way to think about your efforts and achievements?

User: Maybe instead of thinking “I’m not good enough,” I could remind myself that I’ve made progress, even if it’s small. 

Consultant: Exactly! Acknowledging your progress is an important step. Let’s explore this together. Can you list a few achievements or improvements you’ve made in your studies recently, no matter how small they may seem?

User: Well, I did manage to improve my math score a bit last month, and I’ve been studying a little more consistently.

Consultant: Those are great examples, Li! Celebrating those small wins can help change the narrative in your mind. How might this shift in perspective impact your feelings about studying for the upcoming exams?

User: I think it might help ease my anxiety a bit. If I focus on my progress, I might feel less pressure to be perfect.

Consultant: That sounds like a promising approach! We can practice this mindset. What kind of goals do you think you could set for your study sessions that are achievable and aligned with this new perspective?

User: Maybe I could aim to study for just 30 minutes each day, rather than try to cover everything at once. 

Consultant: Setting a smaller, manageable goal like that is an excellent idea! It can make studying feel less daunting and help you build confidence. How do you feel about creating a study schedule with this in mind?

User: I think that would be really helpful! Having a plan might help me stick to it without feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: Great! A structured plan can provide clarity and reduce anxiety. Let’s outline a simple study schedule together, considering your exam subjects and the time you have available. Which subjects do you feel you need the most focus on?

User: I really need to concentrate on math and science.

Consultant: Got it! Let’s allocate specific times for each subject during the week. How many days do you want to study math and science?

User: I could study math three days and science two days a week.

Consultant: Perfect! So, how about this: you could study math on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and focus on science on Tuesday and Thursday. How does that sound?

User: That sounds doable. I feel like I can handle that.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As you begin to follow this plan, remember to check in with your feelings. If you notice anxiety creeping up, what strategies could you use to address it?

User: I could take some deep breaths or remind myself of the progress I've made.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Incorporating breathing exercises and positive affirmations can be very helpful. How confident do you feel about implementing this study plan and techniques?

User: I feel more confident now. I think having this plan will really help me.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Li! Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s okay to have ups and downs. As our session comes to an end, let's talk about how you're feeling about everything we discussed today.

User: I feel relieved, honestly. I think I have some tools now to manage my anxiety better.

Consultant: I'm thrilled to hear that! You've made significant progress by acknowledging your thoughts and setting achievable goals. As we move forward, what would be your main takeaway from today’s session?

User: I think my main takeaway is to focus on my progress and to set smaller goals to manage my anxiety.

Consultant: Absolutely! Those are key strategies to continue using. Remember, you're capable of more than you realize. If you ever need to talk again, don’t hesitate to reach out. I wish you the best of luck with your studies!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: Hello, Lee! I'm glad you could make it for our session today. How have you been feeling lately, especially with your recent exam experience?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious since I got my exam results back. I didn't do well, and it makes me worry about my future performance. I can't shake the feeling that I will always disappoint myself.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like the recent exam has really affected your confidence. Let’s talk about that. What specific thoughts or images come to your mind when you think about that disappointing result? 

User: I keep thinking about how my friends did so much better than me. I feel like I am letting my parents down because they have high expectations for me. I think maybe I'm not smart enough.

Consultant: It's really tough when you compare yourself to others, especially friends who might seem to have everything figured out. You mentioned feeling like you're not smart enough. Can you identify what evidence supports that thought? 

User: I guess I don’t have much evidence. It’s just a feeling. But I worry that if I don’t do well next time, I’ll be right about not being smart enough.

Consultant: That’s a common fear, but challenging that thought can be helpful. If a friend were in your shoes, hearing the same thought, what would you tell them? 

User: I’d probably say that exams don’t define someone’s intelligence, and that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses.

Consultant: Exactly! You know, it’s important to recognize that one exam doesn’t define your abilities. Let’s reframe that thought together. Instead of “I’m not smart enough,” could we say something like, “I’m learning and growing, and this is just one part of my journey”? 

User: I guess that sounds better. It’s just hard to believe sometimes when I feel upset about grades.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way, especially when you’re under pressure. So, during times of anxiety or disappointment, practicing self-talk can be very powerful. Would you be open to exploring a self-talk strategy that could help you manage these feelings?

User: Sure, I’d like to know more about that. 

Consultant: Great! One simple technique is to use positive affirmations. When you start feeling anxious, you can say to yourself, “I am capable of improving,” or “This is just a temporary setback.” Would you be willing to try using something like that in your daily routine? 

User: Yes, I can try that. I think it might help me calm down a bit.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! Another technique we can work on together is mindfulness breathing. This can help you ground yourself when the anxiety kicks in. Have you ever tried any breathing exercises before?

User: I haven't really tried any specific breathing exercises, but I've heard of them. I’m curious to learn.

Consultant: Perfect! Let's practice a simple one together. You can take a deep breath in for a count of four, hold it for a moment, and then exhale slowly for a count of six. This helps activate your body's relaxation response. Would you like to try that now?

User: That sounds good! I’ll give it a try.

Consultant: Let’s do it together. Deep breath in... and hold... now slowly exhale… How do you feel after that?

User: I feel slightly better, but I’m still worried about the future.

Consultant: I understand that concern. The fear of future performance can be overwhelming. It’s important to shift the focus from performance to progress. Instead of thinking about how well you’ll do, think about what steps you can take to prepare. What are some small steps you could take in your study routine that would make you feel more confident?

User: I think I could make a study schedule and stick to it more consistently. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Having a schedule can provide structure and help ease anxiety. How about we set a goal for you to create a study schedule by our next session? 

User: Yes, I could do that. I think I’d feel more in control if I have a plan.

Consultant: Absolutely, having a plan will help! It's about doing what you can rather than stressing over factors you can't control. Remember, setbacks happen to everyone. What’s important is how you respond to them. 

User: That makes sense. I guess I need to be kinder to myself.

Consultant: Definitely! Being compassionate towards yourself, especially during tough times, is crucial. In our next session, we can review your study schedule and how these strategies have been working for you. 

User: I’m looking forward to it. I hope I can stick to it and feel better about my studies.

Consultant: I believe you can. You’re learning these new skills and making progress. Just remember, it's okay to feel disappointed at times. What matters is how you move forward from here. 

User: Yes, I understand. I appreciate your support and advice!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Lee. It’s been great working with you today. You're taking important steps to address your concerns, and that’s commendable. I look forward to our next session! 

User: Thank you! I’ll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you could join me today. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I’ve been a bit disappointed with myself. The other day at that school event, I just couldn't perform the way I wanted to. I felt too nervous.

Consultant: I see. It must be tough to deal with that disappointment. What do you think triggered your nerves during the event?

User: I think I was worried about being judged by my classmates. I wanted to show my abilities, but instead, I froze up.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Feeling anxious about others’ perceptions can be overwhelming. What did you do to cope when you noticed the anxiety starting to build up at the event?

User: Honestly, I didn’t do much. I just kept thinking about how I was messing up, which made it worse. 

Consultant: That's a common reaction. Sometimes our thoughts can spiral in a way that increases our anxiety. If you had to identify any specific thoughts that came to mind during that moment, what would they be?

User: I kept telling myself that I would embarrass myself in front of everyone, that I was going to fail.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite intense. It seems they impacted your performance. How do you think those thoughts made you feel emotionally in that moment?

User: They made me feel really anxious and discouraged, like I wasn’t good enough.

Consultant: It sounds like that was a difficult experience for you, feeling both anxious and discouraged. What if we explored a different way to approach those thoughts next time? How would that sound to you?

User: I guess it might help. I really want to avoid feeling like that again.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset. One technique we could use is to challenge those negative thoughts. For instance, what evidence do you have that those thoughts about embarrassing yourself are true?

User: Well, I don’t have direct evidence. It’s just what I fear will happen.

Consultant: Exactly. Many times, our fears are based on assumptions rather than facts. If a friend were in your shoes, what might you say to reassure them?

User: I would tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay to not be perfect.

Consultant: That’s very supportive of you! Now, how might you start incorporating that kind of reassurance into your own self-talk next time you face a similar situation?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to mess up and that I can learn from it.

Consultant: Absolutely! Learning from experiences is key. Let’s practice a scenario together where you think you might feel anxious in public again. How does that sound?

User: Okay, I’m willing to try.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you're giving a short speech in front of your class. How do you feel as you approach that situation?

User: I feel nervous just thinking about it.

Consultant: That's a natural feeling. Let’s break it down step by step. What’s the first thing you would do when you get to the front?

User: I guess I would take a deep breath to calm myself.

Consultant: Perfect. Taking deep breaths can help ground you. What would you tell yourself right before you start speaking?

User: I might say something like, ‘Just do your best, it’s okay to be nervous.’

Consultant: That’s a wonderful affirmation! Let’s say you begin speaking and you feel nervous. What could you do to mitigate that during your speech?

User: Maybe I could focus on one or two friendly faces in the audience instead of thinking about everyone.

Consultant: Excellent strategy! Connecting with friendly faces can help alleviate a lot of pressure. Now, let’s talk about what you might say during your speech. What would be a topic you feel comfortable discussing?

User: Perhaps I could talk about my favorite hobbies or interests.

Consultant: That sounds like a great choice, as you are more likely to be passionate about those topics. How do you feel about preparing a few key points to share about that topic?

User: It makes me feel a bit more confident. I can handle talking about things I like.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more confident thinking about speaking on topics you enjoy. How about we create a small outline together for that speech?

User: Sure, I think that would help me a lot.

Consultant: Let’s start with your introduction. What’s one thing you would like your classmates to know about your hobby?

User: I want them to know why I love it so much—it really helps me relax.

Consultant: Great! That's a personal touch that can engage your audience. Remember, people appreciate authenticity. How do you feel about your ability to share that now?

User: I feel a bit better. I can see how sharing something personal makes it easier.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing personal experiences can create a connection. As we wrap up today, what strategies do you feel you’d want to implement moving forward?

User: I want to practice talking about my hobbies and reminding myself that it’s okay to be nervous.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Li. Remember to be kind to yourself during the process. You’re making positive steps forward. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel more hopeful and ready to try new things. Thank you!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You've made significant progress. Keep practicing, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello Li! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit nervous, but I'm also excited about the group activities I've been involved in at school. It's still challenging for me, but I feel a sense of accomplishment after completing tasks with my team.

Consultant: That's great to hear that you've been participating in group activities! It's completely normal to feel nervous, especially when facing new challenges. Can you tell me more about what these group tasks have been like for you, and how you feel during and after these activities?

User: Well, during the activities, I tend to feel anxious, worrying that I might not perform well. But afterwards, when I see that we worked well together, it makes me feel proud of what we've accomplished as a team.

Consultant: It sounds like there's a blend of anxiety during the tasks and pride afterwards. That’s a significant shift! What do you think contributes to your anxiety while you're working with the group?

User: I think it's the fear of letting others down or not meeting their expectations. I don't want to seem weak or incapable in front of my peers.

Consultant: I can understand how that would create pressure. It’s important to remember that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. Have you noticed if any particular thoughts or beliefs contribute to that feeling of fear during these tasks?

User: Yes, I often tell myself that I have to be perfect, or I feel like I'm not good enough. It just adds to my anxiety, especially when I’m trying to keep up with others.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization. The belief that you need to be perfect can create a lot of unnecessary pressure. Let's explore this thought a bit—how true do you think it is that you need to be perfect to be valued by your peers?

User: I guess it's not entirely true. I see my friends make mistakes too, and they’re still appreciated. But I still feel that pressure.

Consultant: Exactly, and it's completely natural to have those thoughts. Let’s think about a time when you faced a challenge but still felt accepted by your team. What was that experience like?

User: There was this group project where I messed up my part, but my teammates were supportive and offered help. I felt a little embarrassed, but the support made me feel better.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful example! It sounds like your team valued your presence regardless of any imperfections. How can you remind yourself of that experience when you begin to feel anxious about being perfect in future group activities?

User: I could think about how my teammates supported me and that it’s more important to work together than to be perfect.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Recognizing the value of collaboration can reduce some of that pressure for you. Additionally, let’s talk about ways to handle your anxiety during these tasks. What are some techniques you might be able to use to calm yourself when you start feeling tense?

User: Maybe I could take a few deep breaths or remind myself to focus on the task at hand instead of worrying about others' opinions.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a fantastic technique! It can help ground you and lessen the anxiety. Would you like to practice a brief mindfulness exercise now to see how it feels?

User: Yes, I would like that!

Consultant: Great! Let's take a moment to sit comfortably. Close your eyes if that feels okay, and take a deep breath in through your nose… hold it for a moment… and now slowly exhale through your mouth. How does that feel?

User: It feels calming. I can feel the tension easing a bit.

Consultant: Excellent! This kind of mindfulness can be very beneficial during group activities. Keeping that sense of calm can enhance your focus on collaboration rather than perfection. How do you feel about trying this technique in your next group activity?

User: I think I can do that. It sounds really helpful.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! It's all about taking small steps to build your confidence. Let’s also set a goal for your next group activity. Would it be to practice mindfulness and focus on the team rather than on being perfect?

User: Yes, that sounds good! I want to try to enjoy the experience and focus more on working together.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, Li! Enjoying the experience can be so rewarding. Let’s also recap some of the progress you’ve made. What do you think has changed about how you approach these group activities since our first session?

User: I feel a bit more open to participating, and I understand that I can rely on my teammates for support. It’s not all on me.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing the strength within a team is a significant shift in mindset. As we conclude today’s session, what strategies do you plan to carry forward into future activities?

User: I want to keep reminding myself about teamwork and using breathing techniques to manage my anxiety.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies to bring with you! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. If you ever feel overwhelmed, you can always come back and share your experiences. Keep embracing these challenges, and I look forward to hearing how it goes next time!

User: Thank you! I feel more prepared and confident now. I'm looking forward to trying these out.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Take care until we speak again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling after your recent successes in your exams?

User: Hi, I'm feeling really good! I was quite surprised by how well I did. The praise from my teacher has made me more confident and optimistic about my studies.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like the recognition has positively impacted your self-esteem. Can you share more about how this change in your mood is affecting your daily life and academic routine?

User: Well, I find myself studying more efficiently now. I used to procrastinate a lot, but now I feel more motivated and am able to focus better. It's a nice change compared to before.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re feeling more motivated and focused. This shift can really help in maintaining your progress. Are there specific strategies or routines you've adopted that have contributed to this improvement?

User: I’ve started creating a more structured study schedule, which helps me stay on track. Also, I’ve been setting small goals each day, and achieving them feels rewarding.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Setting small, achievable goals can really enhance your productivity and give you a sense of accomplishment. How do you feel when you reach these small goals?

User: I feel proud of myself. It gives me a boost of confidence, and I'm becoming more positive about my abilities. However, sometimes I still worry about upcoming challenges.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel worried about future challenges, especially when you’re used to experiencing anxiety. What specific challenges are you worried about right now?

User: I’m a little anxious about maintaining my grades and how I’ll perform in future exams. I don’t want to let my teacher or myself down.

Consultant: That’s understandable. You’ve worked hard to achieve this level of success, and it’s normal to want to keep it up. Let’s explore how we can manage that anxiety about future performance. What thoughts come to your mind when you think about those upcoming challenges?

User: I often think that if I don't do well, it’ll prove that I’m not as capable as I thought. That makes me feel really anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like you're placing a lot of pressure on yourself with those thoughts. Can we challenge that idea a bit? What evidence do you have that not doing well would mean you’re not capable?

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence for that. I mean, I did well in the recent exam, so I should trust that I can do it again.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve already demonstrated your capability. It’s important to acknowledge your successes rather than focus solely on the possibility of failure. How can you remind yourself of this when those anxious thoughts come back?

User: I could keep a journal of my achievements and positive feedback. Reading that could help me remember that I'm capable during tough times.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! A journal can serve as a reminder of your strengths and successes. How do you feel about incorporating that into your routine?

User: I think it would help a lot. It’ll be nice to have something tangible to refer to when I feel anxious.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It seems like you’re on the right track. As we begin to wrap up our session today, let’s summarize some of the positive changes you’ve experienced and the strategies we’ve discussed.

User: Sure! I’ve improved my study routine and built more confidence through small goals. I’ll start a journal to document my achievements.

Consultant: Those are fantastic takeaways! It’s clear that you’ve made significant progress. As you move forward, what are some ways you can continue to build on this momentum to maintain your mental well-being?

User: I think I’ll keep setting small goals, and I want to practice positive self-talk. I also want to ensure I take breaks during my study sessions to avoid burnout.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies to prevent burnout and promote balance. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. How do you feel about our sessions and the progress you've made thus far?

User: I feel very positive! This has helped me clarify my thoughts and strategies. I believe I’m better equipped to handle future challenges.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Li! You’ve come a long way in this process. As we conclude our sessions, always remember that it’s key to stay connected with your achievements and utilize the strategies we've discussed. If you ever need support again, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help throughout this process. I’ll keep everything in mind.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of the growth you’ve shown. Take care of yourself, and remember to celebrate your achievements. Goodbye for now!

User: Goodbye!
