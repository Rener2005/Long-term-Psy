Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling pretty lost. After breaking up with Li, I can't stop thinking about our relationship, and I'm starting to feel really frustrated about it.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like this breakup has had a significant impact on you. Can you tell me more about what specifically frustrates you the most about the situation?

User: Well, I just feel a lot of anger and disappointment. It seems like every time I think about him or our relationship, I just get overwhelmed with negative emotions.

Consultant: That makes sense. It is completely normal to feel a mix of emotions after a breakup, especially when there were good times involved. What thoughts come to your mind when you reflect on your relationship with Li?

User: I often think that maybe I should have done something differently, that if I had acted better, we might still be together. 

Consultant: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry. It’s easy to fall into the trap of blaming ourselves for things that may not be within our control. Can you identify any specific thoughts that crop up repeatedly when you feel this way?

User: I keep thinking that I messed it all up. It's like this voice in my head tells me I'm not good enough and that I'll never find someone else.

Consultant: I hear you—it sounds like those thoughts are quite harsh. Let's explore those feelings a bit. What evidence do you have that supports this voice in your head?

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence. It's more like a feeling. Since the breakup, I’ve been struggling to connect with anyone else, which makes me think I'm not worthy of a good relationship.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way given what you’re going through. What if we challenge that thought? If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their worth in relationships?

User: I would tell them they're worthy and deserving of happiness. That just because one relationship didn't work out, doesn't mean they won't find someone better.

Consultant: Exactly! You have the capacity to see worthiness in others. Let's try to apply that same kindness to yourself. How might changing that perspective help improve your feelings?

User: I guess it would lighten the pressure I feel. I’d like to feel more positive about my chances in the future instead of just feeling defeated.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful insight! Let's think about some steps you can take to actively shift your mindset into a more positive direction. What small action could you take this week to practice self-kindness?

User: Maybe I could focus on doing things I enjoy, like painting or spending time with friends, to remind myself that there are other joys in life.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Engaging in activities you love can help improve your mood and create positive experiences. How do you feel about incorporating some of these activities into your week?

User: I feel hopeful! It’s nice to think about doing things that make me happy again.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about taking small steps toward feeling better. As you engage in these activities, notice how your mood shifts and your thoughts change. How do you envision your interactions with others moving forward?

User: I hope I can be more open and less guarded. I don't want to shut myself off from others because of this pain.

Consultant: That's a healthy mindset! Allowing yourself to be open can lead to new connections and experiences. It might feel uncomfortable at first, but it’s part of healing. Are there specific situations where you’d like to practice this openness?

User: I think I’ll try reconnecting with some friends I haven’t talked to in a while. Maybe that will help break the cycle of feeling isolated.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Reaching out can help build support and remind you that you’re not alone. What feelings or thoughts do you expect might come up as you reconnect with them?

User: I think I’ll feel a mix of excitement and anxiety. I worry they might not understand what I’m going through.

Consultant: Those feelings are completely valid. It’s natural to feel nervous about reconnecting. But remember, true friends are there to support you. Do you have any specific strategies in mind to manage that anxiety when you reach out?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to be vulnerable and that they likely want to support me.

Consultant: Absolutely! Being vulnerable can foster deeper connections. Besides that, what else can you do to manage any anxiety that might come up during those conversations?

User: Maybe I could take deep breaths before I talk to them, just to calm my nerves.

Consultant: Great strategy! Taking a moment to breathe can really help ground you. As we wrap up today, I want to encourage you to practice these strategies and be gentle with yourself as you move through this process. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate the support. I feel a little lighter after sharing all of this.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m glad to hear you’re feeling lighter. Remember, it’s a journey, and I’m here to support you whenever you need. Before we end, what are your thoughts on our conversation today?

User: I feel like I have a clearer head. I’m more aware of how I’m thinking about the breakup and how to handle it moving forward.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You’ve made significant progress today. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care of yourself until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang. Welcome back to our session. It’s nice to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite uneasy, especially when I run into Li. Those encounters still bring back a lot of feelings, and I find myself overthinking our past relationship. I really hope to figure out how to manage these emotions better.

Consultant: It sounds like those encounters with Li are really stirring up a lot for you right now. Can you tell me more about what specifically happens during those moments that makes you feel uneasy?

User: Well, when I see him, I feel this rush of anxiety. I start remembering the good moments we had, but then I also feel really disappointed with how things turned out. It’s confusing; I wish I could just move on.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. It's normal to have mixed feelings after a relationship ends, especially if you still have contact with the person. What do you notice in your thoughts or feelings when you start to remember those good moments?

User: I start thinking that maybe things could have been different or that I might miss out on something great. Then I feel really sad and frustrated because it’s in the past but it still feels so present.

Consultant: It's understandable to have those thoughts—that desire to want things to be different can be really powerful. Let’s try to identify some of those automatic thoughts you're experiencing. Can you share a specific thought that comes up for you during those moments?

User: I often think, "I should have tried harder to make it work,” or “I'll never find someone like him.” Those thoughts make me feel hopeless.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Those thoughts seem very heavy. It's essential to recognize how they affect your feelings of hopelessness. Do you notice any patterns in how this thinking affects your day-to-day life or your interactions with others?

User: Yeah, I find myself avoiding social gatherings because I don’t want to feel the same way around other guys. I feel like I won’t be able to trust them or enjoy myself.

Consultant: It sounds like these thoughts are leading you to avoid situations that could actually help you build new connections, which can be isolating. Let’s explore those thoughts further. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts those thoughts, like "I'll never find someone like him"?

User: I guess I don't really have any strong evidence for that. There have been times I've clicked with other people, but I just focus on those negative thoughts.

Consultant: It’s great that you can recognize that. Perhaps we can replace that thought with something more balanced. What would a more balanced perspective sound like regarding the possibility of finding someone new?

User: Maybe something like, “It’s possible I could meet someone else who makes me happy.” That feels better, but it’s hard to believe sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic reframe! Remember, it takes time to shift the way you think about things. You might want to practice repeating that new thought when you encounter reminders of your past. Now, let’s talk about some strategies you can use to manage those feelings and reduce the fear around future interactions. What activities do you enjoy that might help you feel more relaxed?

User: I like reading and sometimes painting, but I haven’t done much of that lately.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful outlets! Engaging in activities you enjoy can significantly help in reducing anxiety and improving your mood. How about we plan to incorporate some time for these activities into your week as a way to help you feel more grounded?

User: That sounds good! I think focusing on painting again could help distract me from those negative feelings.

Consultant: Excellent choice! Let’s also consider some gradual exposure strategies. Perhaps you can set small goals for engaging in social activities. Starting with less overwhelming situations could help you rebuild your confidence. Would you be open to trying that?

User: Yes, I think that would be a good idea. Even just meeting up with a friend for coffee sounds manageable.

Consultant: That’s a great small step forward! As you engage in these activities, it’s also essential to remind yourself of the positive feelings you gain from socializing. Let’s keep discussing these new social experiences in our next session. How do you feel about that plan?

User: I feel relieved to have a plan. It really helps to think about it this way rather than just focusing on the past.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Recognizing and addressing these feelings is a significant step forward. Before we wrap up, let’s summarize what we’ve covered today and what you’ll take away from our conversation.

User: I’ll focus on shifting my thoughts, incorporating painting and reading into my routine, and gradually engage more socially. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! You’re actively taking steps to create healthier thought patterns and build more positive experiences. Remember, it’s okay to take this process one step at a time. I believe you’re on the right path. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support and guidance.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Zhang! I’m here to help you. Looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately, especially regarding social activities and interactions with your classmates?

User: Hi! I've been trying to engage more in social activities, but I often feel uneasy around guys. I joined a student club recently, but I usually end up feeling on edge when there are male members around.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're making an effort to participate in social activities. Feeling uneasy around guys is understandable especially given your recent experiences. Could you share more about what specific thoughts or feelings come up when you're in these situations?

User: I often think that they might judge me or that something awkward will happen. It really makes me hesitate to approach or talk to them.

Consultant: That sounds challenging. It seems like these thoughts are making it difficult for you to connect with others. Let's explore these thoughts a bit more. When you think about being judged or experiencing awkwardness, how does that make you feel in the moment?

User: It makes me feel anxious and sometimes even embarrassed. I really want to feel more comfortable, but those thoughts keep looping in my mind.

Consultant: I understand that these feelings of anxiety and embarrassment are quite strong for you. It sounds like there's a connection between your thoughts and how you feel when interacting with others. Let's try to identify those thoughts more specifically. Can you recall a moment recently when you felt anxious around your classmates? What were you thinking at that time?

User: Yes, during a group project meeting, I noticed that I was the only girl among a few guys. I started thinking that they wouldn't take my ideas seriously just because of my gender.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. It seems like that thought led you to feel undervalued and anxious. Would you say that this is a common thought for you in those situations?

User: Yes, it often occurs, and it holds me back from speaking up or sharing my ideas.

Consultant: It sounds like this thought is quite powerful in shaping your experience. Let’s challenge it together. What evidence do you have that supports this idea that they wouldn’t take you seriously? Have there been moments where they did value your contributions?

User: I think they did listen to my ideas during the discussion, but I kept doubting myself and felt that I wasn’t as competent.

Consultant: It's interesting to note that there were moments you felt heard. Instead of focusing solely on doubts, how might you reframe those moments into something more positive? For instance, acknowledging your competence and contribution can shift your perspective.

User: I guess I could remind myself that I have valuable insights to offer and that they listened to me before. 

Consultant: Exactly! That's a great alternative thought. Let’s think about how you can practice this in future interactions. What might be a small step you could take to challenge that initial doubt next time you’re in a group?

User: Maybe I could prepare a few points in advance to feel more confident while speaking, and try to remind myself that they listen to everyone.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive strategy. Preparing your points can definitely help build your confidence. How do you feel about setting this as a goal for your next group meeting?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful about it! It makes me feel like I have some control over the situation.

Consultant: It’s fantastic to hear that you’re feeling more hopeful! Gaining a sense of control can change your approach significantly. Moving forward, can we also plan on addressing how to manage feelings of anxiety when they arise during these interactions?

User: Yes, that would be helpful. Sometimes, just being around them makes my heart race.

Consultant: That’s understandable. We can explore some relaxation techniques you could use before entering social situations, such as deep breathing exercises. Would you like to try a brief exercise right now to see how it feels?

User: Sure, that sounds good!

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment together. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold it for a moment, and then slowly exhale through your mouth. Let’s do this a couple of times. (Pause for a moment). How do you feel after that?

User: I feel a bit calmer, actually. That was nice!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! This could be a good tool for you to have in your back pocket when you start feeling anxious. As we wrap up today, I would love to hear how you're feeling overall about our discussion and the goals we've outlined.

User: I feel much better! It’s nice to voice my thoughts and feelings, and I think working on confidence will help me.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Zhang! Remember, it’s a process, and each small step counts. Before we finish, what will you take away from today's session that you can apply moving forward?

User: I will focus on preparing for group discussions and challenge my negative thoughts, like reminding myself that I can contribute.

Consultant: Excellent plan! I believe these strategies will help you build trust in yourself and others. Remember, this is a journey, and I’m here to support you. We can meet again to check in on your progress. You're making great strides, and I’m proud of you! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’ll definitely work on this!

Consultant: You're welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! It's wonderful to see you again. I hope you're doing well. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite good overall. Participating in group activities has been enjoyable, and I'm starting to feel more comfortable around my classmates, especially the guys. But I still have moments of resistance, especially with one classmate, Li.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive shift! It's great to hear that you're finding joy in group activities and becoming more comfortable. Could you tell me more about your feelings towards Li and the moments of resistance you’re experiencing?

User: Well, I think it's just that sometimes I feel like I don't know how to interact with him. I want to connect, but I worry he might not be interested in me. It makes me anxious.

Consultant: I see. So, you're experiencing anxiety about connecting with him, possibly stemming from concerns about his interest. Let's explore these feelings. What specific thoughts run through your mind when you think about interacting with him?

User: I often think that maybe he finds me boring or that I might embarrass myself if I try to talk to him. It’s frustrating because I don't want to feel this way.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite distressing. It can be tough when we assume what others think of us. Can we examine how often these thoughts occur and the feelings they bring up for you when you think them?

User: They come up pretty often. Whenever I see him, my heart races a bit, and I feel this tightness in my chest, like I just want to avoid the situation.

Consultant: That’s understandable; physical reactions to anxiety can be overwhelming. Let's take a closer look at one of those thoughts. You mentioned feeling boring. What evidence do you have to support that thought? Is there any evidence that contradicts it?

User: Well, I don’t really have any proof. Sometimes I can make people laugh or enjoy conversations, but I just feel like it might not be good enough when it comes to him.

Consultant: It sounds like your abilities to connect are valid and present. What if we consider treating your perception of him as an opportunity rather than a threat? How might that shift change your feelings?

User: If I think about it as an opportunity, I guess I could approach it as a chance to learn more about him instead of worrying about impressing him. That feels less scary.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on the opportunity can make it less daunting. How can you practice this shift in perspective during your next interaction with him?

User: I think I could prepare a few light topics to talk about. Just something casual to break the ice, like asking about our upcoming projects.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Preparing helps build confidence. What other steps could you take to ease the anxiety before and during your conversation with him?

User: Maybe I could take a few deep breaths before approaching him. Just to calm myself down. 

Consultant: Deep breathing is an excellent way to alleviate immediate anxiety. How do you feel about trying this during your next group activity?

User: I feel like it might help. I really want to give it a shot. 

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! As you engage with this new approach, pay attention to how it feels and what thoughts come up. Would you like to share how you felt after trying this in the next session?

User: Yes, I think that would be really helpful. I'd like to reflect on it.

Consultant: Perfect! Reflecting will help you notice your progress. Besides, strengthening your self-reflection skills is an important part of this journey. How about we also discuss any negative thoughts you might encounter during your interactions next time? 

User: That sounds good. I often think about the worst possible outcomes, which could be helpful to tackle.

Consultant: Exactly! Identifying and challenging those worst-case scenarios can empower you to face your fears. Lastly, let’s take a moment to celebrate your successes so far. How does it feel to know you’re becoming more involved and open with your surroundings?

User: It feels really rewarding! I’m proud of myself for trying to change.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Remember, reflection and acknowledging your progress are key in maintaining this growth. Keep up the great work, and I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time.

User: Thank you! I can’t wait to share my progress. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Zhang. Until next time, take care and continue to nurture this positive journey.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad to have you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi, it's great to be here. I've been feeling better, actually. After sharing with my peers, I feel more understood and supported. But I still struggle a bit with my feelings towards Li. 

Consultant: I'm happy to hear that you feel more supported! It’s perfectly normal to have mixed feelings about relationships. Can you tell me more about your feelings towards Li and what's been on your mind?

User: Well, I used to think our connection was strong, but lately, I feel confused and uncertain about where we stand. I worry a lot and it's hard to focus on anything else.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Zhang. Feeling uncertain in a relationship can create a lot of anxiety. What specific thoughts do you find yourself having about your connection with Li that contribute to your worry?

User: I often think that maybe he's not as interested in me as I thought. I constantly replay our conversations in my head and analyze every detail, trying to figure out what went wrong.

Consultant: It’s understandable to analyze those conversations when you're feeling uncertain. Sometimes, this kind of thinking can lead us to feel even more anxious. You mentioned that you worry he's not interested—how does that thought make you feel inside?

User: It makes me feel really insecure and upset. I start doubting myself and wonder if I can connect with anyone else like that again.

Consultant: I can see how that would affect your self-esteem. It’s common to feel insecure when we face potential rejection. Have you noticed any patterns in how this thought affects your behavior or mood?

User: Yes, I tend to avoid reaching out to him because I fear rejection. Then I feel even worse because I'm not taking any action, but I'm just so scared.

Consultant: Avoidance is a common response to fear, but it often leads to a cycle of increased anxiety. What if we explored some small steps you could take to break that cycle? 

User: That sounds helpful. I want to figure out how to manage my fears better so I can actually talk to him.

Consultant: Great! Let’s identify a small, manageable step you could take. Perhaps starting with a casual message to check in? What thoughts come to mind when you think about doing that?

User: I feel nervous just thinking about it! What if he doesn’t respond, or what if he responds negatively? 

Consultant: Those fears are common, but it might help to ask yourself how likely those outcomes really are. Can you think of any evidence that suggests he wouldn’t respond positively?

User: Well, he has responded before, and we had nice conversations initially. I guess I’m just focusing on the worst scenarios.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Focusing on potential negatives can distort our perception of reality. If you were to encourage a friend who felt this way, what would you tell them? 

User: I would tell them to not jump to conclusions and to consider the positive experiences they’ve had instead. 

Consultant: Exactly! You have a lot of experience and wisdom to draw from. How could you apply that same encouragement to yourself as you think about reaching out to Li?

User: Maybe I should remind myself of the good moments we’ve had and take a small step without overthinking it.

Consultant: Yes, take that approach! Remember that it’s okay to feel nervous, but taking action can also lead to clarity. How about setting a goal to send that message this week?

User: I think I could do that! Setting a goal sounds good, and I can try to focus on what I want to say positively.

Consultant: That's a fantastic plan! Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. How do you feel about the steps we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel more empowered. Talking through this makes me realize that I need to take the risk to know where we stand.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! You’re developing a healthier mindset toward relationships. As we wrap up, what’s one key takeaway you’d like to remember as you move forward?

User: I want to remember that my feelings are valid, but I shouldn't let fear control my actions. I will focus on taking positive steps.

Consultant: That’s a valuable takeaway, Zhang! As you continue to strengthen your confidence, keep reflecting on these feelings. You’ve made great progress. I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate the support and the strategies we talked about. I’ll work on them and see you next time!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and I’ll see you at our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! It's great to see you again for this session. I’m here to support you as we explore your journey further. How have you been since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling much more confident in social situations, which is great. I’ve been working on those study projects with my classmates and it’s been really rewarding. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made significant progress in your social interactions and your study projects. Can you tell me about the specific changes you've noticed in yourself?

User: I think I'm more comfortable initiating conversations and collaborating with others now. I used to feel nervous, especially around my classmates, but now I feel much more at ease.

Consultant: It’s impressive to see how your confidence has grown! Feeling at ease is such an essential part of building relationships. What strategies do you think have helped you most in this transformation?

User: I’ve been trying to focus on listening more and asking questions, rather than worrying about what to say next. It seems to help me connect better with others.

Consultant: That's a fantastic approach! Active listening can create a sense of connection that often disarms anxiety. Have there been any challenges you've faced recently while building these new connections, or do you feel things are going smoothly?

User: There have been a few instances where I felt uncertain about whether a conversation was going well. Sometimes, I worry if I'm saying the right things or if they find me interesting.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those moments of doubt. Often, we can be our own harshest critics. When you find yourself feeling uncertain, what thoughts cross your mind during those moments?

User: I usually think something like, “What if they think I’m boring?” or “Maybe I shouldn’t have said that.” Those negative thoughts just pop up.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Zhang. It sounds like you might be experiencing some automatic negative thoughts in those situations. Let’s explore them a bit more—how do these thoughts make you feel? 

User: They definitely make me feel anxious and a bit self-conscious, which isn't how I want to feel when I'm interacting with others. 

Consultant: That’s understandable. It’s helpful to recognize that these thoughts can impact your emotions and behavior. What are some alternative thoughts you might consider in those moments instead?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone has their moments of uncertainty, or that I'm here to connect and learn from each other, not to impress them. 

Consultant: Those are excellent alternative thoughts! Reframing your perspective can really change how you experience those conversations. How do you feel about testing those thoughts the next time you're unsure?

User: I think that would be a good idea! I can definitely try to remind myself of those points instead of spiraling into negativity.

Consultant: Great! Let’s also think about how to maintain this confidence moving forward. What activities or practices are you currently engaging in that help support your social confidence?

User: I’ve been joining study groups and participating in club events, which have been helpful. I enjoy being around others more than I used to.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Engaging in group activities can foster a supportive environment for growth. How about identifying one specific social challenge you might face in the near future, and we can come up with a plan to tackle it?

User: I have a group presentation coming up, and I’m a little anxious about presenting in front of everyone. 

Consultant: Presentations can be daunting, but you can handle this! What aspects of the presentation make you feel anxious? Is it the speaking part or the responses from the audience?

User: I think it’s a bit of both. I worry about forgetting what to say or not being able to answer questions they might have.

Consultant: Those concerns are common. How about we brainstorm some strategies to help you feel more prepared? 

User: Yes, I would appreciate that! I think practicing beforehand might help me feel more secure in what I want to say.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing can boost your confidence significantly. You might also consider preparing for potential questions by thinking about likely topics that might come up. 

User: That makes sense. I can write down key points and practice with a friend too.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! In addition to preparation, try to use some relaxation techniques before your presentation, such as deep breathing or visualization, to calm those nerves.

User: I will definitely give that a try! I feel more empowered to face this challenge now.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Let’s also take a moment to reflect on your progress during our sessions. How do you think you’ve grown overall?

User: I’ve become more aware of my thoughts and how they affect my feelings. I have strategies to counteract negativity, which really helps. 

Consultant: You’ve shown great awareness, and that’s a huge accomplishment! As we conclude our session, what are some strategies you plan to continue using moving forward?

User: I think I’ll keep practicing active listening and using my alternative thoughts whenever I feel anxious. I’ll also maintain my engagements in group activities. 

Consultant: Those sound like very effective strategies! Remember, you’ve learned a lot during our sessions, and using these techniques can help you maintain your positive mindset. 

User: Thank you for all your guidance. I feel ready to take on future challenges!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhang! I believe in your ability to manage your emotions and continue thriving. If you ever need support in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. Wishing you all the best!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate it. See you next time!
