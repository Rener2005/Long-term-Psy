Consultant: Hello, Graham! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious with some upcoming performances. The thought of forgetting my lines or freezing on stage is haunting me. It just feels overwhelming.

Consultant: I can see how those feelings would be tough to handle, especially since you have important performances coming up. Can you tell me a bit more about what exactly worries you most about performing?

User: Well, I worry that I’ll get so nervous that I won’t be able to remember my lines. Sometimes I even feel physically sick before I go on stage.

Consultant: That sounds quite distressing. It’s understandable to feel that way given the pressure to perform. What do you think contributes to that fear of forgetting your lines?

User: I think it’s this belief that if I forget them, I’ll look unprofessional and let everyone down. It’s like I have to be perfect every time.

Consultant: That’s a heavy pressure to place on yourself. Perfectionism can really amplify anxiety. What would it feel like for you to let go of that need to be perfect for just a moment during your performances?

User: Honestly, it would be a huge relief. But then I worry people will judge me if I mess up.

Consultant: It's natural to worry about others’ perceptions, but what evidence do you have that a small mistake would lead to harsh judgment? 

User: Well, I think maybe it stems from my own high standards. I just feel like if I don’t do it right, everyone will see me as a failure.

Consultant: That makes sense, Graham. It seems that your self-judgment is amplifying your anxiety. What if we explored a different perspective on making mistakes during performances?

User: Sure, I’m open to that. 

Consultant: What if, instead of focusing on perfection, we view each performance as an opportunity to learn and grow? How might that change your approach?

User: I suppose it could help me feel less pressured. If I viewed it as a learning experience, I wouldn’t be as hard on myself.

Consultant: Exactly! Mistakes can often lead to valuable lessons. Let's work on challenging that belief that you have to be perfect. Could you think of a time when something didn’t go perfectly but turned out fine?

User: Yes, there was a time when I missed a line during a show, but I improvised, and the audience laughed. It was a fun moment.

Consultant: That’s a great example! It shows that not everything has to be perfect to still succeed. How can you remind yourself of this when you're feeling anxious before a performance?

User: Maybe I could carry that memory with me or even tell myself it’s okay to be human, to mess up.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Let's also incorporate some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing, into your routine before performances. How does that sound?

User: I think that could help. If I can calm my nerves a bit, maybe I won’t feel as panicked.

Consultant: Absolutely! Deep breathing can help ground you. Let’s practice a quick technique together now, if you’re comfortable? 

User: Sure, I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four, hold it for four, then slowly exhale through your mouth for a count of six. Ready? 

User: Okay, let’s do it.

Consultant: Inhale… 1, 2, 3, 4… hold… 1, 2, 3, 4… and exhale… 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. How did that feel?

User: That felt good. I actually feel a little calmer.

Consultant: That’s excellent to hear! Remember, practicing this before performances may help ease those intense feelings. How are you feeling about your upcoming performances now?

User: Honestly, I'm still a bit nervous, but I feel like I have some tools that could help me cope better.

Consultant: That's a positive shift! Knowing that you have strategies can really empower you. Moving forward, how do you think you can remind yourself to trust your abilities during performances?

User: I could set some affirmations for myself. Remind myself that I’ve done this before and that I can do it again.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Affirmations can really help reinforce positive beliefs. Let's summarize what strategies you've decided to work on before your next performance. 

User: I want to use deep breathing, carry my positive experiences with me, and use affirmations. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Graham! I’m glad you’re feeling a bit more empowered. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel more hopeful. I still have some anxiety, but I have more tools to manage it. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear. Remember, it's a process, and it’s okay to feel a little anxious. If you keep practicing these strategies, you’ll likely find more confidence on stage. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Graham! You've made significant progress. As we wrap up today, know that you can always revisit these techniques whenever you need. I'm here to help whenever you need it. 

User: I’ll definitely keep that in mind. 

Consultant: Take care, Graham, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Graham! I’m glad you’re here today. I remember from our previous sessions that you've been feeling quite anxious about performing. How has your week been?

User: Hi! Yes, it was a bit challenging. I felt really nervous during a recent audition, and it didn't go well. I can't shake off the worry about my future performances.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like that audition had a significant impact on your confidence. Can you tell me more about what specifically worried you during the audition?

User: Well, I felt like I blanked out on my lines. I couldn't remember anything, and I just kept thinking about how everyone must have seen me fail. It was embarrassing.

Consultant: That sounds really frustrating. It's understandable to feel embarrassed after a tough experience like that. Let’s explore together—what thoughts went through your mind in that moment when you forgot your lines?

User: I thought that maybe I’m not cut out for acting anymore. It felt like everyone was judging me, and I was letting them down.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite heavy. It’s common for us to feel judged, especially in an audition setting. Do you think there’s any evidence that supports the idea that you’re not cut out for acting?

User: I guess not really. I have performed well before. But in that moment, it felt so real, like I was a failure.

Consultant: It’s important to acknowledge those feelings, but we can challenge that thought process together. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their abilities as an actor?

User: I would probably remind them of all the good performances they’ve had and encourage them not to give up just because of one bad audition.

Consultant: Exactly, that’s a supportive perspective. Now let’s try applying that reasoning to yourself. Can you identify some of your past successes that counteract the feeling of being a failure?

User: I’ve had some great roles in the past, and I received positive feedback from both the audience and my peers. I just need to remember that, I guess.

Consultant: Yes! Those successes are part of your journey. Now, can we explore how you might feel if you view this recent audition as just one of many, rather than a definitive statement about your abilities?

User: That might help. I can try to see it as a learning experience instead of a failure.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive mindset. Now, let’s talk about managing the anxiety you feel before performances. What do you currently do to cope with that anxiety?

User: I tend to avoid thinking about it until the last minute, but then I feel overwhelmed. I guess that’s not a good strategy…

Consultant: Avoidance often leads to increased anxiety. How about we practice some relaxation techniques that you can use before your performances? Would you be open to that?

User: Sure, that sounds helpful!

Consultant: Great! One technique is deep breathing. Let’s try it together for a moment. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt nice to focus on my breath. I think I could use that before going on stage.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Deep breathing can be a powerful tool. Now, let’s combine it with visualization. If you were to imagine a successful performance, what would that look like for you?

User: I would picture myself calm and confident, speaking my lines clearly and engaging with the audience. It would feel amazing.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful image to hold onto. Practicing visualization like that can help condition your mind for success. How would it feel to incorporate that visualization into your pre-performance routine?

User: It would feel reassuring. I think it could help me reduce my nerves.

Consultant: Absolutely! By visualizing success, you can create a positive expectation for your performances. As we wrap up today, what do you feel is the most significant takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think I need to remind myself of my past successes and visualize my performances more positively. It’s about changing my mindset.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization, Graham. Remember, it’s normal to feel nervous, but you have tools now to help manage that anxiety. How do you feel about your upcoming performance?

User: I still feel a bit anxious, but I’m feeling more hopeful and prepared after our session. I want to try these strategies.

Consultant: That’s a positive approach! I believe you’ll do great. Remember to practice your breathing and visualization. You’ve got this! If you ever feel overwhelmed, just reach out again.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I’ll keep working on these strategies.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care, Graham, and good luck with your performance!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Graham! I'm glad you're here for our session today. How have you been feeling with the upcoming premiere of your play?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite anxious about the performance. I really want to do well, but I find myself worrying a lot, especially about forgetting my lines or not performing well. 

Consultant: It sounds like the pressure of the upcoming performance is really weighing on you. Let's explore that a bit more. Could you describe some of the specific thoughts or worries that come to your mind when you think about the performance?

User: Well, I keep thinking that if I forget a line, everyone will notice and it will ruin the whole show. I imagine the audience laughing at me, and that just makes me more nervous.

Consultant: I can see how those thoughts would create a lot of anxiety. You mentioned that you worry about forgetting your lines and how the audience would react. How does it make you feel when those thoughts occur?

User: It makes me feel really anxious and my heart races. Sometimes I even have trouble sleeping because of it. I just want to feel calm and confident when I'm on stage.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way given the circumstances. Let’s look at the nature of those worries. What evidence do you have that forgetting lines would lead to a disastrous performance?

User: I guess I've had moments in the past where I felt like I forgot my lines, but it didn't go as badly as I feared. The audience was supportive.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! So, it seems that there’s some evidence that the worst-case scenario may not happen. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you advise them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that the audience is usually understanding. They might even find it endearing if something goes wrong.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to remember that the audience is often compassionate and supportive. Now, how can we turn some of these thoughts around to reduce your anxiety and build your confidence for the performance?

User: Maybe I could try practicing in front of friends or even just in front of a mirror to get a feel for the performance without the pressure of a full audience.

Consultant: Practicing in a safe environment sounds like a wonderful idea! It helps you get accustomed to performing and can reduce the pressure. Would you be open to setting up a few practice sessions before the premiere?

User: Yes, I think that would help a lot! I definitely need that familiarity.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s also incorporate some relaxation techniques into our sessions. Would you like to learn specific breathing exercises or mindfulness techniques to help calm your nerves before and during the performance?

User: Yes, I would love to learn those techniques. Anything that can help me feel calmer would be great!

Consultant: Perfect! Breathing exercises can be effective in managing anxiety. For example, we can practice deep breathing techniques where you inhale deeply through your nose and exhale slowly through your mouth. Would you like to try it together now?

User: Sure, I’m willing to try! 

Consultant: Great! Let’s sit comfortably. Now, take a deep breath in through your nose… hold it for a moment… and now slowly release it through your mouth. And again, let’s do this a few more times, slowly and gently. How does that feel?

User: That feels really soothing actually. I can feel the tension starting to ease a little.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! This can be a useful tool for you to use right before you go on stage. Remember, it's about practice and making these techniques a part of your routine. 

User: I'll definitely try to incorporate that. It’s nice to have something concrete to focus on.

Consultant: Exactly! Let’s also talk about using positive affirmations. For instance, before you go on stage, you could tell yourself, “I am prepared, and I will do my best.” How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I think repeating something positive might help shift my mindset.

Consultant: Yes, affirmations can be a powerful way to combat negative thoughts. We can work on crafting some specific affirmations that resonate with you. What would you like to include in them?

User: Maybe something like, “I am capable of performing well,” and “I can handle anything that comes my way.”

Consultant: Those are excellent affirmations! Repeating those to yourself can help strengthen your confidence. As we get closer to the performance, how about we schedule some practice sessions and mindfulness exercises together?

User: I’d really appreciate that. Having support before the big day will definitely help me feel more at ease.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s also keep track of your feelings and thoughts during the next few days leading up to the performance, so we can see how your mindset shifts. Does that sound okay?

User: Yes, I think keeping a journal might really help. I can write about my thoughts and how I feel each day.

Consultant: That sounds like a brilliant plan. Journaling can help you process your emotions and identify any patterns that may arise. Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection.

User: I really appreciate all these strategies. It’s nice to feel like I have a plan.

Consultant: I'm glad you feel that way! We'll continue building on these techniques in our next sessions. How are you feeling overall now as compared to when we started?

User: I feel a bit more optimistic. I know I still have some anxiety, but I have tools to help manage it.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It’s all part of the journey. Before we conclude today, let’s take a moment to reflect on your progress and think about how you can embrace any imperfections in your performance.

User: I think it’s important to accept that nobody is perfect, and I should focus more on enjoying the performance rather than being so critical of myself.

Consultant: Exactly! Embracing imperfections can lead to a more fulfilling experience. I'm proud of your progress today, Graham. Remember, you're not alone in this, and I look forward to supporting you further.

User: Thank you so much for your help! I'm feeling more ready for this performance now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Just remember to practice those breathing exercises and affirmations leading up to your performance. You’ve got this, and I’m here if you need anything in the future. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Graham! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty good about my performance overall. The audience seemed to enjoy it, but I can’t shake off this nagging feeling that I could have done better with the details. It's been eating at me.

Consultant: It sounds like you have this internal struggle between recognizing the success of the performance and your critical view of the details. Can you tell me more about what specific details have been bothering you?

User: It’s mostly about the little mistakes I made on stage—like forgetting a line or not hitting the emotional notes just right. I feel like I should have done better, and it just makes me anxious thinking about it.

Consultant: I hear you. It’s understandable to focus on those little moments, especially when you hold yourself to high standards. What emotions come up for you when you think about those mistakes?

User: I feel frustrated and a bit anxious. It's like I can't let go of it, and it keeps me up at night, replaying those moments in my head.

Consultant: Those feelings of frustration and anxiety can be really tough to deal with, especially when they disrupt your sleep. Let's explore that a bit more. When you replay those moments, what thoughts are running through your mind?

User: I keep thinking that if I had just practiced a little more or focused harder, I wouldn’t have made those mistakes. It feels like I’m letting everyone down, including myself.

Consultant: It sounds like you're setting very high expectations for yourself, and when those expectations aren’t met, it leads to feelings of disappointment. Is it possible that there are other perspectives on those mistakes? 

User: I guess I could think that it was my first show back after a while, and everyone else seemed to enjoy it. But then I feel like I'm just making excuses for myself.

Consultant: It’s important to acknowledge your performance was well-received while still valuing your hard work. Let's try challenging that thought that making a mistake means you're letting everyone down. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts that belief?

User: Well, the audience did clap and cheer. And my director gave me some positive feedback, saying it was a strong performance overall. 

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It sounds like your director and the audience saw strengths in your performance. If a friend had performed as you did, how would you advise them to view their experience?

User: I’d tell them to focus on the positive feedback and not be too hard on themselves. I’d encourage them to see the hard work they put in.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate approach. Why do you think you struggle to offer yourself that same kindness?

User: I think I hold myself to a different standard because I’ve been acting for so long. I feel like I should know better.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, given your experience. However, even seasoned actors make mistakes. It’s a part of the process. Let’s work on practicing some self-compassion. What would it look like to be kinder to yourself when reflecting on your performances?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it's okay to be imperfect and that I'm still learning. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent perspective! How might you incorporate that into your reflection process? 

User: I could write down positive feedback alongside the criticisms, so I can see both sides.

Consultant: That’s a practical approach! Balancing your thoughts can help you maintain perspective. How would you feel about scheduling some time after a performance specifically for reflection? 

User: That sounds helpful. It would give me a chance to process everything without just focusing on the mistakes.

Consultant: That’s a good plan. Besides reflection, let’s think about how you can engage with your team. How do you feel their support could impact your performances?

User: Having their support makes me feel more confident. I think if I rely on them more, it could take some pressure off me.

Consultant: Absolutely! Leaning into your team can help create a more supportive environment. What do you think would help you strengthen that team connection?

User: Maybe we could have more group discussions after rehearsals about how we felt in certain scenes. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Encouraging open communication can foster a supportive atmosphere. As you continue this journey, what are some affirmations or encouraging mantras you could remind yourself?

User: “I am growing with every performance, and it’s okay to make mistakes.” 

Consultant: That’s a powerful mantra! Repeating that to yourself could help reinforce a more positive self-view. How do you feel about integrating it into your routine? 

User: I think I can start saying that before practicing lines or going on stage!

Consultant: Great! Creating these positive habits is a wonderful step forward. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’re taking away from our conversation. 

User: I’m feeling more empowered to focus on the positives instead of dwelling on the details. I also feel ready to communicate more with my team.

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress, Graham! Remember, embracing imperfections and supporting each other can make a big difference in your performances. I'm proud of how far you’ve come. If you ever need help again, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. I feel more confident about my next performance. 

Consultant: You're welcome! I look forward to hearing about your experiences. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Graham! I'm glad to see you again for this session. It sounds like you've been experiencing some positive changes lately with the team dynamics. Can you share more about how you’ve been feeling regarding your performances?

User: Hi! Yes, overall I've felt a bit more supported since joining this team. I think the group aspect has helped me improve my confidence in improvisation. But I still get nervous before performances, especially on stage.

Consultant: It's great to hear that the support from your team has been beneficial! Feeling nervous before a performance is quite common, even for experienced actors. Can you describe what specific feelings or thoughts come to your mind just before you go on stage?

User: Right before I go on, I often feel my heart racing, and I start thinking that I might forget my lines or mess up in front of everyone. It’s really overwhelming.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite intense! It sounds like your mind is generating a lot of anxiety-focused thoughts before you perform. What emotions do you associate with those thoughts? 

User: I feel a mix of panic and apprehension. The idea of failing or disappointing others makes it worse.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s understandable to feel pressure when you care about your performance and your team. Have you noticed if these feelings change when you're performing with your team compared to solo performances?

User: Yes, actually. When I’m with the team, I feel a little less pressure since we’re all in it together. But the nerves still hit me hard at the last moment.

Consultant: That’s an important insight. Teamwork does provide a sense of support. How do you think focusing on that support from your team could help you when those nerves kick in right before performing?

User: Maybe if I remind myself that we’re all there to support each other, it could help calm my nerves. I guess I could shift my focus from just myself to the group.

Consultant: Absolutely! Shifting your focus to the collective experience can be very helpful. We might want to explore some strategies to reinforce that supportive mindset. How do you usually prepare for your performances with the team?

User: Usually, we do some warm-up exercises, and we share tips with each other. That part really helps, but I still struggle right before we go on stage.

Consultant: Warm-up exercises can be great to build rapport and confidence. Perhaps we can introduce some relaxation techniques or affirmations that you can use just before taking the stage. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! Having a tool to manage my nerves would definitely be useful.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s try to create some affirmations you can remind yourself of before a performance, focusing on the support from your colleagues. What phrases could resonate with you that embody teamwork and confidence?

User: Maybe something like, “We are in this together,” or “I trust my team and myself.” 

Consultant: I love those affirmations! Saying them to yourself before the performance could reinforce that sense of unity and confidence. When you feel the anxiety building, you can focus on these phrases. How do you feel about practicing this technique together now?

User: Sure, let’s try it! Practicing it will help make it feel more natural.

Consultant: Great! Let’s go through a small visualization exercise. Imagine yourself on stage, taking a moment to breathe deeply. Visualize your team beside you. Now, let’s repeat those affirmations together. Ready?

User: Okay, I’m ready. 

Consultant: “We are in this together.” (Pause) “I trust my team and myself.” (Pause) How does repeating those affirmations make you feel?

User: I feel a bit more relaxed. Visualizing my team is definitely helping me feel less alone out there.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Visualization and affirmations can create a powerful shift in mindset. As we move forward, how will you incorporate these techniques into your pre-performance routine?

User: I think I’ll start my warm-ups with some visualization and repeat those affirmations. It feels like a good way to ground myself.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Remember, it’s about building that supportive mindset consistently. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on your progress. What do you feel you’ve gained from our sessions so far?

User: I feel like I’ve learned to trust myself a bit more, especially in a team context. Understanding how to manage my anxiety is also a big step forward.

Consultant: I’m so proud of the growth you’ve achieved, Graham! Your confidence in both team dynamics and improvisation has clearly improved. As we conclude today, what strategies will you keep in mind for future performances? 

User: I’ll keep using the affirmations and visualization. I also want to remind myself that it’s okay to feel nervous, and that my team will support me no matter what.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset to have! It’s completely normal to feel nervous, but now you have the tools to manage it. Remember, you can always reach out if you feel the need for more support. 

User: Thank you so much. I feel ready to tackle my next performance with these new strategies.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m confident you’ll do great. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Graham! I'm glad to see you again. Let’s take a moment to reflect on your journey since our last session. How have you been feeling about your performances lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling surprisingly good. The stage fright has really lessened. I think my confidence in my acting and improvisation has grown a lot.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! It's great that you're feeling more confident. Can you describe a specific instance during your recent performances where you noticed this improvement?

User: Yes, during a recent show, something unexpected happened on stage, and I was able to handle it smoothly. It felt great to adapt and still enjoy the experience instead of panicking.

Consultant: That's an incredible achievement, Graham! It truly shows your growth. How did that experience differ from how you might have reacted before?

User: In the past, I would have felt paralyzed by fear, unable to think clearly. But this time, I was able to stay calm and respond positively, which was refreshing.

Consultant: Staying calm and responding positively is a huge step forward. What do you think contributed to this change in your response?

User: I believe it’s the techniques we discussed in our sessions. I’ve been practicing mindfulness and reframing my thoughts, which allowed me to regain control when faced with challenges.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! It sounds like you’ve successfully integrated those techniques into your performances. Can you share how your mindset shifted during this experience?

User: I used to think that if something went wrong, it would ruin the entire performance. Now, I remind myself that mistakes are part of the process and that I can handle them.

Consultant: That’s an excellent perspective, Graham. Embracing mistakes as part of the journey can really alleviate pressure. How has maintaining this mindset affected your overall enjoyment of performing?

User: It has made performing much more enjoyable! I feel less anxious and can appreciate the moments rather than worrying about perfection.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight. As we wrap up our sessions, how do you plan to continue building on this positive experience in your future performances?

User: I want to keep using the techniques and remind myself to focus on the pleasure of acting rather than the fear of failing. I’m also considering joining a local improv group for more practice.

Consultant: Joining an improv group sounds like a fantastic idea! It will allow you to further develop your skills in a supportive environment. As we conclude today’s session, let’s summarize what you’ve accomplished and how to maintain this growth moving forward.

User: Sure. I’ve learned to manage my stage fright, handle unexpected situations, and find joy in performing again. I think that if I keep practicing and reminding myself of these lessons, I’ll continue to improve.

Consultant: Absolutely, you have made remarkable progress. Remember to revisit the strategies you’ve learned whenever you feel anxious. What will be your first step to maintain this momentum?

User: I think I’ll write down my experiences and positive affirmations. Reflecting on my growth will help remind me where I’ve come from.

Consultant: That's a brilliant strategy, Graham! Reflecting on your achievements will reinforce your confidence. As we conclude our sessions today, I want you to know that you have developed valuable skills for the future. If difficulties arise, don't hesitate to reach out again.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate all your guidance. I feel ready to face new challenges!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Graham! I’m proud of your journey. You've gained tools that will serve you well, and I believe in your ability to thrive. Take care, and remember, I’m here if you need support in the future.
