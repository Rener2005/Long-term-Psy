Consultant: Hello, Ms. Zhang! Welcome to today's session. I understand you've been experiencing some anger and frustration at work lately, especially after conflicts with your colleagues. Can you tell me more about how you’ve been feeling?

User: Hi. Yes, it has been really tough. I feel overwhelmed by the pressure of managing this important project, and the disagreements with my team just make it worse. I get really angry, and then I feel even more helpless because I can't seem to control my reactions.

Consultant: It sounds like you're under a lot of stress, and that the conflicts have amplified your feelings of anger and helplessness. Let’s explore a bit—can you describe a specific incident that triggered your anger recently?

User: Sure. During a team meeting last week, we couldn't agree on the approach to solve a technical issue. I felt like my ideas were dismissed, and I ended up raising my voice. After that, I felt really bad about it, but in the moment, I just couldn't hold it in.

Consultant: That sounds really frustrating, especially feeling dismissed. When you raised your voice, what thoughts were going through your mind at that moment? 

User: I thought they just didn't understand my perspective and that they were not taking the project seriously. It made me feel like they were undermining my efforts, which really upset me.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way when you sense that your hard work is not being acknowledged. Those thoughts can create a strong emotional response. How did that outburst affect your relationship with your colleagues afterward?

User: I think it created more tension. Some of them avoided me after that, and I felt embarrassed. I hate that I lost my cool, but it’s like I just can't help it when I'm pushed to the edge.

Consultant: Feeling embarrassed after an outburst is a common reaction. It seems like you really want to manage your emotions better, especially under pressure. Can we begin to identify what specifically triggers your anger in these work situations?

User: I guess it’s when I feel that my authority or competence is being challenged. I just want to be respected for my role as a project manager.

Consultant: That makes sense. It can be quite challenging when your expertise is questioned. Let’s work on recognizing those triggers more clearly. How do you typically notice those feelings of anger arising in your body or thoughts before they escalate?

User: I start feeling my heart race, and then my thoughts become very critical—not just about others, but about myself too. I think things like, “I must be failing at my job,” or “I’m not good enough.”

Consultant: Those critical thoughts can certainly fuel your anger and frustration. It’s important to acknowledge them. Have you noticed any specific patterns or similar thoughts across different incidents?

User: Yes, it often happens during high-pressure situations, like meetings or deadlines. When I feel rushed or overwhelmed, my emotions tend to get the best of me.

Consultant: Acknowledging this pattern is a great first step. Together, we can explore how to challenge those negative thoughts when they arise. Let’s think about a situation where you felt this way—what alternative interpretations could you consider?

User: Maybe instead of thinking I’m failing, I could remind myself that everyone faces challenges, and it's okay to ask for help or share my perspective calmly.

Consultant: Absolutely! That's a much more compassionate way to view the situation. Practicing this kind of rethinking could help you manage your reactions better. Can we discuss ways to implement this in future situations?

User: Sure! I think preparing some phrases to use when I feel my anger rising could help, like reminding myself that it’s okay to take a break if needed.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Taking a moment to breathe or step away can give you the space to handle your feelings more effectively. Would journaling about these instances and your feelings afterwards be something you might consider, as well?

User: Yes, I like that idea! Keeping a record of my emotions and situations might help me identify patterns and understand my triggers better.

Consultant: Great! This emotional diary can serve as a powerful tool for reflection. Each time you experience these feelings, jot down what happened, how you felt, and any thoughts that came to mind. Let’s plan to review it together next time. 

User: That sounds good. I think it will really help me see the situation more clearly.

Consultant: I believe so too, Ms. Zhang. Before we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed. You’ve begun to identify your anger triggers, you’re working on challenging your negative thoughts, and you plan to start an emotional diary. How do you feel about the progress we made today?

User: I feel hopeful. I can see a way forward to improving how I manage my anger at work. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s wonderful to hear you feeling hopeful. Just remember that this is a process, and it’s perfectly normal to have ups and downs. Keep practicing these strategies, and we’ll continue building on your progress in our future sessions. If anything comes up in between, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thanks! I appreciate that. I look forward to our next session.

Consultant: Me too! Take care, and I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: Hello, Ms. Zhang! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been experiencing a lot of frustration and anger lately, especially after the conflict with my colleague and being criticized by my supervisor in that key meeting. It's been hard to manage these emotions.

Consultant: I can see how that would be really challenging for you. It sounds like those experiences have triggered some strong feelings. Could you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel frustrated or angry in those situations?

User: When I get criticized, I suddenly doubt my abilities and feel like I'm not good enough. I just can't help but react with anger. It feels like I'm stuck in this cycle of doubt and frustration.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. Experiencing criticism can often lead to negative self-beliefs and intense emotions. Let's explore what thoughts come to your mind when you feel criticized. Can you identify any specific thoughts or beliefs that arise during those moments?

User: I often think, "I shouldn't make mistakes," or "I'm a failure." Those thoughts just flood my mind when I feel criticized.

Consultant: Those thoughts can certainly contribute to the feelings of frustration and anger you’re experiencing. It's important to recognize how powerful these thoughts are. How do you think these beliefs influence your emotions and reactions in those situations?

User: They make me feel trapped. I get so angry that I almost lash out at others or just shut down entirely. 

Consultant: It sounds like these thoughts lead you to an emotional tipping point, where you either react intensely or withdraw. Would you be open to exploring alternative perspectives to challenge those negative thoughts? 

User: I guess I could try that. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s consider the thought, "I shouldn't make mistakes." How true is that statement really? Is it realistic to think that we can always avoid mistakes in our work?

User: I know logically that everyone makes mistakes, but it feels different when it's directed at me.

Consultant: Absolutely, and feeling that way is valid. However, if a colleague made a mistake, would you be as harsh on them as you are on yourself? 

User: Probably not. I'd probably try to support them instead.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate response. Let’s try to shift that thinking toward yourself—what would it look like if you treated yourself with the same kindness you would offer a colleague?

User: I suppose I would acknowledge that it's just part of learning and that I can improve. 

Consultant: Exactly! Acknowledging that mistakes are part of growth can help soften those harsh self-judgments. Can we create a new thought to replace "I shouldn't make mistakes" with something more constructive? 

User: Maybe something like, "It's okay to make mistakes as long as I learn from them"?

Consultant: That’s a wonderful thought! How does that feel when you say it to yourself?

User: It feels a bit relieving to think about it that way. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let’s also think about how you can express your feelings in these situations constructively. What are some ways you could communicate your feelings when faced with criticism in the future?

User: I could try to tell my colleagues how I feel instead of just reacting in anger. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Learning to express your feelings can help to prevent misunderstandings. Is there a specific situation where you could practice this new skill?

User: Maybe I could try it during our next team meeting, especially if someone questions my decisions.

Consultant: That sounds like a great opportunity! How would you like to prepare for that meeting?

User: I think I could write down how I want to express myself beforehand. 

Consultant: That’s an effective strategy. Planning out your communication can help you feel more confident. How do you feel about setting that as a goal for the upcoming week?

User: I feel good about it! I think it might help reduce my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Tracking your progress will also be beneficial. Perhaps we could review your experiences during our next session to see how it went. 

User: Yes, I would like that. I want to improve my interaction with my team.

Consultant: Wonderful! It’s all about taking those small but significant steps. Remember to be gentle with yourself as you try out these new strategies. How does that sound?

User: It sounds manageable. Thank you for the encouragement.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Ms. Zhang. I'm proud of you for taking these steps! Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or anything you want to express about today's session?

User: No, I think we covered everything I needed today. 

Consultant: All right. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember, it's a journey, and you’re making great progress. Take care until then! 

User: Thank you! I'm looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: Hello, Miss Zhang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing some reflecting on my communication style, especially after the training I attended. But I still feel angry and frustrated when facing work pressure, especially with my colleagues.

Consultant: It's great to hear you've been reflecting on your communication. Acknowledging how your emotions affect your interactions is an important step. Can you share what you've discovered about your communication style?

User: I've noticed that I tend to speak my mind without considering how others might feel. This has definitely led to conflicts with my coworkers.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Miss Zhang. It sounds like you’re realizing the impact of your directness on others. How do you feel when these conflicts arise?

User: I feel really frustrated and sometimes even angry, especially when I think I’m being misunderstood. It's like all my hard work is not being recognized.

Consultant: Feeling misunderstood can be really disheartening, especially in a team environment. What kind of situations typically lead to these feelings for you?

User: Often, it happens during team meetings when ideas clash. I feel like I’m not being heard and I can’t hold back my feelings of frustration. 

Consultant: It makes sense that those situations would lead to frustration, especially when you want your contributions to be valued. Can we explore some ways to communicate that might help in those moments?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I really want to improve how I express my feelings.

Consultant: A constructive approach can often ease tensions. One strategy we can practice is nonviolent communication. This involves expressing feelings and needs without assigning blame. Would you like to role-play an example of this?

User: That sounds helpful. I think I need more practice in expressing myself calmly.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s create a scenario where you feel frustrated during a meeting. I’ll be a coworker who disagrees with your idea. How would you like to start?

User: I might say something like, "I don't agree with your point of view." 

Consultant: That’s a direct start, but we could try rephrasing it to focus on your feelings. For instance, saying, "I feel concerned when I hear differing opinions because I want us to work together." What do you think of that approach?

User: That makes sense! It’s less confrontational and focuses on my feelings instead.

Consultant: Exactly! By sharing your feelings, you open up a dialogue rather than putting anyone on the defensive. Would you like to try another round of role-play with that adjustment?

User: Sure! I’ll try my best.

Consultant: Alright, let’s begin. I’ll reiterate the disagreeing point. Remember to express how you feel and what you need from me. Ready?

User: Yes, I’m ready. 

Consultant: (as coworker) "I really think we should go with my idea instead. It's more efficient."

User: I feel tense when my idea is dismissed because I believe I researched it thoroughly. I need us to consider all perspectives for our project.

Consultant: That was well articulated! You expressed your feelings and needs clearly. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt empowering to voice my feelings without attacking. I think I could handle such situations better this way!

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Just remembering to express your feelings and needs can be a game changer in conflict situations. How would you approach this in your next meeting?

User: I would focus on remaining calm and practicing this nonviolent communication technique.

Consultant: That's a great approach! Practicing this will build your confidence in expressing yourself effectively. What other strategies could you implement if you feel tension rising in a meeting?

User: I might take a deep breath and remind myself to stay open-minded, even when I feel frustrated.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Deep breathing can indeed help center your emotions. Would you like to set a goal for yourself regarding this technique in the upcoming week?

User: Yes! I want to actively practice nonviolent communication during our team meetings and use deep breathing when I feel tension. 

Consultant: Sounds like a solid goal, Miss Zhang! As we wrap up today, what do you feel has been your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I think learning to express my feelings constructively is key. It feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Recognizing the power of communication is a big step forward. How will you continue to build on this in the future?

User: I will keep practicing these techniques and look for feedback from my colleagues on how I can improve further.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! As we end our session, remember that it’s a journey. Keep trying and reach out if you need support. You've made significant progress.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance. I look forward to applying what I’ve learned.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Miss Zhang! I'm proud of the work you've put in. Until next time, take care and stay committed to your goals.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Miss Zhang! I'm pleased to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been working on my emotional management skills, and I'm starting to feel more positive about my teamwork relationships. However, I still face some challenges, especially with managing my emotions when conflicts arise.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're noticing positive changes! Let's explore that a bit further. Can you share a specific situation recently where you felt your emotional management skills were tested?

User: I had a conflict with a colleague during a project discussion. I felt really angry and frustrated, but I tried to take a step back and assess the situation instead of reacting immediately.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant moment for you. Taking a step back is an essential skill in managing those emotions. What thoughts went through your mind when you felt that anger during the discussion?

User: I kept thinking that my colleague was not valuing my input, and that made me feel even more upset. I thought about how all my hard work was being overlooked.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts intensified your frustrations. Let's take a closer look at that. What evidence did you have to support the belief that your input wasn’t valued?

User: Well, my colleague dismissed some of my suggestions quickly without much discussion, which really hurt.

Consultant: That sounds painful, and it's understandable to feel hurt in that situation. However, could there be other reasons for their reaction? Perhaps they were under pressure themselves or misinterpreted your suggestions? 

User: I guess that's possible. I didn't think about it from that angle, but it could be true.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re open to considering other perspectives. This can help in reducing the intensity of your emotional reactions. How do you feel about trying to reframe your thoughts next time a conflict arises?

User: I like that idea. If I can remind myself that their reaction might not be personal, it might help me stay calmer.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reframing your thoughts can be a powerful tool. Let’s practice this together. If a similar situation occurred again, what might a more balanced thought look like?

User: Maybe I could think, "This person might be stressed, and it’s not about me." That sounds better.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start. By recognizing and shifting your thoughts, it can help you respond rather than react. What could be a small step you could take to apply this in your next team meeting?

User: I think I could take a deep breath before responding if I feel defensive. It might give me a moment to process my thoughts before reacting.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Deep breathing can be very helpful. Let’s also touch on the recent team-building activity you participated in. How did that experience affect your feelings towards your colleagues?

User: The team-building activity was surprisingly beneficial. I felt a stronger connection with my colleagues, and it helped me see them in a new light.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Strengthening those connections can really enhance communication and collaboration. How might this newfound understanding help you navigate future conflicts?

User: I think having that connection will allow me to approach conflicts with more empathy. I’ll be less likely to assume the worst.

Consultant: Exactly. Empathy can significantly change how conflicts are handled. It helps create a space where all parties feel heard. As we continue to work on your emotional intelligence, what specific strategies would you like to focus on going forward?

User: I want to practice active listening and responding calmly when someone disagrees with me. I think that would help me manage my feelings better.

Consultant: That's a powerful focus. Active listening not only helps you understand others better but also reduces the chances of miscommunication. Let’s make that a goal for our next session. Are there any other strategies you’d like to explore?

User: I also want to discuss how to give feedback effectively because I tend to avoid it when conflicts arise.

Consultant: That’s a great area to improve! Effective feedback can strengthen your team dynamics. We can certainly work on techniques for that. How do you see these goals impacting your professional growth?

User: I believe improving my emotional skills will not only help me handle conflicts better but also make me a more effective project manager.

Consultant: Definitely. Those skills are vital for your role and will enhance your overall leadership capabilities. As we approach the end of today’s session, let’s summarize what you’ve achieved so far. What do you feel is your biggest takeaway?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is recognizing the power of reframing my thoughts and developing empathy in my interactions.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, and I’m proud of the progress you’re making. As you continue to practice these strategies, remember to celebrate your successes, no matter how small. They all contribute to your growth. 

User: Thank you! I’ll definitely try to remember that.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, if you encounter challenges, don’t hesitate to reach out. You’re on a great path, and I believe in your ability to manage your emotions effectively. 

User: I appreciate your support. I feel more equipped to handle things now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Keep practicing, and I look forward to seeing you again for our next session. You've got this!

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to our next meeting.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ms. Zhang! I'm glad to see you for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi, I've been feeling quite good, actually. I've been able to handle my anger better, especially at work. I’m starting to feel more confident in my role as a project manager.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re making significant progress in managing your emotions at work. Can you share more about a specific situation where you felt you effectively managed your anger recently?

User: Sure! Just last week, during a team meeting, one of my colleagues challenged my ideas in a way that usually would have made me angry. Instead, I took a deep breath and responded calmly, and it helped keep the discussion productive.

Consultant: That’s an excellent example of applying your anger management skills! What specifically helped you stay calm in that moment? 

User: I think remembering how much I wanted to maintain a positive atmosphere for the team. Also, I reminded myself that it’s okay to have differing opinions.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Understanding that varying opinions can contribute positively to discussions is very helpful. How did it feel to handle that situation differently than you might have previously?

User: It felt empowering, honestly. I was proud of myself for not reacting negatively. It made me feel more capable in my new role.

Consultant: It’s fantastic that you felt empowered! Building on that, how do you envision continuing to strengthen your emotional management skills in future project situations?

User: I’d like to keep practicing my communication skills and maybe seek feedback from my team on how I can improve.

Consultant: Seeking feedback is a great strategy! It shows your commitment to growth and collaboration. Have you thought about any specific communication techniques you might use?

User: I’ve been trying to use "I" statements more often. Like saying, “I feel...” instead of immediately pointing out what others might be doing wrong.

Consultant: That’s a constructive approach! Using "I" statements can significantly reduce defensiveness in conversations. Do you recall a time where this technique benefited a conversation?

User: Yes! I used it during a project discussion last week, and it really helped my colleague understand my perspective without feeling attacked.

Consultant: That’s an excellent application! It sounds like you're building positive relationships while discussing important matters. Are there any ongoing challenges you face in managing emotions with colleagues?

User: One ongoing challenge is when deadlines approach; I often feel overwhelmed and can become short-tempered. I really want to work on that.

Consultant: Acknowledging that is an important step. It seems like external pressures might trigger your anxiety. Can you share what thoughts go through your mind when you begin to feel overwhelmed?

User: I typically think that I need to do everything perfectly or that I’m letting my team down.

Consultant: Those thoughts can add significant pressure. Let’s explore them—how realistic do you think those expectations are? Can you think of evidence that challenges those thoughts? 

User: I guess, logically, I know that nobody is perfect, and mistakes can happen. But in the moment, it feels like I need to maintain a flawless reputation.

Consultant: It’s understandable to want to perform well, yet maintaining a flawless reputation isn’t achievable and can lead to stress. What would be a more balanced thought to replace that pressure with?

User: Maybe I could think, "I will do my best, but it's okay to learn from mistakes."

Consultant: That’s a much healthier thought! It promotes self-compassion and encourages learning. How do you feel about adopting that perspective when you start to feel overwhelmed in the future?

User: I feel more at ease just thinking about it. It seems more manageable than the pressure I put on myself.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Let’s discuss further strategies to prevent or address feelings of overwhelm before they escalate. What kind of self-care or stress relief activities have you been using?

User: I’ve tried some breathing exercises and a bit of journaling, but I’m not consistent with them.

Consultant: Those activities are great tools! Building consistency can enhance their effectiveness. How about creating a small, achievable plan to integrate these practices into your routine?

User: That sounds doable. Maybe I could set aside ten minutes each day for breathing exercises and a journal entry a few times a week.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Setting aside time each day dedicated to these activities can really help you manage stress more effectively. How do you think you'll feel after implementing this plan?

User: I believe I’ll feel more centered and equipped to handle challenges at work.

Consultant: I love your proactive attitude! As we continue, it might be valuable to set milestones to review your progress with this plan. How do you feel about that idea?

User: I think that would help keep me accountable and motivated.

Consultant: Absolutely! Accountability can foster growth. Before we wrap up, let’s reflect on your progress today. What has been the most meaningful takeaway for you in our session?

User: I really appreciated exploring how I can shift my mindset and the fact that it’s okay to learn from mistakes. It feels liberating.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight, Ms. Zhang! Remember that you’re completely capable of managing your emotions and leading your team. In our next session, we can review your progress and delve deeper into any new challenges you encounter.

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: You’re welcome! Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up before our next session. Have a great day!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ms. Zhang! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing well, actually. I feel much better about managing my emotions, especially after the conflicts at work. It's been a relief to receive positive feedback from my boss and colleagues.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear that your emotional management has improved and that you're receiving recognition for your work. Can you share a bit more about how you felt during the conflicts and what strategies you used to cope with those emotions?

User: Sure! During the conflicts, I felt a mix of anger and frustration. I took some time to breathe deeply and remind myself that my colleagues were just trying to express their views. It helped me to keep calm and respond more positively.

Consultant: It sounds like you applied some effective coping strategies. Taking a moment to breathe and gain perspective is very important. How do you feel about your emotional responses now compared to before?

User: I feel like I've made significant progress. Before, I would often react impulsively, but now I can pause and reflect before responding. It's empowering to have that control.

Consultant: That’s an impressive change, Ms. Zhang! Recognizing your triggers and being able to manage your reactions is a big accomplishment. As we look ahead, what are your thoughts on your career development? Are there particular goals or skills you want to work on?

User: I’ve been thinking about taking on more leadership roles. I feel ready to step up, but I also want to ensure I continue managing my stress effectively as the responsibilities increase.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re considering stepping into leadership roles. Managing stress is indeed crucial as your responsibilities grow. What skills do you feel you need to develop to prepare for these new challenges?

User: I think I need to improve my communication skills, especially when dealing with conflicts. Also, I want to enhance my decision-making abilities under pressure.

Consultant: Those are very important skills, especially in leadership positions. Would you like to discuss some techniques or strategies that could help you refine those skills?

User: Yes, I would love that! I want to be more confident in my communication, particularly during difficult conversations.

Consultant: One effective approach is practicing assertive communication. This means expressing your thoughts and feelings openly while respecting others. Would you be open to role-playing a tough conversation to see how you might handle it?

User: That sounds helpful! I'd like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you need to address a team member who hasn’t been pulling their weight. How would you start that conversation?

User: I guess I would start by expressing my concern for the team’s project progress and then ask how they feel about their contributions.

Consultant: That’s a good start. Starting with concern for the team shows you care about collective success. How might you express your feelings if their response isn't what you hoped for?

User: I suppose I could emphasize that I value their input and ask if there are obstacles they’re facing that I can help with.

Consultant: Excellent approach! By showing empathy and offering support, you’re maintaining a positive dialogue. Creating an open space for discussion can often lead to better resolutions. How do you feel about trying out this strategy in a real situation?

User: I'm feeling more confident about it! I can see how approaching it this way could help ease tension.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Ms. Zhang. Confidence in your communication will make a huge difference. As we wrap up our session, let's reflect. What do you feel has been your biggest takeaway from our discussion today?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is the importance of empathy in communication. It really does help in resolving conflicts and managing my emotions better.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Empathy is a powerful tool in both personal and professional relationships. As you move forward in your career, remember the strategies we've discussed. How confident do you feel about applying these skills in your next challenges?

User: Pretty confident! I feel prepared to face the next challenges. I really appreciate your guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure to see your growth. If you ever feel the need for more support, I’m here to help. Let’s summarize what you’ve learned and focus on how you'll continue to build on these skills moving forward. 

User: Yes, summarizing sounds good. I want to keep track of my progress.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can create a plan to help you maintain your focus on communication and stress management as you advance in your career. Remember, you've already taken great steps towards improvement, and I believe in your ability to continue this journey. 

User: Thank you! That reassurance means a lot to me.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Ms. Zhang. It’s been wonderful working with you. Best of luck with everything, and don't hesitate to come back if you have more to discuss in the future. Have a great day!

User: Thank you! I appreciate it and will definitely reach out if I need help.
