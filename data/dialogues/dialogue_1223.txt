Consultant: Hello, Xiao Lei! I'm really glad you came in for today’s session. How have you been feeling lately regarding your studies and university life?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really lost. I thought university would be exciting, but I just can't seem to adapt. I feel pressure with the coursework and social situations, and it's just overwhelming.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure and difficulty adjusting to this new environment. Can you tell me more about what specifically is making you feel overwhelmed?

User: Well, the coursework is challenging, and I just can't keep up. I used to be a top student in high school, but here I feel like I'm falling behind. In addition, I'm struggling with making connections with classmates, which makes me feel even more isolated.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, especially when you’ve had such success in the past. It's understandable to feel lost when things don’t go as expected. How does all this pressure impact your ability to study or engage in classes?

User: I find it hard to focus. I keep thinking that I'm not cut out for this, which makes me want to give up. I just get so anxious that I avoid studying altogether. 

Consultant: It sounds like you’re facing a lot of self-doubt and anxiety right now. Let’s explore the thoughts that come to your mind when you think about studying. What kind of thoughts do you have in those moments?

User: I often think that I'm not as smart as everyone else and that I won't be able to succeed like I did before. I keep telling myself I’ll fail, and it makes me even more anxious.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really overwhelming. It’s like a cycle that feeds your anxiety. Can we challenge those thoughts a bit? What evidence do you have that supports those beliefs about not being smart enough?

User: I guess I don’t really have any concrete evidence. I mean, I did well in high school, but now it just feels different. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s great that you recognized that. Perhaps your past success can be a reminder that you do have the capability to succeed. If a friend were feeling this way, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably encourage them to give themselves some grace and remind them of their past achievements. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful perspective! You have the insight to recognize that it's okay to struggle and that your past achievements are valid. How can you apply that self-compassion to how you view your current situation?

User: I think I need to remind myself that it's okay not to have everything figured out immediately. I should allow myself to have a learning curve instead of expecting perfection.

Consultant: That sounds like a great approach! Allowing yourself that space can really help reduce some of the pressure. Let’s work on some specific goals for managing your anxiety leading up to your exams. What do you think would help you feel more prepared and focused?

User: Maybe breaking my study sessions into smaller, manageable parts would help. Also, setting aside time to relax or do things I enjoy could keep me from feeling too stressed.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Breaking things down can make the workload feel less daunting. Also, finding balance with relaxation is important for your mental health. How about we set a plan for your study sessions this week? 

User: That sounds good. I could schedule short study periods followed by breaks, and maybe even set aside time to meet friends.

Consultant: I love that idea! Balancing study and social time can help you feel more connected and supported. As you move forward, remember to check in with those supportive thoughts about your past successes. 

User: I’ll try to focus on that. It feels comforting to remind myself that I have done well before.

Consultant: Absolutely, and you can build on that success. Let's also tackle those feelings of isolation. Is there a particular group or activity on campus you might want to join to meet new people?

User: I've been thinking about joining a study group or maybe a club related to my major. It might help me connect with others who are in the same boat.

Consultant: That sounds promising! Engaging with others who share your interests can really help ease the feelings of isolation. Let’s set a goal for you to research those options this week.

User: I can do that. I’ll look into clubs and perhaps reach out to classmates to see if they want to form a study group.

Consultant: Great! Also, how do you feel about practicing some mindfulness techniques to help with your anxiety before exams?

User: I’ve heard of mindfulness but haven’t really tried it. How would it work for me?

Consultant: Mindfulness can help bring your attention back to the present moment, which can reduce anxiety. We can start with simple breathing exercises to help center you. Would you like to try a quick breathing technique now?

User: Sure! That sounds interesting.

Consultant: Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a moment, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Imagine releasing some of that tension with each exhale. How did that feel?

User: That actually felt calming! I think I can incorporate that into my daily routine.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Using those techniques regularly can help manage your anxiety and improve focus over time. As we approach our next session, what areas would you like to focus on further?

User: I'd like to see if I can really stick to the plan for studying and maybe share how my experiences with mindfulness go.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! We can review your progress with studying and how mindfulness works for you. You've made significant steps today—remember to be kind to yourself along the way.

User: Thank you! It feels like I have a clearer perspective now, even if I still have some anxiety.

Consultant: You're welcome, Xiao Lei! It’s completely normal to still experience some anxiety, especially around exams. Just remember that you’re not alone in this journey. 

User: I really appreciate your support. I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, change takes time, but you’re already moving in the right direction. I look forward to our next session to hear about your progress. 

User: Me too, thank you! I’ll see you then.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Lei! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! Honestly, I've been feeling quite anxious, especially with the mid-term exams approaching. I’m still struggling to stay focused and manage my thoughts about my grades.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel anxious with exams around the corner. You mentioned feeling distracted; what specific thoughts are coming to your mind when you try to study?

User: I keep thinking that I won’t do well, and that makes me even more stressed. It's like a loop of negativity in my mind.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It seems like those thoughts are creating a cycle of anxiety. Can you share what feelings those thoughts bring up for you?

User: I feel overwhelmed and sometimes hopeless. It's hard to imagine getting through the exams, and I worry about disappointing my family.

Consultant: It's clear that the pressure to meet expectations can be overwhelming. I’d like us to explore those thoughts. When you think that you might disappoint your family, what evidence do you have that supports this belief?

User: I guess I don't have solid evidence. It’s just how I feel sometimes, especially after putting in the effort but still feeling like I might fail.

Consultant: It's common to feel that way, especially under stress. If you were to talk to a friend in a similar situation, how would you encourage them to view their situation?

User: I would probably tell them that they’ve worked hard and that grades aren’t the only thing that matters. But I find it hard to apply that advice to myself.

Consultant: That’s an important insight! It’s easier to be compassionate towards others than to ourselves. Let’s work on reframing your perspective to be kinder to yourself. What if you viewed your efforts as valuable, regardless of the outcome?

User: I like that idea, but it’s hard to change how I think. I feel like I’ll only be satisfied if I achieve high grades.

Consultant: I understand. It can be really difficult to shift those ingrained beliefs. What if we tried to find a balance? Acknowledging your hard work while also recognizing that grades do not define your worth or capabilities.

User: Maybe that could help. I guess I need to remind myself that learning is the main goal.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on the learning process rather than just the results can reduce some of that pressure. Have you considered setting smaller, achievable goals while studying?

User: Not really. I usually just aim for getting through a whole chapter, but maybe breaking it down could help.

Consultant: That’s a great thought! We can start small. For your next study session, how about setting a goal to focus on just a few sections? This way, you're less likely to feel overwhelmed.

User: That sounds reasonable. I’ll try it out.

Consultant: Perfect! Also, once you achieve those small goals, celebrate your progress. How does that feel for you?

User: It feels good, actually. I rarely take the time to celebrate my accomplishments, no matter how small.

Consultant: Celebrating even small victories is important. It helps reinforce positive feelings and motivates you. Have you thought about any specific rewards for yourself once you complete your study goals?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to a favorite snack or watch an episode of a show I like.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful rewards! Incorporating those treats can create a more positive association with studying. Now, aside from studying, how are you feeling in social situations with your classmates?

User: Well, I'm still feeling quite anxious when it comes to group work. I worry I won’t fit in or contribute enough.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Social settings can be challenging. Can you share what specific thoughts you have when you're in those group situations?

User: I often think that others will judge my contributions, and that makes me hesitant to speak up.

Consultant: It sounds like you're concerned about how others perceive you. Let's challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that they would judge you harshly?

User: I don’t really have any strong evidence—it’s mostly just my fear talking.

Consultant: That's an important realization! Often, our fears can amplify our insecurities. If you were to replace that thought with something more supportive, what could you say to yourself instead?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that everyone has different strengths and that my ideas are valid too.

Consultant: That’s an excellent affirmation! Remembering that everyone brings something unique to the table can help ease the pressure. Would you feel comfortable trying to contribute little by little in your next group assignment?

User: Yes, I think I could give it a try. I'll remind myself to focus on sharing my thoughts, even if they feel small.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Each step you take is a victory. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel you've gained from our discussion?

User: I feel more aware of the negative thoughts holding me back and have some new strategies to cope with studying and group work.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Xiao Lei! You have made some great progress today. Remember, the goal is to be kinder to yourself and to celebrate your achievements, no matter how small. If you ever feel overwhelmed, know that you can always come back for support.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care and I look forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Lei! I’m glad you’ve come in today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! Honestly, I've been feeling pretty anxious about this group project that I have to participate in. I really don’t like the idea of working with others and worrying that I won’t fit in.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like working with your classmates is causing you a lot of stress. Can you tell me a bit more about what specifically makes you feel anxious when thinking about this collaboration?

User: I think it's the fear of being judged by them. What if they think I’m not contributing enough? Or what if I can't keep up with their pace?

Consultant: Those fears are quite common in social situations. It seems like you’re anticipating negative evaluations from your peers. How do those thoughts affect your emotions when you think about the project?

User: They make me feel really overwhelmed and somewhat depressed. I just want to avoid the whole thing, but I know I can’t.

Consultant: It’s understandable to want to avoid situations that seem daunting. But avoiding them can sometimes reinforce those anxious feelings. Can you recall the last time you felt this way about a group task? What thoughts went through your mind at that moment?

User: Yes, it was during a class presentation last semester. I kept thinking I was going to embarrass myself. I felt so anxious that I struggled to speak.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It seems those thoughts about embarrassment can be quite powerful for you. Have you considered if there might be alternative thoughts or interpretations about that experience?

User: I guess people might have been focused on their own performances rather than judging me. But it’s hard to change that thought in the moment.

Consultant: That realization is a great start, Xiao Lei! Instead of thinking that everyone is focused on judging you, it could be helpful to remind yourself that many might be feeling just as nervous. Can we work on developing some strategies together to help you during your group activities?

User: Yes, I would like that. I want to feel less anxious and be able to contribute.

Consultant: Wonderful! One approach we can consider is gradual exposure. This means starting with smaller social situations and gradually increasing the intensity as you build confidence. Would you be open to that?

User: Yes, I think starting small could help. Maybe I can try talking to one classmate first before the project?

Consultant: Absolutely! That sounds like a good first step. How do you feel about planning to initiate a brief conversation with that classmate? What would you like to talk about?

User: Maybe I could start with asking about their thoughts on the project. It might feel easier to talk about something we both need to do.

Consultant: That's a great idea! It centers the conversation on the project and gives both of you something to discuss. How do you feel about setting a time to try this out?

User: I think I can try to do this by the end of the week. I’m a bit nervous though.

Consultant: It's natural to feel nervous. Remember, you’re taking a brave step towards overcoming your anxiety. What supportive thought could you remind yourself of when you feel this nervousness coming on?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that this is an opportunity to learn and improve. 

Consultant: Exactly! That positive reframing can make a significant difference. Now, let's talk about how to manage those anxious feelings if they arise during the conversation. What do you think could help you stay calm?

User: I think taking deep breaths might help, or even telling myself to just focus on the conversation instead of worrying about what they think.

Consultant: Those are both effective techniques! Deep breathing can help ground you in the moment. Practicing this can enhance your ability to stay present. Are you willing to practice this breathing technique before your conversation?

User: Yeah, I can do that. I think that would help me feel a little more ready.

Consultant: Great! Remember, small steps count, and each step you take builds your confidence. How do you feel overall about our conversation and the plan we’ve put together?

User: I feel more hopeful, actually. It’s good to have a plan and to think about taking small steps.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiao Lei! This progress is important. Over the next week, pay attention to how you're feeling and what you’re thinking, and we can discuss it in our next session. 

User: Yes, I’ll keep that in mind. Thanks for your help today. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes. Remember, you’re not alone in this, and I’m here to support you throughout your journey. 

User: Thank you, I appreciate that! 

Consultant: Take care, Xiao Lei, and I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you again, Xiao Lei. It feels good that you're here. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been thinking a lot about what we discussed last time. I feel a little more aware of my thoughts, but I still find it hard to handle my emotions. Sometimes I feel really lost about my future, especially at university.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're becoming more aware of your thoughts. It’s completely normal to feel lost, especially during such a significant transition. Could you share more about the specific situations or thoughts that make you feel lost about your future?

User: Well, I often find myself comparing my university life to how well I did in high school. I had everything figured out back then, but now I just feel overwhelmed and uncertain about what's next.

Consultant: I understand. The shift from high school to university can indeed be overwhelming. It sounds like you're applying some of the same expectations you had in high school to your current situation. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you feel that way?

User: I often think that I should be excelling and making friends easily, just like I did before. When I don’t, I feel disappointed and think maybe I’m not good enough for this environment.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re holding yourself to some pretty high standards. When you feel that disappointment, how does it affect your mood and your actions at university?

User: It makes me want to isolate myself. I don't feel like going out or participating in activities because I think I won’t fit in or perform well.

Consultant: That’s understandable, but isolating yourself can sometimes lead to more negative feelings. Can we explore a strategy to challenge those thoughts about not fitting in? For instance, what evidence do you have that supports this belief?

User: I guess I don’t really have any strong evidence. It’s just a feeling I have, like everyone else is doing great and I’m just stuck.

Consultant: It's important to recognize that feelings aren’t always reflective of reality. What if we looked at times when you successfully connected with others, even if it was brief? Can you recall a moment where you felt at ease in a social setting?

User: There was this one time I joined a study group, and we actually ended up laughing and sharing ideas. That felt nice.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful example! It shows that you’re capable of connecting with others. How might you remind yourself of that positive experience when those feelings of isolation creep in again?

User: I think I could write it down or remind myself that I’ve had those moments before.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Writing down positive experiences can help reinforce your confidence. Now, let’s talk about how you can actively seek out similar situations. What kind of activities or groups could you consider joining next?

User: I’ve thought about joining a club that focuses on my interests, but I feel nervous about meeting new people.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous. We can break that down into smaller steps. What if you just attended one meeting, just to observe? You wouldn’t have to jump in right away, but you would be in a social environment.

User: That sounds manageable. Just observing could help me feel less pressured.

Consultant: Exactly! Taking small steps can build your confidence over time. And if feelings of doubt arise, remember the positive experience you had with the study group. How do you feel about trying this approach?

User: I feel a little more hopeful about it. It’s good to know that I can take it slow and still be part of something.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Embracing the process of gradual exposure can be very empowering. Moving forward, let’s set some goals for the week. How about aiming to attend that club meeting and jotting down your thoughts after?

User: That sounds like a good idea. I’ll give it a try and see how it goes.

Consultant: Excellent! Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. Before we wrap up, let’s summarize what you’ve learned today and how you can maintain this fresh perspective moving forward.

User: I’ve learned that my feelings of isolation come more from my thoughts than the actual situation. I can challenge those thoughts, and it’s okay to take small steps to connect with others.

Consultant: That’s exactly right! You’re learning to identify and challenge your thoughts. As we conclude our session, what strategies can you implement to address feelings of doubt in the future?

User: I can remind myself of my past positive experiences and take gradual steps when meeting new people.

Consultant: Perfect! It sounds like you’re well on your way to nurturing a more positive outlook. Remember, if you ever feel overwhelmed again, don’t hesitate to reach out. This is an ongoing journey, and you’re making wonderful strides.

User: Thank you so much! I feel more confident about facing my challenges now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Lei! I believe in your ability to navigate this period in your life. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiao Lei! I’m glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a lot better. I've met some new friends and have been trying to engage more in social activities, which feels great. But I still sometimes doubt myself in social situations.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear that you’ve been more engaged socially! It’s completely normal to have some self-doubt. Can you tell me more about a recent social interaction that you enjoyed?

User: Sure! I went out with some classmates for coffee last week. It was a bit nerve-wracking at first, but everyone was really friendly, and I ended up having a lot of fun.

Consultant: It sounds like a great experience! What do you think helped you feel more comfortable during that outing?

User: I think just being with a group of nice people made a big difference. I also tried to focus on listening to them, which helped me feel less pressure to talk all the time.

Consultant: Focusing on listening is a fantastic strategy. It can really take the pressure off and help you connect with others. Did you learn anything specific about yourself from that interaction?

User: Yes, I realized I can relax a bit more when I’m not worried about how I’m coming across. I actually enjoyed sharing some of my thoughts too.

Consultant: That’s an important insight! It shows that you’re making progress in trusting yourself in social settings. As we move forward, are there any specific social situations you're looking forward to or preparing for?

User: I’m excited about an upcoming school event where I’ll meet more people. But I still feel anxious about not fitting in or making a good impression.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way before a big event. Let’s think about some strategies to help you manage that anxiety. What’s one thing you could do before the event to prepare yourself?

User: Maybe I could practice some conversation starters or think about topics I’m comfortable discussing to ease my nerves.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Practicing conversation starters can help boost your confidence. Would you like to try coming up with a few together right now?

User: Yes, I think that would help. I usually get stuck on what to say first.

Consultant: Let’s brainstorm a few topics. How about starting with something simple, like asking about their favorite classes or hobbies? What do you think?

User: That sounds good! I could also share something about my favorite band or movie as an icebreaker. 

Consultant: Perfect! Sharing about your interests can really open up the conversation. How do you feel about using those topics at the upcoming event?

User: I feel a bit more confident thinking about it. It helps to know I have something to fall back on if I feel stuck.

Consultant: Absolutely! Having a few go-to topics can make a big difference. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on your journey. What do you feel has been your biggest achievement in terms of your social skills lately?

User: I think just being able to put myself out there and engage with others has been a big win for me. It feels good to be more open.

Consultant: That’s a significant accomplishment, Xiao Lei! Remember to celebrate that progress, and keep reinforcing those positive interactions. How do you want to carry this momentum into the new semester?

User: I want to continue meeting new people and maybe even join a club or activity that interests me. 

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Engaging in clubs can provide more opportunities to connect with others and strengthen your social circle. We can definitely work together to ensure you stay on this positive path. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I feel more optimistic about the new semester now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s inspiring to see your growth. Just remember that it's a process, and you’re heading in the right direction. If things get tough, we can always revisit strategies together. 

User: I will keep that in mind. Thanks again for today!

Consultant: I’m glad you found our session helpful, Xiao Lei! I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next meeting. Keep up that positive attitude!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Lei! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good. I think I’ve made some progress. I’m still a bit uncertain about the upcoming semester, but overall my mood has definitely improved.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re experiencing a positive shift in your mood. What specific things do you think have contributed to this improvement?

User: Well, I’ve been hanging out with new friends more and trying to stay involved in activities. It’s nice to have that social interaction, which I didn't have much of before.

Consultant: Social interactions play a significant role in our well-being. It seems like connecting with new friends has been beneficial for you. What are some activities you’ve enjoyed doing together?

User: We’ve been playing sports and sometimes just studying together. It feels less lonely when I’m with them.

Consultant: That sounds like a great way to combine enjoyment and productivity! How has this social support affected your outlook on the upcoming semester?

User: I think it helps a lot. I feel more excited about the new classes and meeting even more people. I just hope I can keep up the momentum.

Consultant: Maintaining that positive momentum is crucial. Let’s explore what goals you could set for the new semester to help you continue this progress. What are some things you would like to focus on academically or personally?

User: I want to improve my time management skills and study more effectively. I also wish to participate in more campus events to make new connections.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! Improving time management can definitely help with your studies and give you more time to engage in social activities. How do you feel about creating a plan or schedule that supports both your academic and social goals?

User: That sounds helpful! Maybe having a clear structure can make it easier to balance everything.

Consultant: Absolutely. A structured plan can alleviate some of the stress of managing both aspects. Let’s discuss some specific strategies or tools that could aid in your organization. Have you considered using a planner or app for scheduling?

User: I’ve heard about planners, but I’ve never used one. I think I might need help figuring out how to start.

Consultant: No problem at all! A planner can be very user-friendly. We can start with simple steps. For instance, you can break down your classes and study sessions into manageable blocks. Would you like to try mapping out your week together now?

User: Yes, I’d really appreciate that! I think visually seeing my schedule could help me feel more organized.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start by noting down your class schedule and any commitments you already have. Then we can add in study and free time. How does that sound?

User: Sounds good! I usually have classes in the morning, so I can study more in the afternoons.

Consultant: Perfect. We can block out those times for studying. Also, let’s make sure to include relaxing moments and social activities. Balance is key! How about we pencil in time for hanging out with friends, too?

User: That’s a good idea. I often forget to schedule time for fun. 

Consultant: Fun is just as important as studying! It's essential for keeping that motivation up. Once we have a draft, we can adjust as needed. Does this approach feel comfortable for you?

User: Yes, it actually feels really encouraging to plan instead of just worrying about it all.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Planning can indeed shift your perspective from anxiety to anticipation. Now, looking at your goals, how do you think you can maintain your progress this semester, considering potential challenges?

User: I guess I could regularly check my planner and set reminders to keep me on track. And if I feel overwhelmed, I can talk to my friends or come back to see you.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Checking in with your planner can help keep you accountable, and reaching out to friends is an excellent way to maintain your support network. You’re building a solid foundation.

User: Thank you! I feel like I have more tools now to help me stay positive and productive.

Consultant: You’ve done amazing work during our sessions! I’m confident that with your commitment, you’ll continue to thrive. How do you feel about wrapping up today’s session?

User: I feel good! I have a plan and some strategies in mind. I appreciate your help.

Consultant: It’s been a pleasure working with you, Xiao Lei. Remember, you’ve made progress, and you can always return if you need more support. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your successes!

User: Thank you so much! I’ll keep in touch and share my experiences. Have a great day!
