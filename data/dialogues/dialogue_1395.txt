Consultant: Hello, Pengpeng! I'm glad to see you today. I understand you're starting to adapt to a new environment at kindergarten. How are you feeling about your time there so far?

User: Hi. I'm really frustrated sometimes. I get angry at the other kids and I push them. It's like I want to be the hero, like Ultraman, and fight the monsters, but I don't want to be mean.

Consultant: It sounds like you're expressing some strong feelings through your actions. You want to be a hero and protect, but sometimes that leads to pushing others. Can you tell me what happens when you feel that way?

User: When I feel angry, I just want to push, but I don’t really want to hurt anyone. I just don’t know how to say what I want.

Consultant: It's great that you’re sharing this. Feeling angry can be tough, especially when you don’t have the words to express what you want. What kinds of things make you feel like pushing happens most often?

User: Sometimes, when I want a toy and other kids won’t share, I feel like it’s unfair. I want to take it because I think I will have more fun.

Consultant: It sounds like sharing is a challenge for you in those moments. You want to have fun, but it feels frustrating when you can’t get what you want. How do you feel after you push someone to get a toy?

User: I feel bad afterwards, but then I think maybe it was okay to do it because I really wanted to play. But I also don't want my friends to be upset.

Consultant: It's understandable to have mixed feelings. You want to play and have fun, but it’s also important to think about how others react. Let’s explore other ways to express those feelings. Can you think of something you could say instead of pushing?

User: Maybe I could say "Can I play too?" but I don’t always remember to say it. I just want it right now!

Consultant: That's a great idea! Saying "Can I play too?" is a kind way to ask. It’s okay to want things right away, but practicing saying that can help you get what you want without pushing. Would you like to play a game to practice?

User: Yes! I like games! What kind of game?

Consultant: We can pretend to be in a situation where you want a toy. I’ll be a friend, and you can practice asking nicely. How does that sound?

User: That sounds fun! I want to try!

Consultant: Awesome! Let’s imagine I’m playing with a cool toy. You can come to me and try asking for a turn. Ready when you are!

User: Okay! (pretends to approach) Can I play too?

Consultant: Great job! I like how you asked. How do you feel saying that instead of pushing?

User: It feels better! I think I can make friends like this.

Consultant: Absolutely! Using words helps you make friends instead of push them away. If someone still doesn’t share, what could you do then?

User: I guess I could ask another friend to play with something else. But sometimes that feels hard too.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. It might take practice to try new things. What if we think of a fun activity you could do while waiting for your turn?

User: I could play with building blocks while I wait. I like that!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Playing with blocks gives you something fun to do, and you can still be near your friends. How do you think this could help you feel while waiting?

User: I won’t feel as angry, and I can still have fun. I won’t have to push!

Consultant: Exactly! Keeping busy with something you enjoy will help distract you. How do you think your friends will react when they see you doing that?

User: Maybe they will want to play with me if I'm building something cool!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! You might even attract them to join your play. This way, you're sharing fun instead of frustration. Doesn’t that sound good?

User: Yes! I feel happy thinking about it!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Pengpeng! You’re showing great progress in finding ways to express yourself. What do you think we should focus on next time?

User: I want to learn more about not getting so mad. I want to be a better friend.

Consultant: That's a fantastic goal! We can definitely work on calming down and being a good friend. I'm proud of you for wanting to improve. Remember, practicing is key. 

User: I will try to remember! Thank you!

Consultant: You’re welcome, Pengpeng! I'm looking forward to our next session. Keep practicing those new skills, and we’ll talk again soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Pengpeng! I'm glad to have you here for today's session. Let's have a chat about how you've been feeling lately, especially about playing and sharing with your friends at kindergarten.

User: Hi! Well, I still feel really frustrated with my friends sometimes. They don’t always want to share toys with me, and I end up getting really mad.

Consultant: I can understand that it must be tough for you when your friends don’t share. It’s normal to feel upset in those situations. Can you tell me about a recent time when this happened?

User: Just yesterday, I wanted to play with a truck, but one of the kids grabbed it away. I pushed him, and then I felt even worse afterward.

Consultant: It sounds like that was a really frustrating moment for you. You wanted to play with the truck, but it didn't go the way you hoped. What did you feel in that moment when he took the truck from you?

User: I felt really angry and sad at the same time. I didn’t like him taking my toy.

Consultant: Anger and sadness are strong feelings, especially when you just want to have fun. It's important to express how you feel, but there are different ways to handle those emotions. What do you think you could do next time instead of pushing?

User: Maybe I could ask him nicely for the truck back or wait for my turn?

Consultant: Those are both great ideas, Pengpeng! Asking nicely or waiting can help you feel more in control. It's also a way to show your friends that you want to share and play together. How do you think your friend might respond if you asked nicely?

User: I think he might give it back. I just sometimes get too mad to think of that!

Consultant: That’s completely okay! It can be hard to think clearly when we're upset. Let's practice together. Can you think of a time in the past when you were able to share well, or when a friend shared with you? 

User: Hmm, I remember that one time when I let my friend use my toy car. We had fun playing together.

Consultant: That's a wonderful example, Pengpeng! Sharing that toy car made both of you happy. How did it feel for you to share?

User: It felt good! I liked playing together!

Consultant: Awesome! It sounds like you enjoyed that experience. When you think about sharing and working with others, what are some things you can say to yourself to help you feel calm and open?

User: Maybe I can say “It’s okay to wait” or “We can have fun together.”

Consultant: Those are lovely affirmations! Saying those things to yourself can help you feel more patient and encouraged. How would you feel if you used those phrases next time you’re in a situation where you want to play with a toy?

User: I think I’d feel less mad and might have more fun.

Consultant: That's a fantastic insight! Less anger can lead to more fun, right? Now, let's think of some games or activities that can help you practice sharing and being patient with your friends. Is there a game you enjoy that involves taking turns?

User: I like playing blocks. We can build together!

Consultant: Building blocks together sounds like a perfect opportunity to practice taking turns and sharing. How about you try to have a little game next time, where you and a friend can build something together and take turns picking pieces?

User: Yeah, that sounds fun!

Consultant: Great! I believe you can do it. And remember to use those calming phrases we talked about if you start to feel frustrated. Let's also think about how we can celebrate those moments when you share and play nicely. How do you think it would feel to receive praise from a teacher for sharing?

User: It would make me really happy!

Consultant: Happiness is a wonderful feeling! We can see that those little successes can encourage you to keep moving forward. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you’ve learned or want to practice more at kindergarten?

User: I want to try sharing more and using my phrases when I feel mad.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Pengpeng! Remember, it’s completely normal to feel frustrated sometimes, but with practice, you can also find joy in playing together. I'm proud of the progress you've made. I look forward to our next session when we can talk about how it went!

User: Thank you! I'm excited to try it!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Pengpeng! I'm delighted to see you today. How are you feeling about your time at kindergarten lately?

User: Hello! I feel a bit better. I liked the parent-child activities, but sometimes I don't like it when teachers ask me to follow the rules. It makes me feel upset.

Consultant: It sounds like you enjoyed some of the activities, which is great! However, I completely understand that following rules can be challenging and make you feel upset at times. Can you tell me more about what happens when you feel this way?

User: Well, when the teacher says I have to listen, I sometimes don't want to and I want to do what I like. It feels like I'm not allowed to have fun with my friends.

Consultant: I hear you, Pengpeng. It’s tough when you feel like you can't just have fun. It's okay to want to play as well. What do you think would help you feel better when a teacher asks you to follow the rules?

User: Maybe if I could understand why the rules are important. I mean, I think some rules are okay, but others... I don’t know why I have to follow them.

Consultant: That’s a really good point! Understanding the reasons behind rules can make them easier to follow. What do you think some reasons might be for the rules at school?

User: Maybe to keep everyone safe? But sometimes it feels silly, like when we can’t run inside. I just want to play!

Consultant: You’re correct; many rules are there to keep everyone safe and happy. It’s natural to want to play. How about we think of ways to talk to your teacher about how you feel when you find rules hard to follow?

User: Um, I could tell my teacher that I don’t like some rules? But I’m scared she might get mad.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel scared. How about we practice what you might say to your teacher? You could tell her how much you enjoy playing but also share what makes following the rules difficult for you.

User: Okay, I can try that! Maybe I can say, "I really like to play, and I don’t understand why we can’t run inside."

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! By explaining your feelings, you’re opening a door for understanding. How do you feel about practicing this together?

User: I like that idea! It makes me feel a little less scared thinking of it this way.

Consultant: That's wonderful! Remember, it’s okay to express your feelings. Can we talk about other times when you felt frustrated about rules? How did you handle those moments?

User: Sometimes, I just don’t listen and do what I want, but then I get in trouble, and that makes me sad.

Consultant: It sounds difficult when you choose not to follow the rules. Let's think about different feelings you might have when you get into trouble. How does that make you feel inside?

User: I feel really sad, especially when my parents or my teacher are disappointed.

Consultant: Feeling sad is normal, especially when you care about what others think. Would you like to find some ways to handle those feelings better when they come up?

User: Yes, I want to feel happy again faster. What should I do?

Consultant: One way is to take a deep breath and remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes. You can also think about what you could do next time instead of just feeling sad. How would you like to try that?

User: I can breathe and maybe count to three before I do something. That might help!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Counting to three can give you a moment to think before acting. Can we also talk about how to feel good about following rules with your friends?

User: I like that! Maybe I can tell them it’s important, and we can help each other remember.

Consultant: Yes! Helping each other is such a supportive idea. How do you think your friends would feel if they knew you wanted to help them follow the rules too?

User: I think they might feel happy! They want to play too!

Consultant: Absolutely! And when everyone understands and helps each other, it creates a fun environment. How do you feel about your thoughts on rules now compared to before?

User: I feel a bit better. I think understanding helps a lot!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Pengpeng! Remember, it’s a learning process. We can keep practicing together. What are you most excited to try at school this week?

User: I’m excited to practice talking to my teacher and my friends about the rules!

Consultant: That’s fantastic! I believe in you, and I’m sure you’ll do great. Let's meet again to share what worked well for you. Sound good?

User: Yes! Thank you, I feel better about it all now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm proud of you for wanting to try. Remember, it's okay to keep learning, and I’m always here to support you. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Peng Peng! I'm glad to see you today. I know you've been working hard to get along with your teacher and friends at school. How have things been going for you lately?

User: Hi! I think I'm getting a bit better with my friends, but I still feel a bit nervous around my teacher. Sometimes I just want to run away when she talks to me.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you're feeling more comfortable with your friends! It’s completely normal to feel nervous with new people, especially teachers. Can you tell me more about what makes you feel nervous when your teacher talks to you?

User: Well, I just feel like she doesn't like me very much. When she calls on me, I sometimes forget what I want to say. It makes me scared.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling like she doesn't like you. It can be hard to speak up when you're frightened. What happens in your mind when you feel scared in those moments? Can you share any thoughts that come up?

User: I think… maybe she thinks I'm not smart or I’m doing something wrong. Then I feel really small and want to hide.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, thinking about what your teacher might be thinking. However, sometimes our thoughts can trick us. Do you think there might be other reasons for how she acts, or do you think you might be imagining things?

User: Maybe... but it feels real. I don’t want her to be mad at me, and I just want to do everything right.

Consultant: Wanting to do well is a good feeling, but feeling scared isn't fun. Let’s try to think about it from another angle. If a friend told you they felt nervous because they thought a teacher didn’t like them, what would you tell them?

User: I think I would say to just try to talk to the teacher and not worry too much.

Consultant: That’s a wise thought! Talking might help you feel better and understand her more. What if we think of a fun way you could talk to your teacher? Perhaps playing a little game or asking her some questions can help break the ice?

User: A game sounds nice! What kind of game can I play with her?

Consultant: Great idea! How about a little quiz game where you can ask her questions about her favorite things? It could help you get to know her better and make her seem less scary!

User: That sounds fun! I’d like to know her favorite animal or color.

Consultant: Wonderful! Asking about someone’s favorite things is a great way to start a conversation. How do you think you will feel after you ask her those questions?

User: I think I might feel a bit brave. Maybe even happy if she answers.

Consultant: Absolutely! Feeling brave and happy is a great goal. Remember that each time you try, you’re getting stronger. Is there something you could do to remind yourself to be brave before you talk to her?

User: I could think about my favorite things too, and that helps me smile.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea, Peng Peng! Focusing on your happy thoughts can help calm you down. How about we practice together? What’s one happy thing you can think about right now?

User: I like playing outside with my friends. It makes me feel good!

Consultant: Playing outside is such a joyful activity! When you think about that while talking to your teacher, how do you think it might change how you feel?

User: Maybe I won’t be so scared. I can feel happy and remember having fun.

Consultant: Yes, exactly! By bringing those happy feelings with you, you can create a positive experience. Let’s set a small goal for the next week. Can you try to ask your teacher one question about her favorite things?

User: Yes! I can do that! I’ll try to remember my happy thoughts.

Consultant: You're already doing so well, Peng Peng. I’m proud of you for making this plan! We can talk about how it went in our next session. Are you feeling good about this?

User: Yes, I’m excited to try! Thank you for helping me.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Peng Peng! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experience. You’re getting better at expressing yourself, and I believe you can do this. Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous, and I’m here to help you through it.

User: Okay! I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: See you, Peng Peng! Keep practicing those happy thoughts. I’m looking forward to our next session together.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm so glad you're here for this session. How have things been for you lately at kindergarten?

User: Hi. I've been feeling excited about showing my toys during the sharing session. I really want to connect with my classmates and tell them stories about my toys.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear that you're eager to share and connect with your classmates. Can you tell me more about how it felt when you shared your toys?

User: It felt really fun! I could see my friends listening, and some even started to share their own toys too.

User: Yes, I think so! I want to be friends with them, and sharing helps.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing is a great way to build friendships. Now, let's think about how you can continue to practice these social skills in the future. Are there any specific situations where you'd like to apply what you’ve learned?

User: Maybe when we play games outside. I sometimes feel a bit shy when it's my turn to speak.

Consultant: That's a great observation, Pengpeng! Feeling shy in those moments is quite common. How do you feel when it’s your turn to speak?

User: I get nervous, and I sometimes forget what I wanted to say.

Consultant: It’s really normal to feel nervous. Let's try to explore some strategies that might help you feel more confident. What do you think could help you remember what you want to say when it’s your turn?

User: Maybe I can think about what I want to say before it’s my turn?

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Taking a moment to think can really help you gather your thoughts. Would it feel comfortable to practice that when you're playing outside?

User: Yes! I want to try that.

Consultant: Great! We can even think of some examples of what you might want to say. What are some things you could share with your friends during games?

User: I could tell them about my favorite toy or how to play a game. 

Consultant: Those are perfect topics! Sharing your favorite toy or game could spark interesting conversations. How do you think your friends would react?

User: They might like it! I hope they join in and share too.

Consultant: That’s a lovely thought! Encouraging them to share as well can make for a fun experience. Have you practiced sharing your ideas with anyone at home?

User: I told my mommy about my toy stories, and she seemed happy. 

Consultant: That's wonderful! Sharing with your mommy is a great way to practice. How did it feel to share your stories with her?

User: It felt nice. She listened carefully and asked questions.

Consultant: That's a fantastic way to engage! Listening and asking questions are essential parts of effective communication. How do you think you might do that with your friends too?

User: I can ask them what their favorite toys are when I share mine!

Consultant: Excellent strategy! Asking questions encourages conversations and helps you connect even more. Do you feel prepared to try this out in your next outdoor game?

User: Yes, I will definitely try!

Consultant: I'm so proud of your progress, Pengpeng! Let’s keep focusing on these skills. How can we celebrate your successes? 

User: Maybe I can tell my parents when I try this next time!

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your successes with your parents can reinforce your achievements. Remember, connecting with your friends takes practice, and you’re already doing so well. 

User: Thanks! I feel better about trying now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s great to see your motivation and excitement. As we wrap up today, what would you say has been the biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I'm excited to share more and be brave with my friends!

User: I will! Thank you for helping me.

Consultant: It’s my pleasure, Pengpeng! I'm here to support you. Keep up the fantastic work, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today, Pengpeng. How have you been feeling lately, especially in the kindergarten?

User: Hi! I feel good! My parents and teacher have been really supportive. I'm enjoying my time with my friends and learning new things!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Pengpeng! It sounds like you're having a positive experience. Can you tell me more about the interactions you’ve had with your parents and teacher?

User: My parents listen to me more now and play with me. They ask me about my day at school, and we talk about my friends. My teacher also encourages us to share and play together.

Consultant: That sounds like a great environment to be in! How do you think these changes have affected your feelings or behaviors at school?

User: I feel happier and more confident. I like participating in activities and I don’t feel scared to speak up in class anymore.

Consultant: That's fantastic, Pengpeng! Confidence is so important. What specific activities do you enjoy the most in school now?

User: I really like drawing and playing with blocks. I also enjoy singing and dancing during music time!

Consultant: Those sound like fun activities! Drawing and playing can really help with expressing yourself. How do your friends react when you do these activities together?

User: They like it! We often work together on our drawing projects. Sometimes we even create stories around our drawings, and everybody has fun!

Consultant: That sounds like such a creative and collaborative environment! Creating stories together must make your drawings even more exciting. Have you noticed any changes in your emotions when you're drawing or playing with friends?

User: Yes! When I’m drawing, I feel peaceful, and when we play, I feel really happy. I sometimes get a little upset if I can’t do something right away. 

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel a little upset sometimes. When you feel that way, what do you do to help yourself feel better?

User: I try to take a deep breath and remember my friends are there to help. I also tell myself that it’s okay to ask for help.

Consultant: Engaging in your activities is a wonderful idea! It not only helps you but also allows them to understand what you enjoy. Would you like to think of specific times they can join you for these activities?

User: Maybe on weekends? We could have family drawing time!

Consultant: A family drawing time sounds excellent! Spending dedicated time together can strengthen your bond. How about your experiences at kindergarten? Are there any challenges you face that we can discuss?

User: Sometimes I feel shy when I meet new kids. I want to play but I’m not sure how to start.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel shy when meeting new friends. We could try a fun role play to practice how you might approach new kids. Would you like to give that a try? 

User: Yes, that sounds fun! 

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you see a new kid at the playground. How would you approach them?

User: I would say “Hi! Do you want to play with me?” 

Consultant: That’s an excellent way to start! You’re showing friendliness and inviting them to join you. How do you think the new kid would respond?

User: Maybe they would say yes! Then we could play together!

Consultant: Absolutely! You have a good plan. Remember, if you feel shy, you can always take a deep breath first. How do you feel about using this approach in the future?

User: I feel more confident now! I think I can try it.

Consultant: That’s the spirit, Pengpeng! I believe you can do it! Let’s review what we’ve discussed today and the strategies you can use. What do you think are the most important things to remember?

User: To take deep breaths, ask for help, and play with my family!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Pengpeng! I’m glad you enjoyed it. Keep practicing those strategies, and remember, you can always come back if you want to talk more. Have a fantastic day!

User: Bye! I will practice!
