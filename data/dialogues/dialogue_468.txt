Consultant: Hello Josephine! I’m glad you’re here for today’s session. I know you've been working on rebuilding your self-esteem and gaining a sense of control over your life. Can you share how you've been feeling lately, especially after what you've gone through recently?

User: Hi. I’ve been trying to be strong and regain my confidence, but I still feel really anxious about everything. The recent incident with my partner has left me shaken, and now with the risk of losing my newborn, it’s overwhelming.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of anxiety right now, particularly related to safety and your relationship with your newborn. That must be incredibly difficult. What specifically has been on your mind regarding these fears?

User: Well, I constantly worry about whether I’ll be seen as a fit mother after everything that’s happened. I feel like my past with the eating disorder might come back to haunt me, especially with my partner’s accusations.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel this way, especially given your history and the recent stressful events. It can be hard to separate your past from your present experiences. Can you tell me about the thoughts that come to mind when you think about being a mother and what you fear might happen?

User: I keep thinking that I’m not good enough and that others believe I’m a failure. I worry that if I make one wrong move, it will be used against me in court, and I’ll lose my baby.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very heavy to carry. It's important to challenge these negative beliefs. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you’re not a good mother, and are there any counterexamples that show you might be doing well?

User: I guess I do spend a lot of time caring for my baby, and I’ve tried to keep a routine. But inside, I'm still haunted by my past and the fear that it defines me.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize the positive actions you’ve been taking as a mother. Just because you’ve faced challenges in the past doesn’t mean you’re doomed to repeat them or be viewed negatively. How do you think it would feel to separate your past from your role as a mother?

User: That would feel liberating, but I just don’t know how to do that. I still hear everyone’s judgments in my head.

Consultant: It’s very common to struggle with self-judgment, especially after experiencing trauma. One strategy that might help is to create a list of positive affirmations that combat those negative thoughts. What might some of those affirmations look like for you?

User: Maybe something like "I am a loving mother" or "I’m doing my best." But it feels hard to believe them sometimes.

Consultant: Those affirmations are a great start! The challenge is to practice believing in them regularly, even when it feels tough. We can also explore ways to confront those negative judgments when they arise. How would you feel about discussing how to build a safety plan for yourself, especially regarding interactions that could trigger those judgments?

User: I think a safety plan sounds helpful. I want to feel prepared and secure, especially regarding my partner and the legal issues.

Consultant: Absolutely. A safety plan can help you feel more in control and provide you with strategies to protect your emotional well-being. Let’s start by identifying situations that make you feel most vulnerable. Can you think of interactions or environments that trigger your anxiety?

User: Definitely, being around my partner makes me extremely anxious. Also, I fear talking to authorities about my situation.

Consultant: It’s understandable that those situations cause anxiety. Knowing your triggers allows us to create strategies to manage your emotions during those times. How about setting boundaries with your partner? What are some limits you think would help you feel safer around him?

User: I think I need to avoid conversations about the baby with him until I feel more stable. That would help me a lot.

Consultant: That sounds like a wise decision. Setting boundaries is an important part of self-protection. What other supports do you think could help you maintain your stability during this time?

User: I have a friend who understands my situation. I think leaning on her more could be really beneficial.

Consultant: That's a fantastic resource! Having someone you trust to support you can make a significant difference. How can you encourage yourself to reach out to her when you’re feeling overwhelmed?

User: I can text her when I need to talk, even if it feels hard to admit I need help.

Consultant: That’s a great plan. Remember, it’s okay to ask for help. It shows strength, not weakness. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on some practical steps you can take moving forward. What is one thing you’d like to focus on before our next session?

User: I want to practice those affirmations every day and keep my safety plan in mind. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal, Josephine. Starting with affirmations and your safety plan can help reinforce your sense of control and confidence. I’m proud of the progress you’re making. Remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time. Looking forward to hearing how it goes in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: Hello Josephine! I'm glad to see you today. I understand that you have been feeling anxious about the custody process and the pressures that come with it. Can you share more about how you’ve been feeling lately?

User: Hi! Yes, it’s been really stressful. I constantly worry about what will happen with the custody arrangements for my newborn. The uncertainty is overwhelming, and I keep second-guessing myself.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult, Josephine. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed in such an uncertain situation. What specific thoughts or worries tend to come to your mind when you think about the custody process?

User: I often think that I'm not a good enough mother and that I might lose custody. I keep imagining the worst-case scenarios, which makes everything feel even more pressing.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts create a lot of anxiety for you. Recognizing those worst-case scenarios can certainly be distressing. What kind of emotions do those thoughts trigger for you?

User: I feel anxious and sometimes even helpless. It’s like I’m stuck in this cycle of worrying and then not being able to act on what I need to do.

Consultant: That feeling of being stuck can be really frustrating. It seems like you’re experiencing a mix of anxiety and helplessness. Let’s try to unpack one of those thoughts. When you think you're not a good enough mother, how true do you feel that statement is? 

User: It feels very real sometimes, especially with everything that's happening. I just can't shake off that feeling.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, Josephine. Let’s explore this thought for a moment. What evidence do you have that supports this belief about being a 'not good enough' mother? Can we find any evidence that might challenge that thought?

User: I guess I do care deeply for my baby and try my best. There are moments when I feel sure of myself, but the insecurity creeps in when I think about the custody battle.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you care so much and recognize your efforts. Those moments of confidence suggest that there is another perspective you can hold. If a friend were to tell you they felt this way, what would you say to them?

User: I would probably remind them of all the things they do well and that they shouldn't be so harsh on themselves.

Consultant: Exactly! You’d offer them reassurance and compassion. You deserve that same kindness. Reflecting on both perspectives can help find a balance. How do you think you could begin to challenge that feeling of being 'not good enough' in moments when it arises?

User: Maybe I could take a moment to remind myself of my strengths and the love I have for my baby. That might help me stay grounded.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy, Josephine! It can practice turning those negative thoughts around. Another technique we can explore is relaxation. Have you ever tried any deep-breathing exercises to help manage your anxiety?

User: I’ve heard of them but haven’t really tried it. I am not sure if it would help.

Consultant: It’s definitely worth a try! Deep breathing can be a simple yet effective way to calm your mind. Would you like to practice a brief exercise together right now?

User: Sure, I’d like to try that!

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four... (pause for breathing) and now breathe out through your mouth for a count of four. Let’s do this a few times together. How do you feel after that?

User: I feel a bit more at ease, actually. That was nice.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Josephine! It can be a valuable tool to have in your toolbox for moments of stress. Moving forward, how can you remind yourself to use these tools when you face anxiety about the custody process?

User: I could set reminders on my phone or even write it down somewhere visible in my home. 

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! Having visual reminders can be very helpful. As we move forward, it’s important to also establish support networks. Do you have someone you can talk to about your feelings?

User: I have a couple of friends, but I often hesitate to talk about my worries with them. I feel like I need to put on a brave face.

Consultant: It’s common to feel that way, but sharing your thoughts can relieve some pressure. How can you take small steps in opening up to them about what you're going through?

User: Maybe I could start by sharing just a little of what I've shared with you. It doesn’t have to be everything all at once.

Consultant: That sounds like a sensible approach, Josephine. Starting small can help you gauge their reactions and support. You mentioned earlier that trust is a factor; do you think this gradual sharing could help you feel more secure in those relationships?

User: Yes, I think so. It’s way less daunting to share bits rather than all at once.

Consultant: Exactly! Building trust takes time, and those small steps can make the process feel more comfortable. As we wrap up today, what do you think was the most important takeaway from our session?

User: I found the breathing exercise and the reminder to challenge my negative thoughts really helpful. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Josephine. Remember, it’s all about finding strategies that work for you. You’ve made progress today towards managing your anxiety. For our next session, we can continue working on trust and openness in your relationships. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good. Thank you for helping me today!

Consultant: Thank you for sharing with me, Josephine. You’ve done well today. I’ll see you next time, and remember, it’s okay to lean on others. Take care!

Consultant: Hello Josephine! It’s nice to see you today. I understand you want to improve your comfort level in social situations. Can you share with me how you’ve been feeling about seeking support through social media?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit lost, to be honest. I want to connect with others, but I find it so hard to open up. It’s like there’s a wall I can’t get past.

Consultant: That sounds tough. It's brave of you to seek support. Let’s explore that wall you're feeling. What thoughts come to mind when you think about opening up to others?

User: I worry that no one will understand me or that I’ll say something embarrassing. It's just easier to keep things to myself.

Consultant: I understand those fears. They can feel really overwhelming. How does holding everything in affect your feelings and daily life?

User: It makes me anxious and a bit isolated. I feel like I’m missing out on connecting with others, but I don’t know how to bridge that gap.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way, especially when you’re trying to find that connection. What steps have you taken or thought about taking to reach out to others?

User: I’ve tried to comment on posts and participate a little, but I still hesitate. It’s like my fingers freeze when I want to type something meaningful.

Consultant: That’s a good first step, even if it feels small. Sometimes, starting with small interactions can help build confidence. What do you think would help make those interactions feel less daunting for you?

User: Maybe if I could practice what I want to say or have some prompts to guide me, I could feel more comfortable.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Practicing can definitely ease those feelings. Let’s brainstorm some phrases or questions you could use when you want to engage. How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful! I've thought of asking about others’ experiences, but I’m not sure how to frame it.

Consultant: Asking about others' experiences can be a wonderful way to connect. You might say something like, “I would love to hear how you've been managing challenges lately.” It opens the door for conversation. How do you feel about that approach?

User: That feels good! It’s something I can relate to, and it feels less pressure on me to share my own issues right away.

Consultant: Exactly, it creates a space for dialogue. Now, let's think about setting some small goals for your interactions. Would it be manageable for you to aim for one supportive comment each week on a platform you feel comfortable with?

User: I think I can handle that. Just one isn’t too overwhelming!

Consultant: Perfect! One step at a time can make a big difference. How do you feel about trying that and reflecting on how it goes afterward?

User: I feel more motivated to try! I like the idea of reflecting on it afterward. It could help me see my progress.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflecting helps us recognize our growth and understand what works for us. What emotions do you expect to feel after you engage in those comments?

User: I hope I’ll feel a bit proud and more connected. But I’m also worried I’ll feel anxious again after.

Consultant: It's natural to have mixed feelings. Celebrating the pride is important, even if anxiety arises. Remember, feeling anxious doesn’t negate your progress. If anxiety comes up, we can discuss ways to cope then. 

User: That makes sense. I would like some tips for managing that anxiety when it comes up, if that's okay.

Consultant: Of course! One technique is deep breathing. When you feel anxiety rising, take a moment to breathe deeply—inhale for a count of four, hold for four, and exhale for four. This can help ground you.

User: I’ll definitely give that a try! It sounds simple enough.

Consultant: That’s the key—simplicity helps. We can also visualize success. Picture yourself commenting with confidence; how does that imagery feel to you?

User: It actually makes me feel hopeful. I can imagine it, and it feels nice.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Visualizing success can motivate you. As we wrap up today, let’s recap your goals: start doing one supportive comment each week and practice deep breathing for anxiety management. How do you feel about those goals?

User: I feel optimistic! They seem achievable, and I think I can manage them.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Josephine. Remember, it’s about taking small, manageable steps. You’re doing great so far, and I'm here to support you. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey; I look forward to hearing about your success. Until next time!

User: Bye! I’m looking forward to it too!

Consultant: Hello, Josephine! I'm glad to see you for our session today. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. Participating in the community support group helped me connect with others. But I still feel anxious about sharing my experiences.

Consultant: That's great to hear that you felt some improvement! It sounds like being part of that group gave you a sense of connection. Can you tell me more about what specific moments made you feel anxious while sharing?

User: Well, during my turn to speak, I felt my heart racing, and I worried about what people would think of my story. I wanted to be open, but the fear just sort of took over.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel anxious in such situations. Sharing personal experiences can be daunting. Let's explore those thoughts together. What were some of the negative thoughts that crossed your mind during those moments?

User: I kept thinking that my experiences weren't as valid as others or that people would judge me. I felt like I would embarrass myself.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really overwhelming. It's interesting to note how they influence your feelings. Let’s challenge those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that your experiences are less valid than those of others?

User: I suppose I don’t really have concrete evidence... It's just something I tend to feel. Maybe I'm just being too harsh on myself.

Consultant: It's common to be our own harshest critics. If a friend were in your shoes, what might you tell them about their experiences being valid?

User: I would tell them that everyone has their own struggles, and it’s okay to share them. No one is judging them.

Consultant: Exactly! We tend to extend kindness to others but forget to offer the same to ourselves. Let's practice a bit. If you were to share your story, what would a kinder and more supportive way of thinking about it be?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that my story matters and that sharing it could actually help someone else feel less alone.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization! Shifting your focus to the potential positive impact of your sharing can help lessen that anxiety. Would you be willing to try a little role-play practice for your next group meeting?

User: I think that could be helpful. I’d like to practice what I would say in a supportive environment.

Consultant: Perfect! I’ll play the role of a supportive group member. Why don’t you start by sharing a snippet of your experience as if we were in the group?

User: Okay, um... “Hi, everyone. I'm Josephine, and I want to share about my journey with struggling to find my sense of self while adjusting to being a new mom…”

Consultant: That’s a great start! You’re introducing yourself sincerely. How did you feel saying those words out loud?

User: A bit nervous, but also relieved. It felt good to just say it.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! The nervousness is natural, but expressing yourself can bring a sense of relief. How do you think you could manage that anxiety while speaking in the group?

User: Maybe I can take a deep breath before speaking and remind myself that it’s okay to feel nervous. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Deep breathing can help center you in those moments. Let’s also discuss some positive affirmations you can tell yourself beforehand. What do you think would help?

User: Maybe I could say, “My story is valuable, and it’s okay to share it.” 

Consultant: That’s a great affirmation! Remembering this before you speak can help ground you. As you progress, try to focus on the potential connections you could be building instead of just the anxiety. 

User: Yes, that makes sense. Focusing on connection feels much more positive.

Consultant: I’m glad you feel that way! Looking ahead, what strategies can you use in your next group meeting to remind yourself of your affirmation?

User: I could write it down and keep it with me, maybe even say it quietly to myself before speaking.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea, Josephine. Keeping it visible will serve as a reminder. Before we conclude, would you like to reflect on the progress you've made since joining the support group?

User: I think I've come a long way! I feel like I'm starting to embrace my experience rather than hide from it. 

Consultant: That’s such a valuable insight! You've shown considerable strength and courage. As we wrap up, how do you plan to reinforce this newfound confidence moving forward?

User: I want to continue participating actively and focus on sharing without fear of judgment. 

Consultant: I believe in you, Josephine! You’re making incredible strides. Our next session can focus on assessing your experiences in the group further and refining your strategies. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. I’ll keep working on this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure to see your growth, and I look forward to hearing all about your experiences in our next session. Remember, you have the power to shape your narrative! 

User: Thank you again! I feel more hopeful about sharing my story now. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Until next time, take care and keep believing in yourself.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Josephine! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. After the support group, I received some positive feedback which really boosted my confidence. I feel like I'm gradually taking more control of my life.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re experiencing a significant increase in your self-efficacy. What specific areas of your life are you focusing on right now for continued improvement?

User: I’ve been trying to create a more structured routine for myself, especially with the baby around. I want to make sure I’m managing my time effectively.

Consultant: A structured routine can definitely help in creating that sense of control. Can you share what small goals you've set for yourself to help you achieve this?

User: I’ve started to plan out my tasks each day. For example, I’ll aim to spend certain times just taking care of myself, like having a quiet moment or exercising a bit. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great approach! How do you feel when you accomplish these small tasks? 

User: It feels rewarding. I find that even small victories make me feel more competent and in control. 

Consultant: It’s amazing how even small achievements can have a positive impact on our emotions. How do you plan to keep that momentum going?

User: I think I can maintain it by tracking my progress and rewarding myself when I stick to my plan. 

Consultant: Tracking your progress is an effective way to recognize your accomplishments. What kind of rewards do you consider for those moments?

User: Maybe treating myself to something nice, like a warm bath or a favorite snack. It’s about finding little joys in the day.

Consultant: Those sound like lovely rewards! Would you like to explore any particular challenges you anticipate while trying to maintain this routine?

User: I sometimes worry that I might not stick to my plan, especially when things get hectic with the baby. 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. What thoughts come up when you consider the possibility of not sticking to your routine?

User: I fear that I’ll feel like I’ve lost control again, and it might lead me back to a negative mindset.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those fears. Let’s examine them a bit. What evidence do you have that not sticking to your plan will lead to losing control?

User: Well, in the past, when I didn’t stick to a plan, it did lead to me feeling overwhelmed. 

Consultant: I see. However, it’s also important to recognize that you’ve made strides since then. How might those past experiences influence how you approach setbacks now?

User: I guess I’ve learned that it’s okay to have setbacks as long as I can bounce back. I want to be kinder to myself.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! What might being kinder to yourself look like when facing these challenges?

User: I think it would mean giving myself a break and not being so harsh if I miss a task or two. Maybe I could adjust my plans instead of feeling defeated.

Consultant: Exactly! Flexibility can help you maintain that control without overwhelming yourself. Can we brainstorm ways to build this flexibility into your routine?

User: Sure! Perhaps I can have backup plans for days when things don’t go as expected, like smaller goals or relaxing if I need it.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Having alternative strategies can reduce stress. How does this make you feel about sticking to your routine?

User: I feel more confident. Knowing I have options makes me less anxious about sticking to my plan.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It seems like you’re developing a more compassionate relationship with yourself. Moving forward, how can you remind yourself of this newfound flexibility in your daily life?

User: I could write reminders about being flexible and kind to myself on a sticky note around the house.

Consultant: That’s a practical strategy! How are you feeling about your overall progress we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel really positive! I have a clearer picture of what to do and how to approach challenges.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, let’s think about maintaining this momentum. What do you envision for our next session?

User: I would love to evaluate how my routine has been, and maybe discuss any challenges I faced.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan. It’s important to monitor your progress and keep improving. Remember, you’re doing great, and it’s okay to ask for help if needed. I'm looking forward to hearing about your journey next time!

User: Thank you! I'm excited to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Josephine! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling lately, especially after the positive progress in your legal situation?

User: Hi! I’m feeling really good, actually. The legal outcome lifted a huge weight off my shoulders. I feel more in control of my life, especially as a new parent.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great that you’re feeling lighter and more in control. Let’s take a moment to evaluate the improvements you've made. What specific changes have you noticed in your confidence and overall well-being?

User: I’ve been more engaged with my baby and less overwhelmed by anxiety. I’m gradually learning to trust myself more as a mom. It feels like I’m making progress every day.

Consultant: It’s really heartwarming to hear that you’re embracing your role as a mother and feeling more confident. What activities or routines have you adopted that you think have contributed to this positive change?

User: I’ve started setting small goals for myself each day, like going for a walk or simply reading a book. It helps me feel accomplished without overwhelming myself.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Setting small, achievable goals can really help reinforce your sense of control and achievement. How do you feel emotionally after accomplishing these daily goals?

User: I feel satisfied and proud of myself. It’s encouraging to see that I can take small steps and still feel good about it.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Josephine. Celebrating those small successes is important for maintaining positive momentum. Looking ahead, what are some areas you would like to focus on to ensure your emotional stability and support in the long run?

User: I want to keep building my confidence and maybe even find some community support, like a group for new moms. Connecting with others could really help.

Consultant: Connecting with other new parents is an excellent idea! It can provide emotional support and shared experiences. Have you thought about what kind of community or group would resonate with you?

User: I haven’t looked much into it yet, but I think a local mom group that meets regularly would be beneficial. I could share my experiences and learn from others.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Establishing a support network can help reinforce your progress and provide encouragement. Would you like to explore some strategies to begin researching or joining such a group?

User: Yes, I would appreciate that. I sometimes feel intimidated about reaching out to new people.

Consultant: Completely understandable. Taking that first step can be daunting. Let’s break it down. We could start by identifying local resources, like community centers or online platforms where groups may be advertised. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds doable. Maybe I could start by looking on social media or community boards online.

Consultant: Absolutely! Social media can be a great resource for finding local parent groups. You could also consider connecting with a couple of friends to see if they have any recommendations. When do you think you might start looking into these options?

User: I can look into it this weekend. I really want to take that step.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic commitment for the weekend! Remember to be kind to yourself as you explore these options. It's all about taking one step at a time. After you've done that, we can discuss your experiences and feelings about joining a group, if you’d like.

User: That makes me feel better, thanks! I’ll definitely keep that in mind.

Consultant: You're welcome, Josephine! It’s great to see you so motivated. Before we finish today, let’s summarize the progress you've made and the next steps, shall we?

User: Sure! So, I’m feeling more confident and in control as a new mom. I’ve started setting daily goals, and my next step is to look into joining a mom group.

Consultant: Exactly! Those are significant strides you’ve made. Keeping that momentum will be essential as you move forward. How do you feel about your progress so far?

User: I feel really good about it. It’s reassuring to see tangible progress.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! As we wrap up today’s session, remember that you have the tools and strategies to maintain this progress. If challenges arise, reach out for support when needed, and know that you’re not alone in this journey.

User: Thank you for your support. It really helps to talk everything through.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Josephine! You've done a wonderful job today. If you ever need to check in again, don’t hesitate to reach out. Good luck with your plans for the weekend!

User: I will! Thank you again. See you next time!

Consultant: Take care, Josephine. See you soon!
