Consultant: Hello, Xiaohau! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been really upset because of what happened with my teacher. He doesn't understand me at all and it feels really unfair.

Consultant: It sounds very frustrating for you. You feel that your teacher is not recognizing your feelings or interests, which has left you feeling upset. Can you tell me more about what happened?

User: My teacher separated me from the girls and made me sit with the boys. It feels like he's trying to control who I can talk to. I'm really angry about it.

Consultant: I can understand why you would feel anger and frustration. You want to be able to connect with the people you feel comfortable with, which is completely natural. How has this situation affected your overall feelings at school?

User: I just feel more isolated now. I don’t want to hang out with the boys, but I can’t speak up against the teacher. It’s like I’m being punished.

Consultant: It feels very isolating when you can't be around those you connect with. And having to stay quiet about your feelings can be really hard. What do you wish you could say to your teacher about how you feel?

User: I wish I could tell him that I just want to be myself and have the freedom to choose who I want to sit with. It feels like he doesn't accept me.

Consultant: It’s important to feel accepted and be yourself, especially at your age. It seems that you want to express your identity but feel restricted. What do you think would happen if you expressed those feelings to him?

User: I think he’d just dismiss me or get angry. It’s like he has this idea of how boys should behave, and I don’t fit into that.

Consultant: That must feel really discouraging. It seems like you’re thinking about his possible reactions a lot. Can we explore how those thoughts make you feel and if they’re entirely accurate?

User: I guess it makes me feel hopeless because it feels like I can’t change his mind. But then I think if I keep quiet, I won't get anywhere either.

Consultant: It’s a tough spot to be in, feeling like you have to choose between expressing yourself or keeping the peace. Sometimes, reframing your thoughts can help. What evidence do you see that he wouldn't listen, or is it possible there’s a chance he might understand?

User: I don’t know. Maybe he wouldn’t listen, but deep down, I want to believe he could change. It’s just hard because he always seems so strict. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have hope. Would it help if we brainstormed some ways that you might communicate your feelings to him in a way that feels safe for you?

User: I think that could be good. I just need some guidance on how to do it without making it worse.

Consultant: Okay, let’s approach this step by step. You might start by expressing how you feel—instead of making it about his actions, you could talk about how they affect you. For example, saying "I feel left out when..." How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds okay. I guess I can try that. I just have to find the right words.

Consultant: Finding the right words can be challenging, but take your time. Writing it down might also help you organize your thoughts. What would you like to include in your message to him?

User: I want to say that I feel sad and frustrated being separated from the girls. I just want a chance to be comfortable.

Consultant: That’s a great start. You’re being honest about your feelings, which is so important. How do you think he might react to this message?

User: I hope he’d understand. But part of me is still scared he won’t take it seriously.

Consultant: It’s perfectly natural to feel scared. If he doesn’t react the way you hope, how might you handle your feelings about that situation?

User: I guess I’d have to remind myself that my feelings are still valid and that I deserve to express them, no matter his reaction. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Your feelings are valid and deserve to be heard. It’s a powerful shift in thinking to hold on to your self-worth regardless of how others respond. What other steps do you think you could take to cope with this situation moving forward?

User: Maybe I can talk to friends who support me more about this issue. I might also try to find things in school that make me feel good, like joining clubs.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Connecting with supportive friends and engaging in positive activities can really help improve your mood and give you a sense of belonging. How do you feel about these plans?

User: I feel a bit better thinking about them. It gives me hope that I can change things for myself, little by little.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, change doesn’t have to happen all at once. It’s about taking those little steps towards feeling more comfortable and accepted. How do you feel about our discussion today?

User: I feel grateful! I got to express my feelings and think of ways to handle this better. It feels nice to have a plan.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that. You've made great progress in understanding your feelings and planning how to communicate them. In the future, if things get tough, remember you can always reach out. Do you feel ready to implement the ideas we discussed?

User: Yes, I think I can try. Thank you for listening and helping me through this.

Consultant: You're very welcome. It's been a pleasure to support you. Remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time. I look forward to hearing how it goes next time we meet!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Hao! I'm glad you're joining me today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been really frustrated. I can't seem to get close to the girls in my class and it's messing with my focus. I feel like my relationship with my teacher is getting worse too.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of frustration and perhaps even some confusion about your feelings towards both your classmates and your teacher. Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to engage with the girls or when you're in class?

User: Well, when I try to talk to the girls, I feel really awkward and it just doesn't go well. In class, I can't concentrate on what the teacher is saying because I'm worried about how they see me, and I feel like my teacher doesn’t understand me at all.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, Xiao Hao. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when you're trying to connect with others and feeling misunderstood. What specific thoughts are running through your mind when you feel awkward around the girls or when you're in class?

User: I think things like, "They won't like me," or "The teacher is just annoyed with me." These thoughts make me feel even more anxious.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy and negative. They must create a lot of pressure for you. Let’s reflect for a moment—what evidence do you have that the girls won’t like you or that your teacher is annoyed with you?

User: I don’t know… maybe it’s just how I feel. Sometimes I catch the teacher looking at me in a disapproving way, and I see the girls laughing and I feel left out.

Consultant: It's tough to feel excluded, especially when those feelings are backed by confusion. However, it might be worth considering that there may be other interpretations for their behavior. What would you think if someone else came to you with similar thoughts?

User: I guess I would tell them to not worry too much and that people are often not thinking about you as much as you think they are.

Consultant: Exactly! If you can apply that same perspective to your situation, it might help ease some anxiety. How about we explore techniques to help you focus better in class and manage these anxious feelings?

User: That sounds good. I really want to improve my focus.

Consultant: Great! One technique is to practice short intervals of focused attention followed by breaks. This can help you manage distractions and ease your mind. Have you tried anything like that before?

User: I've heard about it, but I haven’t really tried it yet because I’m worried I won’t stick to it.

Consultant: That’s a common worry. Let's break it down step by step. Start with just 10 minutes of focused work on your schoolwork, then take a 2-3 minute break. It’s manageable, right? And I’ll help you brainstorm some ideas for those breaks.

User: Okay, I think I can do that.

Consultant: Wonderful! And when you feel anxious about your teacher or classmates during those times, remember to take a deep breath and remind yourself of that different perspective we talked about. Would that be helpful for you?

User: Yes, I think so. But sometimes I feel like it’s hard to remember to do that when I’m anxious.

Consultant: It's completely understandable. It takes practice to change those thought patterns. Maybe we can create a simple reminder for you to have on your desk? Something that encourages positive thinking or reminds you to take a breath when you feel overwhelmed.

User: That could help, I think I would definitely look at it if I had something like that.

Consultant: Let's design something together! What phrase or image would feel comforting for you? Something that reminds you to relax or to challenge negative thoughts?

User: Maybe something like “It’s okay to be me” or something that tells me I’m trying my best.

Consultant: I love that idea! “It's okay to be me” is a beautiful affirmation. How about we write it down and maybe even decorate it so it's visually engaging? 

User: Yeah, I can do that! That would make it more fun.

Consultant: Absolutely! Making it fun can help reinforce that positive message. Now, let’s talk about your relationship with your teacher. You mentioned feeling like he doesn’t understand you. Can you think of a moment that made you feel that way?

User: There was a time when he scolded me in front of the class for not participating, and it made me feel really small and like he didn’t care about how I felt.

Consultant: That must have been a really hurtful experience. It sounds like it’s contributing to your current feelings of frustration with him. What would you like to communicate to him about how you feel, if you had the chance?

User: I want him to know that I do want to participate, but it’s hard for me because I feel nervous and judged.

Consultant: That’s an important message! If you felt comfortable, perhaps you could approach him and share that. It might help him understand your perspective better and could open up a more supportive dialogue. How does that idea sound to you?

User: I like the idea, but I still feel a bit scared thinking about it.

Consultant: Fear is completely natural, especially in situations like this. Perhaps you could start by writing down your thoughts. That way, you can gather your feelings and even practice what you want to say before expressing it. Does that feel more manageable?

User: That does sound less intimidating. I can start by writing things down.

Consultant: That’s a productive step forward! In time, you might even feel more comfortable speaking directly to him. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. How has thinking about these strategies made you feel in this moment?

User: I feel a little better, like maybe I can actually try some of these ideas.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiao Hao! Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. Now, as we wrap up for today, what will be your focus moving forward? What’s the first step you want to take?

User: I'll start by writing that positive phrase for my desk and try the short study breaks.

Consultant: Fantastic plan! I believe you can do this. And always remember, it's okay to ask for help when you need it. You’re doing really well by taking these steps to improve your situation. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm here for you whenever you need support. Take care, and I look forward to hearing how it went next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Hao! Welcome back to our session. I'm here to listen and help you with what’s been on your mind. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite anxious, especially regarding my interactions with the teacher and my classmates. It seems harder for me to express myself.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're struggling with anxiety when it comes to communication, particularly with your teacher and classmates. Can you share more about what specific situations make you feel this way?

User: Well, whenever the teacher asks questions in class, I feel a knot in my stomach, and I worry that I won’t respond correctly. It’s like everyone is looking at me, and I freeze.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult to experience. It seems that the fear of being judged or not responding well intensifies your anxiety. What thoughts go through your mind in those moments when you're called upon?

User: I think that everyone will laugh at me if I mess up. I also feel that my classmates don’t really understand me or get my interests.

Consultant: That’s a tough place to be in, feeling misunderstood and fearing ridicule. When these thoughts arise, how do they make you feel emotionally?

User: They make me feel really anxious and sometimes even sad. It makes me hesitate to participate in class discussions.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you perceive potential judgment from others. Let’s identify some of these thoughts more clearly. Have you considered whether those thoughts are entirely accurate or if they may be a bit exaggerated?

User: I’m not sure. Maybe I am being too hard on myself. But it still feels very real when I’m in the moment.

Consultant: It sounds like there might be a disconnect between your thoughts and the reality of the situation. Could we explore alternative perspectives together? For instance, what evidence do you have that supports the belief that your classmates would laugh if you make a mistake?

User: I guess I don’t really have solid proof that they would laugh. It's just a fear I have.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, Xiao Hao. Sometimes our minds can create fears that aren't based on facts. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them to think or feel about their own performance?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay not to be perfect.

Consultant: Exactly! It seems like you have a more compassionate perspective when thinking about others. What if you tried applying that same kindness to yourself? 

User: I think that could help. It just seems hard to do in the moment.

Consultant: It is definitely challenging, but with practice, it can become easier. What if we started by discussing small steps you could take in class to implement this kinder self-talk?

User: Maybe I could practice talking to myself positively right before the class starts?

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Preparing yourself with positive affirmations before class could help shift your mindset. Would you be willing to try that for your next class?

User: Yes, I can give it a shot. But I still feel nervous when I think about actually speaking in class.

Consultant: That is completely normal. Facing those feelings is part of the process. How about we also brainstorm some low-pressure ways you can start communicating in class, perhaps with a friendly classmate or in smaller group settings first?

User: That sounds good. Maybe I could start by asking a question to a friend instead of the whole class.

Consultant: That’s an excellent way to ease into it! Practicing with a close friend can build your confidence and reduce the pressure. Are there any specific friends you feel comfortable approaching?

User: Yes, there are a couple of girls I often talk to, and they seem to understand me.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you have friends you connect with. Starting there can make a big difference. As you practice, allow yourself to feel proud of taking those steps. 

User: I will try that. But what if I still feel anxious even after trying?

Consultant: It’s okay to feel anxious even after trying—progress isn’t always linear. Let’s think about some coping strategies you could use if anxiety arises. This could include deep breathing exercises or reminding yourself of the positive self-talk we discussed.

User: That makes sense. Having a plan for when I feel anxious will definitely help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Having coping strategies can create a greater sense of control over those feelings. Before we wrap up, let’s outline your main takeaways from today. What are the key points you want to remember moving forward?

User: I want to remember to be kinder to myself, practice talking to my friends first, and have some coping strategies ready.

Consultant: Those sound like powerful takeaways! I believe you’re on the right track toward understanding and accepting yourself better. It’s normal to feel challenged, but with these steps, I’m hopeful you can start to feel more comfortable.

User: Thank you! I feel a little more hopeful now, even though I know it’ll be a process.

Consultant: And that's a vital recognition—progress takes time. If you encounter difficulties, remember that it’s okay to reach out. For our next session, we can review how things have gone and adjust your strategies as needed.

User: Okay, I’m looking forward to it. Thank you for your guidance!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Hao! I’m here to support you, and I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care until we speak again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaohao! It's great to see you again. I'm here to support you. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel a bit hopeful because I've noticed my teacher is trying to understand me more. But I still feel like I don’t completely fit in, especially with the boys in my class. It's exhausting.

Consultant: I hear you; it sounds like you’re experiencing both some positive changes and ongoing challenges. Can you elaborate on how your interactions with your male classmates have been lately?

User: Well, I’ve tried to join in on some conversations, but I still feel awkward. They talk about things I’m not really interested in, and I end up feeling left out.

Consultant: That sounds tough, feeling left out can be really draining. It’s good that you’re trying to engage, though. What activities or topics do you think you could share with them that you might enjoy, or at least find common ground?

User: I honestly don't know. I guess I don’t have much in common with them, and I’m not sure how to bridge that gap. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Let’s explore this together. Imagine you were in their shoes for a moment. What might they find interesting or appealing about your hobbies or interests?

User: I suppose they might find my love for gaming relatable, but I just associate gaming with my closer friends, who are girls.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Gaming is a widely shared interest among many. Could sharing a gaming experience or discussing a popular game be a way for you to connect with the boys?

User: Maybe... But I worry they'll judge me for hanging out more with girls.

Consultant: It’s natural to worry about being judged, especially in social situations. Remember, many people share interests regardless of gender. What if instead of worrying, you tried to focus on the joy of sharing something you love? 

User: I guess if I looked at it that way, it might feel less scary. 

Consultant: Exactly! Building connections takes time, but starting from a place of shared interest can ease the process. Can you think of a specific gaming topic you might bring up next time you chat with them?

User: Yeah! There’s a new game coming out that everyone’s excited about. I could mention that.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! Sharing that excitement could open up a conversation. How do you feel about approaching them with this topic?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. It’s a step I haven’t taken before.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful way to frame it—nervous yet excited! It’s all part of stepping out of your comfort zone, which can be very beneficial. Would it help to think of what you might say or questions you can ask to keep the conversation flowing?

User: Yes, thinking of some questions would be helpful. What should I ask?

Consultant: You might ask them what their favorite games are or if they've seen anything interesting related to the new game. Open-ended questions can help keep the conversation going.

User: That sounds doable. I'll try that!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! What’s your action plan for approaching this situation? 

User: I’ll try to bring it up next week. I’ll mention the new game, and focus on listening to what they think.

Consultant: Fantastic! Just remember, it’s okay to feel a little awkward at first—many people do. The key is staying engaged. Beyond this next interaction, how would you like to build on your social skills with the boys?

User: I think practicing role plays could help me feel more comfortable talking to them. 

Consultant: Role playing is a great strategy! We can set up some scenarios where you can practice those conversations. Would you like to try a quick role play now?

User: Sure! I think that would be good.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you’re in a group of boys at school, and you’ve just brought up that new game. I’ll be one of the boys. Ready? 

User: Yes, let’s do it!

[The session continues with practice and exploration of scenarios, as Xiaohao feels more comfortable discussing strategies and enhancing his interactions.] 

Consultant: I think you're doing really well! As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the new strategies we’ve discussed?

User: I feel more optimistic. I’m actually looking forward to trying them out.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re really growing in acceptance and willingness to engage. What’s one actionable step you’ll take before we meet again?

User: I’ll definitely try to start a conversation about the game!

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Keep that momentum going, and remember that it's okay to take it one step at a time. Feel free to reflect on how it goes and share your experiences in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaohao! I'm proud of you for taking this initiative. I look forward to hearing all about your progress. Take care until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaohao! I'm glad we're meeting again today. I remember our last session focused on your experiences with group activities. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty good. I tried a few more activities with the boys, and it was actually fun. I’m starting to feel more open about working with them.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It seems like you've made some positive steps in your interactions. Can you share a bit more about how it felt to participate in those activities with the boys?

User: Well, at first, I was a bit nervous, but once I got into it, I found that I could have fun and not worry so much about fitting in. It felt nice to be part of the group.

Consultant: It sounds like you really pushed yourself out of your comfort zone, and it's wonderful that you enjoyed it. What do you think helped you feel more relaxed during these activities?

User: I guess I tried to focus on the fun rather than worrying about what others think of me. I mean, I wanted to enjoy myself too.

Consultant: Focusing on enjoyment instead of judgment is a fantastic approach! It indicates a positive shift in your mindset. Is there anything specific you did that helped you shift your focus?

User: I just kept reminding myself that everyone was there to have fun, just like me. It made it easier to connect with them.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Shifting your focus to shared experiences can create a sense of connection. As you continue this journey, how would you like to further explore your interactions with the boys?

User: I’d like to join more group activities or maybe organize something myself. I feel like it could help me connect more with them.

Consultant: Organizing your own activity sounds like a wonderful idea! It can also show your leadership skills. What kind of activity are you considering?

User: Maybe a game day or something where we can compete in friendly matches. I think it would be fun and help us bond.

Consultant: That sounds like a very engaging way to bring everyone together! What emotions do you anticipate feeling when you organize such an event?

User: I suppose I’d feel excited but also a little anxious about whether they would enjoy it.

Consultant: Those emotions are completely normal, especially when trying something new. How do you think you could manage that anxiety as you prepare for the event?

User: I think by planning it out step by step and maybe involving a couple of friends to help. It would take some pressure off me.

Consultant: Involving friends could definitely ease your anxiety and make the event more enjoyable for everyone! Have you discussed this idea with any of your friends yet?

User: Not yet, but I think I’ll bring it up with them next time we hang out.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! It’s also a good way to strengthen your friendship. As you think about this upcoming discussion, what thoughts do you have that might hold you back?

User: I worry they might think it's a silly idea or that it won't be fun.

Consultant: Acknowledge those thoughts; it’s common to feel uncertain. But remember, when you focus on what you believe will be enjoyable, you invite positive experiences. How can you challenge that concern about it being a silly idea?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that everyone has different ideas of fun. If I think it’s a good idea, some will probably agree.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful way to reframe your thoughts! Emphasizing your perspective can help you become more confident in sharing your ideas. What have you learned about your ability to connect with others through this process?

User: I think I’m learning that it’s okay to be different and to have my interests. I don't have to change who I am to get along with others.

Consultant: That's a significant insight, Xiaohao! Embracing your uniqueness while connecting with others is key. As we can reflect on your progress today, how do you feel about the skills you’ve developed so far?

User: I feel like I’ve improved a lot, especially in being more open and willing to try new things. It’s empowering.

Consultant: That sense of empowerment is so important! As you continue to use these skills, how can you make sure to maintain this positive momentum in future interactions?

User: I think I’ll keep trying new activities and remind myself that it's okay to step away from my comfort zone. I also want to keep involving my friends.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Regularly challenging yourself and involving friends will help reinforce your confidence. As we wrap up today, what do you believe is your biggest takeaway from our sessions together?

User: I’ve learned that being open to new experiences and working with others is really rewarding. It makes me feel connected and understood.

Consultant: That's an invaluable takeaway, Xiaohao! Being connected and understood is a beautiful experience, and I have no doubt you’ll continue to foster these relationships. If you face challenges in the future, remember to lean on these skills. Thank you for sharing so openly today!

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help. I feel more prepared to keep moving forward and trying new things!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Hao! I'm glad to see you again. Today, I’d love to hear about how you’ve been feeling regarding your social interactions since our last session. How has everything been going for you?

User: Hi! It's been pretty good, actually. I feel like I've been more comfortable with my classmates. They seem to understand me better now, and my relationship with my teacher is also improving.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It seems like you’re experiencing some positive changes in your relationships at school. Can you share more about what specific interactions have felt better for you?

User: Well, I've been able to join conversations more easily, and I'm not as shy anymore. I even shared a joke in class the other day, and everyone laughed! It felt great.

Consultant: That must have felt really rewarding! Sharing a joke and having a positive response can greatly boost your confidence. How did you feel before you shared that joke?

User: I was a bit nervous at first, but I decided to just go for it. I think I felt more assured because I believe my classmates like me.

Consultant: It's fantastic that you had that sense of assurance! It sounds like you’re beginning to see yourself in a more positive light. How do you think this newfound confidence will help you with your social interactions going forward?

User: I think it will help me speak up more and join in activities without feeling anxious. I want to keep building those friendships.

Consultant: That’s a great intention! Building friendships is a valuable skill. Have you thought about any specific strategies you can use to maintain and further develop these connections?

User: Hmm, maybe I could invite a classmate to work on a project together or join a club? I think that might help.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Reaching out for collaborative work and engaging in shared interests can strengthen bonds. How do you feel about taking one of those steps soon?

User: I feel excited about it! I think I can ask someone in class next week.

Consultant: That’s a positive approach! Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. If you encounter any hesitations, we can address those together. What could help you if you feel nervous about reaching out?

User: I think having a plan in mind would help. Like knowing what to say or how to start the conversation.

Consultant: Planning can certainly give you a sense of control in those situations. Would you like to brainstorm a couple of conversation starters or topics that could come in handy?

User: Yes, I’d like that! Maybe I could ask about homework or school projects as a start.

Consultant: Those are perfect topics! They’re relevant and can lead to longer conversations. Would you like to practice a scenario right now to feel even more prepared?

User: Sure! Let’s do it!

Consultant: Great! Let’s say you approach a classmate. I’ll play the role of your classmate. You can start the conversation with your opener.

User: Okay, here goes. "Hi! Have you started working on the science project yet?"

Consultant: That sounds good! I’d respond, "Not yet, I’ve been a bit busy. How about you?"

User: I could reply, "I’ve started thinking about it, but I’m not sure what direction to take."

Consultant: Perfect! That gives your classmate a chance to share their thoughts as well. How does practicing this make you feel?

User: It feels less intimidating now. I think I can really do this!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Building this confidence is key. Before we end our session today, let’s recap some of the progress you’ve made. What do you think has been your biggest achievement since our last meeting?

User: I think being able to share jokes and joining in more on conversations is huge for me!

Consultant: Absolutely, that’s a significant step forward! It shows that you’re comfortable expressing yourself, which is a fantastic achievement. Do you feel ready to continue using these social skills in other areas of your life?

User: Yes, I feel more prepared now.

Consultant: That’s excellent to hear! Remember, it’s all about keeping that progress going. If you face any challenges in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. You’ve developed useful skills that can guide you forward.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and advice.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in you and your ability to keep growing. Today’s session has gone well, and I’m glad to have witnessed your progress. Looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session!

User: Me too! I’ll keep you updated.

Consultant: Perfect! Take care, and I look forward to seeing you next time!
