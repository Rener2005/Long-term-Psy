Consultant: Hello, little friend! I'm really glad you're here for today's session. I understand things have been a bit tough for you lately. Can you share with me how you've been feeling recently?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really anxious and upset. I can’t seem to sleep at all, and I’m also hearing this ringing in my ears. It feels overwhelming sometimes.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult, especially with the ringing and not being able to sleep. It must be exhausting for you. Can you tell me more about what’s been happening that might be causing these feelings?

User: My parents have been fighting a lot, mostly about my studies. It makes me feel really stressed, and I just want them to stop. I feel like it’s my fault, and then I get mad for no reason.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure from the arguments at home, and it’s understandable that you might think it's related to you. Let’s explore how these fights affect your feelings. How do you usually cope when this happens?

User: I don’t really know...sometimes I just lock myself in my room. I feel so guilty and sometimes I hurt myself, which makes me feel worse afterward. 

Consultant: It's really brave of you to share that. I can imagine it feels like a heavy burden to carry, feeling guilty and trying to cope on your own. Let's work on understanding those feelings better. When you hurt yourself, what are you thinking at that moment?

User: I just feel like I can’t take it anymore. I think maybe if I hurt myself, it’ll make me feel better, but it really doesn’t. 

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that. It sounds like you’re trying to find some relief from your emotions, but it’s not helping in the way you hope it would. What would you say is the main feeling you have before you hurt yourself? 

User: Mostly just a lot of sadness and anger combined, I guess. I feel like no one understands me.

Consultant: It's tough to feel like you're carrying those heavy emotions all alone. When you're feeling sad and angry, have there been any thoughts that come to your mind, like things you tell yourself during those times?

User: I often think things like “I’m not good enough” or “I’ll never be happy.” 

Consultant: Those negative thoughts can be incredibly heavy to bear. They can cloud how you see yourself and the world around you. What if we tried to challenge those thoughts? Can you think of any evidence that shows you are good enough or that happiness is possible?

User: Sometimes I do well in school or have fun with my friends, but it’s hard to remember those things when I feel bad.

Consultant: Exactly! Those moments are important to hold onto. You have strengths too, and it’s okay to acknowledge them. How about we make a list of positive things about yourself and times when you have felt happy, even if they seem small? 

User: That could help, I guess. I’ve had some nice moments with friends, like playing during recess. 

Consultant: That’s a great start! It’s wonderful that you have those moments. Let’s write down “playing with friends during recess” and anything else that comes to mind. Focusing on these experiences can help shift your perspective when you’re feeling down. 

User: Sure! I think I can do that.

Consultant: Wonderful! And remember, it’s natural for emotions to fluctuate. What’s important is how we respond to them. Would you like to talk about some strategies to cope better when you feel overwhelmed, especially when your parents are arguing?

User: Yes, I definitely need help with that. 

Consultant: One thing we could try is deep breathing exercises. This could help calm you down when you start to feel stressed or upset. Would you be open to practicing that together now?

User: I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment to breathe in deeply through your nose, hold for a count of three, and then slowly breathe out through your mouth. We can do this a few times together. Ready? 

User: Okay, I’m ready. 

Consultant: (After practicing together) That feels refreshing, doesn’t it? Deep breathing can be a powerful tool to help you feel calmer. 

User: Yes, it really helps! 

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that. Remember, you can use this whenever you need it. Let’s continue to build on this. How do you think your sleep might improve if you started to use these calming techniques before bed?

User: I guess if I’m calmer, I might not feel so anxious trying to sleep. 

Consultant: Exactly! A calmer mind can lead to better sleep. It might take time, but small steps like this can really help. 

User: I hope so. 

Consultant: I believe in your ability to navigate this. As we continue our sessions, we’ll keep working on these skills and explore other coping strategies together. What do you hope to achieve by our next meeting? 

User: I want to feel less sad and maybe sleep better. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! Let's focus on creating a plan to work towards that. You’re already taking a big step just by being here. 

User: Thanks! I feel a little better already. 

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that. Remember, it's a journey, and you don’t have to go through it alone. We’re in this together. 

User: Yes, it helps to talk about it. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Keep in mind, it’s perfectly okay to reach out whenever you’re feeling overwhelmed. Our next session will focus on what you’ve tried and how you’re feeling. 

User: Okay, I’m looking forward to it! 

Consultant: Me too! You’re doing great, and I’m proud of you for opening up. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello Xiaofan! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed. I still struggle with my sleep and sometimes I get really worried when my parents argue.

Consultant: It sounds tough. Recognizing that your parents’ arguments affect your emotions is an important insight. Can you share more about what goes through your mind during those times?

User: When they fight, I feel so anxious. I think it’s my fault, like if I had done something differently, they wouldn't have fought.

Consultant: I see. You feel a sense of responsibility for their arguments, which is a heavy burden to carry. Do you think it’s realistic for you to feel responsible for their actions?

User: I guess not. I mean, I know it’s their issues, but I still feel that way.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially as a young person trying to make sense of adult problems. Let’s try to reframe this thought. What would you say to a friend if they felt responsible for their parents’ arguments?

User: I would tell them it’s not their fault and that they shouldn’t worry about it.

Consultant: That’s a kind and wise perspective. Now, can you try to apply that same thought to yourself? Maybe remind yourself that their disagreements are not your responsibility.

User: I can try, but it’s hard sometimes.

Consultant: It's okay to find it challenging. Change takes time, and it’s a process. Let’s also explore how these thoughts affect your emotions. When you think it’s your fault, how does that make you feel?

User: It makes me really sad and anxious. I feel like I don’t have any control.

Consultant: Acknowledging those feelings is a big step. When you feel sad and anxious, what do you usually do to cope with those emotions? 

User: I sometimes want to hurt myself to feel something else, but I know that’s not good.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It’s important to find safer ways to deal with overwhelming emotions. Have you tried any relaxation techniques, like deep breathing?

User: Not really. I don’t know how to do that properly.

Consultant: No problem! We can practice together. Deep breathing can help calm your mind and body. Let’s try it now. Take a deep breath in through your nose... hold it for a moment... and now slowly breathe out through your mouth. How does that feel?

User: It feels a bit relaxing. I think I liked that.

Consultant: That’s great to hear, Xiaofan! You can use this whenever you feel anxious. Let’s keep practicing these techniques together. When you practice deep breathing, what else would you like to achieve for your emotional health?

User: I want to feel more in control of my feelings and not be scared of them.

Consultant: Feeling in control of your emotions is a strong goal. What do you think could help you achieve that feeling?

User: Maybe learning to talk about my feelings more, instead of just keeping them inside.

Consultant: Absolutely! Talking about your feelings is very important. It helps reduce their intensity. Have you thought about who you can talk to when you feel overwhelmed?

User: I think I could talk to my mom, but I worry she’ll just get upset.

Consultant: It’s normal to worry about that. Maybe you can express to her that you just want to share how you feel, without needing her to fix anything. Would you feel comfortable trying that?

User: I think I could try. It might be nice to share with her.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Sharing your feelings can help strengthen your relationship. As we continue to explore your feelings, how do you feel about the progress you've made so far?

User: I feel a bit better. It’s nice to know I can talk about these things.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Recognizing that you can talk about your feelings is a significant step. What are some feelings you’d like to address next?

User: I want to learn to manage my fears better, especially about school. 

Consultant: Fear of school can be challenging. Let’s discuss specific situations that scare you. What comes to mind?

User: Sometimes I worry about group projects. I fear that others will think I’m not good enough.

Consultant: That’s a common fear, and many people experience it. Can we break that thought down? What evidence do you have that supports or challenges the idea that you’re not good enough?

User: Well, my teachers say I do a good job, but I still doubt it when I’m with classmates.

Consultant: It’s helpful that you have positive feedback from your teachers. Let’s try to focus on that evidence. When you start to doubt yourself, remind yourself of those positive affirmations. Would that help?

User: Yes, I think so. I should hold onto the good things I’ve heard.

Consultant: Absolutely! Positive affirmations can be powerful. We’ll practice this more in our sessions. As we wrap up today, what do you think will be your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I learned that it’s okay to talk about my feelings and that I can try breathing techniques to help when I'm anxious.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! I'm proud of your progress. As we move forward, let’s continue to build on these skills. Remember, it’s a journey, and you’re doing great. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about managing my emotions now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaofan! It’s been wonderful working with you. I look forward to our next session. Remember, you have the tools to support yourself.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaofan! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately, especially after talking with your teacher?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better actually. I was encouraged by what my teacher said, but sometimes I still doubt myself and feel a bit nervous in social situations.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling better. So, it sounds like your teacher's encouragement has had a positive impact on you. Can you tell me more about those moments when you feel nervous? What thoughts come to mind during those times?

User: When I'm in class and have to speak up or interact with others, I often worry that I might say something silly or that others won’t like me. It makes me want to stay quiet.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really challenging. It sounds like you're afraid of being judged. What kind of feelings do those worries bring up for you? 

User: They make me feel anxious and sometimes even a bit sad. I wish I could just be more confident when talking to my classmates.

Consultant: I understand, feeling anxious can be tough. It seems that you want to be confident in those social situations. Let’s try to challenge those worries a bit. When you think about saying something silly, do you think there's actual evidence that supports that thought? Or could there be a different perspective?

User: I guess I don't have evidence, but it just feels real in the moment. I often compare myself to others who seem so much more outgoing.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Comparing ourselves to others can often lead to negative thoughts. If a friend were feeling this way, how do you think you would advise them to think about their situation?

User: I would probably tell them that it's okay to make mistakes and that everyone has their own strengths.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! It sounds like you recognize that everyone is unique. What if you applied that same advice to yourself? How might that change the way you feel in those situations?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it's okay to be me and that I don't have to be perfect. 

Consultant: That's a great realization, Xiaofan! Practicing that self-compassion can be very helpful. Let's work on creating some positive self-talk statements together. What’s something you like about yourself that you could remind yourself in those moments?

User: I guess I'm good at listening and helping others. 

Consultant: Absolutely! You should definitely remind yourself of that. "I am a good listener and I can contribute in my own way." Let’s write that down. How does it feel to acknowledge that part of yourself?

User: It feels nice. I feel a bit more relaxed thinking about it.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let’s keep nurturing that positive feeling. Now, can you think of any recent times when you've felt good about yourself or contributed positively in your interactions?

User: Last week, I helped a classmate with their homework. They thanked me and seemed really happy.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful experience to reflect on! Helping others showcases your strengths. Let's write that down as a positive experience. How did it make you feel when they thanked you?

User: It made me feel proud and happy. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Feeling proud of your actions can be a powerful motivator. In addition to writing it down, how can you channel that feeling into your current interactions?

User: Maybe I can look for more opportunities to help others. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Engaging in those positive behaviors can really help boost your confidence. How about we set a small goal for you? Perhaps you can aim to help a classmate or join a group discussion this week?

User: I can try! Maybe I'll speak up during our next group project.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! Speaking up during a group project is a great way to practice. Remember to use your positive self-talk if you start feeling nervous. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel excited but also a little scared.

Consultant: That makes sense! It’s perfectly normal to feel both excited and scared about new challenges. Just remember, each time you step outside your comfort zone, you're further reinforcing your positive experiences. How about we talk a little more about how to manage that fear when it comes up?

User: Yes, that would help.

Consultant: Great! One technique is to take a few deep breaths before you speak up. You can also visualize the positive outcomes of your contributions. Imagine your classmates responding positively, just like during your homework experience. 

User: I like that idea. Visualizing it sounds helpful.

Consultant: It can be very powerful! Remember, Xiaofan, you’re developing these skills to shift your perspective. Before we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you plan to do. What are the key takeaways for you?

User: I will work on my positive self-talk, try to help others more, and speak up in the next group project!

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! As we conclude today, I want you to remember how far you've come. You’ve already started to embrace your self-worth. How do you feel about your progress?

User: I feel proud. I believe I can do this!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Always cherish those positive moments and keep building on them. If you ever need guidance, don't hesitate to reach out. I believe in you!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaofan! Take care and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Fan! I'm really glad you decided to come for this session today. How have you been feeling lately, especially after trying to join the interest group at school?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. Joining the group has been fun, and I've made some new friends. It’s like I can finally be myself a bit more!

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear that you're feeling more yourself and enjoying your experience in the group. Can you share what activities you’ve been doing that have contributed to this positive feeling?

User: We’ve been doing art projects and playing games together. I feel really happy when I'm creating something or just laughing with my friends.

Consultant: Creating art and sharing laughter with friends are such fulfilling activities! It sounds like both are helping you maintain a positive emotional state. How has this experience impacted your feelings toward your studies?

User: I feel like I'm more motivated to study because I want to impress my friends and share what I learn with them. It feels more fun now.

Consultant: That's a fantastic perspective! It’s admirable how you've connected your friendships with your motivation to study. What specific goals do you hope to achieve in your studies moving forward?

User: I want to keep my grades up and maybe even get better at subjects I struggle with. I think having my friends around will help me with that.

Consultant: It’s great to set goals for your academic performance, especially with the support of your friends. Are there any particular subjects that you find challenging right now?

User: Math is really tough for me. I often feel lost during the lessons, and sometimes I get frustrated.

Consultant: Frustration is a common feeling when we struggle with something challenging like math. Can you tell me what thoughts go through your mind when you feel lost in class?

User: I think maybe I'm not smart enough, or that I’ll never get it right. It makes me want to give up.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when things get tough. However, many people face similar challenges. Let’s explore those thoughts a little more—Is there any evidence that supports the belief that you’re not smart enough?

User: I guess not. I do well in other subjects, but math just seems harder.

Consultant: Exactly! Just because one subject presents more difficulties doesn’t define your intelligence. If a friend were to tell you they felt like they weren’t smart enough, what would you say to them?

User: I would tell them that it’s okay to struggle and that they just need to keep trying. Everyone has things they find tough, right?

Consultant: Absolutely! Everyone has unique strengths and weaknesses. It’s about persistence and support. What do you think might happen if you approach math with that same mindset of persistence?

User: Maybe I wouldn't feel so discouraged? It could help me try harder instead of giving up.

Consultant: That's a positive outlook! Shifting your thoughts can help you tackle challenges more effectively. Would you be willing to try focusing on progress rather than perfection in math?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. I’ll try to celebrate small victories, like completing a problem or understanding a concept.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! Celebrating those small victories is key to building confidence. Moving forward, how do you feel about balancing your studies and your interests? 

User: I want to make sure I spend time on both. I think they help each other out, you know?

Consultant: Absolutely! Balancing both can lead to a more fulfilling experience overall. What strategies can you think of to ensure you dedicate time to your studies while still enjoying your activities?

User: Maybe I can set aside certain hours for studying and still save time for my art and hanging out with friends afterward.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid strategy! Prioritizing your time can help you feel accomplished in both areas. How do you feel about sharing your academic progress with your friends?

User: I think it would be nice! They could encourage me and we can help each other out.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Having a support system can make a big difference. As you continue this journey, what are some ways you can keep communicating openly with your friends about your challenges?

User: I guess I can just be honest with them. If I don't understand something, I can ask for help or tell them I’m feeling stuck.

Consultant: Being open about your challenges is a great approach. It encourages a healthy dialogue and a supportive environment. With all these things in mind, can you reflect on how you’re feeling about your family environment? Has that changed for you as well?

User: I think so. Since I’ve been happier, my mom has noticed and she’s been more encouraging. It feels nice.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you’re experiencing a more positive dynamic at home! Encouragement can significantly boost your confidence. What would you like to explore further regarding your family relationship?

User: I wish we could talk more openly like I do with my friends. It would help us understand each other better.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight. Communicating openly with family can improve understanding and connection. What steps do you think you can take to encourage more conversations with them?

User: Maybe I can start by sharing my day with them and asking about theirs. That feels like a good start!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! Sharing your experiences can encourage them to open up as well. As we conclude our session today, how do you feel about the progress you've made in managing your emotions and nurturing your relationships?

User: I feel really good! I have some solid ideas on how to keep moving forward, both with my studies and at home.

Consultant: I’m really proud of what you’ve accomplished today, Xiao Fan. Remember, you have the tools to navigate your feelings and relationships. Whenever you need support again in the future, I’m here for you!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaofan! I’m glad to see you again. It sounds like things have been getting better at home. How are you feeling about that?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel a bit happier because my parents have been talking more. It makes me feel more relaxed at home, but I sometimes worry if they’ll go back to being distant.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re feeling happier and more relaxed. It’s normal to have worries about changes in family dynamics. Let’s explore that. Can you share more about what changes you’ve noticed with your parents?

User: Well, they have dinner together more often now, and sometimes they even ask me about my day. It feels nice to be included, but I just hope it lasts.

Consultant: It sounds like those moments of connection are really meaningful for you. Being included in family discussions can make you feel valued. What do you think contributes to this improvement in communication?

User: I think my mom is trying hard to make us closer because she realized that it was tough for me when my dad was away all the time. I feel like they are both trying.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that your mom is making an effort to bring everyone together. It shows care and consideration. How does that make you feel about your role in the family now?

User: I feel more important. I think my opinions matter more now, and I like that they want to hear what I think.

Consultant: That’s a lovely feeling, Xiaofan! Feeling important and heard can really boost your confidence. How has this shift in family dynamics impacted your own thoughts and feelings about yourself?

User: I guess I feel more confident. I used to think I wasn’t good enough or that no one wanted to hear me. But now, I feel like I can share my thoughts without being afraid.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift in how you view yourself! Feeling that you can express yourself freely is an important part of building self-esteem. Can you think of a specific situation where you felt this change?

User: Just last week, I told them about a problem I had at school with a classmate, and they really listened. I felt good sharing that.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Sharing your thoughts and feelings is a big step toward building trust and communication in your family. How did that experience impact your relationship with your parents?

User: I think it brought us closer. They didn’t just listen; they also shared their own experiences. It made me feel understood.

Consultant: It sounds like that openness has fostered a deeper connection. Understanding each other's experiences can strengthen bonds. What do you think you can do to maintain this positive dynamic in your family?

User: Maybe I could keep sharing my thoughts more often and encourage them to talk about their day, too. That way, we all stay connected.

Consultant: That’s a great idea, Xiaofan! Encouraging open conversations can help everyone feel connected. What emotions do you anticipate you might face as you continue to foster this communication?

User: I might feel anxious sometimes, worried that I won’t say the right thing or that they won’t respond well.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel anxious, especially when being open and honest. We can work on strategies to cope with that anxiety. How would you describe your thoughts when you feel this way?

User: I usually think, "What if they don’t listen?" or "What if they get upset?" It makes me hesitant.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite daunting. Let’s challenge them together. How accurate do you think those concerns are? Have your parents shown that they care about what you say?

User: They have listened and responded well, so I guess my fears aren’t entirely accurate. It’s just hard to shake them off.

Consultant: Recognizing that is a strong step! Your fears might be rooted in past experiences. What alternative thought can we explore that counters these worries?

User: Perhaps I could think, "They care about what I say, and our conversations are valuable." That sounds more positive.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on that positive thought can help shift your mindset. As you practice this new way of thinking, how do you envision it affecting your confidence in communicating?

User: I think it will help me feel more at ease to speak up without worrying too much. It’ll make sharing feel lighter.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! Feeling at ease can significantly improve your interactions. What steps can you take to reinforce this mindset during conversations at home?

User: I could remind myself to breathe and focus on the positive moments we’ve had together. That might help calm my nerves.

Consultant: Excellent strategy! Taking deep breaths and recalling positive moments can ground you during conversations. As we reflect on our sessions, what do you feel you’ve learned about yourself and your family dynamics?

User: I’ve learned that I can influence our communication positively. I feel stronger in expressing myself now, and I know my family wants to understand me.

Consultant: That’s a profound realization, Xiaofan! Acknowledging your influence is empowering. As we come to the end of our sessions, how do you plan to apply what you've learned moving forward?

User: I’ll keep practicing sharing my thoughts and reminding myself it’s okay to feel a bit anxious. I want to keep the good atmosphere in our family.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. You’ve made inspiring progress, and I believe you can continue to nurture this positive dynamic. Remember, if challenges arise, you have the tools to handle them. 

User: Thank you! I feel much more equipped now. I appreciate your help through this process.

Consultant: It’s been a pleasure working with you, Xiaofan. You’ve shown great resilience. If you ever need support in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. Good luck, and I’m confident you’ll keep thriving!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaofan! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling much more confident! Participating in the speech competition really helped me. I felt accepted by my peers, which was amazing.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like that experience contributed positively to your self-esteem. Can you share more about what specifically made you feel accepted during the competition?

User: Well, when I was up on stage, I felt supported by my classmates. They cheered for me, and I realized I could actually share my thoughts with others without feeling so scared.

Consultant: It sounds like the support from your classmates played a big role in boosting your confidence. How do you feel about sharing your thoughts now compared to before the competition?

User: I feel a lot less scared now. Before, I would just keep my ideas to myself. Now, I think I can talk in front of others more easily.

Consultant: That's a significant change! It must be empowering to feel more comfortable expressing yourself. As we reflect on your progress, what do you think has been your biggest achievement during our sessions?

User: I think realizing that my thoughts and ideas are valuable has been huge for me. Before, I always doubted myself.

Consultant: Recognizing the value of your thoughts is indeed a great achievement. It shows growth in your self-perception. How do you think you can continue to build on this newfound confidence moving forward?

User: Maybe I could participate in more activities or even help with school projects to keep pushing myself.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Engaging in more activities and taking on responsibilities can further reinforce your confidence. How do you feel about setting specific goals for these activities?

User: I would like that! Setting goals sounds good. I think I could aim to participate in at least one new activity each month.

Consultant: That sounds like a realistic and exciting plan! What new activities are you considering doing this month?

User: I was thinking about joining the art club or trying out for the school play.

Consultant: Both of those sound like wonderful opportunities! Do any specific thoughts or feelings come up when you consider participating in these activities?

User: I feel a bit nervous about the school play because I've never acted before. But, I also feel excited about creating art in the art club.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about starting something new, especially acting. How could you manage that nervousness if you decide to join the school play?

User: Maybe I could practice with friends or watch some plays to get a sense of what it's like.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Practicing with friends can help ease your nerves. Watching plays can provide insight into the process, too. How do you think this can apply to managing other challenges in your life?

User: I guess I could always try to prepare more or talk to people who have done things I want to do. That would help me feel less alone.

Consultant: Absolutely! Seeking support and preparation are key tools for facing challenges. As we near the end of our session, what are the most important takeaways you've gained today?

User: I think I've learned that it's okay to feel nervous, but there are ways to deal with it. I also feel more confident about setting goals for myself.

Consultant: That's a wonderful insight! Recognizing the tools available to you and feeling confident in your goals are steps forward. Before we finish, is there anything you would like to ask or clarify?

User: No, I think I'm good! I feel ready for the next steps.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! You've made impressive progress, Xiaofan. Remember, if you ever feel overwhelmed, you're always welcome to reach out for support again. How about we wrap up our session and look forward to your achievements in the coming weeks?

User: That sounds great! Thank you so much for your help!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm excited to see your continued growth. Take care, and see you next time!
