Consultant: Hello Yang! Welcome to today’s session. It’s great to have you here. I’d like to start by understanding how you've been feeling lately. Can you tell me what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really down lately. After not being promoted again, I just feel defeated and unsure about my future. I used to be really motivated, but now I just feel so lost.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Yang. It’s understandable to feel down when you have high expectations for yourself and they don’t pan out. Can you share a bit more about what specific thoughts or feelings come up for you when you reflect on your situation?

User: I keep thinking that maybe I’m just not good enough or that I’ll never achieve anything significant. It feels like I’m failing at everything, and it's hard to shake that feeling off.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like those thoughts are significantly impacting how you view yourself and your future. Let’s take a moment to explore those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you’re not good enough?

User: Well, I keep failing to get promoted, and it feels like everyone else is moving ahead. That makes me think maybe I'm not cut out for this role or that I'm just not capable.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way when you focus on setbacks. However, can we consider other evidence? For instance, you’ve been in the military for five years and have performed well. What strengths have you demonstrated in your role?

User: I’ve always been a good team player and have been praised for my leadership skills. But in moments like this, it feels like those achievements mean nothing.

Consultant: It’s important to acknowledge those strengths and accomplishments. They do matter, even when things feel challenging. How might you reframe your self-talk when you find yourself feeling inadequate in the future?

User: I guess I could try to remind myself of my accomplishments instead of just focusing on the negatives. But sometimes, it feels really hard to do that.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Yang! Acknowledging your past successes can be a powerful way to challenge those negative thoughts. What about creating a list of your achievements to refer back to during tough times? 

User: That sounds like a good idea! Having something tangible might help. 

Consultant: Absolutely! It can serve as a reminder of your capabilities. Now, regarding your feelings of being lost, can you elaborate on what you envision for your future? What do you hope to achieve?

User: I want to feel fulfilled, maybe even move up in my career or find something I’m really passionate about. Right now, I just don’t see a clear path.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, and it’s important to explore that. What steps could you take to start figuring out what you’re passionate about or what career moves might be possible?

User: I could start talking to others who have advanced in their careers or maybe look into further training. But I worry it might not help.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel apprehensive about taking steps when uncertainty looms. What if we set a small, achievable goal, like reaching out to someone in a position you admire? How does that sound?

User: That sounds manageable. I could at least try.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Small steps can lead to clarity. Remember, it’s about exploring opportunities rather than jumping into big decisions right away. How have your family expectations been affecting you in all of this?

User: I often feel pressure to succeed from my family. They're expecting me to be a leader and do well, and when I don’t meet those standards, it just adds to my stress.

Consultant: Family expectations can certainly add a layer of pressure. How do you feel about communicating your feelings to them? It might provide some relief and understanding.

User: I've thought about it, but I worry they won’t understand or that it’ll just disappoint them more.

Consultant: It’s understandable to fear their reaction. However, expressing your feelings could help them support you better. Would it help to draft what you want to say to them, focusing on sharing your struggle rather than seeking their approval?

User: Yes, that might relieve some pressure. Writing it down could help me articulate my thoughts better.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive plan! Remember, it's okay to share where you’re at. How do you feel about our discussion today? Do you think it’s helped you clarify your feelings somewhat?

User: Definitely. It feels good to talk it out. I think I have some things to work on now.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Yang. Identifying specific actions is a great step forward. As we prepare to wrap up, let's take a moment to review what you’d like to focus on moving forward.

User: I want to work on that list of accomplishments, reach out to someone in my field, and maybe talk to my family about how I feel.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! As you go through this process, remember to be kind to yourself. It’s okay to take time to find your way. If you find yourself needing support in the future, know that you’re welcome to come back anytime. 

User: Thank you, I appreciate that. I’ll definitely keep that in mind. 

Consultant: You’re welcome, Yang. It’s been a pleasure to talk with you today. Take care and be patient with yourself as you navigate through this. Goodbye for now!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yang! I'm glad to see you again. It sounds like you've been experiencing some pressure, especially from your family's expectations. Let's talk about how you've been feeling since our last session.

User: Hi. Yes, I've been reflecting a lot. Though I feel a bit calmer than before, I'm still confused about my future and the expectations my family has for me. 

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way, especially with the recent letter from your parents. Can you share more about what specifically in their message is contributing to your feelings of pressure?

User: They were supportive, which is nice, but it also felt like a reminder of my responsibilities. I worry that I'm not living up to their expectations, especially regarding my career advancement.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a mix of pressure and a sense of obligation. What does "living up to their expectations" look like for you? 

User: I think it means being promoted to a higher rank soon and showing I am making progress in my military career. But honestly, I wonder if I can achieve that given how I've been feeling lately. 

Consultant: It's tough to balance personal feelings and external expectations. How has your current state, feeling disinterested and somewhat low-energy, affected your approach to achieving this promotion?

User: It's made it really hard. I find it difficult to stay motivated, and my focus is scattered. I used to be really ambitious, but now I just feel overwhelmed. 

Consultant: Feeling overwhelmed can certainly muddy your ambition. Let's explore what thoughts run through your mind when you think about your promotion. What do you tell yourself about your ability to achieve it? 

User: I often think I'm not good enough or that others are more capable than I am. I can't shake the feeling that I might fail. 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy to carry. Can you see how this mindset might be affecting your motivation and happiness? 

User: Yes, I suppose it makes me more anxious and less likely to take steps toward my goals. 

Consultant: Recognizing that is a great step. Let's challenge those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you're not good enough? 

User: I just feel like my peers are more successful and have accomplished more. 

Consultant: It’s easy to compare yourself to others, especially in a competitive environment. But have you considered your own achievements and the skills you’ve developed over your military career?

User: I guess I have accomplished some things, like successfully leading my team during drills. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Those are important accomplishments. It might help to remind yourself of them when you're feeling down. How do you think reframing your thoughts about your achievements could impact your motivation?

User: It might make me feel more capable and remind me that I do have the skills needed. 

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! By focusing on your strengths, you could potentially reduce the fears that hold you back. What would be a small first step you could take to remind yourself of these strengths when you're feeling low?

User: Maybe keeping a journal to jot down my achievements and positive feedback. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Journaling can help shift your focus towards what's going well in your life. How else could we address the worries connected to your family’s expectations?

User: I think talking to them about how I truly feel could help. But I'm not sure how to approach that conversation.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy approach. It’s important to have open communication. What do you think might happen if you share your feelings with them?

User: They might understand me better, but I worry they’ll think I'm not trying hard enough. 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It might help to frame the conversation in a way that emphasizes your need for support rather than focusing solely on their expectations. How does that resonate with you?

User: It makes sense. I could express my appreciation for their support while sharing my struggles.

Consultant: Exactly! Open and honest communication can sometimes alleviate pressure. Let’s think about your career development, too. What steps can you take to feel more in control of your future?

User: Maybe I can set smaller, achievable goals related to my current role, rather than fixating on the promotion.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive strategy! Focusing on smaller goals can help you gain confidence and clarity. Can you think of one specific small goal to set for yourself?

User: Perhaps I can aim to improve my physical training or enhance my leadership skills in small ways each week.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! By taking small, tangible steps, you can gradually build a sense of accomplishment. How do you feel about moving forward with these ideas?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful and less anxious about the future. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! We’ve made some important strides today. How about we summarize what you’ve learned and plan for our next steps?

User: Sure! I want to keep journaling and have an open conversation with my family about my feelings. I’ll also focus on setting smaller goals in my career.

Consultant: Those sound like effective strategies. Remember, managing your thoughts and taking actionable steps can greatly reduce that sense of pressure. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about continuing this journey?

User: I’m open to it! I know I still have some confusion about my future, but I feel more equipped to handle it now.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset to have. I’m here to support you whenever you need assistance. Don’t hesitate to reach out if things feel overwhelming again. You’ve made impressive progress today!

User: Thank you for your help! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Yang! Take care, and I look forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yang! I'm glad you came in today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello. I've still been feeling a bit lost about my career path. The recent career planning training made me realize that I don't know myself well enough. It's been tough making decisions.

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like you're grappling with self-awareness and the challenges of decision-making regarding your career. Can you share more about what specifically made you feel uncertain during the training?

User: I think it was the exercises we did that asked us about our strengths and interests. I struggled to answer those questions, which made me feel even more confused.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way when trying to pinpoint your strengths and interests. This can be a challenging process. What kind of thoughts crossed your mind while you were reflecting on those questions?

User: I kept thinking that maybe I don't have any strengths or that I'm just not good enough compared to my peers. It felt really discouraging.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite harsh. Can we take a closer look at them? For example, what evidence do you think supports the belief that you aren’t good enough?

User: Well, sometimes I see others excelling, and I feel like I'm stagnant. I guess I just compare myself to them.

Consultant: Comparison can often magnify negative feelings. If a friend were in your position, how would you encourage them to see their own strengths and achievements?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on their journey and not to compare themselves to others. Everyone has their own pace.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective! It seems like you recognize the value of focusing on your own path. What might it look like for you to apply that advice to yourself moving forward?

User: I guess I could try to list my accomplishments and what I enjoy, rather than just looking at others. 

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach! Let’s create a plan to explore your interests and strengths. What are some activities or achievements, big or small, that you feel proud of?

User: Well, I've always enjoyed physical training and leading my team during exercises. It feels good when they succeed because of our teamwork.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Leadership and physical training might be strengths for you. How might you leverage these strengths in your career planning?

User: Maybe I could look into roles within the military that involve training or leading others. That could be a good fit for me.

Consultant: That sounds promising! Focusing on roles that align with your strengths can build confidence and enthusiasm. What steps could you take to explore these roles further?

User: I could talk to my superiors about possible opportunities or seek mentorship from those in similar positions.

Consultant: Engaging with mentors and seeking guidance is an excellent strategy. How do you feel about taking these steps? Does it seem manageable to you?

User: Yes, it feels doable. I think I can start having those conversations soon.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As you begin this journey, how can you remind yourself to stay focused on your own progress rather than comparing yourself to others?

User: I could set weekly goals for myself and check in on my progress, celebrating small wins along the way.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Celebrating small wins will help reinforce your positive mindset. What do you think would be a good initial goal to set for this week?

User: I think reaching out to at least one mentor to chat about my interests sounds like a good start.

Consultant: That sounds very achievable and proactive! How do you feel about making that connection this week?

User: I feel positive about it. It gives me something to look forward to.

Consultant: I’m glad you feel that way! Just remember, it’s a process. Embracing your own journey is key. As we continue, we can keep refining your goals and strategies together. How can I support you in this next step?

User: Just having these conversations helps a lot. I'll definitely share any new thoughts I have after reaching out.

Consultant: Great! I look forward to hearing about your experiences. It seems like you’re developing a more positive perspective about your career path. Let’s keep building on that in our next session.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. It helps me feel less overwhelmed.

Consultant: You’re very welcome. You’ve made some important discoveries today. Remember, moving forward with self-compassion is crucial. Until next time, take care of yourself!

User: I will! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yang! I'm really glad to see you back today. It sounds like you've been working hard on your mental health. What feelings or thoughts do you have as we start our session?

User: Hi! I feel a bit more hopeful today, especially after receiving that positive feedback during the psychological health activity. But sometimes I still struggle to shake off the feeling of being down or disinterested.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. It’s encouraging to hear that the positive feedback has helped lift your spirits a bit. Can you tell me more about those feelings of disinterest? What kinds of activities or situations trigger that sensation for you?

User: I’ve noticed that I no longer find joy in things I used to love, like playing sports or hanging out with friends. Instead, I often just want to isolate myself and avoid everything.

Consultant: It must be tough to feel that way about activities that used to bring you joy. This kind of withdrawal can be challenging. Let’s explore this a little more. When you think about going out with friends, what thoughts cross your mind that lead you to isolate instead?

User: I often think things like, “What if they don’t want me there?” or “I just won't enjoy it anyway.” So, I end up convincing myself that staying alone is better.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing those thoughts with me. It sounds like there are some negative beliefs influencing your decision to isolate. Can we examine those thoughts a bit closer? What evidence do you have that your friends wouldn’t want you there or that you wouldn’t enjoy the time with them?

User: I guess there isn’t any strong evidence. They have invited me before, but I just keep thinking that I might bring the mood down.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, Yang! It seems like you’re recognizing how your thoughts might not fully reflect reality. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their concerns? 

User: I would probably tell them that friends would want to be together even if someone isn’t feeling their best. I guess they wouldn’t mind me joining them.

Consultant: Exactly! Friends typically appreciate the effort to be together, regardless of how someone is feeling. Let's think about how you might strategize to spend some time with them without overwhelming yourself. How about planning a low-pressure activity with a friend this week?

User: I could reach out to one of them and suggest just grabbing a coffee. That feels doable.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Starting with something simple like coffee can help ease you back into social interactions. How does the thought of doing that make you feel?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. I think it might help me feel more connected.

Consultant: Those are great feelings to have! It's totally normal to feel a bit anxious about reaching out, but it sounds like there's a spark of excitement. Let's also talk about what you can do in the moment if those negative thoughts pop up. What strategies could help you challenge those thoughts when they emerge?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that my friends wouldn’t mind my presence, or even recall past experiences where being with them improved my mood.

Consultant: That’s a solid strategy! By reminding yourself of positive experiences and your friends’ likely reactions, you can begin to counteract those negative thoughts. Would you find it helpful to keep track of these instances in a journal? 

User: Yes, I think that could be helpful. I could write down positive memories and experiences after each interaction.

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping a journal of your positive experiences can serve as a motivating reminder of the joy social interactions can bring. How about setting a time each week to reflect on your entries and see how your feelings change over time?

User: That sounds good! I’d like to see how writing things down impacts my feelings.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear you're open to experimenting with that. It’s also great for practicing reflection. How are you feeling about the progress you’re making so far, Yang?

User: I feel more positive than before. Knowing that I have steps to take makes things less overwhelming.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Recognizing that you have manageable steps to take is key. It’s about building up that confidence over time. Have you noticed any changes in your interactions since starting this journey?

User: A little, yes. I’ve made an effort to smile more and be open. Sometimes I catch myself not feeling so heavy during conversations.

Consultant: That’s really encouraging to hear! Small changes can lead to significant improvements over time. As we move forward, how do you envision carrying this positive momentum into your daily life?

User: I think I want to keep challenging myself to engage more with others. Maybe join a new activity or group could help.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Engaging in new activities is a great way to meet new people and keep your social life vibrant. Perhaps we can set a goal for exploring one new opportunity each month? 

User: I like that idea. I’ll look into options around my area.

Consultant: Excellent! It feels empowering to set those goals. Lastly, let's talk about how you can maintain this positive mindset you've cultivated. What practices or reminders would help you stay on track?

User: I could keep affirming those positive thoughts and maybe have a reminder note at home that encourages me to try new things.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy. Having visual reminders can significantly reinforce those positive thoughts. How do you feel about the conversation today and your readiness to take these next steps?

User: I feel stronger and more motivated. Talking through everything has really helped me see things more clearly.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! You’ve made substantial progress, and I believe in your ability to continue this journey. Remember, you can always return for support if needed. Keep working on those strategies, and enjoy reconnecting with others!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance. I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Take care, Yang! Looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yang! I'm glad to see you again. It sounds like you've been making some positive strides in your social life. How are you feeling today?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good lately. Reconnecting with my comrades has really lightened my mood. It feels nice to enjoy social activities again.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like these connections are bringing you joy. Can you share a specific moment when you felt particularly happy during a social interaction recently?

User: Sure! Just last week, we had a team dinner, and everyone was joking around. I actually found myself laughing and joining in the fun, which felt amazing.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful experience! It’s great that you could engage and find joy in the moment. How did that experience affect your view of social interactions moving forward?

User: I started to feel more optimistic about spending time with others. I realized it can be enjoyable instead of overwhelming.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift! It sounds like you’re starting to see the potential for joy in socializing. With this change in perspective, what new interests or activities are you considering to further engage with others?

User: Well, I've been thinking about joining a local sports team or maybe a hobby group. It could be a good way to meet new people too.

Consultant: Joining a sports team or hobby group sounds like a fantastic idea! What kind of sport or hobby interests you the most right now?

User: I'm really into basketball. I used to play a lot in school, and I think it would be fun to get back into that environment.

Consultant: Basketball is a great way to combine physical activity with social interaction. What do you think might hold you back from taking that step to join a team?

User: I guess I’m a bit nervous about not being as good as I used to be or not fitting in with the team.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about joining something new. Let's explore that thought—what evidence do you have that you won’t fit in or that you won’t perform well?

User: I suppose I don’t really have evidence. It's more of a fear based on my past experiences.

Consultant: That’s an important insight! It seems these worries might be based more on assumptions than reality. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has to start somewhere and that it’s about having fun, not just winning.

Consultant: Exactly! You are your own worst critic sometimes. Keeping that perspective can help ease the pressure. What steps could you take to shift your focus from performance to enjoyment?

User: I could remind myself that the main goal is to have fun and meet new people rather than just focus on my skills.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Setting that intention will allow you to enjoy the experience more. How do you think you might communicate this intention to yourself before you join the team?

User: Maybe I can have a little pep talk with myself or even write it down somewhere I can see it regularly.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive strategy! Writing it down can reinforce that message. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the progress you've made and the steps you're considering?

User: I feel more motivated and less afraid of trying new things. I think I’m ready to take the leap.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Yang! You’ve shown a lot of growth today. As a takeaway, remember to focus on having fun and connecting with others. What will be your next step after today’s session?

User: I plan to look for local basketball leagues and sign up for one this week. I'm excited about it!

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic next step! I believe you’ll enjoy the experience and continue to build those connections. Let’s reflect on our sessions together and the progress you've made. What have been your biggest takeaways?

User: I’ve learned that it’s okay to step out of my comfort zone and that socializing can be a positive experience. I feel more confident about meeting people now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s been inspiring to witness your journey. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support in the future. You’re on the right path, and I hope you continue to thrive in your social endeavors!

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help and guidance throughout this process.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Yang! I wish you all the best in your upcoming experiences. Take care and enjoy exploring those new interests!
###################
Consultant: Hi there! It's great to see you again. Last time we spoke, we highlighted some of your recent improvements in self-confidence and how being recognized as an outstanding soldier has positively impacted you. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hello! I've actually been feeling quite good. The recognition has really boosted my morale, and I feel more motivated to focus on my future. But I still have some uncertainties about my career path.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing a significant boost in motivation, which is fantastic! However, I understand you’re facing some uncertainties about your career path. What specific concerns do you have regarding your future?

User: I guess I'm unsure about the next steps I should take to advance in my career as a soldier. Should I look into further training or education? And how can I make sure that I stay motivated?

Consultant: Those are very valid questions. It’s great that you’re thinking about further training or education, as these can really enhance your career prospects. What do you envision as your ideal progression in your military career?

User: I would like to eventually move into a leadership position. However, I need to know what qualifications or experiences I should pursue to get there.

Consultant: Aiming for a leadership position is a wonderful goal! Let’s explore what skills or qualifications you think would be necessary for that role. Have you considered any specific training programs or leadership courses?

User: I have thought about taking some courses on military leadership and perhaps more specialized training in my area. I think that could help me stand out.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive plan! Pursuing courses related to military leadership and your specialization can definitely help you stand out. What steps can you take to get yourself enrolled in those courses?

User: I can start by talking to my superiors about recommendations for training. Maybe they could guide me on the best options available.

Consultant: That sounds like a great proactive step! Engaging your superiors can provide valuable insights and help you determine the best courses to take. How do you feel about that approach?

User: I feel good about it. I think they would be supportive, especially since I’ve been recognized recently.

Consultant: That’s excellent to hear! It’s important to leverage that support. As you think about your long-term development, how can you regularize your commitment to pursuing these opportunities?

User: I could create a structured plan with deadlines for when I want to enroll in courses. I think that would keep me accountable.

Consultant: A structured plan with deadlines is a smart strategy! This leads to accountability and will help you stay organized. What specific deadlines do you have in mind for your enrollment process?

User: I could aim to have a conversation with my superiors this week and then look for courses by the end of the month.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid timeline! By taking actions this week and setting a deadline for course selection, you’ll move steadily toward your goals. How does that feel to you?

User: It makes me feel more focused, like I have a clear path ahead of me.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Having a clear path can really enhance your motivation. As you work toward these goals, how might you handle any potential setbacks or challenges along the way?

User: I think I just need to remind myself of my accomplishments and focus on the positive feedback I’ve received. That should help me keep a good perspective.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! Recall your accomplishments and positive feedback can serve as a strong motivator during challenges. Different hurdles can be approached with a mindset of resilience! How do you typically manage stress when things get tough?

User: I usually try to talk to someone I trust or engage in physical activity. Those help clear my mind.

Consultant: Talking to someone you trust and staying active are excellent ways to manage stress! Would you consider incorporating regular check-ins with a mentor or peer as part of your growth strategy?

User: I think that’s a good idea. Having someone to discuss my progress with could provide insights and support.

Consultant: Definitely! Establishing those relationships can reinforce your development and provide additional encouragement. Looking ahead, how will you measure your progress towards your goals?

User: I could set small milestones, like completing a certain course or receiving feedback from my superiors. That way, I can track my evolution.

Consultant: Setting small milestones is an effective approach to track your progress! It allows you to celebrate small victories along the way. How do you feel about integrating that into your plan?

User: I feel excited about it! It makes the entire process feel manageable and rewarding.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! It’s crucial to celebrate those achievements. In our future discussions, we can revisit your milestones and reflect on your growth. Is there anything else you’d like to talk about today regarding your plans or goals?

User: No, I think we covered everything that’s been on my mind. I feel much clearer on what steps to take next.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s rewarding to see you feeling clearer about your next steps. As this session comes to a close, let’s summarize what we discussed regarding your goal, which is to enhance your career trajectory. 

User: Sure! I want to pursue leadership training, talk to my superiors about options, set a timeline, and create milestones for progress.

Consultant: That’s a solid summary! Your proactive approach to planning and accountability will undoubtedly facilitate your growth and success. Remember, if you ever need support in the future, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate all your guidance.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It was a pleasure working with you. Best of luck with your plans, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
