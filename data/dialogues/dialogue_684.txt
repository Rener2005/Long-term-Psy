Consultant: Hello, Xiao Jun! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling recently, especially with the upcoming exams approaching?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious lately, especially since the teachers keep stressing the importance of the exams. It reminds me of the anxiety I felt last year, and now I'm starting to feel that panic again. My hands are shaking, and I get this tingling sensation all over.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiao Jun. It's understandable that the pressure from your teachers would trigger those feelings again. Let's explore this a bit more. Can you tell me what thoughts were running through your mind when you started to feel anxious recently?

User: I keep thinking that I should be able to do better, that I can’t afford to fail. It feels like so much is riding on these exams, and I just want a perfect score.

Consultant: It's clear you have high expectations for yourself, which is creating a lot of pressure. When you think about failing, how does that make you feel emotionally and physically?

User: I feel panicked and overwhelmed. It’s like my heart races, and I can't sit still. I worry that if I don’t get good grades, my parents will be disappointed. 

Consultant: That fear of disappointing your parents can intensify your anxiety. What would you say is the worst part about potentially not meeting those expectations?

User: I think the worst part would be feeling like I let them down and that I didn’t live up to my own standards. 

Consultant: That sounds really heavy to carry. Let's take a step back and challenge these thoughts. What evidence do you have that your parents would be truly disappointed if you didn’t get a perfect score?

User: Well, they've always worked hard and sacrificed a lot for me, so I feel like they expect a lot in return. 

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way given their investment in your education. But have they ever expressed that their love or support is contingent on your academic performance? 

User: No, they haven’t really said that outright. They often say that what matters is that I try my best, but I guess I still feel that pressure anyway.

Consultant: It's great that you recognize that. Sometimes, our own perceptions can amplify the pressure. What if you could see your efforts as enough, regardless of the outcomes? How might that change your feelings about the exams?

User: I think it might help me feel less anxious, but it’s hard to shake off those thoughts completely. 

Consultant: Of course, changing deep-rooted thoughts takes time. How about we work on some strategies to manage your anxiety in the meantime? Perhaps we can explore some relaxation techniques or even a study schedule to help you feel more prepared.

User: That sounds helpful. I feel like having a plan would make things less overwhelming.

Consultant: Great! Let’s focus on structuring a study plan that breaks down your material into manageable sections. How do you currently prepare for your exams?

User: I usually cram everything the night before, which doesn’t work well for me—I end up stressed and tired.

Consultant: It makes sense that cramming would lead to feelings of stress and exhaustion. Instead, we could create a study plan that spaces out your studying over several days. What do you think about that approach?

User: That sounds better. I think spreading it out would make me feel less pressure. 

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! Let’s outline a study plan together, focusing on short, regular study sessions. How many days do you have until your exam?

User: I have about ten days left. 

Consultant: Perfect. We can break it down into smaller topics to study each day. Would you feel comfortable setting aside, say, one to two hours each day for focused study?

User: Yes, I could manage that. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s also add in some relaxation techniques around your study schedule to help you unwind. Would you be open to trying some deep breathing exercises or mindfulness practices?

User: I’ve heard of deep breathing exercises. I think I could try that.

Consultant: That’s a great start! We can practice some deep breathing now together. It might help you feel a bit calmer as you prepare for your studies. Ready to give it a go?

User: Okay, I’ll give it a shot.

Consultant: Let’s take a deep breath in for a count of four... and exhale for a count of six. Let’s repeat this a few times. How does that feel?

User: It feels good. I feel a bit lighter.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Practicing this regularly, especially during times of high stress, can really help manage your anxiety. As you continue with your studies, how will you remind yourself to use this technique?

User: I think I’ll set a reminder on my phone to take breaks and breathe when I start feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Creating those reminders can help build a habit. Now, before we wrap up, what do you feel is the most significant change we’ve worked on today that you can take away?

User: I think recognizing that my parents won’t be disappointed in me helps, and having a study plan really makes it feel like I can manage my anxiety better.

Consultant: Those are powerful realizations, Xiao Jun. It’s all about progress, not perfection. Remember that your efforts matter, and I believe you can manage your anxiety with the plan we created. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out for support.

User: Thank you, that really helps. I appreciate your guidance today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! You're making great strides, and I look forward to hearing how your study plan works for you. Until next time, take care!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you could join me today for our session. How have you been feeling lately, especially with the exam pressure?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really anxious. I try to relax, but I still obsess over my grades. It seems like everyone around me is constantly discussing results, and it just adds to my stress.

Consultant: It sounds like you're in a tough spot with all the discussions about grades. You mentioned feeling anxious and obsessing over your results. Can you share a bit more about what that feels like for you?

User: It feels like I can't breathe sometimes. I'm always running scenarios in my head about what will happen if I don't get good grades. It's overwhelming and I just want to be perfect.

Consultant: That sounds really heavy to carry, and wanting to be perfect can create a lot of pressure. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit. When you think about perfection, what specific thoughts come up for you about your exams?

User: I keep thinking that if I don't score high, it means I'm not good enough. I can’t shake off that feeling. It’s like a constant nagging thought that I have to prove myself.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially with the expectations from yourself and others. But let's consider this—how much evidence do you have that your worth is tied to your exam scores?

User: I guess I don’t really have solid evidence. It’s just something I’ve always felt—like my grades define my intelligence or my future.

Consultant: That’s a common belief, but it can be quite limiting. If a friend were to say something similar, what would you tell them? 

User: I’d probably tell them that grades aren’t everything and that they shouldn’t define who they are.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you understand this concept well. Now, can we try to apply that understanding to your situation? What if we challenged that thought that your grades define your worth?

User: That makes sense. I do recognize that grades can reflect effort but not my entire self. Maybe I need to remind myself of other things I'm good at.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Focusing on your strengths outside of academics can help shift your perspective. Can you think of some of your strengths or achievements you’re proud of?

User: Well, I like playing basketball, and I’ve been part of the school team for a couple of years. I also try to help my classmates when they’re struggling.

Consultant: Those are wonderful strengths! You're not only excelling in sports, but you're also showing kindness and support to others. How does recognizing these strengths make you feel compared to just focusing on grades?

User: It does help! I feel a little lighter, like I have more to offer than just my academic performance.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it's important to have a balanced view of yourself. Let’s discuss how you might incorporate these strengths into your daily routine to manage stress. What do you think?

User: Maybe I could spend some time playing basketball or helping others with their studies instead of just studying all the time.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Engaging in activities you enjoy can alleviate some of the stress and create a more positive mindset. How can you create a plan for that?

User: I could set aside specific times after school for basketball, maybe on weekends, and make it a habit to check in with classmates to see if they need help.

Consultant: Creating that balance is key! As we wrap up today, can you reflect on the progress you’ve made in changing your perspective on grades? 

User: I feel like starting to accept that my worth isn’t solely based on my grades. I need to embrace uncertainty instead of fearing it.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization, and it's a big step forward. Remember, it's okay to have some uncertainty—life is full of it. As we continue our sessions, we can work more on embracing that uncertainty while also finding strategies to manage the pressure from expectations.

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more empowered to handle things now.

Consultant: You’re welcome! You’ve made great progress today. Remember to practice recognizing your strengths and taking time for yourself. If you find the pressure overwhelming, don’t hesitate to reach out. How do you feel about continuing to work on this together?

User: I definitely want to keep working on it. I appreciate your support.

Consultant: I'm here for you. We'll keep building on this progress in our next session. Take care until then, and remember to enjoy those moments on the basketball court!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Jun! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, especially with the pressures from your parents and teachers?

User: Hi! Honestly, I've been feeling quite overwhelmed. The expectations are really high, and it seems like there's no way to meet them. I get really anxious, especially thinking about my future and exams. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure, which is completely understandable. Can you tell me specifically what thoughts or feelings come to mind when you think about those expectations?

User: I feel like I have to be perfect all the time. If I don’t do well in my exams, I think my parents will be really disappointed in me, and that's terrifying.

Consultant: That fear of disappointing your parents sounds very heavy. It seems like this drive for perfection is causing a lot of stress. Can you share more about how that affects your mood and motivation?

User: I often feel anxious and sometimes even lose motivation to study because I fear I won't be able to achieve the perfect results. I just end up sitting at my desk without doing anything.

Consultant: I see how that creates a cycle of anxiety and avoidance, making it difficult for you to focus. Let's take a moment to identify some of those automatic thoughts. When you're at your desk, what exactly goes through your mind?

User: I usually think, "I can't fail," or "If I don’t do this perfectly, it’s not worth it." Those thoughts just make me more anxious.

Consultant: Those are very intense thoughts. It must feel overwhelming. Let’s explore those thoughts a little more. What evidence do you have to support the idea that failing is not an option? Have there been times when this didn’t happen?

User: Well, I guess there have been times I didn't do well, but my parents still loved me. They said they just wanted me to try my best, but in the moment, I forget that.

Consultant: It's insightful to recognize that your parents love you regardless of the results. Maybe we can work on reframing those thoughts. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their worth beyond their grades?

User: I would say they are more than their grades and that they shouldn't be too hard on themselves.

Consultant: That's a compassionate perspective. It seems important to remind yourself of that too. Let’s practice replacing those rigid thoughts with more flexible ones. How can you remind yourself of your personal value outside of grades?

User: I could start telling myself that trying my best is what matters, and that I’ve done well in other areas before.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent start! We can also work on practical strategies. What activities or hobbies might help you relax or take your mind off the grades for a moment?

User: I enjoy drawing and playing basketball. They help me forget the stress a little.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful outlets for your emotions. Integrating those activities into your routine could help create balance. How about we set a small goal for you? Maybe scheduling a short time each day for something you love, like drawing?

User: That sounds doable. I could take a break after studying and draw for a while. 

Consultant: Great! That could be a positive way to relieve stress. Now, let's talk about how you can manage anxiety during exam preparation. Have you tried any relaxation techniques or breathing exercises?

User: No, I haven’t really thought about that. I usually just push through.

Consultant: It’s easy to fall into that habit. How about we go over some simple breathing exercises together that you can use to help calm your mind before studying or during exams?

User: Sure, I’d like that.

Consultant: Let's try this together: take a deep breath in for four seconds, hold it for four seconds, and then slowly exhale for four seconds. Practicing this a few times can help ground you. Want to give it a try?

User: Okay, let's do it. *takes deep breaths* 

Consultant: How do you feel after trying that?

User: It feels nice to take a moment to breathe. I think I could use this before studying.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Regularly using those techniques can help you feel more in control. As we move forward, let’s think about how you can build your confidence leading up to exams. What are some strengths or skills you already possess that could help you during this time?

User: I’m good at math, and I know that I study well with practice. I just need to remind myself to focus on that.

Consultant: That’s a solid foundation! Emphasizing your strengths can boost your confidence. How can we incorporate that knowledge into your study plan?

User: Maybe I could create a study schedule that focuses on practicing math more since I enjoy it. 

Consultant: Absolutely! That sounds like a smart strategy. Let’s set measurable goals for your studies, something achievable that can help you track your progress along the way.

User: I could write down specific topics to cover each week, particularly in math.

Consultant: Excellent! Keeping track of your progress can be motivating and give you a sense of accomplishment. Now, as we approach our final sessions, let’s review what you’ve learned and how you've grown. What do you feel has been your biggest takeaway?

User: I think realizing that it’s okay not to be perfect has been huge for me. And that I should focus on my value beyond grades.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! As you prepare for future challenges, what strategies will you adopt to sustain this healthier mindset?

User: I’ll keep reminding myself that trying my best is what counts, and I’ll remember to take breaks to do things I enjoy.

Consultant: Those are wonderful strategies to implement! It’s important to be kind to yourself through this journey. Remember, you’re equipped with tools to help you through future pressures. If you find yourself struggling again, don't hesitate to reach out for support.

User: Thank you for all this guidance! I feel more hopeful about managing my anxiety now.

Consultant: It’s been a pleasure working with you, Xiao Jun! You’ve made fantastic progress. Take care of yourself, and remember, I’m here if you ever need assistance in the future.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Jun! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better actually. I did notice some improvements during the mock exams, but I'm still worried that my grades won't meet my expectations.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've seen some progress in the mock exams! However, it sounds like there's still some pressure you're experiencing. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts come to mind when you think about your grades?

User: I guess I keep thinking that if I don't get high marks, I'll disappoint my parents and let myself down. It feels like I have to be perfect all the time.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling like you have to be perfect. It’s understandable to worry about disappointing your parents, but I wonder, how likely do you think it is that you won't meet those expectations? 

User: Well, I suppose it's not very likely that I'll fail completely, but I just can't shake the feeling that anything less than perfect is a failure.

Consultant: It seems that those thoughts of perfection are weighing heavily on you. Can we explore what it means for you to achieve something less than perfect? How do you usually react when you fall short of your own expectations?

User: I get really upset with myself and start to doubt my abilities. I just feel like I should be better, you know?

Consultant: I understand. It's hard not to be hard on yourself, especially with high expectations. It might help to challenge that thought: is every little mistake truly a failure, or is it part of the learning process? 

User: I guess it's part of learning. I just have this voice in my head telling me that I should always be the best.

Consultant: That inner critic can be loud! If you think about it, what would you say to a friend who is struggling with the same thoughts? How would you support them?

User: I would probably tell them that they did their best and that it’s okay to make mistakes. But I find it hard to believe that for myself.

Consultant: That's an important realization, Xiao Jun. You recognize that it’s easier to be kind to others. We can work on turning that kindness towards yourself. How about creating a mantra you can say to yourself when those perfectionist thoughts creep in?

User: That sounds like a good idea! But I'm not sure what to say.

Consultant: How about something like, “My best effort is enough, and it’s okay to make mistakes”? Would that resonate with you? 

User: I think so. It feels comforting to say that to myself.

Consultant: Perfect! Let's also consider some small steps you can take to practice this self-acceptance. Are there any recent moments where you faced a challenge but handled it well, even if the outcome wasn't perfect?

User: I had a group project recently. It didn't go perfectly, but my team and I communicated well, and we learned a lot from the experience.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful example! You worked well with your team, which shows your capability. Let’s focus on celebrating that progress. How might acknowledging these small victories help you reduce pressure on yourself moving forward?

User: I think if I can remember those moments, it might help me not to focus solely on grades.

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing progress, no matter how small, can fortify your confidence. Let's incorporate this perspective into your study routine. Can you schedule time for reflection in your study sessions, where you acknowledge your efforts first?

User: Yes, I could do that. It might make studying feel less overwhelming.

Consultant: Absolutely! Also, how about involving a friend or family member in your study sessions? Sharing your experiences can amplify that sense of support and accountability.

User: I usually study alone, but I could ask a classmate to join me. That might help.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Engaging with others can lessen feelings of isolation and offer support. As we wrap up today’s session, what would you say is the most helpful insight you've gained so far?

User: I think it’s realizing that it’s okay not to be perfect and that I can be kinder to myself. 

Consultant: That's an important step forward, Xiao Jun! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. As we move forward, let’s continue to build on that self-acceptance. I look forward to hearing how implementing this reflects in your daily life at our next session. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit lighter talking about this.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Keep practicing those self-kind thoughts, and remember, it’s a journey. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: I will. Thanks again!

Consultant: You're welcome! See you next time, Xiao Jun!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Jun! I’m glad to see you today. It seems like you've been experiencing some positive changes lately. How are you feeling about everything that's been happening?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel a bit better. My classmates have been really supportive, and I appreciate their encouragement. It's nice to know I'm not alone.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Having that support from your classmates can make a huge difference. Can you tell me more about how their support has affected you?

User: I think it makes me feel more confident. I'm more willing to share my thoughts and ask for help when needed. It's a relief knowing they are there for me during this stressful time with exams.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re beginning to recognize the value of having that support network. How has this shift in your perspective influenced your anxiety about exams?

User: I feel less anxious now. I used to worry a lot about failing, but now I think if I don’t do well, at least I have friends who care. It gives me some comfort.

Consultant: That's a significant change! Acknowledging that you have friends who care can be a great source of comfort during stressful times. What specific actions have you taken to connect more with your classmates?

User: I’ve been studying in groups more often. We share notes and help each other with difficult topics. I feel more engaged this way.

Consultant: Group studying can definitely help you feel more connected and less isolated. How does participating in these study sessions affect your mood and confidence?

User: I feel energized and motivated. It’s nice to know we’re all in this together, and I leave those sessions feeling more prepared.

Consultant: It’s awesome to hear that you’re feeling motivated and prepared. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that arise when you start to feel anxious about your exams?

User: Sometimes I think, “What if I fail?” But I try to remind myself that it's okay to not be perfect, especially since my friends are supportive.

Consultant: That's very insightful, Xiao Jun. Challenging the thought of “What if I fail?” can be powerful. What alternative thoughts could you hold on to in those moments?

User: Maybe something like, “I can learn from this experience, no matter the outcome,” or “I have my friends to help me through it.”

Consultant: Those alternative thoughts are excellent! They emphasize growth and support. Reflecting on this, how do you think you can maintain or strengthen this mindset moving forward?

User: I guess I could remind myself of these thoughts daily, maybe write them down and read them before studying. It might reinforce that positive perspective.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Writing down those thoughts could help you internalize them. Are there other strategies you've considered for managing stress or anxiety during your exam preparation?

User: I haven’t thought much about other strategies, but I could probably take short breaks during my study sessions to relax my mind.

Consultant: Taking breaks is a fantastic idea! It can help you recharge and come back to your studies with a fresh perspective. What activities do you enjoy during your breaks?

User: I enjoy listening to music or going for a short walk. It helps me clear my head.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent ways to unwind! Integrating music and walks into your routine can enhance your overall well-being. How do you think you can schedule these breaks effectively during your study time?

User: I could set a timer to remind me to take breaks every hour, maybe about 10 minutes to listen to music or stretch a bit.

Consultant: That’s a practical approach! Setting a timer will help establish a rhythm to your study sessions. How do you feel about your ability to implement this into your routine?

User: I feel optimistic about it. I think it will help me feel less overwhelmed and get through my studies more effectively.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It's all about finding what works for you. As we wrap up today, what do you feel has been your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think recognizing the importance of my friends’ support and adopting new thoughts to approach my anxiety. It feels like I have a clearer path forward.

Consultant: That's a significant realization. Acknowledging the support around you and developing positive thoughts can be powerful tools for managing anxiety. As we conclude today's session, what strategies do you plan to use moving forward?

User: I plan to keep reminding myself of the supportive thoughts and to take regular breaks while studying. I think this will help me stay grounded.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Xiao Jun. Remember, you're not alone in this, and it’s okay to seek support. I'm proud of the progress you've made, and I'm here whenever you need assistance in the future. 

User: Thank you! I feel more equipped to handle everything now.

Consultant: You’re welcome! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your continued progress next time. Goodbye for now!

User: Goodbye!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Jun! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling better about my emotions lately. The talk we had about self-acceptance really helped. I still get a bit nervous thinking about the upcoming exams, but it's not as overwhelming as before.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're experiencing improvement in your emotional management. Can you describe in more detail how you’ve been handling the anxiety regarding your exams?

User: Well, I’ve been trying to practice some of the techniques we talked about. I remind myself that it's okay to feel nervous, and I've been using positive affirmations. It's still a struggle sometimes, though, especially on days when I feel less motivated.

Consultant: That sounds like a productive approach! Acknowledging your feelings and using positive affirmations can be powerful tools. How do you think your motivation impacts your study habits, especially during this exam period?

User: I think when I'm not motivated, I tend to procrastinate, which just makes me more anxious about the exams. I wish I could stay focused, but sometimes I just feel overwhelmed and don't know where to start.

Consultant: I understand. Procrastination can definitely increase anxiety. Let’s explore this further—what specific tasks or subjects do you find most overwhelming right now?

User: It’s mostly math and science. They feel more challenging than my other subjects, and I often think I'm not good enough at them, which makes me want to avoid studying them altogether.

Consultant: It’s common to feel intimidated by certain subjects. Let's challenge that thought a bit—what evidence do you have that supports or contradicts the belief that you’re not good at math and science?

User: Well, I did well in my last exams, but I keep focusing on the mistakes I made. I guess I’m always comparing myself to my classmates who seem to understand things better.

Consultant: It’s natural to compare ourselves to others, but it’s important to remember that everyone learns at their own pace. What would you tell a friend in your situation—how would you encourage them to view their achievements?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on their progress instead of their mistakes and that it's perfectly fine not to understand everything right away.

Consultant: That’s a helpful perspective! Now, how about applying that same advice to yourself? What would it look like for you to celebrate your progress instead of fixating on mistakes?

User: I guess I could keep track of my improvements and give myself credit for that. Maybe even reward myself for completing study sessions or grasping difficult concepts.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful strategy! Setting goals and rewarding yourself can boost motivation. What kind of rewards do you think would be meaningful for you?

User: Simple things make me happy, like taking a break to play video games or hanging out with friends. I think I could use those as rewards after studying.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Balancing study with enjoyable activities is essential for maintaining your motivation. How do you plan to structure your study sessions leading up to the exams?

User: I’m thinking of setting a schedule where I break down my subjects into smaller topics and focus on one at a time. I’ll mix in breaks and rewards like we discussed.

Consultant: Structuring your study time like that can really help reduce feelings of being overwhelmed. Have you had a chance to try out this plan yet?

User: Not yet, but I feel more confident about trying it. I think I’ll start tomorrow!

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Remember, flexibility is key. If something isn’t working, it’s okay to adjust your plan. How are you feeling about implementing these strategies for the upcoming exams?

User: I feel more optimistic now. Having a clear plan makes the approaching exams seem less daunting. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear your optimism! Let’s also think about your emotional wellbeing as the exams approach. What strategies can you use if you start to feel anxious again during this period?

User: I could take deep breaths or take short walks to clear my mind. I might also try a few minutes of mindfulness or meditation.

Consultant: Excellent strategies! Mindfulness and physical activity can do wonders for reducing anxiety. Would you like to develop a specific mindfulness practice for yourself?

User: Yes, I’d like that. Maybe I can start with five minutes of guided meditation each day.

Consultant: That sounds like a great starting point! Remember to be gentle with yourself as you navigate this process. How do you feel about your progress today?

User: I feel like I’ve learned a lot. Reflecting on things helps me see that I’ve improved and I have effective ways to keep my anxiety in check.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s important to acknowledge how far you’ve come. As our session wraps up today, how do you plan to apply what you’ve learned to future scenarios, like during finals?

User: I’ll focus on celebrating my progress and using my study schedule. If I feel anxious, I’ll remember to use my new strategies to cope.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Xiao Jun. You have a lot of effective techniques to draw from. Remember, this is a journey, and it’s okay to seek support anytime you need it. 

User: I really appreciate that! Thank you for all your help. I feel ready to tackle my studies now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. If you ever feel the need to chat again, don’t hesitate to reach out. Best of luck with your studies, you’ve got this!

User: Thank you! I’ll definitely keep your advice in mind. Goodbye!

Consultant: Goodbye, Xiao Jun! Take care!
