Consultant: Hello, Li Qi! It's good to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! Honestly, I've been feeling quite down. The fact that I didn't get into my ideal university is weighing heavily on me. I feel like I've disappointed my parents and friends.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially given the expectations you might feel from those around you. Let's explore your feelings a bit deeper. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about your results?

User: I keep thinking that I failed, and that I must not be as smart as I thought. It's like I can't stop blaming myself for not getting the grades I needed.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of self-blame. This can be very tough to navigate. If you could describe your self-talk during these moments, what would it sound like? 

User: I often tell myself that I'll never amount to anything if I can't succeed academically. I feel like I've let everyone down, including myself.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be incredibly discouraging. Let's take a closer look at them. What evidence do you have that your worth is solely dependent on your academic achievements?

User: I guess I don't really have any strong evidence. It's just how I've always viewed success, especially with my parents being doctors and all.

Consultant: It sounds like there's a lot of pressure that comes from your family background. Let's try to challenge that thought. If a close friend came to you with similar feelings about their results, what would you say to them?

User: I would probably tell them that their value is not based solely on their exams and that everyone faces setbacks.

Consultant: That’s a kind and supportive response. Why not apply that same kindness to yourself? What if your worth isn't tied to your grades, but to who you are as a person?

User: I don't know. It's hard to separate the two in my mind. I feel like I've let down my family, and that makes me feel worthless.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a sense of failure, especially with high expectations. However, it's important to recognize that setbacks are a part of life. How might your view change if you considered your achievements and qualities beyond academics?

User: I'd like to think I am a hard worker and a good friend. But it’s tough to focus on those when I feel like my one major goal was a failure.

Consultant: It sounds like you have some valuable qualities that contribute to your identity. Let’s take a moment to list some of these strengths. What are some things you are proud of, outside of your academics?

User: I think I'm quite creative and I enjoy helping others. People have told me I'm a good listener. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful qualities! It shows that you're much more than your academic performance. Let’s work on reframing the thought "I am worthless because of my grades." How about changing it to something like "I have strengths and qualities that define me beyond my grades"?

User: That actually sounds more positive. It's just a challenge to believe it really.

Consultant: Believing in a new thought takes time and practice, but it's entirely possible. What’s one small thing you can do this week to reinforce that new belief about yourself?

User: Maybe I could volunteer somewhere or help a friend with their studies. That might remind me of my strengths.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Engaging in activities that highlight your qualities can help shift your focus away from the grades. How are you feeling about our discussion today?

User: I feel a bit lighter, but I still have this nagging anxiety about the future.

Consultant: It's normal to feel anxious when facing uncertainty. Remember, we can work together on techniques to manage that anxiety. Would you like to learn some relaxation techniques or coping strategies for when those feelings arise?

User: Yes, that would be helpful. I want to feel more in control of my emotions.

Consultant: Great! We can start with some breathing exercises. When you feel anxious, taking deep, slow breaths can help calm your body and mind. Would you like to try one together?

User: Sure, let’s give it a try.

Consultant: Let’s start by taking a deep breath in through your nose, holding it for a moment, and then slowly exhaling through your mouth. Let’s do that a few times together. 

User: Okay, I’m feeling a bit more relaxed.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Practicing these techniques regularly can help you manage your stress when you feel overwhelmed. How do you feel about incorporating this into your routine?

User: I think I can try to do it daily. It’s worth a shot!

Consultant: Absolutely, consistency is key. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize what you’ve learned and planned to work on until we meet again.

User: I’ll try to focus on my strengths, challenge negative thoughts, and practice relaxation techniques. 

Consultant: Perfect! You’ve made valuable steps today, and I believe you can continue to work on these. Remember, setbacks are opportunities for growth. Until next time, take care.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: Hello Liqi! It's great to see you again. I know we've been working on your feelings about your self-worth following your recent exam experiences. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I still feel quite anxious and have been struggling with my self-worth. I keep thinking about how I didn’t perform as well as I expected in my exams. It really gets to me.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite overwhelming for you. Let's explore this together. What specific thoughts have been going through your mind when you reflect on your exam results?

User: I often think that I’ve let my parents down and that I’m not good enough. It just makes me feel worse about myself, and I can’t shake off that guilt.

Consultant: I see that you’re feeling a lot of pressure regarding your performance and its impact on your self-image. It’s important to address those feelings. When you have those thoughts, what kind of emotions do they trigger for you?

User: I feel really sad and anxious, like I'm just stuck in this cycle of self-blame. It's affecting my ability to interact with friends too because I just want to isolate myself.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me. It’s tough when those feelings lead you to withdraw from social situations. Let’s try to identify some of the automatic thoughts you have during these moments. Could you share what comes to mind when you think about your exam results?

User: I think things like “I’m a failure” or “I’ll never be successful.” Sometimes, I even question if I should continue with my studies.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very harsh. You mentioned feeling like a failure; how do you think this impacts your behavior or your daily life?

User: It makes me feel less motivated to study or even do things I used to enjoy. I just feel undeserving of good experiences.

Consultant: That’s a heavy burden to carry. Let’s try to challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts the idea that you’re a failure? 

User: Well, I do have some good grades from previous years, but it feels like they don’t matter now because of this one instance.

Consultant: It’s understandable to focus on the most recent experience, but it’s important to recognize your overall achievements. What would you tell a friend who felt this way about their performance?

User: I would probably tell them that one exam doesn’t define their entire abilities and that they should focus on the bigger picture.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective! Now, let’s think about how you can apply this same kindness to yourself. What’s a more balanced thought you could replace “I’m a failure” with?

User: Maybe something like “I’m still capable and I can learn from this experience.” 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic shift in perspective! By focusing on growth rather than failure, you create space for self-acceptance. Can we explore some strategies to reinforce this new thinking in your daily life?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I want to feel better about myself again.

Consultant: Great! We can start with small affirmations and reminders of your strengths. How about setting aside a few minutes each day to reflect on your achievements, no matter how small?

User: That sounds doable. I think I can start a journal to write these down.

Consultant: A journal is an excellent idea! It can help you keep track of your progress and reinforce positive thoughts. Besides journaling, are there any activities you enjoy that could help improve your mood?

User: I love painting and spending time with my friends. I guess I’ve just been avoiding those activities because of how I feel.

Consultant: Engaging in activities you love is essential for your well-being. Let’s plan some time for painting or hanging out with friends. Would that help you reconnect with those positive experiences?

User: Yes, it would definitely help! I used to feel happy when painting.

Consultant: Wonderful! Making time for those activities can help you distance yourself from negative feelings and shift your focus to what brings you joy. How do you feel about discussing any specific goals for this week related to your self-care and engaging with others?

User: I think I can set a goal to paint for at least an hour and reach out to a friend to hang out. 

Consultant: That sounds like a positive plan! Setting these small, achievable goals can really help shift your mindset. Let’s keep reminding ourselves of the progress you've made so far. What are some strengths you can acknowledge about yourself?

User: I suppose I’m creative and hardworking. I have accomplished a lot in school despite everything.

Consultant: Those are significant strengths! Recognizing and celebrating them can boost your self-esteem. As we wrap up for today, what do you hope to carry forward from this session?

User: I hope to be kinder to myself and to focus on my strengths more. I’ll try to keep a positive outlook.

Consultant: That's a beautiful takeaway, Liqi! Remember to be gentle with yourself on this journey. We’ll continue to build on these strategies next time. I'm proud of the steps you're taking. If you ever feel overwhelmed, remember that it’s okay to reach out again. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to our next session. Take care and enjoy your painting!

Consultant: Hello, Li Qi! I'm glad to see you again today. Let's take a moment to check in on how you've been feeling lately. How are you doing since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been managing to accept my situation a bit better, but I still have moments where I feel down about not meeting my parents' expectations, especially after my exam results.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re making some progress in accepting things, but those lingering feelings can still be quite challenging. Can you share more about what goes through your mind when you feel this way?

User: It's like a voice in my head telling me that I've let them down, and I'm worried about disappointing them again if I try to retake the exams. It feels overwhelming sometimes.

Consultant: I understand that those thoughts can be heavy to carry. Let’s take a moment to explore those feelings. What do you think is the worst part of letting your parents down?

User: I think the worst part is seeing their disappointment. They work so hard and believe in me, and I hate disappointing them.

Consultant: That makes sense. Their belief in you seems very important. How do you feel about your own expectations for yourself in this situation?

User: I feel like I should be doing better. I want to prove that I can be as successful as they want me to be, but it just feels out of reach sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re caught between wanting to make them proud and the pressure of feeling you have to meet those high expectations. Could you identify any thoughts or beliefs that come to mind when you feel overwhelmed?

User: I often think that if I don’t get into a good university, my future will be ruined, and I won't be able to achieve anything meaningful.

Consultant: That's a strong belief you’re holding on to. It’s understandable to feel that way, especially with so much pressure. Let's take a closer look at that thought. How much evidence do you think supports the idea that not getting into a top university would ruin your future?

User: I guess I don't really know... I hear so many stories about people making it big no matter what school they went to, but in the moment, it just feels so final.

Consultant: You make a valid point. Many people find success through various pathways. If a friend came to you feeling the same way, what might you say to help them see the situation differently? 

User: I would probably tell them that it's not the end of the world and that there are always options. They could always try again or look for different opportunities.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate outlook! It seems you have that wisdom within you too. How might you apply that same understanding to yourself in this situation?

User: I think I could try reminding myself that there are other paths and that failing isn't the end, just a chance to learn and grow.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Let's try to create some positive self-talk that could help you when those overwhelming thoughts arise. What would you like to tell yourself in those moments?

User: Maybe something like, “I am capable, and this is just a part of my journey. I can always try again.”

Consultant: That’s an empowering affirmation! Repeating that to yourself might help in shifting your mindset. Now, let’s consider some actionable steps. Have you thought about specific goals that you could set for yourself if you decide to retake the exams?

User: I think I should break it down into smaller goals. Maybe focus on one subject at a time and set a timeline for studying.

Consultant: That sounds like a very manageable and structured plan! Setting small, achievable goals can really help you build confidence. What about activities or study methods have you found enjoyable in the past that we could incorporate?

User: I liked studying with friends and having discussions. It made things clearer and less lonely.

Consultant: Perfect! Collaborating with friends can definitely lighten the load and make studying more engaging. How about planning some study sessions together? It could also help to reinforce that you’re not alone in this.

User: That sounds like a good idea! I think having that social aspect could motivate me more.

Consultant: Great! Social support is key in facing challenges. As we move forward, let’s also work on building your self-confidence. Can you think of past achievements that made you feel proud?

User: I did well in a few subjects before high school and even won a couple of awards. I felt really proud back then.

Consultant: Those accomplishments are a testament to your capability! Reflecting on those moments can boost your confidence. How do you think you can incorporate that feeling into your current mindset?

User: I guess I could remind myself of those times when I start feeling down about my academics now.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Holding onto past successes can be very grounding. As we wrap up today, what feels like the most valuable takeaway for you from our conversation?

User: I've learned that I need to be kinder to myself and remember that failure is not the end. I can always try again.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! Keeping that perspective will certainly help you as you explore your options moving forward. I believe in your ability to navigate this situation. Before we finish, what would you like to focus on in our next session?

User: I’d like to discuss more about building my self-confidence and how to handle setbacks better.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can delve deeper into strategies for building self-confidence and navigating setbacks. I'm looking forward to our next session, Li Qi. You’re doing great, and remember, it’s okay to take your time. Take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li Qi! It's good to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I'm feeling a bit better, but I still have a lot of mixed emotions about the idea of repeating the exams. Some days I feel confident about it, and others I doubt whether it's the right decision.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to have those feelings, especially with such an important decision ahead of you. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel confident some days and doubtful on others?

User: Well, on the confident days, I remind myself of my strengths and how I've done well in the past. But on the doubtful days, I worry about the pressure of repeating and what if I don't get the results I want again.

Consultant: That sounds like a tough cycle to be in. It seems like your past successes give you motivation, while the fear of disappointment creates uncertainty. How do those thoughts impact your emotions during those periods?

User: When I'm feeling confident, I feel motivated to study and work hard. But when I'm doubting myself, I just feel anxious and can't concentrate on anything.

Consultant: It's interesting to see how these thoughts influence your emotions and actions. Let's explore those doubts a bit. When you think about not achieving the results you want again, what specific thoughts come to your mind? 

User: I think things like, "Maybe I'm not smart enough to do this" or "What if everyone else does better than me again?"

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy. It's important to recognize them when they pop up. How do you feel when you think about being "not smart enough"? 

User: It feels really discouraging and makes me want to give up, honestly. 

Consultant: I can see why that would be discouraging. Let's try to challenge that thought a bit. Is there evidence that supports the idea that you aren't smart enough? Or could there be another perspective?

User: I mean, I've done well in the past... I have good grades in most subjects. It's just that my performance in high school hasn’t been great.

Consultant: That's a valuable insight, Li Qi. Your past successes indicate your capabilities. How might you reframe that thought? Instead of thinking "I'm not smart enough," what could you say to yourself that reflects your abilities more accurately?

User: I guess I could say something like "I have the potential to do better and I can work towards that."

Consultant: That's a much more empowering thought! It acknowledges your potential and encourages growth. How does that new thought make you feel compared to the previous one?

User: It definitely makes me feel more hopeful. I feel like I have something to strive towards instead of feeling defeated.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Hope is a powerful motivator. Let's think about practical steps you can take to support this hopeful mindset. Are there activities or strategies that help you study more effectively when you're feeling this hope?

User: I like setting small study goals and taking breaks. It helps me stay focused and not feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Great strategy! Setting small goals can really make tasks feel more manageable. How about integrating those small goals into your study plan, especially as you prepare for the tests?

User: That sounds like a good idea. I could plan out my study schedule week by week and break down subjects into smaller topics.

Consultant: Excellent! This structured approach can help reduce that overwhelming feeling and keep you on track. Let’s talk about what you’ll need to feel prepared. What would help you feel more certain about your study plan?

User: Maybe talking to my teachers about my plan and getting their feedback would help. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful step! Getting feedback can help solidify your plan and give you new insights. How do you feel about reaching out to them?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but knowing I’ll have a clearer plan makes me more inclined to do it.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel nervous, but it sounds like you’re also feeling motivated by the potential clarity. Let’s aim for that feeling of readiness. When do you think you might set up that meeting?

User: I could try to arrange something by the end of this week.

Consultant: That sounds like a reasonable timeline! We can discuss how that meeting goes in our next session. As you prepare, remind yourself of your strengths and the effort you’re putting into this. Is there anything else you’d like to address today?

User: I think we covered a lot. I feel a bit more reassured now about my plans.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that, Li Qi! Keep that sense of reassurance close to you as you move forward. Remember, it’s a process, and you’re taking positive steps. I look forward to hearing how everything goes in our next session!

User: Thank you! I’ll do my best and see you next time!

Consultant: You’re welcome! Take care, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello Li Qi! I'm glad to see you again. It sounds like you've had some meaningful experiences at the growth camp. How are you feeling about everything since then?

User: Hi! I feel a bit clearer about myself and my goals. The camp helped me think a lot about what I want in life, but I still need help figuring out how to make those ideas real. 

Consultant: That’s a great start! It’s wonderful to hear that you’re feeling clearer about your goals. Can you tell me what specific insights or realizations you had during the camp that you’d like to explore further?

User: I realized that I often put too much pressure on myself to succeed. I want to take things one step at a time instead of rushing toward the finish line, but it’s hard to change that mindset.

Consultant: It makes sense that shifting your mindset is challenging, especially when you've always been so driven. What would it look like for you to take things one step at a time? How do you envision that feeling?

User: I think I would feel more relaxed and confident in my abilities. I’d like to set smaller, achievable goals that lead to my bigger plans without feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy approach. Let’s work together on setting those smaller, achievable goals. What is the biggest goal you have in mind that you want to break down?

User: I want to improve my grades this year and get into a good university. But right now, my immediate goal is just to study effectively and not feel so anxious about it.

Consultant: Focusing on effective study techniques is a fantastic starting point. Let’s break this goal down further. What specific steps do you think could help you study more effectively?

User: Maybe creating a study schedule would help. And I could set specific times for each subject so that I don’t feel lost.

Consultant: A study schedule sounds like a great idea! Structuring your time can definitely help reduce anxiety. How about we outline how you can set up that schedule in a way that feels manageable and not overwhelming?

User: Sure! I think I should start with writing down the subjects I need to cover and then allocate a realistic amount of time for each one.

Consultant: That’s a good plan. When creating your schedule, how might you balance study time with breaks to avoid burnout?

User: I think I need to make sure to take regular short breaks. I often forget to take breaks and then end up feeling exhausted.

Consultant: Absolutely, taking breaks is essential for maintaining focus and conserving energy. How long do you think each study session ought to be, followed by a break?

User: I was thinking of studying for about 50 minutes and then taking a 10-minute break. That way, I can maintain my focus without getting too tired.

Consultant: That sounds effective! Let’s visualize how that study session would look. What specific things could you do during your 10-minute breaks to recharge yourself?

User: I could go for a quick walk or do some stretching. Listening to music could also help me relax in those moments.

Consultant: Those are fantastic options! Physical movement and music can be really refreshing. Now, how do you think sticking to this plan would affect your mood and confidence over time?

User: I believe it would help me feel more in control and less anxious. If I follow a plan, I think I'd see a positive change in my grades.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! Having a plan can instill a sense of control. As you implement this schedule, how will you keep track of what works for you and what doesn’t?

User: I guess I could keep a journal to note how I feel after each study session and see which subjects are most challenging. That way, I can adjust as needed.

Consultant: A journal is an excellent tool for reflection. It can help you identify patterns and areas for improvement. How do you feel about reviewing that journal regularly to monitor your progress?

User: I think that would be really helpful! I’d like to celebrate small successes as I see improvements.

Consultant: Celebrating those small wins is vital to building your confidence. What does celebrating a success look like for you?

User: Maybe treating myself to something nice, like a favorite snack, or taking time to watch a movie. That sounds fun!

Consultant: Those sound like delightful rewards! Keeping a balance between study and relaxation is crucial. As you think about your goals, how do you want to ensure that your motivation stays high during difficult times?

User: I think I need to remind myself of my long-term goal and that slow progress is still progress. Maybe looking back at my journal could inspire me.

Consultant: That’s an empowering strategy! Reminding yourself of the bigger picture can really help maintain motivation. As we near the end of our session, how are you feeling about the steps we've discussed?

User: I feel much more positive and structured about my goals now. This session has really helped me see things more clearly.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’re on an inspiring path, and I believe you can implement these plans successfully. For our next session, what would you like to focus on or review further?

User: I’d like to share how my study plan went and assess what worked and what didn’t. Thank you so much for your help today!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your progress. Remember, you have the tools to manage your journey and I’m here to support you.
###################
Consultant: Hello Li Qi! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good actually. I've been more involved in social activities and revisiting some of my old hobbies. It feels fulfilling!

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It seems like those positive changes are really benefiting you. Can you share what specific activities or hobbies you’ve found particularly enjoyable?

User: I've started painting again, which I used to love. It’s relaxing and helps me express myself. Also, I joined a volunteer group, which has been a rewarding experience.

Consultant:  Painting and volunteering both sound like great ways to channel your emotions and build connections. How have these experiences impacted your overall mood and mindset?

User: They’ve really lifted my spirits! I feel more confident and motivated now. It’s like I’m rediscovering myself after feeling stuck for a while.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling more confident and motivated. It seems like you've found some meaningful ways to express yourself and connect with others. How do you think this newfound confidence has influenced your daily life or your goals?

User: I’m setting more goals for myself, like focusing better on my studies. I want to get ready for university, and I feel more determined to achieve that.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Setting goals can be a great way to channel your energy and focus. What specific goals are you working towards in your studies right now?

User: I want to improve my grades—especially in mathematics. I’ve started to create a study schedule to keep myself accountable.

Consultant: Creating a study schedule is a proactive step. Let’s delve deeper—what challenges have you faced so far in sticking to that study schedule?

User: Sometimes, I get overwhelmed by all the material and lose focus. I also worry about not being perfect, which makes me procrastinate.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed at times, especially with high expectations. Let's explore those feelings further. When you think about the idea of "not being perfect", what thoughts come to mind?

User: I often think that if I don’t get top marks, I haven’t succeeded. It makes me feel anxious and afraid to even try.

Consultant: I see. That thought can indeed create a lot of pressure. What evidence supports this belief, and are there alternative ways to view it?

User: Well, I guess not every effort has to lead to perfection. I’ve done well in other areas just by trying my best, not necessarily being the best.

Consultant: That's an important insight! Focusing on effort rather than outcome can relieve some of that anxiety. If a friend were in your position, what advice do you think you would give them about handling perfectionism?

User: I would tell them to focus on their progress and that it’s okay to make mistakes. It’s part of learning.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re already giving yourself excellent advice. How can you implement this perspective into your own study routine to help ease some of the pressure?

User: I think I can remind myself that progress is more important than perfection and celebrate small achievements instead of only focusing on grades.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive plan. Celebrating small victories can be motivating and boost your confidence. How can you start to put this into practice right away?

User: Maybe I can set mini-goals for my study sessions and reward myself, like taking breaks to enjoy painting afterward.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Incorporating enjoyable activities as rewards can reinforce positive habits. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel excited! It makes studying seem less daunting and more balanced.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear you’re feeling excited about it! As we discuss these approaches, how do you feel about the progress you’ve made since we started our sessions together?

User: I feel like I’ve made significant strides, especially in understanding my feelings and developing healthier perspectives.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Li Qi! We’ve discussed a lot of positive changes. Looking ahead, how can you maintain this momentum and continue your personal growth?

User: I think I’ll keep setting realistic goals and remind myself that it’s okay to not have everything figured out. I also want to keep engaging in my hobbies.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies for maintaining your growth. As we come to a close on our sessions, let's reflect—what would you consider your biggest takeaway from our time together?

User: I’ve learned that it’s okay to let go of perfection and embrace my journey. That’s really helped my confidence.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization. As we end our sessions, remember that you have the tools to manage your emotions and pursue your goals. Whenever you feel the need for support, I’m here for you. Good luck on your journey!

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate all your help and support.
