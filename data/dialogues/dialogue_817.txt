Consultant: Hello Liu! I'm glad you're here today. Before we begin, I’d like to understand how you've been feeling recently. Can you share what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious and self-conscious. After my exam results, I just feel lost in this new school. It's hard for me to keep up with my classes, and my Mandarin isn’t great. Everyone seems to be doing better than me, which makes me feel even worse.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling quite overwhelmed by the changes in your school environment, and it’s impacting your confidence. Can you tell me more about how these feelings of anxiety and self-doubt manifest in your daily life?

User: I often feel embarrassed to speak in class because I’m afraid I’ll make mistakes. I also avoid socializing because I worry I won’t connect with my classmates, and that just makes me feel more isolated.

Consultant: That must be really tough to go through. It seems like your fear of making mistakes and not fitting in is affecting both your studies and social interactions. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come to your mind when you’re in these situations?

User: Yes, I often think that I will embarrass myself or that my classmates will judge me. It makes me not want to try at all.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. It’s important to recognize these thoughts because they can influence how you feel and behave. Would you say these thoughts are often based on evidence, or do you feel they might be influenced by your anxiety?

User: I guess they might be influenced by my anxiety. I don’t have concrete proof that others think poorly of me, but I still feel that way.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight. It seems like your anxiety may be leading you to assume the worst about how others perceive you. Let's try to challenge that thought—what would you say to a friend who expresses similar feelings? How would you help them reframe their situation?

User: I would probably tell them not to worry about what others think and to just focus on being themselves. 

Consultant: That’s excellent advice! So, if you were to apply that same perspective to yourself, how might it change your feelings about speaking in class or connecting with your classmates?

User: I think it might help me to let go of some of that fear. If I remind myself that it doesn’t matter what others think, maybe I would feel less anxious.

Consultant: Exactly! Practicing self-compassion and reminding yourself that everyone makes mistakes can help shift your mindset. What could be a small step you could take this week to practice this new way of thinking?

User: Maybe I could try raising my hand in class, even if I’m nervous. Just to practice speaking up.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Taking small steps can help build your confidence over time. How do you think you will feel after trying that?

User: I think I might feel proud of myself for trying, even if it doesn't go perfectly.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful outlook! Celebrating your efforts, regardless of the outcome, is an essential part of building self-esteem. How have you been coping with your feelings of isolation from your classmates so far?

User: I mostly just keep to myself. It feels safer that way, but I know it's not helping my situation.

Consultant: It’s understandable that you would seek safety in solitude when feeling anxious. However, gradual exposure to social interactions might help reduce that feeling of isolation. Are there any classmates you feel a bit more comfortable with that you could reach out to?

User: There are a couple of students I sit next to in class. I guess I could try to talk to them after lessons.

Consultant: That sounds like a good idea! Maybe start with simple topics or discussions about classwork. How do you feel about approaching them?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think I can do it. 

Consultant: It’s normal to feel nervous about initiating conversations, but take it at your own pace. What positive outcomes do you think could result from these interactions?

User: I guess I might find common interests and maybe make a new friend. That would be nice.

Consultant: Absolutely! Building a support network can really help ease feelings of anxiety and boost your confidence. How about we set a small goal for you to try talking to one person this week? 

User: Yes, I can do that! I’ll try to talk to at least one classmate this week.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Remember to be kind to yourself, regardless of how it goes. We can discuss your experiences in our next session. How are you feeling about everything we’ve talked about today?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful now, like I have some steps I can take. It feels nice to talk about this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You've made some impressive insights today. Remember, it's about taking one step at a time. I'm looking forward to hearing how it goes next week.

User: Thank you! I feel better knowing I have a plan.

Consultant: You're welcome! Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need support before our next session. See you soon!

Consultant: Hello Liu! I'm glad you're here for our session today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious because I've noticed my classmates forming study groups, and I feel excluded. It's hard for me to even think about joining them.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're feeling a sense of isolation and a bit of anxiety about reaching out to others. Can you tell me more about what goes through your mind when you think about joining those groups?

User: I just think they'll reject me or that I won't fit in. It feels safer to just stay on the sidelines.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s natural to feel that way when you’re faced with social situations that are challenging. When you think about the possibility of joining those groups, what specific feelings come up for you? 

User: I feel embarrassed and nervous, like everyone is judging me. I really want to be part of the group, but I just can't bring myself to do it.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel nervous in that situation. Those feelings of embarrassment and fear of judgment can be overwhelming. Let's try to pinpoint those thoughts—what exactly do you think they might judge you for?

User: I think they'll think I'm not smart enough or that I don't have anything to contribute.  

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really tough to deal with. Let's explore them together. How much evidence do you think supports these thoughts? Are there moments where you’ve shown your knowledge or contributions that could contradict these judgments?

User: I do help my classmates with some subjects. Maybe they wouldn’t think that... but when I’m anxious, I just can’t recall those moments.

Consultant: That’s an important point! It sounds like in the moment of anxiety, it becomes difficult to remember your strengths. What if we tried to focus on reinforcing that positive side? What could you tell yourself instead when you feel those anxious thoughts creeping in?

User: I guess I could remind myself that I have helped others before and that I can contribute.

Consultant: That's a great start! Positive self-talk can be really beneficial. Now, let’s think about small, manageable steps you could take to begin engaging with your classmates. What’s one small action you could try that feels a bit challenging but doable?

User: Maybe I could just say hi to one classmate next time?

Consultant: Absolutely! A simple "hi" is a good way to start small. How do you think you would feel after saying hello?

User: I think I’d feel a little better, but also still nervous.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous, but remember, taking that small step is a significant achievement. How about we track how you feel after trying that out? 

User: Yeah, I would like that. I think I need to practice being more social.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. If you notice those anxious feelings coming up again, remind yourself of your strengths and the positive interactions you can have. Would you be willing to try this out before our next session?

User: Yes, I’ll try. I just hope it goes well. 

Consultant: It’s great that you’re willing to take action! Remember, it’s just a step, and it doesn’t have to be perfect. After you try, we can discuss how it went, no matter the outcome. How does that make you feel?

User: It makes me feel a bit relieved, I guess. Like I’m not alone in this.

Consultant: You’re definitely not alone, Liu. I’m here to support you through this process. Is there anything else on your mind today before we wrap up?

User: No, I think that’s it for now. I’m just happy we talked about this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Just remember, every small step counts, and I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress. Until next time, take care!

User: Thank you! I will.

Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you today. It’s important that you are here to talk about how you’ve been feeling. Can you share what’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really embarrassed and helpless at school. I cry sometimes, and I think my classmates and teachers are starting to notice. It makes me feel more anxious.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like the situation at school is quite overwhelming for you right now. Can you tell me more about what leads you to cry at school?

User: I find studying really hard. I don't understand a lot of the topics, and I feel like I'm falling behind. I also struggle to talk to other students, so I just feel really lonely.

Consultant: That sounds frustrating and isolating. Feeling lost academically and having difficulty in social situations can be really tough. How do you usually cope with these feelings when they arise?

User: I usually just try to stay quiet and keep to myself. I feel like nobody would understand what I’m going through if I talked about it.

Consultant: It makes sense that you would want to keep your feelings to yourself, especially if you’re worried about being understood. But feeling isolated can often make things feel worse. Have you noticed any thoughts that come to mind when you're feeling this way?

User: Sometimes I think I'm just not good enough, and that I’ll always be alone. I get really scared about being judged by others.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very heavy and difficult to carry. Let's take a moment to explore them together. What evidence do you have that supports the belief that you are not good enough?

User: I guess I think about my grades and how I struggle to make friends. It just feels like I’m always behind.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re putting a lot of pressure on yourself based on your grades and social interactions. But it’s important to remember that these moments don’t define your worth. What if we tried to challenge those thoughts by considering other possibilities? What could you say to yourself instead?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that I’m still learning and that it’s okay to struggle sometimes. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! Embracing that you are in a learning process can be incredibly freeing. Now, when you feel the urge to withdraw, what could be a small step you might take to connect with someone instead?

User: I could try saying hello to someone in my class, maybe even join a group study session. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Taking small steps can help build your confidence. How do you think you would feel if you initiated a simple conversation with a classmate?

User: I think I might feel nervous at first, but it might feel nice to talk to someone instead of being alone.

Consultant: That’s a positive perspective! Feeling nervous is completely normal. Let’s work on some phrases or topics you could use to start that conversation. What interests do you share with your classmates?

User: I think some of them like the same shows I do. Maybe I could ask about their favorite episodes?

Consultant: Perfect! Asking about common interests is a great way to spark a conversation. Let’s also think about how to manage the anxiety you might feel. What techniques have you tried so far when you start feeling overwhelmed?

User: I've been taking deep breaths when I start to feel anxious, but it doesn’t always help much in the moment.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a good technique! We could explore other methods as well, like grounding exercises or focusing on your senses. Have you heard of those before?

User: No, I haven’t. How do they work?

Consultant: Grounding exercises can help center your thoughts. For instance, you could try describing the things you see, hear, and feel in your environment. It helps bring your focus back to the present. Would you like to practice that now?

User: Sure, I’d like to try!

Consultant: Great! Take a moment to look around you. Can you name three things you see right now?

User: I see my notebook, a pencil, and a window outside.

Consultant: Excellent! Now, can you describe two sounds you hear?

User: I hear the ticking of a clock and some distant chatter.

Consultant: Wonderful! Finally, can you share one thing you feel, such as the temperature or texture?

User: I feel the coolness of the desk under my hands.

Consultant: Well done! This type of exercise can help bring you back to the moment when you start to feel overwhelmed. How do you feel after doing this practice?

User: I feel a bit calmer. I think I can use this when I feel anxious at school.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s a useful tool to add to your toolkit. Now, as we look ahead, what would you hope to achieve in our next sessions together?

User: I hope to feel more comfortable participating in group activities and developing my social skills.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! We can certainly work on enhancing your social strategies. I believe you have the potential to engage more with others. Remember, each small step is a victory. 

User: Thank you! I feel a little more hopeful about things.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Liu! I’m glad to see you feeling hopeful. Let’s continue to build on that progress together. I'm looking forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're here today. I know you've been trying to participate in some activities at school. How are you feeling about that right now?

User: Hi. I'm feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. I want to join in, but I keep worrying about how I might not fit in or be accepted.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way when trying something new, especially in a social environment. The desire to belong is very strong. What do you think could help you feel more comfortable when joining these activities?

User: Maybe if I could make a few friends first, that would help. But I don't know how to start a conversation without feeling awkward.

Consultant: Making friends can definitely ease that pressure. Let’s explore ways you could initiate conversations. What are some interests or hobbies you could share with someone to start a dialogue?

User: I like drawing and reading. I could mention that, but I'm worried it might come off as boring.

Consultant: Those are great interests! Many people could connect with drawing and reading. Have you thought about how you could ask someone about their interests in return?

User: That makes sense. I could ask them what they like to do for fun. But what if they don’t seem interested?

Consultant: It’s okay to feel concerned about their reaction. Remember, you can't control how others respond, but you can control your effort to reach out. Even if someone isn’t interested, it doesn’t reflect who you are. What would it feel like to try anyway?

User: I suppose it would feel a bit scary, but also maybe a little freeing. I just really don’t want to be rejected again.

Consultant: Rejection is a tough experience, but taking that step can be an opportunity for growth. If you do face rejection, we can work on ways to cope with that feeling together. How about we set a small goal for your next activity?

User: That sounds good. Maybe I could aim to talk to one person about drawing?

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! Talking to one person is very manageable. How about we also brainstorm some possible conversation starters you could use?

User: Yeah, I could say something like, "I just started drawing again, do you draw?" or "What's your favorite book?" 

Consultant: Those are great conversation starters! They’re friendly and open-ended. Remember, the goal is just to connect and share. How would it feel to have these ready when you go to the activity?

User: I think it would make me feel a bit more prepared. I’ll try to remind myself that it’s okay if it doesn’t go perfectly.

Consultant: Absolutely! Preparing yourself with those starters is already a step towards confidence. Let’s also talk about self-encouragement—how can you remind yourself to be proud of taking that step regardless of the outcome?

User: Maybe I could write a note to myself that says it’s okay to take risks and that I’m brave for trying.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Having that note could serve as a great reminder. Now, looking ahead, what do you hope will change for you after trying this conversation?

User: I hope it will help me feel less anxious about being in social situations and maybe even help me make a friend or two.

Consultant: I love that hope! Reducing anxiety and building friendships are fantastic goals. How might you celebrate even the small steps you take toward that happening?

User: I could treat myself to something nice, like a favorite snack or a little art supply after the activity.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely way to reward yourself! Celebrating your efforts is key. As you prepare for your next activity, remember that every small interaction builds your confidence. 

User: Yes, I really like that idea. I’ll keep telling myself that progress is progress.

Consultant: Exactly! Progress is indeed progress, no matter how small. How do you feel about our conversation today? 

User: It’s been really reassuring. I feel more empowered to try. Thank you!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You’ve made some great plans today. Remember, it’s about taking these steps at your own pace. I’m here to help you through it. 

User: I appreciate that a lot. I feel like I have a clearer picture of what I want to do now.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Keep reflecting on these feelings, and when we meet again, we can discuss how your experiences went. I look forward to hearing about your progress.

User: Thank you! I feel more optimistic about this. I will definitely try to engage more.

Consultant: I believe in you! You’re taking significant steps forward. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need to talk about anything in between our sessions. Keep being brave!

User: I will. Thank you for your support! I feel more confident now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. Until next time, take care and embrace those new experiences!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty good, actually. After the talent show at school, I received a lot of positive feedback. It really boosted my confidence. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like that experience really validated you and helped improve your self-esteem. Can you tell me more about how you feel when you receive that kind of recognition?

User: Well, it made me feel valued and like I actually belong. I used to be really shy, but this event made me feel like I could open up more to everyone.

Consultant: It's great to see how this recognition has positively impacted your sense of belonging and willingness to connect with others. Looking forward, how do you envision using this newfound confidence in social situations?

User: I want to participate more in class and maybe join some clubs. I hope to make more friends too.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! Engaging more in class and connecting with peers can foster even more positive experiences. What would it feel like for you to step into those situations more often?

User: I think it would feel exciting but also a little scary. Sometimes I worry about what others will think of me or if I’ll embarrass myself.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel a mix of excitement and fear when trying new things. Let’s explore those fears. What specific thoughts do you have when you think about participating or meeting new people?

User: I often think they might laugh at me or that I might say something stupid. It makes me hesitant to speak up.

Consultant: I understand. Those thoughts can be quite discouraging. Can we work together to challenge those unhelpful thoughts? For example, what evidence do you have that supports these fears? 

User: I don’t really have any strong evidence. It’s mostly just my worries taking over.

Consultant: That's an important realization. It sounds like those fears may be more about your feelings than the reality of the situation. If a friend were feeling that way, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to make mistakes and that everyone has their own insecurities.

Consultant: Exactly! It's very compassionate of you to recognize that. Let's work on how you can apply that perspective to yourself. What would it look like for you to talk to yourself the way you would talk to a friend?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s okay to be imperfect and that most people are supportive.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! By practicing positive self-talk, you can gradually change how you feel about these situations. What’s one small step you could take this week to start practicing this new mindset?

User: Maybe I could try speaking up in class at least once and remind myself that it’s okay if I’m not perfect.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Speaking up at least once will be a positive step forward. How do you feel about this challenge?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. It feels good to have a goal!

Consultant: That's a positive reaction! It’s totally normal to feel a bit anxious about trying something new. Remember to acknowledge your feelings, but don't let them hold you back. How can we best prepare for this experience?

User: I can write down some notes about what I want to say and practice them before class.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Practicing can help ease some of that anxiety. Do you think having a few notes will help you feel more prepared and confident?

User: Yes, I think it will! It makes me feel like I have a plan.

Consultant: Having a plan can make a world of difference. It helps you feel more in control of the situation. How will you reward yourself after participating?

User: I think I’ll treat myself to something nice, maybe a favorite snack or some time to relax afterward.

Consultant: That’s a lovely idea! Treating yourself acknowledges the effort you put in and reinforces positive behavior. Let's also reflect on your progress throughout this process. How do you feel about the changes you've made so far?

User: I feel really proud! I can see how I've become more willing to engage socially, and I enjoy it.

Consultant: You should feel proud! Recognizing these changes is vital for your growth. As we wrap up today, what are you looking forward to in terms of your social interactions moving forward?

User: I’m looking forward to making new friends and sharing more of my talents. I feel hopeful for the future. 

Consultant: That’s a beautiful outlook! I believe you are well on your way. Remember, you have the skills and mindset to navigate these new experiences successfully. If you ever need support, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m really glad to have been able to support you. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. I'm really glad about how I've been participating more in class projects and making friends. It feels nice to be more outgoing.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're feeling a sense of achievement and satisfaction with your social interactions. Can you tell me a bit more about how you feel when you're involved in these projects?

User: When I'm working with my classmates, I feel excited and a bit nervous at the same time. But overall, the experience is rewarding, and I enjoy collaborating with others.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re experiencing both excitement and reward from collaboration. Those mixed feelings are quite normal. How do these feelings impact your confidence in interacting with your classmates?

User: I think they boost my confidence. I've noticed that I’m more willing to speak up and share my ideas. It’s like my efforts are being recognized.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Liu! It seems like your hard work is paying off and allowing you to be more expressive. In addition to enjoying those moments, how do you feel about your family relationships recently?

User: They have improved a lot. I feel like I can talk to my grandparents more openly now. It’s nice to connect with them, especially since my parents are away for work most of the time.

Consultant: That’s really encouraging to hear! Building connections with your grandparents can provide you with valuable support. How does that connection help you, especially when you're facing challenges?

User: Talking to them makes me feel less alone. They share their experiences, which helps me feel understood. It gives me some comfort when I'm stressed about school.

Consultant: It sounds like they offer a comforting presence and valuable wisdom. As you continue to thrive both socially and academically, are there any concerns or challenges you'd like to address today?

User: I guess sometimes I worry about keeping up this progress. What if I go back to being quieter and more withdrawn like before?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It's common to fear regression after positive changes. Let's explore some strategies you can use to maintain your growth. Have you identified any specific skills or techniques you've gained that you could continue practicing?

User: Yes, I have! I’ve been more open to expressing my thoughts and being proactive in group discussions. I want to keep that up.

Consultant: That's an excellent approach! Staying proactive in conversations will help reinforce your confidence. Would you be open to setting some small goals for yourself to practice these skills further?

User: I’d like that! Maybe I can aim to contribute at least once in every group discussion.

Consultant: That sounds like a great goal! Contributing once in each discussion will allow you to gradually build your confidence. How do you feel about noticing when you’re achieving this goal?

User: I think I could keep a journal to track my contributions. That way, I can look back and see my progress.

Consultant: A journal is an effective way to reflect on your experiences and recognize your growth. It allows you to celebrate your achievements. How do you feel about integrating this journaling practice into your routine?

User: I’m excited! Journaling feels like a good way to process my feelings, and it will motivate me to keep speaking up.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Writing can help solidify your new skills. As we wrap up our session, let’s summarize the progress you’ve made: you've built rapport with peers, improved family connections, and identified proactive strategies to maintain your confidence. Do you feel proud of these accomplishments?

User: Yes, I really do! I’m happy with how far I’ve come.

Consultant: That’s great to hear, Liu! Remember, it's essential to continue nurturing those connections and actively engaging with others. Whenever you feel unsure, refer back to your journal to remind yourself of your progress. If challenges arise, you know how to reach out for support.

User: Thank you! This conversation really helped me feel more secure about moving forward. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Remember, you have the tools and support you need to continue your journey. Feel free to reach out anytime. Goodbye for now!

User: Goodbye!
