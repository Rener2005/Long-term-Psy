Consultant: Hello, Xiaoli! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I'm feeling really anxious again. The thought of speaking English in class makes my heart race, and I often feel like I'm going to embarrass myself.

Consultant: I understand that speaking in English can be quite daunting for you. Let's explore those feelings together. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about speaking in class?

User: I keep thinking that my classmates will judge me or laugh at my mistakes. It makes me feel so insecure.

Consultant: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy weight of fear about judgment. Have you noticed how those thoughts make you feel in the moment before speaking?

User: Yes, I feel very nervous and sometimes even avoid participating in discussions altogether. I just want to disappear.

Consultant: Avoiding those situations could provide temporary relief, but it also keeps you from growing more comfortable with speaking. What could be a small step you could take to gradually engage with your classmates in a safer way?

User: Maybe I could start by talking to one classmate during lunch? That feels a bit less intimidating.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Talking to one person during lunch could be a less overwhelming way to practice your speaking. How would you feel about setting that as a goal for this week?

User: I think that could work. But what if I mess up or can’t remember the right words?

Consultant: It’s completely normal to fear making mistakes, but remember, everyone makes them. What might you tell a friend in your situation who fears making mistakes?

User: I would probably encourage them to look at the positive side, like just having fun and learning from the experience.

Consultant: Exactly! Treating yourself with the same kindness you would offer to a friend can be incredibly helpful. How about thinking of your conversations as opportunities to learn rather than tests?

User: I like that perspective. I guess it would make things feel less stressful.

Consultant: Great! As you approach those conversations, try to remind yourself that learning takes time, and it's okay to make mistakes. Have you noticed any small successes in your study or social interactions that we can build on together?

User: Well, I managed to answer a question in class last week, even though I was really scared.

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement! Speaking up in class is a brave step. How did it feel for you afterward?

User: I felt proud of myself, but then I started doubting if I would be able to do it again.

Consultant: Doubt is a very common feeling to experience after stepping out of your comfort zone. When you felt proud, what thoughts went through your mind that motivated you to speak up?

User: I thought maybe I could do this, just like everyone else, but then the fear took over again.

Consultant: It's understandable that the fear resurfaces. Let's practice recognizing that positive thought. Next time that fear arises, you can remind yourself that you have done it before and can do it again. How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful. I’ll try to remember that.

Consultant: Excellent! Building that inner dialogue will be important. As you prepare to speak up, what are some strategies you could use to calm your nerves beforehand?

User: I can practice deep breathing or maybe rehearse what I want to say in my head.

Consultant: Those are effective techniques! Making a habit of these calming strategies can help ease your anxiety before speaking. When you feel anxious, which of these methods do you find most comforting?

User: I think deep breathing helps a lot. It makes me feel more grounded.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a solid plan in place. Can we set a specific time where you’ll practice these techniques, maybe before your lunch conversations?

User: Sure! I can take a few minutes to breathe deeply before I approach someone.

Consultant: That sounds like a promising plan. As we wrap up for today, what is one positive affirmation you would like to remind yourself of regarding your communication skills?

User: I want to tell myself that I am making progress and that it’s okay to take my time.

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation, Xiaoli. Remember, every step you take counts. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. You’re doing great!

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoli! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been quite anxious. After the English corner activity, I still can’t get over the embarrassment of not being able to speak. I feel like I’m not making any progress and it’s really discouraging.

Consultant: I hear you, Xiaoli. That sounds really tough, especially when you're trying to engage and express yourself. Can you tell me more about your thoughts or feelings during that English corner activity?

User: Well, I was very nervous when I got there. I kept thinking about how everyone must be judging me for not being able to speak well. Then, when it was my turn to speak, I just froze and couldn’t say anything. It felt like everyone was looking at me, and I just wanted to disappear.

Consultant: It sounds like you felt a lot of pressure in that moment. You mentioned feeling judged—what were the specific thoughts running through your mind at that time?

User: I thought they would think I’m stupid for not knowing how to speak properly. I felt like I was wasting everyone’s time just by being there. It made me feel even worse about myself.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. Those thoughts can feel very intense. Let's explore this a bit. Do you think there's evidence to support the idea that others view you that negatively?

User: I suppose not. I mean, they’re just practicing too, right? But in the moment, it felt very real. 

Consultant: Exactly, in the moment it can feel overwhelming, but stepping back sometimes helps. If a friend were in your position, what might you tell them?

User: I would probably say it’s okay to struggle and that everyone is learning together. But I don’t know, I can’t seem to apply that advice to myself.

Consultant: That’s a great realization, Xiaoli. You recognize the kindness you would offer to a friend. Let’s try to apply that same kindness to yourself. What would be a more balanced thought to replace the critical one about yourself?

User: Maybe I could think that it’s okay to not be perfect and that everyone has their own pace. But doing it is just so hard!

Consultant: It's definitely a process, and it’s okay to take your time. What if we think about a small step you could take next time to help ease that anxiety? Perhaps starting with just a few words or phrases?

User: I could try. Maybe I could prepare a few simple sentences in advance to feel more confident?

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Preparing beforehand can help you feel more composed. How about practicing those sentences out loud, even by yourself first? 

User: Yes, that could help me feel less scared. I just need to remember that practice is part of learning.

Consultant: Right! And you’re taking proactive steps, which is fantastic. Each little success counts. What else do you think you could do to feel more comfortable in those situations?

User: Maybe I could focus on my breath a bit before speaking. It might help calm my nerves.

Consultant: Absolutely! Breathing techniques can really help center you. Let’s practice a few deep breaths together. Would you like to try that?

User: Sure, I’m willing to try that!

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in for a count of four, hold for four, and then exhale for six. Ready? Inhale… 1, 2, 3, 4… hold… 1, 2, 3, 4… and exhale... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. How did that feel?

User: I felt a little more relaxed. I think I can do this.

Consultant: That’s excellent to hear! You've just taken a step toward feeling less anxious. Let’s also consider how you can track your progress. Would it be helpful for you to keep a journal of these experiences?

User: Yes, I think writing down my feelings and experiences would help me see how I’m improving.

Consultant: Fantastic! It can help normalize your feelings and show your growth over time. What do you think your first entry might include about today?

User: I think I’d write about how I felt anxious but also found ways to cope with it, like breathing and preparing sentences.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Reflecting on your progress each session will reinforce the strategies you’re building. As we prepare for future situations, let’s talk about how you want to approach feedback from others.

User: I honestly feel really sensitive to what people might say about me. I often think they’re criticizing me, even when they’re not.

Consultant: It makes sense that sensitivity can heighten your anxiety. What if we work on acknowledging those feelings without letting them take over? How might that change your perspective?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that not all feedback is negative. I could think of it as constructive or helpful instead.

Consultant: Yes! That’s a wonderful reframe. If feedback comes your way, can you try to view it as something you can learn from rather than a judgment of your worth?

User: I can definitely try to do that. It seems like a healthier way to look at it.

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s all about shifting that perception. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ve gained from this session. What stands out to you?

User: I’ve learned that I can prepare ahead, practice breathing, and try to view feedback differently. It feels good to have some strategies to help my anxiety.

Consultant: You’ve made significant strides, Xiaoli! Remember, it’s completely normal to feel nervous, and you’re taking meaningful steps to work through those feelings. How do you feel about continuing this journey?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful now. I realize it’s okay to take my time.

Consultant: That's the spirit! You're already making progress, and I'm here to support you along the way. If challenges come up, remember you can always return to these strategies. Looking forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hi Xiaoli! I'm really glad you could join the session today. Last time, we talked about your feelings regarding others' evaluations and your sensitivity to them. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been trying to work on it, but I still find myself feeling really anxious about how others perceive me, especially in class. When I speak up, I often think that everyone is judging me negatively.

Consultant: It sounds like you're still feeling that heaviness regarding your classmates' reactions. Could you share an example of a time recently when you felt this way?

User: Just last week, I tried to ask a question in class, but I thought I saw some classmates whispering. I convinced myself that they were laughing at me, which made me really upset.

Consultant: I can hear how distressing that must have been for you. It seems like that moment really affected your self-esteem. Can you tell me what thoughts went through your mind at that time?

User: I thought that they must think I'm stupid for not knowing the answer. It felt like everyone was looking down on me.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really harsh. Let's unpack that a bit. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that they were laughing at you specifically?

User: I don't have any solid proof, but it just felt that way in the moment. It’s like I could sense their judgment.

Consultant: I understand that feeling. It's tough when our emotions take over. What do you think could be another possible interpretation of that situation? Could there be any reasons for their behavior that have nothing to do with you?

User: Maybe they were just chatting about something else completely? I guess I don’t know for sure what they were talking about.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to remember that you can’t read others’ minds. This realization can help you reframe the situation. How does it feel to think that their focus might not have been on you at all?

User: It makes me feel a bit relieved. Maybe I’m being too harsh on myself. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Xiaoli! Let’s practice replacing those initial negative thoughts with this new perspective. What would you say to a friend who felt this way?

User: I would probably tell them that they shouldn't worry about what others think. They should focus on their own efforts.

Consultant: Perfect! That’s such a supportive approach. Let’s try to apply that same kindness to yourself. When you feel sensitive to criticism, how could you remind yourself to think like that friend instead?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that everyone makes mistakes and that I’m trying my best. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Emphasizing your efforts is a healthy way to combat those feelings. Let’s move on to discussing some positive experiences you’ve had in social situations—perhaps in clubs or with friends.

User: I joined a language club recently, and it’s been fun. I still feel shy, but they’re really supportive. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Engaging with supportive people is an excellent way to build confidence. How do you feel when you’re in that environment?

User: I feel more comfortable, but I still worry they might laugh at my mistakes in English.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those worries. But remind yourself that everyone there is likely understanding and learning too. What if you took small steps to share your thoughts more in the club? 

User: Maybe I could start by sharing my experiences more often instead of worrying about my English.

Consultant: Exactly! Taking small steps can lead to greater confidence. How do you think your peers would respond if you shared your feelings about learning English?

User: I think they would be understanding. After all, everyone is there to learn.

Consultant: For sure! This can help you realize that those shared experiences could actually bring you closer to your peers. Shall we role-play a scenario where you express yourself in that club setting?

User: Sure! I can pretend I’m sharing about my background and how I’m working on my English.

Consultant: Great! I’ll be a member of the club, and you can start when you’re ready.

User: Okay… Hi everyone, I’m Xiaoli, and I come from a small village. I’m really excited to improve my English, even though sometimes I feel shy about my speaking.

Consultant: That was a wonderful start, Xiaoli! How do you think people would respond to that?

User: I think they’d probably be really supportive. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing that vulnerability can create connections. How does that experience feel compared to your previous fears?

User: It feels empowering. Like it’s okay to be open about my struggles.

Consultant: Yes! Recognizing that it’s okay to share can significantly help in building those social bonds. How can you carry this feeling into future interactions?

User: I’ll try to remind myself that it’s okay to be vulnerable and that my peers will likely understand.

Consultant: Perfect! Your ability to recognize and act on this is commendable. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on the progress you’ve made in adjusting your perspective towards others’ evaluations.

User: I feel like I’m starting to see things in a more balanced way, even if it's just a little bit. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization! Remember, these positive experiences will take time to build confidence. What strategies will you use to maintain this growth moving forward?

User: I will keep practicing speaking more in club activities and remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes. 

Consultant: Wonderful commitments! I believe in your ability to manage these feelings and grow further. Today marks a great step towards achieving that! For our next session, we can keep building on this. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I feel more hopeful now. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaoli! I'm glad to see your hopefulness. Remember, I’m here to support you whenever you need it. Take care, and I’ll see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hi Xiaoli! I'm glad you're here today. I want to hear about your experiences in the club activities. How have you been feeling about them?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better since joining the club. Everyone has been really friendly, but sometimes I still feel nervous and out of place.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’ve found friendliness in the club. Feeling nervous is completely normal, especially in new social situations. Can you tell me more about the moments when you feel out of place?

User: Well, when I’m with the other members, I sometimes struggle to keep up with the conversation, especially in English. I feel like my speaking skills are holding me back from really connecting with them.

Consultant: I can see why that would make you feel uneasy. It sounds like you're worried about how well you’re able to communicate in English compared to others. Can you share any specific thoughts that come to your mind during these conversations?

User: I often think that they must find it hard to understand me or get annoyed by my mistakes. I feel like I’m not as smart as they are.

Consultant: That’s a tough place to be in, feeling that way about your abilities. Let's explore those thoughts. Do you think there is evidence that they find you difficult to understand or dislike your mistakes?

User: I mean, I don't know for sure; they seem nice, but I just assume it. Maybe I’m just being too sensitive.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those assumptions, but it’s important to challenge them too. If a friend made similar mistakes, would you think negatively of them? 

User: No, I would probably just encourage them. I guess I’m being hard on myself.

Consultant: Exactly! Remember, it's okay to make mistakes while learning. It’s part of the process. How about we start a positive thinking journal where you can note down the encouraging moments you experience, both in the club and beyond?

User: That sounds helpful! I think writing down positive experiences might help me see things more clearly.

Consultant: Fantastic! It can be a powerful tool to reinforce your confidence and social interactions. What kind of positive experiences have you had in the club that we can start with?

User: Last week, I shared an opinion during a discussion, and they seemed to appreciate it. They even asked for my thoughts again later.

Consultant: That’s a great example! You contributed to the conversation, and they valued your input. How did that make you feel?

User: It felt nice to be heard. I was surprised, actually!

Consultant: Being surprised in a positive way is a wonderful sign! Let’s note that down. What do you think you can do to create more opportunities for yourself to share in the group?

User: Maybe I could prepare a few thoughts before meetings. That way, I’ll feel more ready and confident to speak up.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant idea! Preparation can definitely ease some anxiety. How do you feel about taking this small step for the next meeting?

User: I feel a bit more excited about it. It feels manageable.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Remember, every small step contributes to your overall growth. Are there any other aspects of this new environment that you’ve found challenging or are concerned about?

User: I worry about balancing my time between studies and club activities. I don’t want to fall behind in my classes.

Consultant: Balancing commitments can be tricky. Have you considered what your priorities are, and how you can manage your time more effectively?

User: I haven’t really mapped it out yet. I usually just go with the flow.

Consultant: That’s understandable, but creating a structure could help alleviate some of that stress. Would you like to brainstorm how to prioritize and manage your time between studying and the club?

User: Yes, I’d like that. It would probably relieve some of my worries about falling behind.

Consultant: Let’s tackle that together. First, let’s list down all your commitments and see how much time you can allocate to each. How does that sound?

User: Sounds like a good plan! I think I need to see it in front of me.

Consultant: Perfect! Once we can visualize it, we’ll have a better idea of how to fit everything in without feeling overwhelmed. You’re taking great steps toward managing these feelings!

User: Thanks! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: Absolutely, Xiaoli! I’m here to help. Let’s focus on these strategies and keep capturing those positive experiences. How do you feel about where we are now?

User: I feel more hopeful. I’m looking forward to trying out these ideas and seeing how they work for me.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! We’ll keep building on this progress. For our next session, let’s check in on how the journaling and time management went, alright?

User: Yes, I will definitely do that. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in you and your ability to navigate these challenges. I’m looking forward to our next meeting. Take care!

User: Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Li! I'm really glad to see you today. How are you feeling about your new responsibilities?

User: Hi! I'm feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety. The group activity I’m coordinating is a bit overwhelming, but I also see it as a chance to grow.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing both anticipation and some worries. That’s completely normal when taking on new challenges. What specific aspects of this responsibility are causing you concern?

User: I worry that I won’t be able to communicate effectively with my group, especially since my Mandarin isn’t great and my English skills are still developing.

Consultant: I hear you. Communication can be challenging, especially in a new role. Let’s explore this together. What do you think would help you feel more confident when communicating with your group?

User: Maybe practicing my English and finding ways to express myself better could help, but I’m not sure where to start.

Consultant: That’s a good insight! Practicing will definitely build your confidence. We can break this down into smaller, manageable steps. What if we focus on a couple of simple phrases or ideas you want to convey in the group, and practice them together?

User: That could work! I think doing it in smaller chunks might make it less intimidating.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s also talk about how you can set time aside for these practice sessions. Have you thought about incorporating this practice into your daily or weekly schedule?

User: I haven’t really planned it out yet. I usually just study when I feel I have time, but maybe I should be more intentional about it.

Consultant: Creating a dedicated practice time could really help. How about we outline a simple weekly schedule that includes these practice sessions, along with your other responsibilities?

User: That sounds helpful! I can see how planning it out might ease my anxiety about not being prepared.

Consultant: Great! Let's map out when you'll practice and also incorporate your other tasks. What are the most important activities you need to balance along with this newfound responsibility?

User: I definitely need to keep up with my classes and studying, and I also want to spend some time with my brother. He sometimes feels lonely because of my school schedule.

Consultant: It’s thoughtful of you to consider your brother’s feelings! Balancing studies and family is important. How would you feel about allocating time for both your practice and family? 

User: I think I could find time in the evenings once my classes are over. That way I won’t neglect either responsibility.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! How does scheduling evening practice sessions sound to you? You could use this time to both prepare for your role and connect with your brother.

User: I like that idea! It would help me to stay on task and still be there for him. 

Consultant: Excellent! Let's also think about how to foster support with your group. Have you discussed your challenges with anyone in the group?

User: Not really. I guess I thought I should handle everything on my own. 

Consultant: It’s common to feel that way, but opening up can strengthen your connections. Could you consider sharing your feelings with your group? It might help others feel comfortable sharing theirs too.

User: That could be helpful! I hadn’t thought about it that way. Maybe if I open up, they'll support me more.

Consultant: Definitely! Creating this sort of environment can make everyone feel valued and strengthen teamwork. How do you think you might start that conversation?

User: I could start by saying I really want our group to succeed but I’m feeling a bit unsure. That way I can be straightforward about my feelings.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful approach! Being honest about your feelings can encourage openness. How do you feel about taking this step?

User: I feel nervous but also excited. It seems like I could really build a better dynamic with them.

Consultant: That’s an important insight! Feeling nervous is natural, but it also shows you care about your group's success. What steps can you take to manage that nervousness when the time comes?

User: I could remind myself that everyone is just trying to do their best, just like me. Maybe I can breathe deeply before speaking.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Breathing techniques can really help center yourself. We can also explore some affirmations you can remind yourself of in moments of doubt. How does that sound?

User: I love that! Having something positive to say to myself would help, I'm sure.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s come up with a few affirmations you can use. How about something like, “I am capable and learning every step of the way”? 

User: That resonates with me. I want to feel like I’m growing instead of being stuck in my insecurities.

Consultant: That’s a powerful mindset to have! Remember, every effort you make counts towards your growth. As we wrap up, what do you feel is the most important takeaway from our session today?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is that I can plan effectively and seek support from my group. That makes me feel more prepared for what’s ahead.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Xiao Li! You already have a solid foundation to build on. As you move forward, remember to be kind to yourself and acknowledge your progress. 

User: Thank you! I feel more confident now and I'm looking forward to trying out what we discussed!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m so glad you feel this way. Remember, I’m here to support you whenever you need it. Good luck with everything, and I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next time!

User: Thank you again! I can’t wait to update you on how it goes!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoli! It’s great to see you again today. I’m looking forward to hearing how you’ve been feeling since our last session. How has everything been for you?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling much more confident lately, especially after managing my club activities and schoolwork. It really helped me build some friendships too.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made significant strides in building relationships and confidence. Can you share a bit about what specific moments made you feel confident during this time?

User: Well, there was this one time in a group project where I contributed more than I expected. I even spoke up in English, which felt really amazing!

Consultant: That sounds like a huge accomplishment! Speaking up in English must have felt rewarding, especially considering your concerns before. How did that experience impact your feelings about speaking English in other situations?

User: It made me feel like I could do it more often. I still get nervous, but I think I can handle it. I just need a little push sometimes.

Consultant: It’s great to hear you’re feeling more capable. Acknowledging that you might need a push is a fantastic insight. What kinds of situations do you feel you might need that extra encouragement in?

User: In classes, especially when we have discussions, I still hesitate. I find myself worrying about making mistakes or not being understood.

Consultant: That’s quite common. It’s brave of you to recognize those feelings. Let’s explore what thoughts come into your mind when you’re in those situations. What do you find yourself thinking before you speak?

User: I usually think about how my classmates might judge me if I say something wrong. It stops me from speaking up.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re dealing with some pressure from those thoughts. Let’s challenge that for a moment. Is there any evidence that your classmates judge you harshly when you make a mistake? Can you recall any instances where you felt supported instead?

User: Actually, I think they’re usually really understanding. They make mistakes too. I guess I’ve just been hard on myself.

Consultant: It’s eye-opening to realize that your classmates are likely experiencing similar feelings. What would you tell a friend who was feeling the same way you do about their concerns?

User: I would tell them that it’s okay to make mistakes and that we learn from them. I’d encourage them to keep trying.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate response! Now, let's apply that same kindness to yourself in those moments. Next class discussion, what could you say to encourage yourself to speak?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that everyone is learning together. Maybe I could set a small goal to speak at least once each class.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Setting a goal to speak can really help build your confidence over time. As we reflect on your progress, how do you feel about the overall changes you’ve made since we started working together?

User: I feel proud and relieved. My confidence is growing, and I’m starting to feel like I belong here.

Consultant: That’s an incredible achievement, Xiaoli! You’ve worked hard to build that confidence. As we wrap up, what strategies or resources do you think will help you maintain this momentum moving forward?

User: I think continuing to be involved in clubs will help. Also, maybe joining a study group for English could give me more practice and support.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent strategies. Engaging in clubs and study groups can offer not just practice but also connection and support from others. Lastly, how do you feel about facing any potential challenges in the future?

User: I feel more equipped now. I think I can handle challenges better, especially with my new mindset.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! You’ve developed a strong mindset and tools to face challenges. Remember, it’s perfectly okay to reach out for support when needed. As we conclude our sessions, what do you believe has been your biggest takeaway from our work together?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is learning to be kinder to myself and recognizing my progress without dwelling on imperfections.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight, Xiaoli. I’m so proud of the progress you’ve made. You’ve gained valuable skills and self-acceptance, and I believe you’re well-equipped for the future. Remember, if you ever need further support, I’m always here for you. Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate all the help and support. I feel ready for what’s next.
