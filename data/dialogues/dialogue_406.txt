Consultant: Hello, Li Xiao! I'm glad you're here today. I understand that you’ve been feeling quite anxious and overwhelmed lately. Can you share a bit about what’s been going on recently?

User: Hi! Yes, I’ve been feeling really stressed out. My workload has increased significantly, and I’ve been struggling to manage everything. It feels like I’m constantly juggling between work and taking care of my family, and it’s exhausting.

Consultant: That sounds challenging, Li Xiao. Balancing work and family can be really tough, especially with the added pressure of increased workload. Can you tell me more about how these challenges are affecting you emotionally?

User: I often feel anxious and a bit depressed. It’s like I’m in a cycle where I just can’t catch a break. Even small tasks feel overwhelming, and I feel drained most of the time.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel drained when you’re under so much pressure. Let’s explore this a bit deeper. Are there specific situations or thoughts that trigger your feelings of anxiety or overwhelm?

User: Yes, I notice that I often think, “I’m not doing enough” or “I’ll never manage all of this.” These thoughts make me feel even worse and contribute to my stress.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very heavy. It seems like you might be putting a lot of pressure on yourself. When you think, “I’m not doing enough,” how does that make you feel in that moment?

User: It makes me feel really inadequate and hopeless. I start doubting my ability to handle my responsibilities, which only increases my anxiety.

Consultant: It’s tough to carry those feelings of inadequacy. I wonder, if a friend were in your position, what advice would you give them about their thoughts?

User: I would probably tell them that they are trying their best and that it’s okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes. But I struggle to take that own advice for myself.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! It’s often easier to empathize with others than ourselves. Let’s challenge those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you’re not doing enough?

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence. I do manage to complete my tasks, but I just feel like I could be doing more.

Consultant: It’s great that you manage to complete your tasks! Perhaps we can reframe that thought. Instead of “I’m not doing enough,” could we adjust it to something like “I am doing what I can, and that is enough for now”?

User: That sounds more manageable, but it still feels hard to fully accept that.

Consultant: Changing those thoughts takes time, and it’s a process. It’s fantastic that you’re open to trying! What are some small actions you can take to help you feel more adequate amidst your responsibilities?

User: Maybe I could prioritize my tasks better, or set aside some time just for myself to relax.

Consultant: Prioritizing tasks and taking time for yourself sounds like a solid plan! What kinds of activities would you enjoy doing during that relaxation time?

User: I love reading and sometimes just going for a walk. Simple things help me unwind a bit.

Consultant: Those are wonderful choices! Let’s think about how you can incorporate more of those activities into your routine. How about setting a specific time each week to read or take a walk?

User: I could try that! Setting a specific time might help me stick to it more.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! It’s important to carve out time for yourself. In addition to these activities, how can we address your feelings of anxiety when they arise throughout your day?

User: I guess I could remind myself of the progress I have made and try to focus on what I can control instead of worrying about everything at once.

Consultant: Absolutely, focusing on what you can control is empowering. We can also explore some relaxation techniques to help you manage anxiety when it comes up. Would you be open to trying a simple breathing exercise here today?

User: Yes, I would be willing to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath together—inhale through your nose for a count of four… hold it for a count of four… and now exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of four. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt nice to slow down for a moment. I can see how that could help me feel more grounded.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Practicing breathwork can be very beneficial. It’s a simple tool you can use anytime you start to feel anxious. How do you feel about trying to implement this regularly?

User: I think incorporating this into my day could really help. I’ll definitely give it a try.

Consultant: That’s a positive step! As we wrap up today, what are some of the key insights you’re taking away from our conversation that might help you moving forward?

User: I realized that I need to be kinder to myself and remind myself of my accomplishments rather than focusing on shortcomings. Plus, I can create better boundaries with my time. 

Consultant: Those insights are powerful! Remember that it’s a process, and it’s okay to have ups and downs. Keep practicing those coping strategies we discussed, and remind yourself that you’re doing your best. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit lighter after our session today and more hopeful about trying out these new approaches.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li Xiao! It’s been a pleasure talking with you. Remember, you’re not alone in this, and you have tools at your disposal to navigate these challenges. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li Xiao! I'm glad you came in today. How are you feeling about your work and the pressures you've been under lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I still feel quite anxious. The additional teaching tasks from the school leadership have really piled up. I feel like I’m constantly rushing and that there's never enough time to get everything done.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like the pressure from work is really overwhelming right now. Can you share a bit more about how you feel when you’re faced with these additional tasks?

User: I feel a mix of frustration and helplessness. There are moments when I just want to escape from it all because I’m worried I won't meet expectations.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It's understandable to feel frustrated and helpless in such demanding situations. What specific thoughts run through your mind when you think about these expectations?

User: I often think that if I don't meet these expectations, I might let my students down, and I’m scared that my colleagues will judge me too.

Consultant: That’s a lot of pressure you’re putting on yourself. It seems that there's a fear of disappointing both your students and peers. How do those thoughts impact your feelings and behaviors in your work?

User: When I think this way, I become more anxious, and then I start to procrastinate. It's like I freeze up and end up working less effectively.

Consultant: So, this cycle of anxiety leads to procrastination, making you feel even more stressed. Let’s try to identify these thoughts as they occur. Can you recall a specific situation recently where you felt this anxiety build-up?

User: Yes, just a few days ago, I had to prepare lesson plans and felt completely overwhelmed thinking about all the tasks I had yet to do.

Consultant: In that moment, what thoughts went through your mind? What did you tell yourself about not being able to complete these plans?

User: I thought something like, “I will never finish this on time,” which then made me feel like I was failing.

Consultant: It’s a strong thought, indeed. Let’s explore it. How accurate do you think that thought is? Are there other experiences that might suggest you can get your work done in a timely manner?

User: Well, in the past, I managed to complete similar tasks, but I usually relied on last-minute efforts. Maybe I didn’t give myself enough credit for what I can actually accomplish.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! It seems like there’s evidence of your capability hidden beneath that anxiety. What would it look like to trust yourself more in these situations?

User: I guess it would mean planning my time better and believing I can complete tasks without rushing at the last minute.

Consultant: Exactly! Let’s work on some strategies for that. To start, we can look at your tasks and prioritize them. What are the most urgent things you have to tackle this week?

User: There are lesson plans, grading assignments, and also preparing for a parent-teacher meeting. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s prioritize those. Which of these tasks do you feel is the most urgent or must be completed first?

User: I think the lesson plans are the most urgent since the lessons are coming up soon.

Consultant: Good insight. What if we set aside a specific time today to focus solely on those lesson plans? How would that feel for you?

User: That sounds helpful, but I worry I might get distracted.

Consultant: It’s common to worry about distractions. Perhaps we could set a timer for focused work sessions? This way, you can work in short bursts and take breaks to refresh. How does that sound?

User: That could work. I like the idea of having breaks.

Consultant: Excellent! Remember, it’s about giving yourself permission to take those breaks. Now, how about the grading assignments? When can we schedule time for that?

User: Maybe after I complete the lesson plans, I can tackle those tomorrow.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Taking it step by step can really help with reducing that anxiety. Lastly, let’s discuss how you can communicate your workload with your family. What are your thoughts on reaching out to them for support?

User: I haven’t really talked to them about how I feel recently. I think they might not understand how much I'm juggling.

Consultant: Open communication can work wonders. You might be surprised at their understanding. How about planning a time to share your feelings and workload with them? 

User: I think I’ll try that. It might help relieve some of the pressure I put on myself.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! And remember, sharing your experiences can allow them to support you better. As we wrap up today, what insights do you feel you've gained from our session?

User: I realized that I can manage my tasks better and that communicating with my family could really help reduce my stress.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve identified some effective strategies that can lead to significant improvements. I’m proud of you for opening up today, Li Xiao. Remember to give yourself grace as you implement these changes. 

User: Thank you, I appreciate your support. I feel a bit clearer about what I can do moving forward. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep practicing those communication skills and task management strategies. If you find those old feelings creeping back in, don’t hesitate to reach out again. Until next time, take care!

User: Will do! Thank you again for everything.

Consultant: Hello, Li Xiao! I'm glad to see you here today. Before we start, I’d like to check in. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling overwhelmed. The pressure at work has increased, and I also have more responsibilities at home. It just feels like everything is piling up, and it's hard to manage it all.

Consultant: It sounds like you're under a lot of stress right now, trying to juggle multiple responsibilities. Can you tell me more about what's been particularly challenging for you lately?

User: Well, my husband and I have been arguing more often. I think it’s mainly because we don’t communicate well. I feel like I'm not being heard, and that frustrates me. I just want things to be better between us.

Consultant: Communication is crucial in any relationship. It’s understandable to feel frustrated when you feel unheard. What specific situations have led to these arguments recently?

User: Usually, it’s about household tasks or how to handle things with our child. We both have different opinions, and instead of talking them through, we end up raising our voices.

Consultant: That’s tough. It seems like these disagreements escalate instead of resolving. How do you typically feel after these arguments, and what thoughts go through your mind?

User: I often feel guilty and sad afterward. I think, “Why can’t I express myself better?” and “This isn’t how I want our family life to be.” It makes me anxious about having to confront these issues again.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel that way, especially when you value your family life. Let’s explore this a bit further. What do you think holds you back from expressing yourself more effectively during these discussions?

User: I guess I fear that my husband won't understand or that it will lead to an argument again. I worry that my feelings won’t be validated.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It sounds like there is a fear of conflict and misunderstanding that prevents you from speaking up. What would it look like for you to express your feelings in a way that feels safer and more constructive?

User: I think it would help if we could listen to each other without jumping to conclusions or getting defensive. I’d like to share my thoughts calmly without worrying about the outcome.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Establishing a calmer environment is essential. Can we try thinking of some strategies that you can use to facilitate more open communication with your husband?

User: Sure! I think starting with “I feel” statements might help. Instead of blaming, I can express how his actions affect me.

Consultant: Absolutely! “I feel” statements can be very effective. For example, you might say, “I feel overwhelmed when we argue about household duties” instead of accusing him of not helping. How do you feel about trying this strategy in your next conversation with him?

User: I feel hopeful! It sounds like a better approach. But I still worry about how he’ll respond.

Consultant: It's great that you’re feeling hopeful! Remember to keep your expectations realistic. His response may vary, but you’re taking a proactive step. What else can you do to prepare for this conversation so that you feel more confident?

User: Maybe I can practice what I want to say beforehand. I could also try to create a calm environment, like waiting until the evening when things are more relaxed.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Practicing your thoughts ahead of time and choosing the right moment can make a big difference. In addition, how can you remind yourself to stay calm during the conversation?

User: I could take deep breaths or even mention that I want to have a calm discussion at the beginning. That might set the tone for us.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Setting intentions at the start can help create a supportive atmosphere. What do you think you could do if things start to heat up during the conversation?

User: If I feel it’s getting too intense, I could suggest taking a break and revisiting it later when we’re both calmer.

Consultant: Perfect! Taking a break is a healthy way to manage escalating emotions. It’s essential to prioritize emotional safety. Let’s summarize some of the strategies we discussed today.

User: Sure! I’ll use “I feel” statements, practice my message beforehand, choose a calm time to talk, set intentions, and take breaks if needed.

Consultant: That’s right! You’ve come up with a solid plan. It seems like you’re taking significant steps toward improving communication and reducing conflict. How do you feel about these strategies moving forward?

User: I feel more empowered! I believe I can approach my husband more effectively now, and I’m excited to put these strategies into practice.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear, Li Xiao! Your willingness to improve your communication is commendable. Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. Is there anything else on your mind that you want to discuss before we wrap up today?

User: I think that covers most of it. I just want to remember that these changes take time.

Consultant: Absolutely, that’s a wise perspective. Change doesn’t happen overnight, but with practice and patience, it will come. I’m here to support you through this journey. If you find yourself needing more guidance, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support and guidance today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li Xiao. I’m proud of the progress you've made. Remember to practice your strategies, and I look forward to hearing about how they work for you in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li. Welcome to our session today! I’m glad to see you. How have you been feeling lately, especially with the insights you gained from the recent seminar on self-care and stress management?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling better in some ways, but the pressure from work and home still weighs on me. I want to apply what I learned about self-care, but I'm not sure how to start.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling better. It sounds like you're eager to implement those strategies. Can you tell me what specific aspects of self-care you're considering applying in your daily routine?

User: I think I want to try mindfulness exercises, but I feel overwhelmed at the thought of fitting that into my already packed schedule. I fear it might not work for me.

Consultant: That feeling of being overwhelmed is quite common when introducing new practices. What if we break it down into smaller, more manageable steps? How much time do you think you could realistically dedicate to mindfulness each day?

User: Maybe just five or ten minutes. I think I can manage that. But I worry it won’t be enough to make any real difference.

Consultant: Starting with just five to ten minutes is an excellent idea! Even small practices can create a significant impact over time. What kind of mindfulness exercise sounds most appealing to you—breathing exercises, guided meditations, or something else?

User: I think breathing exercises might be a good start. I can do those anywhere, and they seem simple enough.

Consultant: Absolutely! Breathing exercises can be a powerful tool for grounding yourself and reducing stress. Would you like to explore a specific technique together that you could try daily?

User: Yes, I'd appreciate that. I want to feel more in control of my emotions.

Consultant: Let’s try a simple breathing technique. It’s often called “4-7-8 breathing.” You breathe in for four seconds, hold it for seven seconds, and then exhale for eight seconds. It helps to calm the nervous system. Would you like to give this a try now?

User: Sure, I’m willing to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s practice together. Inhale deeply through your nose for four seconds. (Pause) Hold that breath for seven seconds. (Pause) Now exhale slowly through your mouth for eight seconds. (Pause) How did that feel for you?

User: It felt nice, actually. I didn’t realize how tense I was until I did that.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Li! Taking a moment to check in with your body can really help. How do you think you could incorporate this practice into your daily routine to help manage your stress?

User: I could do it first thing in the morning before I start my day. That might set a positive tone for everything.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Starting your day with mindfulness can set you up for success. Besides mindfulness, is there any other self-care strategy you’re interested in exploring?

User: I've thought about setting boundaries at work, but I struggle with saying no to colleagues. I fear it might upset them.

Consultant: Setting boundaries is essential for your well-being, but it can be challenging. What feelings come up for you when you think about saying no to someone?

User: I feel guilty, like I’m letting them down. I want to be helpful, but I often end up overwhelmed.

Consultant: Guilt can be a tough emotion to navigate. Remember, saying no doesn’t make you unhelpful; it protects your well-being. What if you reframed your perspective and considered how setting boundaries might actually help both you and your colleagues?

User: That makes sense. If I take care of myself, I can be more effective and supportive when I do help others.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you’re already grasping the importance of that balance. Could we role-play a scenario where you practice saying no to a request?

User: Yes, that could be really useful.

Consultant: Let’s imagine a colleague asks you to take on an extra project. How would you like to respond?

User: I might say something like, “I appreciate the offer, but I’m currently at capacity and won’t be able to take this on right now.”

Consultant: That’s a strong response! It’s clear and respectful. How does it feel to say that out loud?

User: It feels empowering, actually. I think I can do this!

Consultant: That's the spirit! Empowerment comes from recognizing your limits. Let’s summarize what we discussed today. You have a new mindfulness practice, a plan to set boundaries at work, and a strategy to manage your emotions. How are you feeling about all of this?

User: I feel much more confident! I’m excited to put these practices into action.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Remember, it takes time to adjust and see results. How can you ensure you stay connected to your support network during this process?

User: I suppose I could share my goals with my friends and family, so they can encourage me.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Engaging your support network can keep you motivated. As we wrap up today, is there anything specific you’d like to focus on for our next session?

User: I’d like to discuss how my mindfulness practice is going and any challenges I face with setting boundaries.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can delve deeper into that next time. It’s been wonderful to see your progress today, Li. Keep believing in yourself, and I look forward to our next session. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your guidance. I’m feeling hopeful moving forward.
###################
Consultant: Hello Li Xiao! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit more confident lately, especially after sharing my stress management experiences with friends and getting positive feedback. It feels good to know I'm not alone in this.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear you're feeling more supported. Can you share more about how that feedback affected you or your approach to stress management?

User: Well, it made me realize that my experiences could actually help others. I felt validated, and it encouraged me to lean more on my friendships for support instead of trying to handle everything alone.

Consultant: That's a significant breakthrough! Encouraging connections with friends can really be beneficial. How do you envision utilizing this support more in your daily life going forward?

User: I think I should reach out more often, maybe plan regular meet-ups with friends. Just talking to them feels refreshing, and it helps me keep my stress levels in check.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Regular interactions can definitely help maintain positive feelings. Do you have any specific activities in mind that could help strengthen these friendships?

User: Yes! Maybe we could have a monthly game night or even a book club. Having something regular to look forward to might ease the stress of daily life.

Consultant: Those are great ideas! Engaging in fun activities can help you bond and lift your spirits. Speaking of that, how do you usually feel before or after spending time with your friends?

User: Before meeting up, I sometimes feel a bit anxious or like I should be working instead. But afterward, I always feel lighter and more motivated. It's like a weight is lifted off my shoulders.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that pressure to work, but it's wonderful that the time spent with friends lifts your mood. What do you think prevents you from prioritizing friendship time over work sometimes?

User: I guess I worry that if I take time off, things might pile up, and I won't be able to catch up. It's just hard to find that balance.

Consultant: Balancing work and personal life can indeed be challenging. How might you approach scheduling these social activities while still keeping your work in check?

User: Maybe I could block some time each month in my calendar for these activities, treating them as important as work meetings. It might help me feel more committed to showing up.

Consultant: That's an effective strategy! Treating those meet-ups as appointments can help reinforce their importance. How do you think committing to this schedule will impact your stress levels?

User: I believe it could really make a difference. If I know I've set this time aside, I might feel less guilty about not working during those hours. 

Consultant: Exactly! By prioritizing those moments of connection, you're giving yourself permission to unwind and recharge. Have you noticed any specific stress relief techniques that work well for you during your time with friends?

User: Yes, when we’re together, we often share our day-to-day struggles. Just talking it out feels like a mini therapy session. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic coping mechanism! Sharing struggles can create a sense of relief and help you gain new perspectives. Is there a particular topic or feeling that arises often during these conversations?

User: We often talk about stress from work, especially teaching. It's reassuring to know my friends have similar experiences. It makes me feel less isolated.

Consultant: Feeling connected through shared experiences can really help combat the sense of isolation. How does that realization affect your view of your own challenges in teaching?

User: It makes me feel like my challenges are normal and manageable. I don’t feel as overwhelmed thinking that I'm the only one going through this.

Consultant: That’s an important insight! It seems you’re beginning to recognize that shared experiences can lessen the burden. How might you remind yourself of this connection when you're feeling overwhelmed alone?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal of these conversations. When I feel stressed, I could look back at the supportive moments and remember that I’m not alone.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! A journal could serve as a valuable resource to remind you of your support network. As we move forward, how do you intend to maintain and enhance your social connections while managing your work responsibilities?

User: I think I’ll set those regular catch-ups and maybe also be more proactive in reaching out if I'm feeling overwhelmed. I want to keep that support flowing.

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive approach! Staying engaged with your support network is crucial. Lastly, how do you feel about your ability to maintain these practices long-term? 

User: I feel hopeful. With the plan I have in mind, it seems achievable. I really want to sustain this growth and keep improving my stress management.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful attitude! Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. As we wrap up today, what’s your main takeaway from our discussion?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is that I can legitimize my friendships as a vital part of managing stress. It’s okay to lean on others.

Consultant: Absolutely, Li Xiao. Emphasizing social support is so important, and it will contribute greatly to your emotional resilience. I’m really proud of the steps you’re taking. Until our next session, keep up those connections and feel free to reach out whenever you need support.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help. Looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li Xiao! It's great to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling quite good, actually. The pressure I was experiencing has significantly lessened, and I've been able to enjoy my time with my family more.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're experiencing some relief from the pressures you were feeling. Can we talk about what strategies you've been using to manage your stress lately?

User: Yes, I've been trying to take things one step at a time. I also make sure to spend quality time with my family and take breaks when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Those sound like effective strategies! Taking breaks and spending time with loved ones can really help in managing stress. What specific moments or activities have brought you the most relief recently?

User: I think just sitting down to play with my son in the evenings has been a highlight. It helps me disconnect from work and just enjoy the moment.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful way to unwind. Connecting with your son not only allows you to relax but also strengthens your bond. How do these moments make you feel emotionally?

User: When I’m with him, I feel really happy and at ease. It’s like all my worries just fade away for a while.

Consultant: It’s great that you have found that sense of peace and happiness through your interactions with him. In terms of your work, how has your experience been lately? Have you noticed any changes there?

User: Surprisingly, yes! I’ve been managing my workload better, and I feel less overwhelmed. I think I’m finally finding a rhythm that works for me.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Finding a rhythm can significantly enhance productivity and reduce stress. What do you think contributed to this positive change in your work situation?

User: I started setting clear boundaries for my work hours and prioritizing tasks instead of trying to do everything at once.

Consultant: Setting boundaries is a crucial skill in stress management. It seems like you’ve really applied what we've discussed. How do you feel about maintaining these strategies moving forward?

User: I feel optimistic! I think I can keep it up as long as I stay mindful about it.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset to have. Mindfulness can really help in staying grounded. Have you thought about any specific situations where you might need extra support or reminders to maintain your progress?

User: I guess when work gets particularly busy, I might slip back into old habits. I’d like to have some sort of plan for those times.

Consultant: Creating a contingency plan is a great idea! What strategies could you incorporate into this plan to remind yourself to stick to your boundaries during busy periods?

User: Maybe I could set reminders on my phone to take breaks and check in with myself. Also, possibly keeping a journal to reflect on my day would help.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent strategies! Setting reminders and journaling can encourage self-reflection and prompt you to take the necessary breaks. How do you feel about integrating journaling into your routine?

User: I like the idea! I used to journal more often, and it really helped me. I think I’ll start again. 

Consultant: That’s a positive step forward! Journaling can be a powerful tool for process emotions. As we wrap up today, what would you say has been your biggest takeaway from our sessions?

User: I think realizing the importance of self-care and that it’s okay to set boundaries has been most powerful for me, along with the reminder to enjoy those little moments.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Self-care and boundaries are vital for maintaining your well-being. As you continue this journey, remember to lean on these strategies. Do you feel prepared to move forward with your plans?

User: Yes, absolutely! I feel motivated and ready to apply everything we’ve discussed.

Consultant: That's wonderful! Please keep in mind that I’m here as a support if you need to check in again. You've made significant progress. I wish you all the best in your ongoing journey. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate all your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li Xiao. It’s been a pleasure to work with you, and I wish you continued success. Take care!
