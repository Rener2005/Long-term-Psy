Consultant: Hello, A Hong! It's great to see you again. I know we’ve talked about your experiences with eye contact in our last sessions. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi, I’ve been feeling really anxious again. With the pressure of finishing high school and preparing for the college entrance exams, it feels like I can’t control my anxiety around eye contact. I feel as though everybody is watching me, and I’m just so uncomfortable.

Consultant: I hear you. The pressure of exams can definitely heighten anxiety, especially regarding social interactions like eye contact. Can you share a bit more about what specific thoughts come to your mind when you find yourself in situations requiring eye contact?

User: I keep thinking that if I look someone in the eyes, they'll notice how nervous I am. Sometimes, I even think they might judge me or think I'm weird. It makes me want to avoid looking at anyone altogether.

Consultant: It sounds like you're afraid that others will see your anxiety, which makes you feel even more anxious. It’s understandable to feel this way. Let's explore this idea: What evidence do you have that people actually judge you negatively when you make eye contact?

User: Well, I don’t have solid evidence. It's just a feeling I've developed over time. I guess I've always felt like I don't fit in, and that includes feeling awkward when I have to look someone in the eye.

Consultant: It’s very insightful that you recognize this feeling stems from past experiences rather than specific evidence. Have you ever talked to someone directly, looked them in the eye, and found they reacted positively or that there was no judgment at all?

User: I don’t remember many positive experiences. Mostly, I think I've just avoided those situations. It’s hard to even imagine it being okay to look someone in the eye.

Consultant: Avoidance can feel like a solution in the moment, but it reinforces anxiety in the long run. What if we tried to think about how you can gradually practice eye contact in less pressure-filled situations? How does that sound?

User: That sounds a little scary, but maybe it could help. I just don’t know where to start!

Consultant: Starting small is key. How about we practice eye contact with someone you trust first? This could be a family member or a close friend where you feel safe. What do you think of that idea?

User: I think I could try with my younger brother. He wouldn’t judge me as much, so it might be easier. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! When do you think you could have a conversation with him where you focus on maintaining eye contact?

User: Maybe this weekend when we’re just hanging out together. I’ll try to look him in the eye for at least a few moments while we talk.

Consultant: Great plan! Start with just a few seconds, and see how that feels. It’s a step toward challenging the belief that eye contact is something to be feared. How do you think you’ll feel afterwards?

User: I guess I might feel relieved if it goes well, but I am also worried about feeling awkward or messing it up.

Consultant: That's completely normal. Remember, it’s part of the learning process. If it feels awkward, that’s okay! You’re practicing, and every little bit helps. What might you tell yourself afterwards, regardless of how it goes?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it’s just practice, and every step is progress, even if it feels uncomfortable.

Consultant: Exactly! Remind yourself that discomfort can lead to growth. After you try this with your brother, we can discuss how it went in our next session. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good. I really hope it goes well. It’s just hard to think about it now.

Consultant: I understand. Taking the first step is often the most challenging part. Would you like to reflect on any other thoughts or feelings you're experiencing about this before we end today?

User: I think I just feel overwhelmed by all the pressure of exams on top of everything else. It feels like there's so much to juggle, and I don’t want my anxiety to make things worse.

Consultant: That’s very valid. The pressure of exams can compound your feelings of anxiety. Let’s take a moment to acknowledge that it’s okay to feel overwhelmed. It’s important to take things one step at a time. 

User: I appreciate that. I sometimes forget that it’s okay to feel this way.

Consultant: Yes, and it’s essential to be kind to yourself. You’re facing a lot, and you’re taking proactive steps to address your anxiety. It’s important to honor your progress so far. 

User: Thank you for understanding and for your guidance. It helps to talk about my feelings and to have a plan to work on everything.

Consultant: You're welcome, A Hong! I'm here to support you, and I'm proud of your willingness to confront these challenges. Remember, we can take this journey at your pace. 

User: I will try to remember that. I’ll do my best this weekend and look forward to our next session to share how it went.

Consultant: That’s a great commitment! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experience. Until we meet again, be gentle with yourself and reach out if you need anything. 

User: Thank you so much! See you next time! 

Consultant: See you next time, A Hong! Take care.

Consultant: Hello, Ah Hong! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling worse, to be honest. The pressure of graduating is overwhelming, and my fear of making eye contact with others has gotten much worse.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. The pressure of graduating can be quite intense. Can you tell me a bit more about when you feel this fear of making eye contact?

User: It happens when I'm in class or talking to friends. I start to panic and feel like everyone is judging me. It makes me want to avoid conversations altogether.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, feeling judged and wanting to avoid those interactions. What kinds of thoughts go through your mind right before you feel this panic?

User: I keep thinking they will see how anxious I am and think I'm weird or stupid for not being able to look them in the eye.

Consultant: It sounds like you're facing some very critical thoughts about yourself. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. Do you think there’s evidence that people see you that way? 

User: I don't know... I just feel that way in the moment. It's hard to think rationally.

Consultant: That's understandable. In those moments of panic, it can be difficult to step back and analyze the situation. If a friend were in your position, what do you think you would tell them about those thoughts?

User: I guess I would tell them that people are probably more focused on themselves than judging others. 

Consultant: Exactly! Sometimes, it helps to remember that others are often preoccupied with their own feelings. Would it be helpful if we work on some ways to challenge those critical thoughts together?

User: Yeah, I think that might help. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s start by identifying one specific situation where you felt anxious about eye contact. What happened, and what thoughts went through your mind during that moment?

User: I remember in class last week, when the teacher asked me a question, I froze up and couldn’t look at her. I felt like everyone was staring and waiting for me to mess up.

Consultant: In that moment, what was your biggest concern about looking at your teacher?

User: I was worried she would see how nervous I was and think I didn’t know anything.

Consultant: I see. That sounds really stressful. Let’s think about this together—what might happen if you made eye contact instead? 

User: I guess I would just answer the question like everyone else. But I still believe they will see my anxiety.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have that fear. However, what if making eye contact actually made you feel more confident and engaged in the conversation? 

User: That would be nice, but it feels so far away right now.

Consultant: I get that. Let’s try an exercise. Next time you’re in class or a group, what if you practiced just a little bit of eye contact with someone for a brief moment? How do you feel about starting small?

User: I could try looking at a friend for a second. That seems less scary.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! Remember, starting small can help you build comfort gradually. What do you think you might say to yourself in that moment to help reduce your fear?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it's just a normal thing and they aren't judging me as harshly as I think.

Consultant: That's a brilliant self-reminder! Practice that reality check next time. How would you feel after trying that out with your friend?

User: I think it would help me feel more in control, even if it’s just a little.

Consultant: Yes! Feeling in control is an important step. After trying this, let’s discuss how it went in our next session. How does that sound?

User: Sounds good! I just hope I can remember to do it.

Consultant: It’s a process, and preparing for it can help. Do you think writing down reminders could help you remember to practice?

User: Maybe I could put a note in my notebook or on my phone. 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Having those reminders can support you when anxiety strikes. In addition to this, how are you feeling about your social interactions overall? 

User: They feel really overwhelming right now. I’m not sure how to engage without feeling anxious.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way, especially with the pressure of graduating. We can continue to build your confidence and find ways to ease that anxiety. 

User: I really want that. I want to feel more relaxed talking to people. 

Consultant: We will work towards that together, Ah Hong. Remember, taking small steps and practicing will lead you toward feeling more comfortable. 

User: Thank you for your support. It helps to know that it’s okay to take it slow.

Consultant: Absolutely! Progress takes time, and every step counts. In our next session, we can check in on how the eye contact practice went and build on it. 

User: That sounds great! 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. I believe in your ability to overcome this. Remember to be kind to yourself as you explore these challenges. 

User: Thank you! I’ll try to do that. 

Consultant: You’re welcome, Ah Hong. Keep focusing on your progress, and we’ll see how far you’ve come next time. Looking forward to our next session!

User: Me too! Thank you again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ah Hong! I'm glad you're back for another session. How have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi. I've been struggling a bit. Even though I’ve made some progress, I still find it really hard to make eye contact with others. It feels so uncomfortable, especially during classes and exams. 

Consultant: I see, Ah Hong. It's great that you're aware of your progress, but I understand that eye contact can still be quite challenging for you. Can you share more about when you feel the most anxious about making eye contact?

User: During group projects or when the teacher asks me a question. I get really nervous and worried that everyone will judge me if I look at them.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. Feeling judged can definitely increase anxiety. When you find yourself in those situations, what thoughts run through your mind?

User: I often think, "What if they think I'm weird?" or "What if I mess up and everyone sees?" 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very overwhelming, and it’s understandable they would make you feel anxious. Let’s explore the feelings they create for you. How do those thoughts affect your emotions in those moments?

User: I just feel really panicky and want to avoid looking at anyone. I sometimes even freeze up completely. 

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts lead to a lot of fear and avoidance. Let's identify those automatic thoughts more closely. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that people would think negatively of you?

User: I guess I don’t really have concrete evidence. It's just something I worry about a lot based on past experiences where I felt embarrassed.

Consultant: That’s a very insightful realization, Ah Hong. It’s common for our fears to be based on past experiences rather than current reality. If a friend were in your position, what might you advise them to think about?

User: I would probably say it's okay to make mistakes and that not everyone is paying so much attention to us.

Consultant: That's a wonderful perspective! It shows self-compassion and brings a more balanced view to mind. Let’s practice using that kind of thinking when you're in those situations. How can you apply this to your next class?

User: I could remind myself that it’s normal to make mistakes and that I can take a breath and speak slowly instead of panicking.

Consultant: Yes, that's a great strategy! Taking deep breaths can help calm your nerves. As we move forward, let's consider some situations where you can gradually practice making eye contact. What is a low-pressure situation you could start with?

User: Maybe I could try looking at my friend during a conversation. That feels a bit safer.

Consultant: Starting with a friend is a great idea! It allows you to practice in a less intimidating situation. How do you feel about that plan?

User: I think it's manageable. I feel a bit nervous, but also willing to try.

Consultant: That openness to trying is a positive step forward! Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous. Each little practice can lead to improvements. How about setting a small goal for the week regarding this?

User: I could aim to make eye contact for a few seconds when talking to my friend. 

Consultant: That sounds like an achievable goal! It’ll help you gradually build confidence. As we wrap up today, what do you think has been the most significant takeaway from our session?

User: I realize it’s okay to feel anxious and that I can change my thoughts about it. 

Consultant: Exactly! Acknowledging your feelings while working towards changing how you view those situations is powerful. As you work on these skills, how do you see yourself handling similar situations in the future?

User: I hope to become more comfortable with eye contact and feel less anxious overall.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic vision, Ah Hong! Remember, progress takes time, and you've already made great strides. I look forward to hearing how your practice goes in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and I will try my best. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm here to support you. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Ahong! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been okay, I guess. I still struggle with looking people in the eyes. It makes me feel really anxious, especially in group settings.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re here to talk about this. It sounds like you want to work on your eye contact issues and deal with the anxiety that comes with it. Can you share a bit about a recent experience where you felt this anxiety?

User: Well, just a few days ago, during a group project at school, I found it really hard to look at my classmates while talking. I felt like I was avoiding them, and it made me feel embarrassed.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Ahong. Being in a group and feeling like you can’t connect through eye contact can be very isolating. What thoughts were going through your mind at that moment?

User: I kept thinking that they would judge me for not being able to look them in the eye, and I felt like I was being awkward.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts were quite overwhelming. It’s common to worry about how others perceive us. Do you think those thoughts were realistic or possibly a bit exaggerated?

User: I guess they were exaggerated. No one actually said anything negative, but I assume the worst.

Consultant: That’s an insightful observation, Ahong. Many of us can fall into that trap of assuming negative judgments. What would you say if a friend was in your position feeling that way?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay and that others might not think about it as much as they think. 

Consultant: Exactly! You would provide them with reassurance. Can we explore a few strategies to help you practically improve your eye contact in a safe environment? 

User: Yes, I’d like that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start with a small experiment. How about practicing eye contact with someone you trust, like a friend or family member, in low-pressure situations? How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds manageable. I think I could practice with my little brother.

Consultant: That’s a good idea! It’s a safe and familiar environment. When you practice, pay attention to how you feel during and after making eye contact. What do you think you could say to yourself to stay calm during this practice?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it’s okay to feel nervous and that people understand.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful affirmation! Acknowledging your feelings while also reassuring yourself is a great strategy. Let's aim for you to try this practice and share how it goes in our next session. 

User: Sure, I’ll try that. 

Consultant: Excellent! Also, how do you feel about discussing your experience in the recent mental health seminar and how that has influenced your thoughts about connecting with others?

User: The seminar helped me realize that many people struggle with similar issues. It made me feel less alone and inspired me to try connecting more with others.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization, Ahong! Knowing you're not alone can foster a sense of connection. How can we incorporate this understanding into your practice with eye contact?

User: I guess I could think of other people who might feel the same way during these interactions. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Remembering that others might share your feelings can help ease some pressure. As you practice, try to focus on those shared experiences rather than just your own anxiety. 

User: That makes sense. I’ll give it a try!

Consultant: Fantastic! I believe you’re on the right track. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any other thoughts you have about today’s session?

User: I feel like we covered a lot, and I’m excited to try practicing with my brother.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Ahong! It’s great to see your eagerness to take these steps. Remember, every small effort counts towards your confidence and skills. 

User: Yes, I’ll keep that in mind.

Consultant: Wonderful! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Please remember to be gentle with yourself as you practice. You’re doing really well.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: Thank you, Ahong! I’m here for you. Keep practicing, and I believe you will see improvement in your interactions. See you next time!

User: See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ah Hong! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit more confident, especially in class discussions. But I also notice I'm still struggling with looking people in the eyes. It makes me really uncomfortable.

Consultant: That's great to hear that you're feeling more confident in group discussions! It's understandable that looking someone in the eyes can be difficult. Can you share more about when you feel this discomfort the most?

User: It's particularly tough when teachers ask questions or when I'm talking with classmates. I tend to look away, and I feel embarrassed about it.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing some anxiety in those moments, which is quite common. Let’s explore this further. What thoughts go through your mind when you feel the urge to avoid eye contact?

User: I start thinking that people will judge me for not making eye contact or that they'll think I’m weird.

Consultant: Those thoughts can certainly create a lot of pressure! How do those thoughts make you feel in those moments of interaction?

User: They make me feel anxious and sometimes even make me hesitate to participate in discussions.

Consultant: I understand. It seems like those thoughts are affecting your willingness to engage. Let’s identify if there are any cognitive distortions in your thinking. For example, is there any evidence that supports the belief that others will judge you for not making eye contact?

User: Not really, I guess. Most of my classmates are focused on their own responses.

Consultant: That’s a valuable realization, Ah Hong! It seems like there’s a disconnect between what you think will happen and what’s actually true in the situation. What would happen if you allowed yourself to try making eye contact, even a little, during class discussions?

User: I’m not sure. I feel like it might be really scary, but it could help me feel more connected.

Consultant: That’s a very insightful thought! Facing that fear gradually might actually help alleviate it over time. Can we brainstorm some small, achievable goals for you to practice making eye contact in a comfortable setting?

User: Maybe I could start by trying to make brief eye contact with my friends when we talk? Just for a second and gradually increase it?

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect approach! Starting small allows you to gradually build confidence. How do you feel about setting a specific goal for your next social setting over the week?

User: I could aim to make eye contact with each friend at least once when I talk to them this week. It feels doable.

Consultant: That's a wonderful goal! Reflecting on our previous sessions, what strategies do you already have to help you manage anxiety during these interactions?

User: I can breathe deeply and remind myself that most people are friendly.

Consultant: Excellent! Let's combine those strategies with your new goal. Remember to breathe and reassure yourself while practicing eye contact with your friends. How do you feel about trying this over the next week?

User: I feel motivated to try it! It would be nice to see how it goes.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! As you start practicing, remember to be gentle with yourself. How do you plan to check in on your progress after this week?

User: I think I’ll write down my experiences and see how I felt each time I made eye contact.

Consultant: That’s a great idea, Ah Hong! Journaling is a helpful tool to reflect on your experiences. What do you hope to gain from this practice?

User: I hope it helps me feel less anxious and more connected with my classmates.

Consultant: Those are wonderful aspirations. As we wrap up today, let's recap what we’ve discussed. You plan to practice brief eye contact with friends this week while using deep breathing to manage anxiety, and you’ll reflect on your experiences through journaling. 

User: Yes, that’s right. I want to follow through with that.

Consultant: I believe you can do it! Remember, every small step counts. For our next session, we can review what you observed and explore further strategies to support your growth. How are you feeling about everything we've talked about today?

User: I feel positive about it. I'm looking forward to practicing and sharing what I learn.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Your growth is truly inspiring. If you need any support before our next session, don't hesitate to reach out. I look forward to hearing how things go during our next meeting!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and encouragement.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Ah Hong! Take care and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello Ahong! I'm glad to see you here today. It's great to hear that you've been feeling more positive and confident lately. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling much better. I participated in a school event where I interacted with others and received positive feedback, which was a wonderful experience for me.

Consultant: That sounds fantastic! Engaging in activities and receiving positive feedback can really boost your confidence. How did that experience affect your feelings about social interactions moving forward?

User: It made me feel more capable and encouraged me to try to interact with others more often. But I'm still struggling a bit with making eye contact.

Consultant: I understand that eye contact can be challenging, especially if you've had difficulties with it in the past. Can you share what thoughts come to your mind when you're in a situation where you feel you need to make eye contact?

User: Sometimes I think people will judge me or that I’ll look awkward, which makes me anxious about even trying.

Consultant: It’s natural to have those thoughts. They can create a cycle of anxiety. Let's explore together—do you think there’s any evidence to support those thoughts? How might someone else view that same situation?

User: I guess if my friends were in my position, they might just see me trying my best and not be critical at all. I often am too hard on myself.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Ahong. It sounds like you may have a different perspective if you imagine supporting a friend in the same situation. Would you be willing to practice reframing some of those critical thoughts into something more supportive?

User: Yes, I would like that! Maybe instead of thinking they'll judge me, I can think they might appreciate my effort to connect.

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a wonderful start. Now, let’s consider practical steps. What small action can you take in your daily interactions to gradually practice making eye contact?

User: I could start by practicing with my family or friends in low-pressure situations, focusing on making eye contact during conversations.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Slowly integrating those practices can build your confidence. How do you feel about setting achievable goals around making eye contact during those interactions?

User: I feel good about that. Setting smaller goals feels less overwhelming.

Consultant: Great! Let’s discuss a few goals you could set this week, then we can review them during our next session. How about aiming to make eye contact for a few seconds during the first part of a conversation?

User: That sounds manageable. I think I can do that!

Consultant: I’m really pleased to hear that. As we work together, remember to celebrate each step you take, no matter how small. It's all part of your journey.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your encouragement.

Consultant: You're very welcome. It’s important to acknowledge your growth. So, besides working on eye contact, is there anything else you'd like to focus on during our session today?

User: I think I would just like to feel more confident in my interactions in general, not just the eye contact part.

Consultant: Absolutely, let’s explore strategies to boost your overall confidence in social settings as well. Can you tell me about another recent social interaction where you felt either confident or nervous?

User: Recently, I attended a group study session, and while I felt nervous at first, I surprisingly found it easier to contribute.

Consultant: That’s wonderful progress! It seems like you were able to push through the initial anxiety. What thoughts helped you to eventually feel comfortable contributing?

User: I kept reminding myself that everyone is there to learn and that my opinions matter too.

Consultant: That’s a powerful reminder, Ahong. Focusing on the shared purpose of the situation can really help ease social pressure. Maybe we can develop a list of affirmations you can tell yourself before interacting socially. Does that sound helpful?

User: Yes, that does sound helpful. I think it would keep me grounded.

Consultant: Let’s start crafting those affirmations together. Perhaps something like, "My contributions are valuable," or "I am worthy of being heard." What phrases resonate with you?

User: I like the idea of saying "I trust myself to contribute" before speaking up in groups.

Consultant: That’s an excellent affirmation! It centers your self-trust, which is crucial. Let’s also think about incorporating this affirmation before your daily interactions. How does that sound to you?

User: I can definitely try saying it before each interaction.

Consultant: Wonderful! Practicing this can build your self-confidence over time. Remember, consistency is key. Now, as we begin to wrap up today’s session, what have you found most valuable or insightful?

User: I think recognizing my negative thoughts and replacing them with supportive ones was really enlightening. It makes me feel more equipped to handle social situations.

Consultant: That's a significant realization, and it's great that you feel more equipped! As we conclude, let's summarize the strategies we discussed today—practicing eye contact gradually, using affirmations, and reframing negative thoughts. Do you feel prepared to implement these strategies moving forward?

User: Yes, I do. I feel more confident now!

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that. Remember, you’ve made great progress, and it's okay to keep seeking support when needed. If you encounter challenges, think back to the tools we've discussed. You have the ability to overcome these hurdles.

User: Thank you so much for your guidance today. I really appreciate it.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Ahong! It's been wonderful seeing your growth. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.
