Consultant: Hello, Taotao! I'm glad you're here today. How are you feeling right now? Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about?

User: Hi. I guess I'm feeling a bit irritated. It seems like everyone is against me—teachers, classmates, all of them. I just can't take it anymore.

Consultant: I understand it must be really difficult to feel like everyone's targeting you. Can we explore this a bit more? What happened between you and your classmate recently?

User: Well, Li Ming started it! He said something mean during class, and I just reacted. It feels like they're always picking on me for no reason.

Consultant: It sounds like that was a really frustrating situation. When Li Ming said something mean, what thoughts went through your mind at that moment?

User: I thought, "Why me? They always do this!" I felt like I just had to defend myself.

Consultant: It seems like you felt very attacked and wanted to protect yourself. Do you feel this happens often with your other classmates as well?

User: Yes, pretty much. It's like I have no one on my side. They just don't understand me.

Consultant: Feeling misunderstood and isolated can be really tough. How do you usually respond when you believe they're targeting you?

User: I usually just get angry, and things end up like what happened with the window last time. 

Consultant: It sounds like anger is a reaction you have when you sense unfairness. Is there another way you would like to handle such situations?

User: I don't know. It's hard to even think straight when I'm angry. I just feel like I'm in a corner.

Consultant: I hear you. Let's consider if there might be other responses that could help you feel less cornered, maybe ways to express yourself without things escalating. What do you think?

User: I guess talking could help, but I don't see why they would listen to me.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel doubtful about being heard, especially if you feel isolated. Can we think of a situation where you felt a bit more at ease? What was different then?

User: Well, there were times during group projects when things were okay. People seemed to work together better. 

Consultant: That's interesting. So during group projects, things felt different. What do you think made those interactions better?

User: Maybe 'cause we had a common goal. Everyone wanted to finish the project, so they were less mean, I guess.

Consultant: That's a good insight. Having a shared goal can definitely help people work better together. How might you use that understanding next time you feel targeted?

User: Maybe if I find a way for us to have a common interest, it might change things? I'm not sure.

Consultant: That's a thoughtful approach. Common goals can indeed shift dynamics. Let's think about ways you can create similar situations, where collaboration feels better. How does that sound?

User: Yeah, maybe. I'm not saying it'll be easy, but it's worth a try.

Consultant: It's great that you're open to trying. It might also help to understand what's important to your classmates. Is there anything they seem to care about that you could connect with?

User: They like sports, I think. I play soccer sometimes, but I'm not very close to them.

Consultant: Sports could be a great way to connect. It's a shared interest where teamwork is natural. Do you think joining in more could create some shared moments?

User: It might. I've seen them play often, but I'm usually too upset to join.

Consultant: It makes sense to feel hesitant when you're upset. We can work on ideas to manage those moments when emotions run high. Would you like to explore techniques for staying calm?

User: Sure, I could use some help with that. 

Consultant: One technique is to pause and take a few deep breaths when you feel anger rising. It can give you a moment to decide how you really want to react. Would you like to try that next time?

User: I can give it a shot. It might help me not to react so quickly.

Consultant: Practicing that pause can be powerful. Over time, it might help change how situations unfold. How about we set a small goal for the next week to join one soccer game and also try pausing when you feel upset?

User: That sounds doable. If it doesn't work, at least I tried.

Consultant: Absolutely, giving it a try is already a big step forward. Let's check in on this next time and see how things went. Remember, I'm here to support you through each step. 

User: Thanks, it's good to know I'm not alone in this.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Taotao. You're not alone. We'll work through this together, one step at a time. Let's wrap up for today and continue this journey in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hi Taotao, it's nice to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi. I guess I've been okay, but I still feel that my teachers and classmates are against me. It's really frustrating.

Consultant: I understand those feelings can be very challenging. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened during the incident with Li Ming and the fallout afterward?

User: Well, Li Ming said something that really annoyed me, and I just snapped. I know I shouldn't have broken the window, but it just happened, and now everyone's treating me like I'm the bad guy.

Consultant: It sounds like you felt provoked and reacted in the moment. Let's explore that a bit—what were some of the thoughts going through your head right before you reacted?

User: I just kept thinking that Li Ming was doing it on purpose and that nobody would stand up for me. I felt like I was on my own, so I had to defend myself.

Consultant: Those thoughts must have been really intense. How did they make you feel at that moment?

User: I felt angry, really angry and alone. Like everyone was out to get me.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel anger in such situations, but it's important to see what might have fueled that emotion. Do you think there's a possibility that your thoughts were more extreme or not entirely realistic?

User: Maybe... I guess I did jump to the conclusion that everyone was against me without really thinking it through.

Consultant: That's a great observation. Let's think about some alternative explanations. Is there a chance that Li Ming or your classmates weren't trying to upset you intentionally?

User: I suppose it's possible. Maybe he wasn't thinking about how I'd react or was trying to be funny.

Consultant: Exactly, sometimes people act without realizing the impact it has on others. What do you think a different, less drastic response could have been in that situation?

User: I could've just walked away or told a teacher instead of reacting immediately.

Consultant: Those are excellent alternatives. It's about giving yourself a moment to think and choosing a different path. Let's try a small exercise—imagine if a friend was in a similar position, what advice would you give them?

User: I'd tell them to breathe and think before acting, and to talk to someone about how they feel instead of lashing out.

Consultant: That's a wonderful and mature approach. With practice, it can also be how you handle situations. How do you feel about trying to apply this when you feel overwhelmed next time?

User: It sounds doable. I think it might help if I remind myself to pause and consider other options.

Consultant: That's a strong plan. Pausing can give you the space to choose a response that aligns with how you want to interact with others. Is there an upcoming situation where you think you could practice this?

User: Yes, we have a group project next week, and I'm worried about working with others. I could try it then.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity. Let's also explore some calming techniques you could use if things get heated—like deep breathing or stepping outside for fresh air. What do you think might work for you?

User: I’ve tried deep breathing before, and it kind of helps. So does listening to music when I feel tense.

Consultant: Those are great strategies. Combining them with your new approach to evaluating situations might really help calm your emotions. How are you feeling about all this now?

User: I feel a bit more prepared. It's good to have something to try instead of just reacting.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that, Taotao. You're showing an eagerness to find new ways to handle challenges, which is a significant step forward. Do you feel more confident in understanding different perspectives within conflicts?

User: Yeah, I think I can see how jumping to conclusions isn't helpful and focusing more on understanding what happens.

Consultant: That’s great progress. Keep in mind, everyone sometimes makes mistakes in interpreting things, but being open to considering other perspectives is key. What are some things you could practice to reinforce these insights?

User: I’ll try to remind myself to pause and ask what else could be true in situations. And maybe calm down by listening to music when I start to get upset.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies. Remember, developing these skills takes time, so be patient with yourself. How will you track your practice and progress over the coming week?

User: I could write down what happens in my notebook whenever I handle things well, and check if I could’ve done anything differently.

Consultant: That's an excellent plan. Reflecting on what works can really solidify your progress. Is there anything else you'd like to explore today before we end our session?

User: Not right now. I think I have a lot to work on and think about.

Consultant: Great. Remember, you have the tools to handle these situations differently. If you need more guidance, I'm here for you. Looking forward to hearing about your successes next time.

User: Thanks, I appreciate that. I'll see you next week.

Consultant: Take care, Taotao. Keep up the good work, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hi Taotao, I’m glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been a bit better, I guess. I've been trying to understand how my classmates feel, and I'm talking to my teachers more calmly. But I still feel like people misunderstand me sometimes.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're making an effort to understand others and that you're able to communicate calmly with your teachers. Can you tell me about a specific moment when you felt misunderstood recently?

User: Well, even though I'm trying not to get angry, there are days when other kids say things that really annoy me. Like last week, a classmate said something mean, and I felt the anger building up again.

Consultant: That sounds challenging. Feeling misunderstood can be frustrating, especially when you're trying hard to improve. Did you manage to address the situation without getting angry?

User: I tried to walk away and calm myself down. It worked for a while, but later I kept thinking about it and felt bad for not standing up for myself.

Consultant: Walking away to calm down is a positive step. It's okay to want to stand up for yourself, but it's important to find a way to do it constructively. Let's work on that together. How about we role-play a scenario where you encounter a similar situation?

User: Sure, I guess that could help.

Consultant: Alright, let’s imagine a classmate says something hurtful. First, try to identify what they mean without jumping to conclusions. What do you think you could say to them?

User: Maybe I could ask them why they said that...like, "Why do you think that about me?" I could try to keep my voice steady.

Consultant: That's a good start. Asking questions can help you understand their intentions better. Now, let’s continue this scenario. If their response still seems mean, how could you express how you feel without getting angry?

User: I could say, “I feel hurt when you say things like that.” I think it’s better than shouting back.

Consultant: Exactly, expressing how you feel can let them know the impact of their words. This might also make them think twice next time. How do you feel about practicing this approach in real life?

User: A bit nervous, honestly. But I think I can try. It sounds better than getting into more trouble.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel nervous about trying something new. The important thing is that you're willing to practice and grow. Remember, every step you take towards communicating better helps build your confidence.

User: Thanks. It's just that sometimes I worry I'll mess up and react badly again.

Consultant: It's okay to have those worries, Taotao. Mistakes are part of learning. If you feel like you're losing control, you can always pause and take a few deep breaths before responding. What do you think about that strategy?

User: I like it. Breathing helps calm me down, just like we talked about last time.

Consultant: Fantastic. Breathing is a simple but effective way to manage stress. Would you like to practice it with me now to reinforce the habit?

User: Okay, let's do that.

Consultant: Alright, let's take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then slowly exhale through your mouth. Let's try it together.

User: *breathes deeply* I feel a bit more relaxed.

Consultant: That's the idea. Remember, you can use this exercise any time you feel stress building up. Over time, it can become a natural response for you.

User: I'll try to remember that. I really want to handle things better.

Consultant: You're showing real commitment, and that's important. We'll keep working on these skills together. Are there any other scenarios you'd like to role-play or discuss today?

User: Maybe how to respond if someone accuses me of something I didn’t do?

Consultant: That's a great idea. Let's explore how you could handle that. First, it's important to stay calm. What could you say to clarify the situation?

User: I could say, “I didn’t do that, but I would like to talk about it to clear things up.”

Consultant: That’s a clear and calm response. It shows you're willing to discuss the matter without being defensive. How do you feel about practicing this approach more?

User: It feels helpful. I think I can try it out next time.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. Remember, handling conflicts constructively will improve your relationships with classmates and boost your confidence. How do you feel about the progress you've made so far?

User: I feel like I can do better and not always react violently. I want to keep working on it.

Consultant: You're making wonderful progress, and it's great that you're committed to continuing your improvement. Let’s set small goals for you to achieve before our next session. What do you think?

User: I could try using these techniques at least once a day and see how it goes.

Consultant: That's an excellent goal. Practicing regularly will help make these responses more natural for you. I’m confident you'll do well. How about we meet again next week to discuss how things went?

User: Sounds good. I’ll let you know if I have trouble.

Consultant: I'm always here to support you, Taotao. Keep up the good work, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care!

User: Thanks. Bye!
###################
Consultant: Hi Taotao, welcome back! It's great to see you here. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been doing okay, I guess. I tried to talk with some classmates and we played a few games, which made things a bit less tense. It felt good, but I'm still worried I might lose control if something goes wrong.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you've taken the step to communicate and play with your friends. It’s a big step forward. Can you tell me more about what happens when you feel like you might lose control?

User: Sometimes, when someone says something that upsets me, my first reaction is to get really angry. I know it doesn't help, but it's hard to stop myself in the moment.

Consultant: I understand. It’s common to feel that way, especially when something triggers strong emotions. Let’s explore some strategies to help manage those feelings. What do you think usually triggers these reactions for you?

User: It’s usually when someone makes fun of me or when I feel like I’m being treated unfairly. It makes me feel small and I just want to lash out.

Consultant: These feelings sound intense and difficult to navigate. Let’s think about some of the positive steps you've taken recently. How did initiating conversation and playing games with your classmates make you feel?

User: It made me feel a bit more in control, like I can actually get along with others when I try. But I still have this fear that I could mess it up.

Consultant: Acknowledging that you can get along is a big positive. Fear of making mistakes is natural, but it seems like you have the capability to handle situations better now. Have you noticed any specific changes in how the other students respond to you when you're calm?

User: Yeah, when I'm calmer, they seem to be nicer. It's like they’re more willing to talk or play games with me. But I don't always know how to keep that going.

Consultant: That's great observation. It shows that your behavior impacts theirs positively. Let’s build on this successfully. If a similar situation were to arise again, what’s a small step you could take to maintain this calmness?

User: Maybe I could try taking a deep breath before reacting. Or remember the times when being calm actually worked.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent strategies. Taking a pause to breathe can interrupt the instant reaction, and reflecting on past success can reinforce your self-control. Would you like to practice any specific scenario to be better prepared?

User: Yeah, I think I’d like to practice what to do if someone teases me again. It happens often enough.

Consultant: Alright, let’s run through a scenario. Let’s say someone starts teasing you about your glasses. How do you think you could respond to keep the situation from escalating?

User: I think I could just ignore them or say something like, "That's not cool," and then walk away.

Consultant: That's a constructive response. By ignoring or calling out the behavior calmly, you're showing you're in control. How confident do you feel about trying this approach next time?

User: I feel a bit more confident now. I think I can handle it better next time.

Consultant: That’s the spirit. This approach not only helps you stay calm but also teaches others how they should treat you. How does it feel to role-play these situations and discuss them?

User: It feels good, like I’m actually preparing myself. But I still hope I don't have to deal with it too often.

Consultant: Preparing for possibilities builds confidence and resilience. It’s okay to wish not to deal with conflict, but knowing you can handle it if it arises is empowering. What about other areas? Are there other skills you'd like to improve on?

User: I’d like to be better at making friends. I sometimes feel awkward about starting conversations.

Consultant: Making friends can seem tricky, but you're already taking steps by being open and engaging in activities. Would you like to discuss some ways to make those initial interactions more comfortable?

User: Yes, that would be nice. I always run out of things to talk about.

Consultant: Sure! You could start by asking simple questions about their interests, like, "What’s your favorite game?" or mention something you both have in common. How does that sound?

User: It sounds like a good idea. I think I can do that.

Consultant: Wonderful! Building conversations around common interests can be a great way to connect. What do you think might be your next step in practicing these skills this week?

User: I’ll try talking to someone new in class. Maybe during lunch or after school.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal. Each new interaction is a step forward. Remember, it’s okay to take things at your own pace. How do you think this plan fits with what you've learned and applied recently?

User: I think it fits well. Talking about this is helping me feel more confident to actually try it.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that. Confidence is key, and practicing these skills will continue to build it. How are you feeling about maintaining the progress you’ve made and applying these new approaches?

User: I’m feeling more hopeful. I think I can do it with more practice.

Consultant: That’s great to hear, Taotao. Consistent practice and reflection on your experiences will strengthen these skills. Before we wrap up for today, is there anything else you would like to focus on?

User: Not right now, I feel like we've covered a lot. Thank you for helping me understand how to handle things better.

Consultant: You’re doing really well, Taotao. Keep applying what we’ve discussed, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need further guidance. Remember, each small step is significant. Looking forward to your progress. Take care until we meet again!

User: Thank you! I’ll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hi Taotao! It's great to see you again. How have things been going since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing pretty well. I managed to get praised by the teacher for my work in group activities, which made me feel really good.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It seems like your efforts are starting to pay off. How did it feel to receive praise from your teacher?

User: It felt amazing! I was really happy knowing that my hard work was noticed. It's like I'm finally fitting in with others in the class.

Consultant: It sounds like you're gaining more confidence and finding a sense of belonging with your classmates. Do you think these positive experiences are helping you manage your emotions better than before?

User: Yes, definitely. I am trying to stay calm and not lose my temper easily. I feel like I'm learning to manage my frustration better.

Consultant: That’s a significant step forward, Taotao. Emotions can be tricky, but it seems like you're starting to get the hang of it. What strategies have you been using to keep yourself calm during stressful situations?

User: I've been trying to stop and take a deep breath before reacting. It helps me think before I act, like when I feel upset in a game or activity.

Consultant: That's a great technique! Taking a pause to breathe gives you the opportunity to respond more thoughtfully rather than reacting impulsively. Have you noticed any particular situations where it's easier or harder to control your emotions?

User: It’s easier when I’m in activities I enjoy or with friends, but harder when I feel like someone is being unfair to me.

Consultant: It’s understandable that fairness is important to you. It can be frustrating when things seem unfair. How do you typically handle those situations when they come up?

User: I used to get really angry and argue, but now I try to talk it out or ask for help from a teacher if needed.

Consultant: That’s a very mature approach, Taotao. Asking for help is a good way to handle difficult circumstances. How does it feel to express your feelings and seek solutions with others?

User: It feels better because I don't have to deal with everything by myself, and it shows others that I'm trying to change.

Consultant: You’re doing a fantastic job acknowledging your feelings and reaching out for support. Building this kind of social support network is key to maintaining long-term positive behaviors. Have you been able to make any new friends in your class?

User: Yeah, a few classmates have started talking to me more, and I've joined more group activities. It makes me feel more connected.

Consultant: That's excellent progress! Being involved in group activities can strengthen friendships and help you feel more integrated with your peers. How do you plan to keep up this positive momentum?

User: I want to keep participating and not get into any more fights. I'm going to focus on being a good teammate and friend.

Consultant: Aiming to be a supportive teammate and friend is a great goal. Positive interactions are a powerful way to build lasting bonds. Is there anything specific you think we should focus on to help you continue on this path?

User: I think learning more about managing my emotions when I'm upset would help. That way, I won't slip back into old habits.

Consultant: Great insight, Taotao. We can definitely work more on emotional management techniques tailored to those situations. Would role-playing certain scenarios be helpful to practice responses?

User: That sounds fun! I think acting out the situations might help me see how I can handle them differently.

Consultant: Perfect! We'll do some role-play exercises next time to reinforce your emotional regulation skills. Before we finish today, let's summarize what’s been working well for you. 

User: I've been able to breathe and think before reacting, talk out my feelings, and get support from teachers and friends.

Consultant: Excellent summary! You've developed some strong strategies. Moving forward, practicing these skills will help solidify them. What do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our sessions so far?

User: I've learned that I can control my reactions and that it's okay to get help when I need it.

Consultant: Absolutely, Taotao. You've made incredible progress, and I’m proud of your commitment to change. Remember, if challenges arise, you have the tools and a supportive network to handle them. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?

User: No, I think we’ve covered everything I wanted to talk about. Thanks for all your help!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Taotao. It's been a pleasure working with you. Keep up the great effort, and remember, you can reach out anytime you need support. Take care, and see you next time!
