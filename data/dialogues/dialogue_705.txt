Consultant: Hello, Yang! It's great to see you today. I understand you've been feeling anxious and overwhelmed lately. Can you tell me a bit more about how you've been feeling, especially with the upcoming exams?

User: Hi. Yes, I feel a lot of pressure because of the exams. It's like I can't focus at all, and I've been turning to video games as a way to escape. I know I shouldn't be doing it, but it just feels easier.

Consultant: It sounds like the pressure from the exams is leading you to seek comfort in video games, even though you realize it might not be the best choice. Let's explore this a bit more—what thoughts come to mind when you play video games during this stressful time?

User: When I play games, I feel a temporary relief from the stress. But then I end up playing for too long and feeling guilty afterward. It just feels like a cycle I can’t get out of.

Consultant: I see. So, playing games helps you momentarily forget about your stress, but it also leads to feelings of guilt and frustration afterward. Can you share what emotions you're experiencing when you realize you've spent too much time gaming?

User: I feel really disappointed in myself. It's like I know I should be studying, but I keep getting sucked into the games. I feel stuck and helpless.

Consultant: That must be really challenging for you, feeling stuck and helpless. Let's take a moment to identify some of the negative thoughts you might be having about yourself when this happens. What runs through your mind in these moments?

User: I think things like, "I'm a failure," or "I'll never improve." It makes me feel even worse because I know my parents would be disappointed too.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy and tough to deal with. It's understandable that they contribute to your anxiety and frustration. What if we try to challenge those thoughts? For example, how much evidence do you think supports the idea that you’re a failure? 

User: I guess I don’t really have concrete evidence. I study sometimes, but it feels like no matter how hard I try, I can’t keep up with my classmates.

Consultant: That’s an insightful observation, Yang. It sounds like you're setting some very high expectations for yourself. If a friend were in your situation, struggling with feelings of failure, what advice would you give them?

User: I guess I would tell them that it's okay to ask for help and that they’re not alone in this. 

Consultant: That’s a kind and supportive thought. You deserve that same kindness. How might you apply this advice to yourself? What steps could you take to seek support or change your routine?

User: Maybe I should talk to my parents about how I feel, or at least try to reduce my gaming time and plan my study sessions better. 

Consultant: Those sound like productive steps! Talking to your parents might help them understand your struggles better, and planning your study sessions could give you a clearer focus. What would a balanced plan look like to you, including gaming and studying?

User: I could set specific times for gaming after I finish studying for a certain period. Maybe I could make a schedule to keep track of both.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! A schedule could help you manage your time more effectively and ensure that you still enjoy gaming without overindulging. How do you feel about implementing this kind of structure into your daily routine?

User: I think it sounds like a good plan. I might need to remind myself to stick to it since I can get easily distracted.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. Perhaps you could set small reminders or use an app to keep you on track. Additionally, if you find yourself feeling overwhelmed again, remember to check in with those thoughts of disappointment—are they truly accurate?

User: Right, I can try to catch those thoughts before they spiral. It’s just difficult to remember in the moment.

Consultant: Absolutely, it takes practice. With time, you’ll learn to recognize those patterns more easily. Would you be open to tracking your feelings and gaming sessions over the next week? We can review together next time.

User: Yes, I think that could really help. I want to be more aware of how gaming affects my mood.

Consultant: That sounds like a productive step! Let’s aim to gather some data on that for our next session. In the meantime, try to balance your schedule and be gentle with yourself as you adjust. How do you feel about our conversation today?

User: I feel a little better, actually. It’s nice to talk about this instead of just keeping it to myself.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It's important to express what you're feeling. Remember, these feelings don’t define you, and it’s okay to seek help. We can work together to navigate through this. Is there anything else you’d like to explore before we wrap up today?

User: I think I’ve said what I needed to for now. I appreciate your help!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Yang! I'm here for you, and I look forward to seeing how your strategies develop in our next session. Remember to take care of yourself during this busy time!

Consultant: Hello, Yang! I'm glad you're here today. I want to talk about how you've been feeling lately, especially regarding your concerns about gaming and family dynamics. What's on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious, especially after hearing my parents argue on the phone again. It just makes me feel like everything is unstable. Plus, I keep trying to reduce the time I spend gaming, but I fail over and over. It's really frustrating.

Consultant: I can see how that would be overwhelming. It sounds like you feel trapped between your gaming habits and the stress at home. Let's start by exploring what that anxiety feels like for you. What specific thoughts or emotions come up when you think about your gaming time and your family situation?

User: I think about how gaming is the only thing that relaxes me, but then I remember that I should be studying or talking to my parents. It feels like I'm letting them down, and it adds to my anxiety.

Consultant: That sense of letting your family down seems quite heavy. It’s understandable to seek comfort in gaming, but balancing that with your responsibilities sounds tough. What do you believe would help you manage your gaming time better?

User: I wish I could just control myself. I know I should limit my gaming, but when I start playing, it’s hard to stop, and then I feel worse about everything afterwards.

Consultant: It sounds like you're caught in a cycle where gaming offers temporary relief but ultimately increases your anxiety. What if we explored some alternatives to help you manage your gaming time? What would that look like for you?

User: Maybe I could set a timer or something, but I’m afraid I might not stick to it. 

Consultant: Setting a timer is a great first step! It can help create structure. Let’s challenge that fear about not sticking to it. What evidence do you have that you couldn’t stick to a timer? 

User: Well, I've just never been good at following plans. I always end up ignoring them, and then I feel guilty.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable given your past experiences. But let’s think about the possibility that this time could be different. If a friend were in your shoes and struggling with following plans, what advice would you give them?

User: I would probably tell them to take it one step at a time and not be too hard on themselves.

Consultant: That’s a wise approach! Taking it step by step is key. How about we create a simple plan together? For instance, we could set a specific time limit on gaming, say one hour, and then engage in another activity after. How does that sound to you?

User: That might work, but what if I want to keep playing?

Consultant: It’s okay to feel that way! Let’s incorporate an incentive to make it easier to switch to another activity. After your gaming, what can you do that you would look forward to? 

User: Maybe I could read a book or go outside for a bit. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Reading or spending time outside can be refreshing. How about this: if you follow your timer and then switch to one of those activities, you’ll reward yourself for sticking to the plan. This could help you feel more in control.

User: Yeah, that makes sense. But I still worry about my parents arguing. It makes everything harder.

Consultant: Family dynamics can be quite challenging, especially when there’s tension. Have you had a chance to express your feelings to your parents about the impact their arguments have on you?

User: No, I haven’t. I don’t want to upset them more. 

Consultant: That’s understandable. It can be tough to bring those feelings up. What if we think about how you might communicate your feelings gently? Maybe sharing that their arguments make you feel anxious could help them understand your perspective.

User: I guess I could try, but I’m not sure what to say.

Consultant: How about starting with something like, "I feel anxious when I overhear arguments, and it makes it hard for me to focus on my studies"? This way, you are expressing your feelings without placing blame. How does that sound?

User: That could work, I just hope they don’t get defensive.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It might help to remind them that you’re sharing this because you care about the family as a whole. Often, expressing vulnerability opens the door for better communication. Are you willing to try this approach?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. 

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Tackling these things together can build better understanding. Let’s summarize what we've discussed today: You’ll work on managing your gaming time with a timer and take breaks with enjoyable activities, and you’ll try to express your feelings respectfully to your parents. 

User: Sounds good! 

Consultant: Fantastic, Yang! As you reflect on this plan, you might have moments of frustration, but remember to be gentle with yourself. You’re incorporating positive changes. How are you feeling about this now?

User: I feel a bit hopeful, but also nervous.

Consultant: That’s completely normal! It's a big step you're taking. We can always revisit this and adjust as needed. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. Is there anything else on your mind before we wrap up?

User: I think that covers everything for now. Thanks for your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of you for taking these steps. We’ll continue to build on this. If you need support, don’t hesitate to reach out. Looking forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Yang! I'm glad to see you today. Last time we talked about your feelings of frustration and your desire to improve your self-management skills. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi. I've been reflecting a lot, but it's still tough. I keep thinking about how little progress I've made, and it feels really discouraging.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel discouraged, especially after reflecting on your progress. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts come to mind when you think about your progress?

User: I just feel like no matter how hard I try, I end up getting distracted by games. I want to focus on my studies, but I keep slipping back.

Consultant: I see that you're facing a real struggle with distractions. When you think about your studies versus gaming, what emotions do you notice?

User: I feel anxious and overwhelmed. It's like there's this pressure to succeed, but I can't seem to get myself motivated.

Consultant: That pressure can be really heavy. Exploring those feelings can help us understand what's going on deeper. Do you think there's any underlying belief driving that anxiety?

User: I think I feel like I should be perfect or do better than others. When I don't, I get really frustrated.

Consultant: That's an important insight. It sounds like you might be putting a lot of pressure on yourself to achieve a certain standard. What if we tried to identify some of those thoughts and challenge them? 

User: Sure, that sounds okay. I guess I often think that if I don't do as well as others, I'm failing.

Consultant: Let's try to reframe that thought. What evidence do you have that not doing as well as others means you're failing? Could there be other interpretations?

User: Well, I guess I could be focusing more on my own progress instead of comparing myself to others.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on your personal growth can be much healthier. What might that look like in your daily routine?

User: Maybe I could set smaller, achievable goals for my studies instead of worrying about being the best.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Setting smaller, realistic goals can help you feel a sense of accomplishment. Would you like to try setting a specific goal for your study sessions next week?

User: Yes, I’d like to try that. Maybe I could aim to study for an hour each evening instead of just playing games.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. How about we create a daily schedule together that balances study time and relaxing time with games? 

User: That could help! I think having a plan would make it easier for me to stick to studying.

Consultant: Alright, let's brainstorm some ideas! What times are you usually free to study, and how long can you realistically focus?

User: I usually have some time after dinner, around 7 PM, and I can probably focus for about an hour.

Consultant: Perfect! So we could schedule study time from 7 PM to 8 PM. What about before that? Is there a short block of time you could use to ease into studying?

User: Yeah, I could try to study for 30 minutes before dinner, too.

Consultant: Excellent! That gives you two time blocks for studying. Now, let's talk about how to make studying more engaging. What subjects do you find most interesting or easier to focus on?

User: I like math. It's easier for me to study because I can see immediate results when I solve problems.

Consultant: That's fantastic! You could use those math problems as a way to build confidence. What might happen if you start your study sessions with something you enjoy, like math?

User: I think that would make it easier to keep going. If I start off well, I might feel more motivated.

Consultant: Exactly! Starting with a subject you enjoy can create momentum for your studies. How do you feel about scheduling your math study first?

User: That feels good! I like the idea of getting some quick wins at the beginning.

Consultant: Great! We could set up your first 30 minutes for math right before dinner, and then after dinner, you switch to another subject. How does that sound?

User: That sounds doable. I can stick to it if I've planned it out.

Consultant: I believe you can do this! Incorporating breaks and rewards after your study sessions could further motivate you. What would you like to do as a reward?

User: I usually like to relax and play games afterward, so that could work.

Consultant: That sounds like a good way to balance work and play. After each study session, a short gaming break could help you recharge. Remember, it’s also okay to adjust the plan as you go along. 

User: Yes, flexibility sounds important. I’ll try this out and see how it goes!

Consultant: Wonderful! Before we wrap up today, what is the main takeaway you have from our session?

User: I think I learned that focusing on my own progress rather than comparing myself to others will help me feel less pressure, and setting smaller goals will make studying feel less overwhelming.

Consultant: That's a valuable takeaway, Yang! I’m excited for you to implement your new strategies. Remember to be kind to yourself as you work through this. How do you feel about our next steps?

User: I feel more positive about it now. I’m looking forward to trying these new strategies out.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Keep track of your feelings and experiences as you try these methods, and we can discuss them in our next session. You've made a lot of progress today!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I feel more hopeful now.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Yang! I'm excited for you and your journey ahead. Remember, I'm here to support you anytime you need. Take care until next time!

Consultant: Hello, Yang! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially after trying to communicate openly with your father?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. That conversation with my dad made me realize that communication is possible. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like it was a positive experience for you. What aspects of that conversation stood out the most for you?

User: I felt more understood than I expected. We talked about my school and my gaming habits. I think he is starting to see where I'm coming from.

Consultant: It's encouraging to hear that your dad is starting to understand your perspective. How did that make you feel in terms of your communication with him?

User: I felt relieved and a little more confident. I realized I can express my feelings without fearing a negative reaction.

Consultant: That's a significant breakthrough, Yang! Building confidence in your communication is essential. Moving forward, are there other people in your life where you'd like to apply what you've learned?

User: I think I need to talk to my mom about my studies and gaming habits too. She's often strict with me, and I find it hard to talk to her.

Consultant: That’s a good insight. Communicating with your mom could help improve your relationship. What are some thoughts or feelings that come up when you think about having a conversation with her?

User: I'm nervous. I worry she might not understand me the same way my dad did. What if she just gets angry?

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous, especially when past experiences have been challenging. Can you think of what you might want to communicate to her that could help her understand your point of view?

User: I want to tell her that gaming isn't just a way to escape; it's something I enjoy. But I know I should find a balance.

Consultant: Balancing your interests is important. What if you start by sharing your appreciation for gaming and then express your desire to manage your time better?

User: That sounds like a good approach. I could show her that I'm trying to be responsible about it and that I want to succeed in school too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Framing it that way makes it clear that you care about both your interests and your responsibilities. Would you like to practice what you might say to her?

User: Yes, I'd like that! I’m not sure how to start though.

Consultant: Let’s role-play. You can start the conversation, and I'll be your mom. Just express your feelings as we discussed. Ready?

User: Okay... um, mom, can we talk for a minute? I wanted to share how I've been feeling about school and my gaming.

Consultant: Sure, Yang! I’m listening. What’s on your mind?

User: Well, I enjoy gaming a lot, and it helps me relax. But I also know I need to focus on my studies. I want to find a way to do both.

Consultant: I see. But how do you plan to manage your time between gaming and studying?

User: I was thinking I could set specific times for both. Like, after I finish my homework, I can play for a little while, maybe an hour or two. And if I have a big exam, I can limit my gaming more.

Consultant: That sounds like a reasonable plan. It shows you are taking responsibility. How do you think your mom would respond to this proposal?

User: I hope she would appreciate my honesty and willingness to find balance. It might make her a bit less strict if she knows I'm trying.

Consultant: That's a realistic approach. It demonstrates maturity. Do you feel more confident to talk to her now after practicing this?

User: Yes, a lot more! I feel like I have a plan, and I can handle whatever her response is.

Consultant: Fantastic! Now, what about in school? Is there something you want to change in your communication there as well?

User: I think I need to talk to my teachers more about my struggles in class. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed, and I just stay quiet.

Consultant: Opening up to your teachers can definitely help. What might you say to them if you approached them about your struggles?

User: I guess I could say something like, "I’m having a tough time keeping up with the material. Could you give me some tips or extra help?"

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! It shows you are proactive and willing to seek help. Are you ready to talk to your teachers with this plan in mind?

User: I think I am! It doesn't feel as scary now that I've thought it through.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! These communication skills you're developing will really benefit you. Before we end today's session, is there anything else on your mind that you’d like to discuss?

User: Not really, I feel like we covered a lot! I'm excited to put this into practice.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Remember, it’s a process, and the more you practice, the more comfortable you’ll become. Let’s summarize what we’ve achieved today: you’ve identified ways to communicate with your mom and teachers effectively.

User: Yes, I feel more equipped now!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Before we conclude, how will you maintain these new skills and strategies going forward?

User: I’ll remind myself to be open and honest when I feel something isn't right and to practice that balance in my daily routine.

Consultant: Perfect! I believe in your ability to manage these challenges. If you ever need support again, don’t hesitate to come back. You’re making great progress. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I feel much better about everything now.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Yang! I look forward to hearing how it goes in your next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hello Yang! It’s great to see you here today. I’m excited to talk about your recent efforts to get involved in school activities. How have you been feeling about that?

User: Hi. I’ve actually signed up for a basketball club at school! I think it’s a step in the right direction, but I still feel a bit nervous about it.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Joining the basketball club is a brave step towards diversifying your activities. It's normal to feel nervous. What specific feelings come up for you when you think about participating in the club?

User: I guess I worry about not being good enough or embarrassing myself in front of others. I think they might judge me because I haven’t played much before.

Consultant: Those feelings of worry about judgment are quite common, especially in new situations. Let’s take a moment to consider these thoughts. When you think that others might judge you, what emotions does that bring up for you?

User: It makes me feel anxious and a bit discouraged. Sometimes, it makes me just want to avoid it altogether and stick to gaming instead.

Consultant: I can understand how that anxiety could lead you to want to retreat into familiar habits like gaming. However, it's great you're aware of this. What would it look like if you approached the basketball practice with an open mind, free from that judgment?

User: I suppose I want to think of it as just a chance to have fun and be active, not about being perfect at it. But it’s hard to shift my mindset.

Consultant: Absolutely, shifting that mindset can be challenging. Let’s explore how you can remind yourself of the fun aspect. What are some positive reasons you could focus on that would encourage you to enjoy basketball, regardless of your performance?

User: Well, I think playing would help me stay fit, and I could meet new friends while doing it too.

Consultant: Those are wonderful reasons! Staying fit and making friends are both significant benefits. Could you try writing these down as reminders for yourself before practice? It might help reinforce that positive mindset.

User: That sounds like a good idea! I’ll definitely try that. 

Consultant: Great! Along with that, how have you been reflecting on your experiences after each practice? Anything surprising or enjoyable you’ve noticed?

User: After the first practice, I noticed I felt really energized. Even if I messed up a couple of shots, I still enjoyed the time spent with others.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! Focusing on the energy and enjoyment rather than just the performance is a big step forward. How can you keep that focus on the enjoyment in your future practices?

User: I think I’ll remind myself that it’s about having fun and just being part of the team, rather than only worrying about improving my skills.

Consultant: That’s an excellent perspective to maintain! Before we wrap up today, what emotions do you feel about continuing with the basketball club moving forward?

User: I feel a bit more confident. I think I can handle it. I’m excited, and I want to keep challenging myself.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Embracing excitement and challenge is vital. Let’s set a goal for you to enjoy each practice, reflect on your experiences positively, and share your thoughts with me in our next session. How does that sound?

User: Sounds very doable! I can’t wait to share the next week’s experience. 

Consultant: Perfect! I believe you’re on a wonderful path. Remember, it’s about the journey and not just the end goal. I look forward to hearing about your progress and reflections next time. Keep up the great work, Yang!

Consultant: Hello Yang! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially with the recent positive feedback from your teacher?

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty good, actually! I was surprised by the positive feedback—I didn’t expect it at all. It made me feel like I can do better in my studies.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It seems like that acknowledgment has really boosted your confidence. How do you feel about maintaining that positive momentum in your studies moving forward?

User: I want to keep that feeling, but sometimes it’s hard to stay focused. I still get distracted by video games or other things.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way, especially with how engaging games can be. Let’s talk about what strategies you might consider to balance your time between games and studying. What have you tried so far?

User: I’ve tried setting timers to study, but I often ignore them when I get into a game.

Consultant: That’s a common challenge. It can be tough to step away from something enjoyable. How about setting a specific study goal for each session before playing a game? This way, you can feel accomplished before your leisure time.

User: That might help. If I tell myself I need to finish a chapter before I play, that could be a good motivator.

Consultant: It sounds like a solid plan! By setting that goal, you create a clearer boundary for both study time and playtime. How do you think that would affect your overall mindset toward studying?

User: I think it would help me see studying as something I can complete and enjoy rather than just a chore. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about transforming the perception of studying into something rewarding. Do you have any particular subjects or areas where you feel you need more support or motivation?

User: Math has always been difficult for me. I think I struggle with it because it feels overwhelming.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Math can be challenging. What if we break down your math study sessions into smaller, manageable pieces? This way, each small success can contribute to your overall confidence.

User: That sounds good. Maybe if I could focus on just one concept at a time, it wouldn't feel so scary.

Consultant: Yes! Focusing on one concept at a time can really reduce that feeling of being overwhelmed. After mastering one concept, celebrating that achievement can help reinforce your progress. What might that celebration look like for you?

User: Maybe I could reward myself with some gaming time or even a small treat after each lesson.

Consultant: That’s a great motivational strategy! Mixing pleasure with your studies can make the entire process more enjoyable. Now, as we discuss these strategies, how do you feel about your self-discipline to stick to these plans?

User: I feel a bit more positive about it. Having clear targets makes it seem less daunting. I think I can manage that.

Consultant: I love to hear that! Building on that positivity, how do you envision keeping yourself accountable to these goals?

User: I could keep a journal or a planner, writing down what I need to do each day. It would be satisfying to check things off.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! A planner can be a tangible reminder of your goals and progress. Plus, it can help you see how far you've come. What feelings come up for you when you think about organizing your tasks in that way?

User: It feels reassuring. Knowing that I have a plan helps reduce the anxiety I usually feel about schoolwork.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Reducing anxiety through planning is such an empowering step. As we move forward, if you're ever feeling overwhelmed again, remember these strategies and how they’ve worked for you. How do you feel about our session today? 

User: I feel really good. I think I have some solid plans to work with, and I’m looking forward to trying them out.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any concerns you have for the future?

User: No, I think everything is clear for now. I just want to keep this positive energy going!

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping that positive energy is key. Remember to reflect on your wins and treat yourself kindly as you move forward. I’m confident you’ll continue to build on your successes. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need further support. Take care, and I can't wait to hear about your progress in our next session!
