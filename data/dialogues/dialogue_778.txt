Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you could join me today. I’d like to start by checking in on how you’ve been feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I guess I’ve been okay, but it’s really hard to concentrate on anything. All I think about is playing games. I participated in a school game competition recently, and now I just want to keep playing and ignore everything else.

Consultant: It sounds like that competition has really captured your attention and it's making it tough for you to focus on other important things, like schoolwork. Can you tell me more about how this affects your daily life?

User: Well, my grades have dropped a lot. I’ve been getting calls home from my teachers, and I'm tired of hearing my mom nag at me. It just makes me want to play more to escape all that pressure.

Consultant: I hear you. It seems like the pressure from school and home is overwhelming, and playing games feels like a way to escape that. How do you feel when your mom talks to you about your grades?

User: I feel angry, like she doesn’t understand me. She’s always comparing me to other kids, and it makes me just want to shut down and play games instead.

Consultant: That sounds really frustrating. It’s understandable to feel defensive when you think someone doesn’t see your perspective. When you think about that situation, what kind of thoughts go through your mind?

User: I just think she doesn't care about what I want. She only wants me to do well in school and be like the other kids. It feels so unfair.

Consultant: I can see how that feels hurtful. You want your feelings to be understood too. Have you had a chance to share these feelings with your mom?

User: Not really. I just get into arguments with her. I don’t know if she would understand anyway.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a lot of tension between you two. What do you think would happen if you tried to explain how you feel to her, even just a little bit?

User: I don’t think it would change anything. She’d probably just get mad and tell me that I need to focus on school more.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel that way. It must be tough to feel like your thoughts wouldn't be welcomed. Let’s pause for a moment. Can we explore the idea that she might actually be concerned about you? How does that change your perspective, if at all?

User: I guess she does care, but it feels like she only cares about grades. I just don’t know how to make her see my side.

Consultant: That’s completely valid. You want to feel like your feelings are valid too. If you could express one thing to her that would help, what would that be?

User: I want her to see that I’m not just a lazy kid. I just need some time to enjoy games, and it doesn’t mean I don’t care about school.

Consultant: That’s a significant feeling to express – wanting to be understood as someone who needs balance and time for enjoyment. How do you think you could start that conversation with her?

User: I could try maybe telling her that I feel overwhelmed and just need some time for myself. But I feel worried she’ll just brush it off.

Consultant: It shows strength that you’re considering that. Perhaps starting from a place of sharing your feelings, like saying you feel overwhelmed, could open up a different kind of conversation. How do you think you would feel after sharing that?

User: I’d probably feel a bit relieved, but also scared. What if she doesn’t listen?

Consultant: Feeling relieved yet anxious is completely normal. Sometimes taking that step, even though it feels scary, can help in feeling more connected. What if we think together about how you can approach it, step by step?

User: I guess if I prepare myself for the conversation, it might help. But I’m still worried.

Consultant: That’s a good point. Preparation can ease some of that anxiety. Let’s talk through a possible outline of what you might say. You could start with how you're feeling, then express how much you value both school and your time for gaming. How does that sound to you?

User: Yeah, that could work. I can say it’s important for me to do well in school and still enjoy some time gaming.

Consultant: Great! That’s a positive approach. Sometimes, showing that both are important to you can help others see your perspective more clearly. How do you feel about possibly trying this in the next few days?

User: I think I’ll give it a shot... but I’m still feeling unsure about whether I’ll really say it.

Consultant: That uncertainty is completely understandable. What if we set a little goal for you? Just to visualize saying a small part of what you feel – like starting with “I feel overwhelmed”? 

User: Okay, I think I could start with that. It seems easier than going all out.

Consultant: That’s a great step forward! Just that simple start can pave the way for a more open conversation. Remember, taking it slow is perfectly okay. What else do you think might help you feel better as you approach this situation?

User: Maybe if I plan some gaming time as a reward for talking to her, I’ll feel more motivated to do it.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive incentive! Associating reward with a challenging task can make it more doable. How are you feeling about our discussion today?

User: I’m feeling a little better actually. It’s nice to talk it out instead of just keeping it in.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Remember, you’re taking steps towards understanding and expressing your feelings. Next time we meet, we can check in on how the conversation with your mom went, and see if there’s anything else we can work on together.

User: That would be good. Thanks for listening.

Consultant: Of course! I'm always here to listen. You’ve done well today, and I look forward to our next session.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. How are you feeling? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling really misunderstood lately. People just don’t get what I’m going through. It’s like I can’t do anything right, and I feel like everyone is always judging me.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure and frustration from the people around you. Can you tell me more about what's been bothering you recently?

User: Well, at school, I had an argument with a classmate, and then the teacher scolded me. I felt it was totally unfair. I didn’t even do anything wrong, but they made me seem like the bad guy.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. Being in a situation where you feel unfairly treated can be very frustrating. What were some of the thoughts that went through your mind when the teacher scolded you?

User: I just kept thinking, "Why is this happening to me?" And I felt like everyone was looking at me like I was some kind of troublemaker.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem to make the situation even more overwhelming for you. How did that make you feel emotionally in that moment?

User: I felt really angry and hurt. It made me want to just hide or quit trying. I feel like I can never catch a break.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel angry and hurt in such situations. It seems like a lot is building up inside you. Have you noticed any patterns in these types of situations where you feel judged or criticized?

User: Yeah, it feels like it happens a lot. I remember when my parents separated, I felt like it was my fault. Now everything just makes me feel like a loser.

Consultant: It’s painful to carry that feeling of fault and blame, especially at such a young age. Sometimes, our minds can trick us into thinking things are our fault when they're not. How do you think those past experiences affect the way you react now?

User: I guess I often think that if I mess up, everyone is going to think I'm bad. It makes me want to just give up.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization. It sounds like you're worried about people's judgments based on your past experiences. If you could change how you view these situations, what would it look like?

User: I’d like to just feel calm and confident, like it’s okay to make mistakes. But I don’t know how to do that.

Consultant: That's a great goal. We can work towards that. What if we tried to challenge some of those negative thoughts when they come up? For example, when you feel that everyone is judging you, we could ask, "Is there evidence of that being true?" 

User: I don’t know. It feels like it is true in the moment.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. But let’s think about it together. If a friend were in your situation, how might you help them see things differently?

User: I guess I would tell them to not worry too much and that everyone makes mistakes.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s often easier to be compassionate towards others than to ourselves. How can we start applying that same kindness to your own experiences?

User: I guess I need to remind myself that I’m not perfect, and that’s okay.

Consultant: That's a great thought! Let's practice that. Next time you feel judged, try saying to yourself, "It's okay to make mistakes, and I'm allowed to learn from them." How does that sound?

User: It sounds a bit helpful, actually. Maybe I can try that.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! We can also look at some specific situations where you felt judged or criticized, like the one at school, and log your feelings and thoughts around them. Would you be willing to give that a try?

User: Yeah, I can do that. It might help me see it differently.

Consultant: Great! By tracking those moments, we can identify patterns in your thoughts and feelings. It can empower you to see things from a new perspective. What's something specific you’d like to focus on next? 

User: Maybe that argument at school? I still feel upset about it.

Consultant: That sounds like a good place to start. Let’s break it down together. What detail stands out the most to you from that incident?

User: The part when the teacher really got mad at me. I felt like I was the only one being scolded.

Consultant: That must have felt isolating. It can be hard to hear strong criticism, especially in front of others. Did you have any thoughts at that moment that made you feel worse about it?

User: I thought that maybe I was a bad student. Like, why can’t I just get things right?

Consultant: It's important to recognize that single moments don’t define you as a student. Let’s challenge that idea. Can we find evidence that proves you’re not a bad student?

User: Well, sometimes I do get good grades, and I work hard on my homework.

Consultant: Exactly! You have evidence of your success. It’s alright to have setbacks, and they don’t take away from all the hard work and accomplishments you have. 

User: I see what you mean. I just need to remember that it’s not the end of the world when something goes wrong.

Consultant: That's a very positive shift in mindset. As we continue these sessions, I encourage you to keep building on this understanding. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds good. I want to feel better about myself.

Consultant: And you’re taking the right steps toward that. For our next session, let’s try focusing on logging your thoughts and feelings. Remember, you’re doing well, and it’s okay to express your emotions. 

User: Thanks! I feel a bit better just talking about it.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. You're making progress by exploring your feelings. I look forward to our next conversation and continuing to work on this together. 

User: Me too. I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Absolutely, take care, and see you soon!

Consultant: Hello there! I’m glad you could come in today. I’d like to know how you’ve been feeling recently, especially about your family gatherings?

User: Hi. Well, I really don’t want to talk about family gatherings. I just feel so tired of them. I just end up arguing with my mom all the time. I feel like nobody understands me.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling exhausted and frustrated with everything happening at home, especially during gatherings. Can you tell me a bit more about what specifically bothers you during those times?

User: I just don’t see the point in them. It’s like they’re forced fun, and nobody gets along. My mom keeps pushing me to participate, and it makes me angry.

Consultant: I can see why that would be frustrating for you. It feels like there's an expectation to enjoy something that you find unappealing. What kind of things usually happen during these gatherings that make you feel this way?

User: People try to make small talk, and it just feels so fake. Then my mom gets upset when I don’t respond. It just escalates into a fight.

Consultant: It seems like the pressure to interact is making you feel even more isolated and misunderstood. When you find yourself in those situations, what kind of thoughts go through your mind?

User: I think things like "Why am I even here?” or “They just don’t get it.” I just feel alone in a crowd.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy and isolating. It’s understandable to feel that way when you’re in a situation you don’t enjoy. If you were to break those thoughts down, do you think they accurately reflect the reality of the situation?

User: Maybe not. I guess I just get caught up in my feelings and don’t really look at what’s happening.

Consultant: That’s an important insight! Sometimes, our emotions can take charge and cloud our judgement. Let’s explore this together—what would be a more balanced thought in that moment during a gathering?

User: Maybe something like, “It’s okay to be here, and not everyone has to understand me.” 

Consultant: That’s a great alternative thought! It allows you to acknowledge your feelings while also creating space for the experience. How do you think adopting this new thought might change how you feel during family gatherings?

User: I think it could help me feel less pressured. If I don't expect everyone to get me, it might be a little easier.

Consultant: Exactly! Reducing that pressure can often lead to a more comfortable experience. Can you think of some small steps you might take during the next gathering to practice this new mindset?

User: Maybe I could find something to focus on, like a game, instead of just trying to talk to everyone. And I could remind myself it's just for a little while.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Focusing on a specific activity can give you a sense of purpose and potentially lessen your anxiety. How do you feel about trying this next time?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful about it. I’ll definitely give it a try.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It's all about small changes. On another note, how about discussing your relationship with your mom? You mentioned arguing—what usually triggers those conflicts?

User: It’s usually when she tries to force me to do things. Like, she wants me to talk to my dad more, and I just don’t want to. I feel like she doesn’t understand.

Consultant: That’s a tough situation. It’s important that your feelings are respected. How does that make you feel when she pushes you to do something you’re not comfortable with?

User: It makes me feel powerless and frustrated. Like, I don’t have any say in my own life.

Consultant: Feeling powerless can be really tough, especially when it’s about something so personal. Have you had a chance to express to her how this makes you feel?

User: I’ve tried, but it usually ends up in an argument. She just doesn’t see it my way.

Consultant: It sounds like communication is a challenge there. Would it help to approach the conversation with a little more structure next time, maybe using “I” statements to express how you feel?

User: What do you mean by “I” statements?

Consultant: “I” statements are a way of expressing your feelings without blaming the other person. For example, saying “I feel frustrated when…” instead of “You always make me mad when…”. This can help the other person understand your perspective better.

User: That makes sense. I can try that.

Consultant: Excellent! Practicing this could open the door to better communication. Let’s talk about maintaining this progress. What strategies do you think you can use to keep this mindset going?

User: I could write down my feelings when I'm upset, or maybe talk to you about it more often. 

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies! Journaling can help you process your emotions, and talking about your feelings with me can provide support. How do you feel about keeping that consistency?

User: I think I can manage that. It’ll help me get through the tough moments.

Consultant: Absolutely! It's all about progress, not perfection. Lastly, as we wrap up, let’s reflect on what you’ve learned today. What do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I think it’s learning to understand my feelings better and communicate them. It feels good to talk about it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’ve made some insightful steps today, and I believe you can apply these strategies moving forward. Remember, if you ever need help again, I’m here for you. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you next time!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate it.

Consultant: Hello, I'm glad to see you today! It sounds like you've had some exciting changes recently. How are you feeling about the new agreement with your mother regarding your gaming time?

User: Hi. I guess I feel a little excited about it. I really want to try volunteering, but I’m still not sure if my mom will fully support me in this.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you’re hopeful about volunteering, but there's some uncertainty about your mother's support. Can you tell me more about what you hope to gain from participating in volunteer activities?

User: I think volunteering would help me meet new people and maybe do something meaningful. But I'm afraid I won’t have enough time for my games.

Consultant: That makes sense. You want to create connections and find meaning through volunteering, while also being concerned about your gaming time. What if we explored how volunteering could fit into your schedule, alongside your gaming?

User: Yeah, I think that could work. Maybe if I limit my gaming to the weekends, I could still volunteer during the week.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! It shows that you're considering a balance between both activities. How do you feel about setting this schedule?

User: It feels okay, but I still worry about missing out on my favorite games when I could be playing after school.

Consultant: It's normal to feel that way when trying to shift routines. What if we think about some rewards for prioritizing your volunteering? This might help motivate you to stick to your schedule without feeling like you’re missing out on gaming.

User: Rewards could be cool. Like maybe I can treat myself to some extra gaming time on the weekend if I volunteer during the week.

Consultant: Absolutely! Having that incentive might help reinforce your commitment to both volunteering and your gaming. How would you feel about tracking your volunteering experiences and the moments you felt good about them?

User: I think keeping a record could help me see my progress. Sometimes I forget how good it feels to do something nice for others.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! Documenting your thoughts and feelings about volunteer work can help remind you of the positive impacts. Along the way, we can celebrate those moments. What kind of reflections do you think you'd like to jot down?

User: Maybe I could note down the people I meet and how it felt to help them. Like, if I made someone smile or felt good about my contribution.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Noting those positive interactions can be very uplifting. As you engage in your volunteer work, you'll likely start to notice the good feelings associated with helping others—let's make sure to focus on that.

User: That makes sense. I guess seeing those smiles would make me happy too.

Consultant: Exactly! And think about how having those experiences can improve your overall mood. Can we also talk a little about how you'll encourage yourself on those days when you feel tempted to just play games instead of volunteering?

User: Mmm, I could remind myself of the good things I felt in the past when I helped others. Maybe I could write little notes to myself as reminders.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Writing those notes can create a supportive environment for yourself. What kind of phrases do you think would be helpful to include in those reminders?

User: I might write things like, "Your time spent helping others is valuable," or "You can always return to your games later."

Consultant: Those phrases are very encouraging and affirm your contributions to the community. Would you feel comfortable sharing one of those reminders with your mom? It might help her understand your motivation as well.

User: Yeah, I could show her the notes. She might like to see what I'm working on outside of gaming.

Consultant: That’s a great step! Sharing your thoughts can help strengthen your support system. Over time, this can lead to more open conversations with your mom. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the plan we created together?

User: I feel more excited now! It helps to know I have ways to balance everything and that I can share it with my mom.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’re taking meaningful steps towards your goals. Keep practicing this openness with your emotions and experiences. Remember, if you encounter challenges, I’m here to support you! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’ll definitely try to keep my notes and share them with my mom.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe you'll do great. I look forward to hearing about your journey next time we meet. Take care!

User: Bye! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Zheng! I'm glad to see you again. It seems like we made some progress in our last session. How are you feeling today?

User: Hi! I'm feeling a bit better, actually. I made a new friend during the volunteer activity, and that really made me happy.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Making new friends can be very uplifting. Can you tell me more about this new friendship and what you enjoyed about that experience?

User: Well, we just clicked. We share similar interests, and we had a lot of fun working together. I didn’t feel as nervous around him.

Consultant: It sounds like you felt comfortable and connected with him. That's a great sign of your growing social skills. How does this positive interaction make you feel about your relationships with others?

User: It makes me feel hopeful, I guess. But sometimes I still struggle with talking to people I don't know well.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel that way. Building new relationships can be challenging. Can you identify specific situations where you feel nervous or find it hard to communicate?

User: When I meet new people or when I have to speak in front of a group, I feel really anxious. It's like I worry they won't like me.

Consultant: I understand that can be tough. Those feelings of worry can be quite overwhelming. Let’s explore those thoughts together. What do you think would happen if you were to talk to someone new?

User: I guess I'm just afraid they might think I'm weird or that I won't know what to say.

Consultant: It sounds like you're worried about being judged. Let’s think about this—do you have evidence that people find you weird, or is it more of a fear you have?

User: That's true. I don’t really have any proof, it’s just my thoughts telling me that.

Consultant: Exactly, sometimes our thoughts can create misconceptions. What if you could challenge that worry? What alternative thoughts could you have instead?

User: Maybe I could think that they might be just as nervous, and we could help each other feel comfortable.

Consultant: That’s a positive alternative! You could even consider that most people appreciate someone who is friendly. Knowing this, how do you feel about approaching someone new next time?

User: It feels a bit less scary when I think about it that way. I could just try to smile and say hi.

Consultant: Excellent! Smiling and saying hi is a great first step. Let’s practice a scenario. Imagine you're meeting someone new at school—what would you say to start a conversation?

User: I could say, “Hi, I’m Zheng. What do you think of this class?” That sounds easier.

Consultant: That’s perfect, Zheng! Asking about something you both share can create a natural conversation. How does practicing this make you feel?

User: It makes me feel a bit more confident. I think I could actually try it.

Consultant: Fantastic! Confidence comes from practice. Now, let's switch gears a little—when you think about your family, how do you feel about communicating with your parents lately?

User: I haven’t talked much with my dad since we moved back with my mom. I feel awkward about it.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Communication can sometimes feel challenging, especially after things have changed. What thoughts do you have when you think about talking to him?

User: I feel like he might be upset or that he won't want to listen to me.

Consultant: Those worries are common, but remember, communication is a two-way street. What if you approached him with something positive, like sharing your recent experience with your new friend? 

User: That could work! He would probably want to hear about my day.

Consultant: Exactly! Sharing positive experiences can open up more communication. How about planning a time to talk to him about it?

User: I think I could try to talk to him tonight when we have dinner. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Take your time and choose your words. How are you feeling about this new approach?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited. It’s nice to have a plan.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! A balance of nerves and excitement is normal. Remember, both talking to friends and family is a skill you can develop. Reflecting on our session today, what’s the biggest takeaway for you?

User: I think it’s that I can challenge my negative thoughts and be more open with my family. 

Consultant: Exactly! By challenging those negative thoughts and practicing communication, you're on your way to becoming more confident. Keep practicing, and we’ll discuss how things go in our next session.

User: Yeah, I’m looking forward to it! Thanks for your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zheng! Take care, and I’ll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zheng! It's great to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a lot better actually. I've been trying to communicate more with my parents, especially my mom. It's been nice.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful, Zheng! It's great to hear that you're working on communication with your mom. Can you share more about what's been different in your interactions?

User: Well, we've had some good talks lately. I've also mentioned that I want us to do more activities together, like playing games or going out. I think it could help us bond more.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Engaging in activities together can definitely strengthen your relationship. How has your mom responded to your suggestion of doing more family activities?

User: She's been positive about it! She seems to be really open to the idea. We actually played a board game last weekend, and it was fun.

Consultant: I'm really happy to hear that! Fun activities can create positive memories and help reduce any tension. How did you feel during the game night?

User: I felt really happy! It was nice to just relax and enjoy our time together. I didn't even think about the issues we used to have.

Consultant: That’s incredible, Zheng. It seems like you are creating a more positive atmosphere at home. What do you think has contributed to this change in your feelings toward them?

User: I think talking it out helped a lot. I don’t feel as angry or upset anymore. I understand why some things happened in the past, and I can let go a bit.

Consultant: That’s a significant breakthrough! Understanding and letting go can be quite powerful. Are there still any challenges you're facing when it comes to communicating or spending time with your parents?

User: Sometimes I still feel awkward about bringing up certain topics. I don’t want to upset either of them, especially given our past.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. What if you took small steps? Maybe you could start with lighter topics before discussing more serious issues. How does that sound to you?

User: Yeah, that sounds manageable. I guess I could try just asking about their day or something like that first.

Consultant: Absolutely! Starting small can make it easier to build up to deeper conversations. What do you think would help you feel more confident in those interactions?

User: Maybe practicing what I want to say beforehand? I sometimes get nervous and forget what I want to ask.

Consultant: Practicing is a great strategy! You could even write down a few questions or topics you’re comfortable discussing. That way, you have something to refer to when you're feeling uncertain.

User: I like that idea! I could use a notebook for it. It might help me keep track of what I want to talk about.

Consultant: Excellent! Keeping a notebook could also help you reflect on how your conversations go over time. Speaking of reflections, what accomplishments are you most proud of since we started our sessions?

User: I think just being able to talk to both of my parents without getting frustrated is a huge step for me. I didn’t think I could do it.

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement, Zheng! Recognizing your progress is important. How has that made you feel about your ability to manage other aspects of your life?

User: I feel more in control, even with my game time. I don’t rush to play as soon as I get home. I can balance it better.

Consultant: That's a fantastic improvement! Balance is key. It sounds like you're developing more healthy habits. What would you like to focus on moving forward to maintain this momentum?

User: I want to continue to improve my communication with my parents and maybe explore some new hobbies. I think that could help me feel even better.

Consultant: Those are wonderful goals! Exploring new hobbies can also be a great way to create additional bonds with your parents. What hobbies are you interested in trying?

User: I've been thinking about trying sports, like basketball. It sounds like fun, and I could even invite them to watch.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Getting active can be enjoyable, and having your parents involved could make it even more special. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel excited about it! I think it would be fun, and it gives us a chance to cheer each other on.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Excitement is a great feeling to have about new activities. Before we wrap up today, let’s summarize your progress and goals. What do you think are the key takeaways from our session today?

User: I’ve improved my communication, spent quality time with my mom, and I want to keep working on these relationships while exploring new activities.

Consultant: Exactly, Zheng! You’ve recognized your achievements and laid out clear goals for yourself. Remember, it’s all about taking small steps and being kind to yourself along the way. 

User: Thank you! This really helps me feel more positive about everything.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You've made fantastic strides, and I'm confident that you can continue to grow. Whenever you need support, don’t hesitate to reach out. This is our last session for now, but remember, you have the tools you've learned to manage your emotions and relationships.

User: Thanks for everything! I appreciate all the guidance you’ve given me.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zheng! It’s been an honor to support you. Best of luck with everything—go out there and enjoy those new activities!
