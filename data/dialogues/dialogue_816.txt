Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. I know things have been tough lately for you. Can you share more about how you've been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi. I still feel quite down, especially after my exam results. My parents reacted by punishing me instead of comforting me, which made everything worse. I just feel lost.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional load. You mentioned feeling lost. Can you tell me more about what that feels like for you?

User: I just feel like I'm not good enough. I compare myself to others, and it feels like everyone else is doing better than me. It makes me anxious about the future.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It’s common to feel anxious when we compare ourselves to others, especially during challenging times. What thoughts go through your mind when you feel this way?

User: I keep thinking that I'm a failure and that I’ll never succeed. It's like a loop I can’t escape from.

Consultant: A loop of negative thoughts can be quite exhausting. It’s important to recognize these thought patterns. Can you identify any specific moments when these thoughts become particularly strong?

User: It happens a lot when I see my friends doing well or when I think about my parents' expectations. I just feel that I disappoint them.

Consultant: That sounds really painful. Disappointment from ourselves or others can be really heavy. What would you say if a friend shared similar feelings about feeling like a failure?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has their struggles and that they shouldn't be too hard on themselves. But I don’t seem to apply the same advice to myself.

Consultant: That's a valuable perspective! It’s often easier to be kind and understanding to others than to ourselves. What do you think prevents you from applying that same kindness to yourself?

User: I think it’s because I feel like I need to prove myself to everyone, especially my parents. I feel guilty about not living up to their expectations.

Consultant: It’s tough to feel that pressure. Let’s explore that guilt a bit. What thoughts do you have that make you feel like you need to prove yourself?

User: I guess I think they will be disappointed or ashamed of me if I don't succeed. It’s like I’m not meeting their standards.

Consultant: Those feelings of pressure can be overwhelming. Let’s challenge that thought a bit. What evidence do you have that your parents would feel that way if you don’t succeed?

User: I remember them saying last time that they couldn’t believe I let them down. But maybe they just don’t know how I feel.

Consultant: It’s possible that they are unaware of your feelings. Would it help to share your experiences and emotions with them, so they can understand where you’re coming from?

User: I don't know. What if they don't understand and get angry again? 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It can be scary to open up. Would it feel more manageable to start by writing down your feelings or practicing what you might say, just in case?

User: Writing it down does sound a bit easier. That way, I can organize my thoughts before talking to them.

Consultant: That’s a step in the right direction! Writing can help clarify your feelings and make the conversation less intimidating. How do you feel about that suggestion?

User: I think I could try that. It feels less pressure-filled somehow.

Consultant: Wonderful! Besides that, let’s focus on what you enjoy doing. Have you engaged in any activities lately that bring you joy?

User: Not really. I’ve been too focused on my worries. I used to love drawing, but I haven't been motivated to do it lately.

Consultant: Getting back to something you love, like drawing, could be a great way to relieve some of that pressure. How about setting aside a little time each week to draw again? 

User: That sounds nice. I do miss it. It might help me relax and get my mind off things.

Consultant: Absolutely! Setting aside time for yourself is important. You deserve to do things that bring you joy. As we continue, let’s work on building some confidence in your abilities to communicate with others. How does that sound to you?

User: I would really like that. I feel really awkward talking to classmates.

Consultant: That’s perfectly normal. Let’s think about some small steps to ease that discomfort. Have you had any recent experiences where interacting felt a little easier, even if just a tiny bit?

User: I guess I’ve chatted a bit with a classmate during a group project, but it was hard.

Consultant: That’s a great start! It’s a positive sign. Perhaps you can aim to initiate a little more small talk during group activities. What do you think about that idea?

User: I'd like to try. It does sound less intimidating in a group.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s work on some conversation starters you can use the next time. This will help build your confidence. 

User: Okay, that sounds good. I could practice them with you. 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Let’s brainstorm a few now. How about something simple like asking them about their weekend plans or their latest interests? 

User: Yeah, I could definitely do that. It's not too personal, so it feels safer. 

Consultant: Exactly! Safe conversations can lead to more comfortable interactions. Over time, this’ll help you feel more at ease. Remember, it’s all about taking small steps.

User: I really appreciate that. It feels nice to have a plan in place for both my feelings and my interactions.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s about building on your progress, one step at a time. Let's recap what we discussed today in our journey to improve your confidence and emotional well-being. 

User: Okay! I like that idea. 

Consultant: Today, we talked about recognizing negative thoughts and exploring your feelings regarding expectations. We also came up with strategies for expressing yourself and improving your social interactions. Does that sound about right?

User: Yes, that summarizes it well. 

Consultant: Great! It’s important to carry those strategies with you. Remember, progress takes time, and it’s okay to feel a bit uncomfortable along the way. 

User: Thanks for your support. I feel more hopeful now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep practicing those skills we talked about. If you need to talk or reflect on your experiences next time, I’ll be here to help. 

User: I will. Thank you so much.

Consultant: Today was a significant step forward for you. You've shown a lot of courage discussing your feelings. I look forward to our next session. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you today. I know that you've been facing some challenges with your confidence and social interactions lately. Can you share a bit more about how you've been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi. I feel really low. Since school started, the other students laughed at my Mandarin pronunciation, and it made me even more insecure. I find it hard to talk to anyone, and I just want to stay quiet.

Consultant: That sounds very difficult, Liu. It’s understandable to feel hurt when others react negatively. You're dealing with feelings of isolation and a lack of confidence. Can you tell me more about what goes through your mind when someone laughs at your pronunciation?

User: I just feel embarrassed and think that I’m not good enough. I worry that they will always laugh at me and that I won't be able to make friends.

Consultant: I hear you. Those thoughts can be really overwhelming. It might be helpful to explore if there could be a different way to think about the situation. What evidence do you have that you won't be able to make friends?

User: I don't know, but I'm just so scared. I keep thinking that they won't want to be friends with someone who speaks like me.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel scared, but I want you to think about this: if a friend of yours was facing the same situation, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that there are people who care about them and that it’s okay to be different.

Consultant: Exactly! You already have the insight that it's okay to be different, and that there are people who care. Let's explore how you can apply that perspective to your own experience. Can you think of any strengths or qualities you have, apart from your language skills?

User: I guess I’m really good at drawing. My art teachers have told me I have talent.

Consultant: That's a wonderful strength, Liu! Drawing is a great way to express yourself and can even help you connect with others. Perhaps you could use your art as a way to start conversations or connect with classmates who share similar interests?

User: I never thought about that. Maybe I could bring my sketches to school and show them to my classmates.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Sharing your art might help you feel more connected and allow others to see a different side of you. How would you feel about trying that?

User: I feel a little excited about it, but also nervous. What if they don't like it?

Consultant: It's natural to feel nervous about sharing something personal, but remember that not everyone will react negatively. You might even inspire someone else! Let’s reflect on this: what would it mean for you if a classmate responded positively to your drawings?

User: It would make me feel really happy and maybe more confident.

Consultant: Yes! That joy could help boost your confidence. As we move forward, it's also important to think about ways to manage those negative thoughts when they arise. What strategies have you tried to deal with your feelings of anxiety or insecurity?

User: I usually just keep everything to myself. I don’t know how to handle it.

Consultant: Keeping it all in can be heavy. Let's work on some strategies together. One approach could be journaling your thoughts and feelings. Writing them down can give you a clearer view of your emotions and help you reframe negative thoughts. What do you think about that?

User: I think that might help. I’ll try it.

Consultant: Great! It can be a safe space to express yourself. Additionally, practicing positive affirmations could help you combat those negative beliefs. Can you think of a positive statement about yourself that you'd like to use?

User: Maybe I could say, "I am creative and have my own strengths."

Consultant: That's an excellent affirmation, Liu! Repeating that to yourself can gradually change how you view yourself. Let’s set a goal for this week: practice journaling your feelings and repeat your positive statement daily. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I will try to do it.

Consultant: I’m proud of you for taking this step! Remember, it’s a process and it’s okay to feel nervous. We can work through this together. Next time we meet, we can talk about how it went and if you experienced any changes in your feelings or interactions.

User: Thank you! I feel a little better just talking about this.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Liu. You’re making great progress, and I believe that with time and practice, you’ll grow more comfortable in your social situations. Remember, I’m here to support you, and it’s perfectly fine to reach out if you feel overwhelmed. Let's set a date for our next session.

User: Yes, I would love that. Thank you for listening!

Consultant: Anytime, Liu! I look forward to our next conversation. Take care and remember to be kind to yourself during this process. 

User: I will! Bye!

Consultant: Bye, Liu!
###################
Consultant: Hello Liu! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed with school. There are so many courses, and I just can't keep up. It's like I'm losing interest in learning altogether.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like the pressure from your courses is really weighing on you, making it hard to stay engaged. Can you tell me more about what specifically feels challenging for you right now?

User: Well, I struggle to keep up with the assignments and studying. When I sit down to study, I feel like there's too much to do, and I just get stuck. It makes me feel really down.

Consultant: That sounds frustrating, Liu. It seems like the sheer volume of work is creating this sense of paralysis for you. What would it look like for you to feel more effective in managing your study tasks?

User: I think if I could break things down into smaller steps and actually see myself completing them, it would help. But I just don't know where to start.

Consultant: Breaking tasks down into manageable steps is a great strategy! It's important to set yourself up for small wins. Let's explore together what a smaller step might look like for your current assignments. Can you identify one task you’d like to tackle first?

User: Maybe I could start with my math assignments. They seem to pile up quickly because I don't always understand the concepts.

Consultant: That sounds like a good starting point. What if we set a specific, small goal related to your math assignments? Perhaps dedicating just 10 to 15 minutes a day to review a specific concept could be a first step. How does that sound?

User: That sounds doable. If I could just do a little each day, maybe I wouldn't feel so overwhelmed.

Consultant: Exactly! It's all about taking those small, manageable actions. How do you feel about committing to that for this week? And we can check in on your progress next time.

User: I think I can handle that! It's reassuring to have a plan. I’ll try to do that each day.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! How about we also think about how you can celebrate those small achievements? A small reward for sticking to your plan might motivate you further.

User: That's a good idea! Maybe I can treat myself to something I enjoy after finishing my daily ten minutes.

Consultant: Absolutely! A little reward can create positive reinforcement. It’s like saying to yourself, “I accomplished this, and I deserve to feel good about it.” What else might help you feel more engaged in your learning?

User: I used to like group studies, but since I’ve been feeling down, I haven’t wanted to reach out to my classmates.

Consultant: It makes sense that reaching out feels difficult right now. However, joining a study group could provide support and enhance your understanding. How would you feel about trying to connect with a classmate this week, even if it's just to share some study tips?

User: I think I could try that. It might feel a little awkward, but maybe they feel the same way about the courses.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Liu! Many people share similar struggles, and studying together can make the experience not only productive but also enjoyable. What’s one way you could initiate this connection?

User: I could reach out to a friend who seems to have a better grasp of the material and ask if they’d want to study together. 

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a proactive step that could really help you. And it might also serve to rebuild your confidence as you tackle your studies together. How are you feeling about our plan so far?

User: I feel more hopeful. I like having specific things to focus on and a plan to improve my learning.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. As you start implementing these strategies, notice how you feel and what small successes you have. Any thoughts on how you can maintain the motivation to keep this going?

User: I think I could keep a journal to track my progress and feelings. It might help remind me of what I’ve accomplished.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Keeping a journal can help solidify your learning experiences and keep you motivated by showcasing your progress. What do you think your next step is going to be after today’s session?

User: I’ll start with the math assignment for 10 minutes, try to reach out to my friend, and keep a journal about it all.

Consultant: That sounds like a well-rounded plan! I’m excited to hear about your experiences next time. Remember, taking these small steps will gradually lead to bigger changes. 

User: Thank you! I feel much lighter talking to you, and I'm ready to give this a try.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear you feel that way! Always remember, it's a journey. Between now and our next session, be kind to yourself as you navigate these changes.

User: I will! Thanks again for your support. I really appreciate it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Liu. Looking forward to our next session to hear all about your progress and experiences. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm really glad to see you today. It sounds like you've been getting more involved in school activities recently. How have you been feeling about that?

User: Hi! Yes, I have started participating in some school events. At first, I was really nervous, but now I feel a bit better. It's interesting to meet new people, but I still find it hard to open up sometimes.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're engaging in school events! Feeling nervous is completely normal, especially when meeting new people. Can you tell me more about a specific event you've participated in and how it made you feel?

User: Well, I recently joined a club. At the first meeting, I was really quiet and didn’t say much. But I enjoyed the activities we did, and I felt a little more comfortable by the end. 

Consultant: That’s a positive experience! It sounds like despite your initial nervousness, you were able to enjoy the activities and feel some comfort in the group. What specific moments stood out to you during that club meeting that made you feel more at ease?

User: I think it was when we played games together. I started laughing and felt like I could relax a bit, even though I still wasn't talking much.

Consultant: Laughter can definitely help break the ice! It shows that you were beginning to connect with others, even if you weren’t speaking much. How do you think participating in those games affected your feelings about being in the group?

User: I felt less stressed, and I realized that everyone was just having fun. It made me think maybe I could talk to them next time.

Consultant: That's a wonderful insight! Recognizing that everyone is just looking to have fun can really help reduce that pressure to perform. What would it look like for you to talk to someone in the group during the next meeting? 

User: I think I could start with a simple greeting or maybe ask about a game we played. It feels less daunting than just jumping into a conversation.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic strategy, Liu! Starting with something simple can make it feel more manageable. What do you think might hold you back from reaching out to someone next time? 

User: I worry they might not respond well, or that I’ll mess up what to say.

Consultant: Those worries are very common, but challenging those thoughts can be helpful. What evidence do you have that they wouldn’t respond well? 

User: I guess I don’t have any real evidence; it’s just what I think in my head.

Consultant: That’s very insightful! Sometimes our minds create negative scenarios without any real basis. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them to do? 

User: I would probably tell them to just go for it and not to overthink it too much.

Consultant: Exactly! You’d encourage them to take that leap. Can you try applying that same advice to yourself in the next meeting? 

User: I’ll try. I’ll remember to just go for it and not let my thoughts stop me.

Consultant: Wonderful! Each small step counts, and by challenging those anxious thoughts, you can create more positive experiences. Let’s think about what small goal you’d like to set for yourself for the next meeting.

User: Maybe I could aim to greet at least one person?

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect goal, Liu! A simple greeting can open the door to more interactions. How can I support you in achieving that goal?

User: Maybe you could help me practice how to say it in a more relaxed way?

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s practice a few ways you could introduce yourself or greet someone. It can be as simple as, "Hi, I'm Liu. Nice to meet you!" How does that feel for you to say?

User: That feels okay, but I might get nervous saying it in front of them.

Consultant: I understand that feeling. What if we add a few deep breaths before you greet someone? Breathing can help calm those nerves. Would you be willing to try that?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. 

Consultant: Great! Practicing deep breathing along with your greeting can help make you feel more at ease. How are you feeling about our conversation so far, Liu?

User: I feel more encouraged. I think I can try these things now.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! You've gained some great insights today. Remember, each small step is a victory. Before we wrap up, what do you think your next steps will be after our session today?

User: I’ll practice my greeting and remember to breathe. I’ll also think about what I want to talk about if I feel more comfortable.

Consultant: Those are excellent next steps! Let’s summarize what you’ve accomplished today and how you can keep moving forward with your social confidence.

User: Okay! I’ve recognized some of my fears, set a goal, and found ways to handle my anxiety.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve made wonderful progress, Liu. Continue to build on these strategies, and you’ll likely find even more enjoyment in your social interactions. If you ever feel unsure, remember you can always reach out for support.

User: Thank you for your help! I appreciate it.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Liu. I'm proud of the steps you're taking, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello Liu! I'm really glad to see you today. It sounds like you've been having some positive experiences recently with your team project. How are you feeling about it?

User: Hi! Yes, it was nice. I enjoyed working with my classmates, and I felt like I contributed to our success. But sometimes I still doubt my abilities to express myself in the group.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you enjoyed the teamwork! It’s totally normal to have doubts about self-expression, especially in a group setting. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel uncertain when trying to express yourself?

User: Well, I often feel like my thoughts might not be as good as others, or that I might say something wrong. It makes me hesitate to speak up, even when I want to contribute.

Consultant: I understand that feeling. It's common to compare ourselves with others and worry about our contributions. What do you think would help you feel more confident when you want to share your ideas?

User: I guess if I felt more assured that my thoughts are valuable, I might be more willing to share them. Sometimes, when I get positive feedback from teachers or classmates, I feel encouraged.

Consultant: That’s a thoughtful insight! Positive feedback is indeed powerful. Let’s explore some of those successful experiences you had during the team project. Can you describe a moment when you felt good about contributing?

User: Sure! I suggested an idea for our project, and my classmates liked it. They said it was creative and helped our project stand out. That made me feel happy and more involved.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It seems like your suggestion had a positive impact and made you feel more connected to your team. What specific skills do you think helped you come up with that idea and share it with your classmates?

User: I think it was just brainstorming together that helped. Everyone was throwing around ideas, and I felt inspired by their energy.

Consultant: It sounds like synergy played a big role in your contribution. How do you feel about recreating that environment in future discussions? What steps could you take to engage more in those moments?

User: I could try to remind myself that everyone has ideas to share. And if I feel nervous, maybe I could take a deep breath first to calm myself before speaking.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Taking a deep breath is a great way to ease tension. When you remind yourself that everyone's ideas matter, it can also build confidence. How do you think you could practice expressing yourself more in group settings?

User: Maybe I could start by sharing small ideas or thoughts in low-pressure situations, like with friends or in smaller groups. That might help me get used to speaking up.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! Starting with smaller, comfortable settings can ease you into more challenging situations. What might be a small group or setting you could practice this in soon?

User: I have a study group this week. I could try sharing my thoughts on our topics more openly.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! And remember, even if there are any hiccups, each time you share, you’re building that confidence. How do you think you’ll feel after attempting to share more in your study group?

User: I think I might feel proud of myself for trying, even if it’s a bit scary. Just knowing I did it would boost my confidence.

Consultant: Absolutely! That pride in your effort is so important. After trying it out, it might be helpful to reflect on how it went. What are some things you might want to focus on in that reflection?

User: I might want to note how I felt when I spoke up and if my classmates responded positively. I think that would help me see my progress.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! By reflecting on both your feelings and the responses from your classmates, you can start reinforcing your positive experiences. How do you feel about continuing to work on this style of self-reflection and expression in our sessions?

User: I feel good about that! I want to keep building my confidence and improving my communication skills.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Liu! It sounds like we’re making great progress. As we continue, we’ll focus on reinforcing those new patterns of self-expression. Remember, you have already shown that you can contribute meaningfully. Would you like us to plan some specific practices for your next sessions?

User: Yes! I’d appreciate that. It would help to have strategies to work on before the next project.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can set specific goals for both your study group and other social situations. I will also encourage you to identify any positive feedback you receive along the way. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds perfect! It makes me feel more organized and focused on what to improve. 

Consultant: I’m glad you feel that way! We’ll celebrate your progress together, and I’m here to support you through this journey. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any questions you have?

User: No, I think I’m good for now. I just want to thank you for helping me think through these things. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you today, Liu. Remember, you have shown great potential, and I believe you can keep enhancing your communication skills. Looking forward to our next session! 

User: Thanks! I’m looking forward to it too.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you again. It sounds like you've been making progress with your communication skills. How have things been since our last session?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been trying to talk more with my family, especially my parents. I shared some of my school experiences with them, and it felt good.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Sharing your experiences can really strengthen your relationships. What specific things did you share with your parents?

User: I told them about my classes and how I’m trying to make new friends. I think they were surprised to hear that I've been working on my social skills.

Consultant: It's great that you felt comfortable to share that with them. What was their reaction like?

User: They seemed happy and even a bit proud. It made me feel like they care more than I thought.

Consultant: It sounds like you received positive reinforcement from them, which is really encouraging. How did that make you feel about your relationship with them?

User: It made me feel closer to them. I didn’t realize it before, but I guess I really want their support.

Consultant: Wanting support from your family is very natural. It’s important for your emotional well-being. Have you noticed any changes in your feelings towards school or your social life since you started sharing more with them?

User: Yes, actually! I feel less anxious about both my studies and socializing. I’ve been able to join some group discussions in class.

Consultant: That's amazing, Liu! Joining group discussions can really help with both your confidence and your learning. What do you think helped you to participate more actively?

User: I think it’s because I feel more supported at home, so I’m less afraid of making mistakes.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense! Feeling supported can definitely boost your confidence. As we continue, let's think about how you can keep this momentum going. Are there any specific goals you have in mind for your studies or social life?

User: I want to improve my grades and maybe join a school club. I think that could help me meet more friends.

Consultant: Those are fantastic goals! Joining a club could be a great way to meet people with similar interests. Is there a particular club that interests you?

User: I’m thinking about the art club. I love drawing, and it would be nice to share that with others.

Consultant: The art club sounds like a perfect fit for you! Expressing yourself creatively can also be a wonderful way to connect with people. Have you considered how you might approach joining the club?

User: I guess I could attend a meeting and see how it feels. I just hope I don’t feel too nervous.

Consultant: That’s a good plan! It’s natural to feel a bit nervous, but remember that everyone in the club shares an interest in art, just like you. What might you do to help calm your nerves when you go to the meeting?

User: Maybe I can practice some deep breathing before I go in. I’ve heard that helps.

Consultant: Deep breathing is an excellent strategy! It can help center you and reduce anxiety. Would you like to try a quick deep breathing exercise together now?

User: Sure, that sounds good!

Consultant: Great! Let's take a deep breath in... hold for a moment... and then exhale slowly. Let’s do that a couple of times. Inhale… and exhale. How do you feel after that?

User: It definitely helps. I feel a bit more relaxed.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, you can use this technique anytime you feel anxious. How do you think this approach can help you in joining the art club?

User: I think if I use deep breathing before I go in, I will be less tense and able to enjoy the experience more.

Consultant: Exactly! It's all about managing your feelings so you can fully embrace new opportunities. As we work on your goals, it might be helpful to set a timeline for when you'd like to join the club. What do you think?

User: I could try to attend the next meeting on Thursday.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Setting a goal is a great way to stay motivated. Before we wrap up, do you have any other concerns or thoughts you'd like to share today?

User: I think I'm good for now. I feel more hopeful about things and have some steps to follow.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Liu! You've made significant progress. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel really positive. It’s nice to talk through things and realize what I can do.

Consultant: I’m glad you feel that way! As we finish for today, let’s reflect on the strategies you’ll use—sharing with your family, practicing deep breathing, and joining the art club. You’re becoming more proactive. Remember, I'm here to support you whenever you need. Looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help. I’ll keep working on these things!
