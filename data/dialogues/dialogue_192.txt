Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyue! I'm glad you're here today. Before we dive into our session, I’d like to hear about how you’ve been feeling lately and what’s been on your mind.

User: Hi. I’ve been really emotional lately, especially after that class about parent-child relationships. I couldn't stop shaking and even cried silently. It's just a lot to take in, and I don’t know how to handle it.

Consultant: That sounds really overwhelming. It’s understandable to feel shaken after discussing such a sensitive topic. Can you share more about what specifically triggered those strong emotions for you during the class?

User: Well, it made me think about my relationship with my mom. I really want her love and approval, but I feel like I can't measure up to what she expects. It’s exhausting and makes me question if I'm good enough.

Consultant: It seems like you’re caught in a tough spot between wanting to please your mom and feeling unworthy. Those feelings can be really heavy to carry. What do you think contributes to feeling that way about yourself?

User: I guess it’s partly because my parents divorced when I was in high school. I feel like I’m not enough for either of them. On top of that, I have to take care of my little brother, which adds to the pressure.

Consultant: That’s a lot for someone your age to handle. It's understandable that you would feel this way given your family situation and the extra responsibilities. How do you usually cope with these feelings when they arise?

User: Sometimes I just shut down completely. I can’t focus in school, my thoughts drift off, and I feel guilty for not doing better. I often end up crying alone in my room.

Consultant: It seems like isolation and guilt are your primary coping mechanisms right now. It might feel like a temporary relief, but it can contribute to that cycle of negative emotions. What do you think could help you feel supported instead?

User: I wish someone could just listen to me and understand. I feel like people don’t get what I’m going through. 

Consultant: It’s really important to feel heard and understood. You’re in a tough spot, and wanting support is absolutely valid. Let’s work together on recognizing some of those feelings and developing some more constructive thoughts around them. What negative thoughts pop up when you’re feeling this way?

User: I often think that I’m a burden to my family. I feel like they’d be better off without me sometimes. It makes me feel worthless.

Consultant: Feeling like a burden can be a very heavy thought to carry, and it significantly affects how you view yourself. Let’s take a moment to challenge that thought together. Can you recall any moments where you’ve felt valued by your family or friends?

User: There are moments when my friends tell me they appreciate me, but I just brush those off. I don’t really believe them.

Consultant: It’s common to doubt the positive things people say about us, especially when we’re in a tough emotional space. Let’s think about why that might be. What would you say to a friend who shared those same feelings about their worth?

User: I’d try to reassure them that they matter and that people care about them. But I can’t do that for myself. 

Consultant: It sounds like you’re very empathetic towards others, but hard on yourself. What if we tried to flip that script? Can you think of a positive affirmation about yourself that you could remind yourself of daily?

User: I guess I could try saying “I am worthy” but it feels strange to say that to myself. 

Consultant: It can feel unnatural at first, but affirmations can be powerful. Let’s practice it here together. How about you say, “I am worthy” out loud and see how it feels?

User: Okay… “I am worthy.” It feels a bit awkward, but I think it’s a start.

Consultant: That’s wonderful, Xiaoyue! Every step, no matter how small, is progress. Let’s continue building on these affirmations and also focus on setting small goals for yourself. What’s one thing you’d like to achieve in the next week that would help you feel more grounded?

User: Maybe I could try to spend some time each day doing something I enjoy, like drawing or hanging out with friends. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Engaging in activities that bring you joy can be a wonderful way to counter those heavy feelings. As you try this, notice how it affects your mood. 

User: I think I’d like that. I really enjoy drawing, but I haven’t done it much lately.

Consultant: Reconnecting with your passions is so important. Let’s touch base on this during our next session and explore how those activities might change your feelings towards yourself and your situation. 

User: Okay, I’d like that. 

Consultant: Great! Remember, you’re not alone on this journey, and it’s perfectly okay to seek help and support. We’ll get through this together. Is there anything else you’d like to express today before we wrap up?

User: I guess I just want to understand better why I feel the way I do about my mom and myself. 

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight, and we’ll explore those feelings deeper next time. Understanding the connections between your emotions and experiences is a step towards healing. You’re doing really well, and I look forward to our next session, Xiaoyue! 

User: Thank you. I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! Take care until we meet again.

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Yue! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, things have been really tough. I had another argument with my mom, and I ended up feeling even worse. I keep thinking that I’m the reason our family is falling apart.

Consultant: I hear you, and it's understandable that you're feeling this way after that conflict. It sounds like you're struggling with a lot of guilt and blame toward yourself. Can you tell me a little more about what happened during the argument?

User: I just lost it. She criticized my grades and said I wasn't trying hard enough. I felt really hurt and yelled back at her, but afterward, I felt terrible. It’s like I can’t do anything right.

Consultant: It sounds like that exchange was really upsetting for you. The pressure to perform well in school combined with family stress can be overwhelming. What thoughts went through your mind during that moment of conflict?

User: I was thinking that maybe I really am a disappointment. I can’t help but feel like I am failing everyone, especially my mom.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very heavy to carry. It's important to recognize how they are influencing your feelings. Are there specific feelings that come up for you when you think about being a disappointment?

User: I feel really anxious and sad. Sometimes I even wonder if I’m worth anything at all. It’s hard to concentrate on my studies when I feel this way.

Consultant: That sounds so painful, Xiao Yue. When you question your worth, it can really affect not just your emotions but also your ability to focus on schoolwork. Let's explore those thoughts a bit deeper. How do you think those feelings about yourself relate to your mom's comments?

User: I guess I just internalize everything she says. When she points out my faults, it feels like she’s confirming what I already believe about myself.

Consultant: It seems like her words trigger a lot of self-doubt for you. Have you noticed any patterns in your thinking after such interactions? Perhaps some thoughts that seem to surface repeatedly?

User: Yes, definitely. I often think that if I'm not perfect, then I'm worthless. It’s like this cycle where I feel bad, and then I just dig into those negative thoughts more.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that insight. It sounds like you've identified a harsh standard you're holding yourself to. What evidence do you have that supports this belief? Is there another way to look at your situation?

User: I mean, I’ve done well in some subjects, but I still focus on the mistakes. I guess I’m not as bad as I think, but it’s hard to feel that way.

Consultant: That’s an important recognition! It's good that you can see that you do have accomplishments. How would you feel if you considered those achievements as proof of your capabilities, rather than just the mistakes?

User: I suppose it might help me feel a bit more confident. I just don’t know how to stop seeing myself in such a negative light.

Consultant: It can be challenging to shift that perspective. One idea is to start practicing self-compassion. How would it feel to treat yourself the way you'd treat a friend who was in your position?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that they’re still valuable. Maybe I should try talking to myself like that.

Consultant: That’s a great step! Self-compassion can help soften those harsh self-judgments. Moving forward, what small changes could you make to practice this new way of thinking?

User: Maybe I could write down some positive things I do each week? Like a journal of good moments or achievements, however small.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Writing can be a powerful tool to reinforce positive beliefs. It might also help to remind you of your worth during tough times. How do you think starting this practice could change your feelings when you interact with your mom?

User: I think it might help me respond differently when she criticizes me. If I remember my strengths, I might not feel so defensive and hurt.

Consultant: Exactly! By acknowledging your worth, you can create space for calmness instead of reacting with guilt and fear. As we finish our session today, what key takeaway do you feel could be most valuable to you?

User: I want to focus on being kinder to myself and recognizing my accomplishments instead of just my failures. I really hope it helps with my relationship with my mom.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight, Xiao Yue. Compassion toward yourself can lead to healthier interactions with others. Remember, it takes time to implement these changes. If you find yourself struggling, it's okay to reach out for help. I’m here for you when you need it. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and understanding. I’ll definitely work on it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad we could discuss this today. I look forward to hearing how your practice goes in our next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyue! It's great to see you. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! Honestly, I’m still feeling pretty low. I tried talking to my mom again, but it didn't go well. Now I'm even more anxious about my studies.

Consultant: I understand that it must be really frustrating for you to have tried to communicate with your mom and not seen any progress. Can you share more about what happened during that conversation?

User: I just wanted to express how overwhelmed I feel, but she didn’t seem to understand. Instead, we ended up arguing, and I just felt so helpless and angry.

Consultant: It sounds like your attempt to communicate was met with resistance, which has led to even more anxiety in your studies. How do you feel this situation is affecting your ability to focus on your schoolwork?

User: It's definitely making it worse. Every time I sit down to study, I can't concentrate at all. My mind keeps wandering to those frustrating moments with her.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. It’s difficult to focus when your mind is preoccupied with unresolved feelings. What would it look like for you to regain your focus and manage those feelings while studying?

User: I just want to have a clearer mind and not let those thoughts distract me. Maybe I could also feel less anxious about everything.

Consultant: Absolutely, achieving a clearer mind and reducing your anxiety is a great goal. Let's explore some strategies to enhance your focus. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before studying?

User: Not really. I usually just jump straight into it and hope for the best, but it doesn't work out that way.

Consultant: It might be helpful to incorporate some relaxation techniques before you study. For instance, taking a few deep breaths or practicing mindfulness for a couple of minutes can help settle your mind. Would you be open to trying that?

User: Yes, I could give it a try. I guess it wouldn’t hurt to see if it helps.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful attitude! Let's practice a short breathing exercise together. Inhale deeply for four counts, hold for four counts, and exhale for four counts. Let's do this a few times. 

User: Okay, I'll try that. *[User follows the breathing technique]* Wow, I actually feel a bit more relaxed.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Establishing this kind of routine can really help bridge into a productive study session. How do you think you can implement this before your study times in the future?

User: I can set a reminder to do this before I start studying. I think that might help me get into the right mindset.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Also, as you become more accustomed to focusing in this way, we can gradually introduce role-playing exercises to help you feel more comfortable when communicating with your mom. How does that idea sit with you?

User: I like that! Practicing would probably help me feel less nervous about talking to her again.

Consultant: Exactly! Role-playing can be a safe way to explore different scenarios and responses. How about we start by setting up a situation where you explain your feelings? What would you say to your mom if the conversation went ideally?

User: I would want to tell her that I feel overwhelmed and need her support. I just want her to understand what I'm going through.

Consultant: That’s a great start. How do you think she might respond to that?

User: I hope she would listen, but I’m scared she might not.

Consultant: It's perfectly natural to feel nervous about her possible reaction. Let's practice that. I'll be your mom, and you can express your feelings as you would like to do.

User: Okay, here goes. “Mom, I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed with school and everything, and I wish you could help me a little more...” *[User continues to express feelings]*

Consultant: You did really well expressing your feelings. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt a little scary, but also a relief to say it out loud.

Consultant: That's a positive sign! You’re taking steps towards confidence in expressing your needs. Remember, it’s okay to feel scared, but facing that fear little by little can lead to greater comfort over time. What’s the next step you think you can take after this session?

User: I’ll practice the breathing before studying and think about when to have another talk with my mom, maybe try out what we practiced too.

Consultant: Those sound like fantastic next steps, Xiaoyue! You’re working really hard to improve your emotional state and communication skills, and that’s so commendable.  

User: Thank you! I feel like this session was really helpful, but I’m still worried about the next talk with my mom. 

Consultant: It’s normal to feel that way, but keep in mind that you’re developing strategies to address your feelings more effectively. The reminder of the breathing techniques and the practice we've done can help ease some of that anxiety. We’ll continue to build on this in our next session. 

User: That sounds good. I feel slightly more prepared now, actually.

Consultant: I'm really pleased to hear that. Remember, you're not alone in this; you have skills and support to help you through. If any thoughts or feelings come up before our next meeting, feel free to note them down, and we can discuss them then. 

User: I will! Thanks for everything today. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaoyue. Keep practicing those techniques, and I'm looking forward to hearing how it goes next time. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyue! I'm glad you're here today. I want to start by checking in on how you've been feeling lately, especially regarding your social interactions. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty unsure of myself when it comes to social situations. I recently participated in a class activity, but I felt like I couldn't concentrate, and I was really sensitive to what others might think of me. It was overwhelming.

Consultant: It sounds like the class activity was quite challenging for you, especially with the worries about how others perceive you. Can you share more about what specifically made you feel overwhelmed during that activity?

User: I wanted to engage and have fun, but I kept worrying about saying the wrong thing or making a fool of myself. I felt really anxious and ended up just standing there rather than joining in.

Consultant: That sounds tough. You had the desire to join, but the fear of judgment held you back. Let’s take a moment to explore those thoughts. What kind of thoughts were running through your mind while you were there?

User: I kept thinking that everyone was watching me and judging me. I felt like if I didn’t say something perfect, they would think I’m awkward or stupid.

Consultant: It sounds like there was a lot of pressure on yourself to perform perfectly in that social setting. Do you remember any specific feelings that accompanied those thoughts?

User: I felt really anxious, like my heart was racing. I also felt a bit embarrassed, and I just wanted to hide.

Consultant: Those feelings of anxiety and embarrassment are completely understandable, especially in situations where you feel judged. Let's think about those thoughts a bit more. How true do you think those beliefs are—that others were judging you negatively?

User: I guess I don’t know for sure. It’s just what I assumed. I just felt so self-conscious.

Consultant: It’s common to assume negative judgments from others, but it can be helpful to challenge those thoughts. If a friend were in your shoes, what advice would you give them? Would you think they would face similar judgments?

User: I’d probably tell them not to worry so much about what others think and just be themselves. But when it’s me, it’s so much harder to let go of that fear.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective to have! It shows you recognize how we can be our own worst critics. Let’s try to apply that insight to your own situation. What alternative thought could you replace your fear of judgment with during social interactions?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay not to be perfect. After all, people are usually more focused on themselves than on me.

Consultant: That’s an excellent shift in thinking! Focusing on the fact that everyone has their insecurities can help reduce that pressure. Now, let’s think about gradually increasing your participation in social activities. What’s a small step you could take to practice being more involved in social situations?

User: Maybe I could try starting a conversation with a classmate or joining a club that interests me. It feels a bit scary, but I think it might help.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Starting with small conversations can be a great way to ease into social situations. How about we set a specific goal for you to try this week with a classmate or in that club?

User: I can try to talk to someone during lunchtime this week. Just a simple “Hi” and asking how their day is going.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal, Xiaoyue! Just starting with a “Hi” can really open the door to more conversation. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. I think I can do it if I remind myself that it’s okay to just be myself.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! It’s normal to feel nervous, but remember that you’re taking a positive step forward. After you try it, we can discuss how it went in our next session. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I’ll give it a try and see how I feel afterward.

Consultant: Perfect! I’m here to support you, and I believe you can do this. Let’s also think about some relaxation techniques or self-soothing strategies you can use if you start feeling anxious before or during these interactions.

User: I usually like listening to music to calm down, or sometimes I take deep breaths.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Deep breathing can really help ground you. Let’s reinforce that as a tool for when you feel anxious. You can even practice it right before approaching someone. How are you feeling about everything we've discussed today?

User: I feel like I have some ideas to work with and goals to aim for. It feels good to talk it out, and I’m feeling a bit more reassured.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It seems like you’re starting to build confidence in handling social situations. Remember, change takes time, and every small effort counts. If you feel overwhelmed, don't hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you! I appreciate that. I’ll do my best this week and see how it goes.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoyue! I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Keep believing in yourself—you’re making progress. Have a great week ahead!

User: Thanks! I will! Talk soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyue! It's great to see you today. I'm looking forward to our conversation. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more stable emotionally, to be honest. I think I'm starting to accept the changes in my family and feel more confident about my future.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Xiaoyue! It sounds like you're making positive strides in adapting to your family's changes. Can you tell me more about what has contributed to this newfound stability and confidence?

User: Well, my interactions with my uncle and aunt have really made me feel supported. I feel like I can talk to them about things, and it helps a lot.

Consultant: It’s great that you have that support system. Having people who understand and listen to you can make a significant difference. How does that support affect your thoughts about your studies and your new school year?

User: It makes me feel more motivated. I think I can tackle my studies better this semester now that I feel supported at home.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset to have! You’ve mentioned feeling more motivated. How do you envision this motivation influencing your study habits and goals for the new school year?

User: I hope to stay more focused and maybe set up a better study schedule. I tend to get distracted easily, so I want to work on that.

Consultant: Creating a study schedule sounds like an excellent plan! Let’s think about some specific strategies you can use to improve your focus. What has worked for you in the past when it comes to studying?

User: I remember that when I break my study sessions into smaller chunks, it's easier for me. I also find it helpful to take short breaks in between.

Consultant: Breaking study sessions into smaller chunks is a fantastic approach! It helps prevent feeling overwhelmed. How about incorporating those short breaks? What kind of activities do you enjoy doing during those breaks?

User: I like listening to music or just taking a walk outside. It helps me clear my mind.

Consultant: That sounds refreshing! Incorporating music and walking into your breaks might enhance your overall focus when you return to studying. Have you thought about how to make that part of your study routine?

User: I think I need to set reminders for myself, maybe on my phone, to take those breaks. Sometimes I just forget to step away.

Consultant: That's a practical idea, setting reminders. It ensures you don’t miss those moments to recharge. Besides studying, how are you currently feeling about managing your emotions and any challenges that arise?

User: I feel like I’m doing a bit better. When I start feeling anxious, I try to acknowledge it rather than avoid it, which helps.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy, Xiaoyue! Recognizing and acknowledging feelings is an important step in managing them. Can you share an example of a recent situation where you applied this strategy?

User: Recently, I felt really anxious about a group project. Instead of just stressing, I took a moment to step outside and breathe. It felt like I was actually making progress.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant example of applying your skills! Taking a moment to breathe and reflect can really change how you handle stress. How did you feel afterward when you returned to the project?

User: I felt a lot calmer, and I could think more clearly. We ended up having a good discussion, and it didn’t feel as overwhelming anymore.

Consultant: It’s fantastic to hear that your calmness led to a positive outcome. You’ve done an excellent job in recognizing how your emotions impact your actions. How do you plan to build on this success in the upcoming weeks?

User: I think I want to focus on maintaining that calmness, especially when things get tough. I believe sharing how I feel with my uncle and aunt could help too.

Consultant: Holding onto that calmness is key, and talking to your uncle and aunt can provide additional support when needed. You've already displayed strong emotional management skills. Lastly, as we wrap up our session, what is one key takeaway you want to remember as you move forward?

User: I really want to remember that taking breaks and acknowledging my feelings are important. They really help me perform better.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway, Xiaoyue! Acknowledging your emotions and taking regular breaks will undoubtedly support your progress. I’m proud of the progress you’ve made today. As we conclude, I encourage you to continue practicing those skills. If you ever feel the need for support again, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad to be a part of your journey. Take care, and keep up your positive work!
