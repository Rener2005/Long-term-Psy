Consultant: Hi there! I'm really happy to see you today. Let's start by talking about how you've been feeling lately. What's been on your mind?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really frustrated. In school, I often find myself daydreaming during class. Even when I try to pay attention, I just get distracted by everything around me. My teachers keep calling me out, and when my mom hears about it, she gets upset with me. I just don’t know what to do.

Consultant: It sounds like you're facing a lot of pressure from both your teachers and your mom, and that's really tough. I hear you saying that distractions make concentrating difficult. Can you share a bit more about what those distractions are like for you in class?

User: Well, sometimes it’s just things happening outside the window, like people walking by or other kids talking. Other times, I just get lost in my own thoughts, thinking about random stuff. I don't mean to ignore the lesson; it just happens.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It seems that everything around you, along with your own thoughts, pulls you away from focusing in class. Do you remember a specific situation where you felt particularly distracted? What were you experiencing at that moment?

User: Yes, just last week, I was sitting in class, and the teacher was explaining something, but I kept thinking about what I would do after school instead of listening. I felt bad about it afterward because I missed important information.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel disappointed when you miss vital information. This distraction seems to create a cycle of frustration for you. Let's explore that feeling further. When you find yourself getting distracted, what thoughts go through your mind about your ability to focus?

User: I sometimes think that maybe I’m just not smart enough to understand what's being taught. My mom always tells me to pay more attention, so it feels like I must be failing at it.

Consultant: That thought—that you're not smart enough—can be very damaging. It's important to challenge that belief. What evidence do you have that shows you are capable of understanding the material when you do focus?

User: Well, I can do my homework just fine when I sit down and concentrate at home. I get good grades when I actually try, so maybe I am smart enough. But when I'm in class, it just feels different.

Consultant: It’s great to hear you acknowledge your success at home! That’s positive evidence of your capabilities. Now, let’s think about your experiences in class. When distractions happen, how do they affect your mood or how you feel about school?

User: I start feeling anxious and stressed out. I worry about what my teachers think of me, and my mom’s reaction makes it worse. It’s like I’m letting everyone down.

Consultant: That pressure can really weigh on you, making it harder to concentrate. Let’s work together to identify some strategies you can try when you feel those distractions coming on in class. For instance, can we think of a simple technique to keep you engaged during the lesson?

User: Maybe I could try taking notes on what the teacher says. That might help me stay focused.

Consultant: Taking notes is a fantastic strategy! It can keep your mind engaged and help you remember key points. Another idea could be to focus on keywords that the teacher emphasizes. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I think if I could focus on writing down the key points, it might help me not to daydream as much.

Consultant: Exactly! Practicing focusing on those key points can guide your attention back to the lesson. Let’s talk about how you can apply this in your next classes. What would be a good first step?

User: I can ask my teacher if I can use a notebook just for notes. That way, I’ll have something to keep my hands busy, and I can look down whenever I feel distracted.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Using a notebook can redirect some of that distracting energy into something productive. Let’s also think about how to handle moments when you feel yourself drifting off. What could you say to yourself to refocus?

User: I could remind myself that these lessons are important and that I can understand them if I try hard. Maybe I can take a deep breath to calm myself, too.

Consultant: Those are excellent self-reminders! Deep breaths can be a powerful tool to help calm those racing thoughts. Let’s practice that right now together—deep breath in... and out. Great! You can use that technique any time to regain your focus. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit better about trying to concentrate in class now. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about practice and being patient with yourself. During our next session, let’s talk about how these strategies worked for you. Does that sound okay?

User: Yes, definitely! I’ll try to keep track of how it goes!

Consultant: Excellent! I believe in your ability to make these changes. You’ve already shown so much insight today. Keep practicing, and we'll talk again soon. 

User: Thank you, I appreciate it! See you next time! 

Consultant: See you next time! Take care, and remember to celebrate those small victories along the way.

Consultant: Hello there! I'm really glad you're here today. I understand you've been feeling frustrated with your homework. Can you share a bit more about what's been going on lately?

User: Hi. I’ve been struggling with my homework a lot lately. My mom often tells me I’m not focusing enough, and it just makes me feel worse.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling pretty overwhelmed. Can you tell me what specifically is making it hard for you to concentrate on your homework?

User: I just get distracted really easily. Sometimes I stare at my homework for a long time but can’t really get it done. It’s like my brain just isn't working.

Consultant: I see. That must be really frustrating for you. When you’re trying to focus, what thoughts go through your mind that might be pulling your attention away?

User: I keep thinking about other things I want to do, like playing with my friends or watching videos. It’s hard to stay in the moment.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have distractions like that. Let’s explore those thoughts together. When you think about wanting to play or watch something, how does that make you feel about your homework?

User: It makes me feel more frustrated because I know I have to do my homework, but I also want to have fun. I feel like I can't do both.

Consultant: That sounds tough—feeling stuck between your homework and wanting to have fun. What if we work together to find ways to balance both? For instance, how would it feel to have short breaks where you could play a little after completing part of your homework?

User: That could be nice. I like the idea of taking breaks. Maybe I won’t feel as stressed if I know I can play afterward.

Consultant: Exactly! Having something to look forward to may help you focus better. Let’s think about setting some small goals for your homework. How about we start with a specific task and then reward yourself with a break afterward? What do you think?

User: Yeah, I can try that. Maybe I can finish a math problem and then take a five-minute break.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Small goals can really help you feel accomplished and make the task less daunting. When you sit down for homework, let’s try to also be aware of distractions. Have you noticed anything in your environment that pulls your attention away when you’re trying to work?

User: Sometimes my phone goes off with messages from my friends, and I just want to check them.

Consultant: That’s a common distraction! What if we try keeping your phone in another room while you work? This could help reduce those interruptions. What do you think about that strategy?

User: That sounds like a good idea! I think I can focus better if my phone isn’t around.

Consultant: Great! By removing those distractions, you’ll probably find it easier to concentrate. Now, let’s also think about what positive thoughts you can remind yourself of when you feel frustrated. What do you think might help you when you’re feeling stuck?

User: Maybe I can tell myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that I’ll get better if I keep trying.

Consultant: That’s a perfect thought to hold on to! Remembering that it’s okay to make mistakes can really help reduce pressure. Can we practice that together a few times whenever you feel frustrated?

User: Yes, I’d like that! I’ll try to remind myself that it’s part of learning.

Consultant: Absolutely, and I’m really proud of you for being open to this! As we work on these techniques, you might find that your confidence grows. How do you feel about trying these steps over the next week?

User: I’m feeling hopeful! I think if I follow these steps, it might help me with my homework.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about taking small steps and celebrating your progress, no matter how small. In our next session, we can talk about how these strategies worked for you. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?

User: No, I think we covered a lot. Thank you for your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing how things go for you. Remember, every little step counts, and I believe you can manage this. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately, especially after what happened during the class activity?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling a bit frustrated and anxious. I couldn’t keep up with my classmates during the activity, and it made me doubt my abilities. I really want to participate better next time.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience had a significant impact on you, and it's understandable to feel frustrated. You want to feel more confident and focused during group activities. Can you tell me more about what you wish you could change when you’re participating in those activities?

User: I hope I can pay more attention and not get distracted so easily. I want to feel like I’m part of the team instead of feeling isolated.

Consultant: Being part of a team is important, and it’s great that you’re aware of what you want to improve. Let’s explore what distractions you experience during activities. Can you share what usually goes through your mind at those times?

User: Sometimes I just zone out and start thinking about other things, like what I’ll do after school. It makes me miss out on what my classmates are doing.

Consultant: That makes sense. It's common to get lost in thought. When you find yourself zoning out, what feelings come up for you? 

User: I feel anxious and a bit sad afterwards because I don’t want to let them down. I just feel like I don't measure up sometimes.

Consultant: It’s tough to feel that way, and it’s important to acknowledge those feelings. Let's work on recognizing those anxious thoughts. When you start feeling that way, what negative thoughts do you notice in your mind?

User: I often think that I’m not as smart as my classmates and that they must think I’m slow or not good enough.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very discouraging. Let's challenge those ideas. Can you think of any evidence that contradicts those thoughts? Have you done something in class or another area where you felt capable?

User: Well, I do enjoy drawing and I think I’m pretty good at it. When I draw, I feel focused and happy.

Consultant: That’s an excellent insight! Drawing is something you excel at, and it makes you feel positive. Let’s try to connect that feeling of focus from drawing to group activities. How would it feel to use positive reminders about your drawing skills when you feel distracted?

User: I guess I could remind myself that I can focus on something I love, so maybe I can focus on the group too. 

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a wonderful strategy. Perhaps you can create a positive self-affirmation like, "I can focus and contribute," and repeat it to yourself before and during group activities. How does that sound to you?

User: I like that idea! It feels more encouraging than just saying I shouldn’t zone out.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear you feel that way. Practicing positive self-talk can help shift your mindset. Next time you get ready for a group task, you might also visualize yourself contributing confidently. Can you think of an upcoming activity where you could try that?

User: There’s a group project coming up next week. I can definitely practice saying those things to myself before we start!

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan, Li! It’ll be an opportunity to put what we’ve discussed into practice. We could also think about exploring some activities that can help improve your focus. Would you be interested in planning a few fun exercises to build this skill?

User: Yes! I think that would help. I want to try.

Consultant: Fantastic! We could start with some short focus exercises, like timed drawings or concentration games. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds fun! I like the idea of using drawing to practice.

Consultant: Wonderful! Drawing can be a powerful tool for improving your focus. We can try different games that require you to pay attention and gradually increase the challenge. Would you feel comfortable sharing your drawing with your peers when you practice this?

User: I think I’d feel proud to share my drawings with them. It might help me feel included too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your talents can help build connections with your classmates. It may also encourage them to see you as an important part of the group. What hobbies or skills do you think you could share with the group?

User: I could show them my drawings and maybe even help them with some art techniques!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Helping others can boost your confidence and create a sense of belonging. Plus, you’ll be reinforcing a positive experience for yourself. Before we wrap up for today, let's summarize what we’ve talked about and the steps you’re going to take moving forward.

User: Okay! I will use positive affirmations, practice visualizing my participation, and share my drawings. I want to focus more on my skills.

Consultant: That’s a great summary, Li! You’ve developed some excellent strategies today. Remember, it’s a process, and it’s okay to take one step at a time. I'm really proud of the progress you've made. 

User: Thank you! I feel more positive about the next steps.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to how these strategies will help you in your next activity, and I believe you’ll do great. If you ever need to revisit these ideas or want to share how it went, feel free to come back. You've got this!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for today's session. I want to hear about your art experience that made you feel really good. Can you tell me more about that?

User: Hi! In my drawing class, I felt so happy and focused. It’s like I completely lost track of time while painting, and I loved it. I wish I could feel that way when I’m doing my homework too.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear that drawing brings you joy and focus. What do you think helped you feel so concentrated during your art class?

User: I think it’s because I was really enjoying what I was doing. The teacher praised me, and I felt proud of my work. It made me want to keep going.

Consultant: So, feeling proud and enjoying the activity helped you focus. How do you think you can feel that same enjoyment and pride in your other subjects or homework?

User: Maybe if I could find something I enjoy about them, I would focus better. But sometimes, I just feel bored or overwhelmed.

Consultant: I understand. Finding joy in your homework is important. What subjects do you find the most boring or overwhelming? 

User: Math is really tough for me, and I often get distracted. I find it hard to understand the problems.

Consultant: It can be challenging when a subject feels difficult. Let’s explore this together—when you do math, what are the thoughts that come to your mind that might make it overwhelming for you?

User: I often think, “I can't do this,” or “This is too hard.” Then, I just want to give up.

Consultant: Those thoughts can feel really discouraging. What if we try to challenge those thoughts? Is there any evidence that supports those beliefs or any past experiences where you succeeded in math?

User: Well, there were times when I got things right, but I always forget them quickly. Most of the time, I just remember the times I struggled.

Consultant: It’s common to remember struggles more, but your successes matter too! How about focusing on those successful moments and reminding yourself of them when you start feeling overwhelmed?

User: That sounds logical. Focusing on what I did well could help. 

Consultant: Absolutely! We can also think about creating small, enjoyable tasks for your math homework. What would make you feel more inclined to do your math homework?

User: If I could turn some math exercises into games or something fun, I think I’d like it more. 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Games can definitely make learning more enjoyable. What kind of games do you like? Maybe we can incorporate some fun elements into your math practice.

User: I love puzzle games! If I could solve math problems like puzzles, I would probably enjoy it a lot more!

Consultant: Perfect! We can create puzzle-like math challenges. Let’s plan to turn some of your math homework into puzzles. How does that sound for a start?

User: That sounds exciting! I think I could give it a try. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Also, since you felt so focused while drawing, could we think about setting a specific time to draw before doing homework? It might boost your motivation.

User: Yes! Drawing can be a nice break before I study. It could help me feel better and focus more afterward.

Consultant: That's a wonderful strategy! Drawing can serve as a reward for your effort. How about we set a small goal for this week? Perhaps starting with 10 minutes of drawing before your homework?

User: That sounds doable! I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: Great! Let’s also think about how you can celebrate your small achievements when you complete your tasks. How would you like to acknowledge your efforts?

User: I could reward myself by watching a little TV or reading a fun book after finishing my homework!

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect reward system! Celebrating your efforts will help keep your motivation high. Remember, you’re working hard, and it’s important to recognize that progress.

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more motivated just talking about this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we wrap up today’s session, what do you think your biggest takeaway is from our discussion?

User: I think focusing on my successes and making math more fun could really help me. I feel encouraged to try these new ideas.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization! Remember, it’s about small steps and seeing what works best for you. You’ve shown a lot of determination today.

User: Thanks! I appreciate all your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m proud of the insights you've gained today. As we end this session, I want you to know that you can always come back whenever you need more support. Keep up the great work!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really happy to see you today. I would love to hear about how you've been feeling since our last session. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi! I feel pretty good actually. I got a lot of praise from my mom for a craft project I brought home. It made me feel really happy. My mom even said I did a great job!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Feeling appreciated can really boost our motivation. Can you tell me more about how that praise made you feel and what impact it had on your studying?

User: Well, I felt more confident and supported. It was like she noticed my effort, which made me want to keep trying, especially with my homework. I felt more focused, too.

Consultant: It’s great to see how positive feedback can enhance your focus and motivation! Let’s take a moment to reflect on that experience. How can you maintain that focus and motivation in your studies going forward?

User: I think if I keep reminding myself of how good it felt to be praised, it might help. Maybe I can also set small goals to keep myself on track with my homework.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Setting small goals can certainly help maintain your focus. What kind of goals do you think you would like to set for yourself?

User: Maybe I could aim to finish my homework a bit earlier each day, so I have more time to relax afterwards. 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! By giving yourself that extra time to relax, you’re also reinforcing a positive learning experience. How do you feel about involving your grandma and grandpa in this process?

User: I think they’d be supportive. They always cheer me on, especially when I’m doing well in school. 

Consultant: Fantastic! Having a support system at home can really make a difference. Would you be comfortable discussing your new goals with them and asking for their encouragement?

User: Yes, I think I’ll tell them about my homework goal. They will probably be happy to help!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Encouragement and support from family can motivate you even more. What kind of encouragement do you think would be useful for you from them?

User: Maybe they could set up a little reward, like letting me choose a movie to watch together when I finish my goals for the week.

Consultant: I love that idea! A little reward can be a great motivator. Let’s summarize these goals: you’ll set a goal to finish your homework earlier each day, involve your grandparents, and add a reward system. How does that sound?

User: It sounds really good! I feel excited about it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that excitement! Building on this positive experience is important. What else do you think you can do to keep that motivation strong?

User: Maybe I can create a chart to track my homework progress so I can see my achievements. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Visualizing your progress can provide constant encouragement. How do you feel about sharing this chart with your family?

User: I think they would love to see it! It would show them that I’m working hard.

Consultant: Absolutely! It creates a sense of achievement and brings your family into your journey. How do you imagine they would react to seeing the chart?

User: I think they’ll be proud of me. I’d love to see their smiles when they see it!

Consultant: That’s a beautiful thought! Your efforts deserve to be recognized, and that support will help you continue to grow. Now, let’s also consider any challenges you might face. What could distract you from your homework, and how can you address those distractions?

User: Sometimes, I get distracted by my phone or the TV. Maybe I should keep my phone in another room when I study.

Consultant: That’s a smart move! Reducing distractions like that can greatly improve your focus. Can you commit to giving it a try during your study time?

User: Yes, I’ll try that! I really want to stay focused.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! It’s all about finding what works for you. How confident do you feel about these plans we’ve created together?

User: I feel very confident! I believe I can do it.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s a process, and you’re already on the right path. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on your progress. What do you think you learned about yourself today?

User: I learned that I can stay focused with some rewards and support. It feels good to have a plan!

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing your capabilities is a powerful step forward. As you move on, remember to celebrate your achievements, no matter how small. Is there anything else you want to discuss before we finish today?

User: No, I think I’m all set! Thank you for your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you've made today. Keep believing in yourself, and I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Hi there! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good! I won the art competition at school, and my grandparents were so proud of me. I feel more confident now!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Winning a competition can really boost your confidence. How do you think this newfound confidence will impact your studies or other activities?

User: I hope it helps me focus better when I study. My mom always says I need to pay more attention to my homework.

Consultant: It sounds like you really want to channel this confidence into your studies. Let’s reflect on your strategies. What have you done recently to help you stay focused while studying?

User: I’ve been trying to make a schedule and stick to it. It’s been tough, but sometimes it helps me keep track of what I need to do.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Creating a schedule shows your commitment. Have you noticed any particular times or subjects where you struggle to focus more than others?

User: Yes! I find it hard to concentrate when I have math homework. I don’t always understand it, and then I get frustrated.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel frustrated when you encounter something difficult. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that go through your mind when you struggle with math?

User: I often think, “I’m really bad at this,” and then I just want to give up.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite discouraging. Let’s explore them a bit. What would you say to a friend who was feeling the same way about a subject?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to find things hard and that they should keep trying, even if it’s tough.

Consultant: That's a kind and encouraging response! It seems like you have a good perspective when it comes to helping others. How about when it comes to yourself? What if you rephrased that thought about math in a more supportive way?

User: Hmm, maybe I could think, “It’s okay to find this difficult, and I can ask for help to understand it better”?

Consultant: Exactly! That sounds much more encouraging. Allowing yourself to ask for help shows strength. Have you thought about seeking help from your grandparents or teachers when homework feels overwhelming?

User: I haven’t really talked to them about it, but I guess I could. They might be able to help me understand better.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! It’s important to have support, especially with challenging subjects. Let’s also think about what additional interests you might want to pursue to keep your motivation high. Are there any new hobbies or activities you’ve been curious about lately?

User: I’m really interested in trying out digital art! I think it would be fun and could be related to my painting.

Consultant: Digital art sounds like an exciting avenue to explore, especially since you enjoy painting! What would be a small step you could take to start exploring digital art?

User: Maybe I could ask my parents for an app or some tutorials for beginners?

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Taking that step will allow you to dive into your interest. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on everything we discussed. What would you consider your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I think I learned that it’s okay to struggle with things, and I can reach out for help. I also feel excited to try new things like digital art!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! Remember, it’s a journey filled with growth and learning. I'm proud of the progress you've made. If you encounter challenges in the future, remember the strategies we talked about today. I'm here for you whenever you need to chat again. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I feel more positive about everything!

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Keep nurturing your confidence and interests. Have a great day, and I look forward to our next session!
