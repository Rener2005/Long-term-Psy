Consultant: Hello L! I'm really glad to see you here today. How are you feeling about coming to school lately?

User: Hi. I don't know... I just feel really scared about going back. Last time, I just didn’t want to go at all. I got really upset when my mom tried to take me back.

Consultant: It sounds like coming to school has been really tough for you lately, especially with that strong reaction. Can you tell me more about what you were feeling when you were at the school gate?

User: I felt really anxious and just wanted to run away. I thought about all the things that could happen in class, like being called on or feeling embarrassed.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly overwhelming. What specifically about being called on or feeling embarrassed makes you feel so anxious?

User: I guess I'm just scared that I won't know the answer or that everyone will look at me and judge me.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. Many people feel anxious about being judged or not knowing the answers. If you could imagine a situation where you felt less anxious about being called on, what would that look like for you?

User: I guess... maybe if I felt more prepared or if I could just say what I thought without feeling so afraid.

Consultant: Preparing yourself sounds like a good strategy. Have you ever thought about ways to prepare for class discussions or get more comfortable sharing your thoughts?

User: Not really. I usually just try to stay quiet and not draw attention to myself.

Consultant: Staying quiet can feel safer, but it might also contribute to your anxiety. What if we explored some small steps you could take to prepare for class discussions without feeling overwhelmed?

User: Like what? I’m not sure I could do that.

Consultant: One idea could be to practice speaking your thoughts at home first, maybe with a family member or even in front of a mirror. That way, you can get used to expressing yourself before you do it in class. How does that sound to you?

User: I guess that might help. It’s just hard to even think about doing that.

Consultant: That's completely normal. Change can feel challenging at first. What if we tried brainstorming some topics you're interested in to make it easier to practice speaking?

User: I like art, but I don’t know if that would help in class discussions.

Consultant: Art is a great topic! You could start by talking about your favorite piece of art or even your feelings about creating art. It’s a subject you’re passionate about, and that could make it easier to share your thoughts. Would you be willing to give that a try?

User: I could try. It might feel less scary if I talk about something I like.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on something you enjoy can help reduce anxiety. Let’s plan for you to practice talking about art at home, maybe just a few sentences first. How does that plan feel to you?

User: That feels okay, I think. I’ll try to practice.

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember, it’s a process, and it’s okay to take small steps. As we continue to explore your feelings about school, are there any other situations that make you feel scared or anxious?

User: Sometimes I worry about group projects. What if the group doesn’t like my ideas?

Consultant: Group projects can definitely add pressure. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come to you when you worry about sharing your ideas with your group?

User: I just feel like they’ll all think I’m dumb if I say something wrong.

Consultant: That’s a tough thought to carry around. Let’s consider that thought for a moment—what evidence do you have that they would think you’re not smart based on your ideas?

User: I don’t know. Maybe it's just what I imagine.

Consultant: Imagining the worst can amplify our fears. How do you think your friends might actually respond if you share your ideas with them?

User: I guess they might be supportive? I just can’t get past the fear.

Consultant: It’s helpful to recognize that possibility. Sometimes, our fears can create stories in our minds that aren’t accurate. What do you think could help you challenge that fear before sharing your ideas?

User: Maybe thinking about what I would say to encourage a friend in the same situation?

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Treating yourself with the same compassion as you would a friend can change the narrative. Let’s add that to your plan—encouraging your inner voice just like you would a friend. 

User: That makes sense. I think I really want to feel less scared and more confident.

Consultant: You’re making great progress here, L. Remember, it’s all about building those small moments of confidence step by step. Are there other situations or feelings about school we should focus on today?

User: I think I’ve shared most of what’s been bothering me. I just hope I can do better in class.

Consultant: You’re doing really well by being here and opening up about your experiences. As we wrap up, let’s think about how you can keep practicing these steps we discussed. What do you feel would be your next steps after this session?

User: I’ll definitely practice talking about art at home and try that encouraging self-talk.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Remember, I’m here to support you, and we’ll continue to explore these feelings together next time. You’re getting stronger with each step you take. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit better just talking about this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, L. Remember, it’s okay to take your time. I look forward to our next session together. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, L! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious. The other day in class, the teacher called on me unexpectedly, and I just froze. It was so embarrassing. I still can't stop thinking about it.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. Feeling frozen in that moment must have been uncomfortable for you. Can you tell me what thoughts were going through your mind during that moment?

User: I just felt like everyone was staring at me, and I thought I might fail to answer. I felt so embarrassed and wanted to disappear.

Consultant: It makes sense that you would feel overwhelmed in that situation. It seems like the fear of judgment from your classmates is quite strong. Let's explore that a bit. What do you think would happen if you did make a mistake when speaking up in class?

User: I think everyone would laugh at me, and it would be really awkward. I mean, I just don't want to be the center of attention in a bad way.

Consultant: I hear you. That fear of judgment can be paralyzing. But is there any evidence that students would really laugh at someone who made a mistake? Sometimes our minds can exaggerate these fears. 

User: I don't know... I guess I've seen other classmates make mistakes and not get laughed at. They just move on, but I can't help thinking they must be stronger than me.

Consultant: That's an important realization, L. You're recognizing that others have similar fears but still manage to continue. What if we could try to replace those negative thoughts with something more supportive? For example, you could tell yourself: “It's okay to make mistakes; I can learn from them.”

User: I like the idea of being more supportive to myself, but it's hard to remember that in the moment. 

Consultant: It is challenging, and it takes practice. Would you be willing to try some small exercises where you practice speaking up in a safe space, like with a few friends, to gradually build your confidence?

User: I think I could try that. Maybe just talking a little bit more with my desk buddy could help me get used to it.

Consultant: That's a fantastic first step! Building up from a comfortable space with your desk buddy can help make you feel more confident. What would it feel like to talk to them more freely?

User: I think it would make me feel less anxious about talking. If I can do it with her, maybe it won’t feel so scary in class.

Consultant: Exactly! By starting with someone you trust, you can begin to reshape how you view speaking up. After you try this, we can discuss how it went and how you felt. 

User: I hope it goes well! I really want to improve.

Consultant: I believe you can, L. It’s a journey, and every small step counts. As you practice, I encourage you to keep track of any positive thoughts you replace the anxious ones with. 

User: That sounds doable. I’ll try to remember to be kinder to myself when I’m nervous.

Consultant: That’s a great plan. Remember, it’s perfectly normal to feel nervous sometimes. How do you think you can remind yourself of that when you feel anxious?

User: Maybe I can write it down and look at it when I'm feeling nervous, like saying it out loud to myself before class.

Consultant: Writing it down is a wonderful strategy! It gives you something to refer to in those moments of anxiety. How does it feel to come up with this plan?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Like I actually have something to try.

Consultant: That's progress, L! You’re recognizing that you have the ability to take small steps towards improvement. Next time, we can also talk about how to handle unexpected situations like being called on in class. 

User: Yes! That would help a lot. I hate that sudden feeling of fear.

Consultant: We’ll work on that together. I want you to focus on the idea that you are capable and deserve to participate without fear. What else do you think might help you feel more calm in such situations?

User: Maybe practicing some deep breathing before I speak in class could help calm my nerves. 

Consultant: Deep breathing is an excellent tool for reducing anxiety. We can practice it together. When you feel that rush of anxiety, just taking a moment to breathe can make a world of difference.

User: I’ll definitely try that. Thanks for suggesting it!

Consultant: You’re welcome! I'm proud of you for being open to trying new strategies. As we move forward, let’s also think about maintaining connections with your classmates to help you feel more comfortable.

User: I think building those connections might help me feel less isolated. I’ll work on that.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember, social connections can make a big impact. It seems like you’re committed to improving your interactions. Let’s keep building on that next time.

User: I really appreciate your support. I’m looking forward to our next session!

Consultant: You're doing so well, L. I’m excited to hear about your experiences next time. Until then, take care and remember to be kind to yourself!
###################
Consultant: Hello, L! I'm really glad you could make it today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been okay, but I still feel nervous when I'm around new classmates. I really want to improve my social skills.

Consultant: I understand. It can be tough to feel nervous around new people. Can you share a bit about a recent experience where you felt this way?

User: Well, I went to my classmate's birthday party recently. I felt really anxious talking to some older kids there.

Consultant: That sounds challenging. What kind of thoughts were going through your mind while you were at the party?

User: I kept thinking that they wouldn't like me or that I would say something silly.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really tough to deal with. How did these thoughts make you feel during the party?

User: I felt really shy and just wanted to hide. I didn't speak much at all.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me, L. It sounds like those thoughts created a lot of fear for you. What would you like to change about these feelings in future social situations?

User: I want to feel more confident and be able to talk to people without being so scared.

Consultant: That’s a great goal! We can work on building that confidence together. What do you think would help you feel more comfortable in those situations?

User: Maybe if I could practice talking to people in a safe environment, it would help.

Consultant: Practicing sounds like a solid plan! How about we try some role-playing today? We can act out different social scenarios together.

User: That sounds good! I think it might help me feel less nervous.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s start with a simple situation, like introducing yourself to someone new. How do you usually start a conversation with someone?

User: I usually just smile and say "hi," but then I don’t know what to say next.

Consultant: That’s a good start! Let’s build on that. What if after “hi,” you could ask them something simple, like what games or activities they like? Would you like to try that in our role-play?

User: Yes, I can try that! 

Consultant: Great! I’ll be the new classmate. Let’s go ahead. You can start.

User: Hi! Um, I’m L. What, um, activities do you like?

Consultant: Hi L! I’m Alex. I really enjoy playing soccer. How about you?

User: Oh, I don't play sports much. I like reading.

Consultant: Reading is fantastic! What kind of books do you enjoy?

User: I like fantasy books, especially ones about magic.

Consultant: That’s awesome! Let’s pause for a moment. How did that feel, L? 

User: It felt a little scary but also kind of fun! 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, even feeling a little scared is perfectly normal. With practice, it will become easier. What do you think you could do next time you’re in a similar situation?

User: I think I could ask someone about their favorite books too!

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a wonderful idea. It sounds like you’re already thinking ahead. How do you feel about your confidence level after this role-play?

User: I feel a bit more confident, but I still think I need more practice.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, L. Practice is key! How about we set a small goal for you to practice outside of our sessions before next time? 

User: Maybe I could try to talk to at least one new classmate during recess this week?

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic goal! How do you feel about that plan?

User: I feel a little nervous about it, but also excited.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel both. Remember, every small step counts. Before we wrap up, what do you think you’d take away from today’s session?

User: I think I learned how to start a conversation, and I feel like I can try more now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! You’ve made a lot of progress already. Let’s continue building on that confidence next time. Make sure to observe your feelings during your interactions this week!

User: I will! Thank you for helping me today!

Consultant: You're very welcome, L. I'm proud of you for taking these steps. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hi there! I'm really glad to see you today. I want to talk a little about how you're feeling lately, especially after that recognition you received in P.E. Can you share what emotions that brought up for you?

User: Hi! Yes, I felt really happy and a bit surprised when my teacher praised me. It was nice to be recognized in front of everyone, but I also felt a little unsure afterwards, like maybe I didn’t deserve it.

Consultant: It sounds like receiving praise made you feel a burst of happiness, but there's also a part of you that’s questioning whether you truly earned it. That's a really common feeling. What do you think made you feel unsure about it?

User: I guess I usually don’t do much in class or stand out. It was just a group project, and I didn’t think I contributed more than others. 

Consultant: I see. So you think that because you don’t often stand out in other situations, you may feel you don't deserve the praise this time? Let's explore this a bit more. Can you tell me about some of the times you've felt proud of your efforts, even if they weren't recognized?

User: Well, there have been times when I helped my friends with their problems or sat with them when they were feeling down. I felt good about that, but it was just what friends do, right?

Consultant: Absolutely, supporting your friends is a sign of kindness and strength. Even if it feels normal to you, those moments are indeed valuable. How did those experiences make you feel about yourself back then?

User: I felt useful and like a good friend, but it’s different from being praised in class. 

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. Praise in a more public setting can feel weightier. In those moments when you helped your friends, did you ever think about writing those experiences down or reflecting on them? 

User: No, I never thought about that. I guess it didn’t seem that important. 

Consultant: Would you be open to trying that? We can create a “success log” together, where you document moments you feel proud, no matter how small. This can help you recognize your strengths and boost your confidence. 

User: That sounds interesting! I guess it would help me see things differently.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start by thinking about that recent praise. What do you think you did that led to you being recognized by your teacher?

User: I just worked well with my team, I think. I did my part and tried to encourage them too.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Encouraging others is an important quality, and it shows leadership skills. How does this realization make you feel about that moment?

User: It makes me feel a bit more confident, I guess. Like I did play a role, even if it was a group effort.

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing that you contributed positively is a step towards building a more confident self-image. Now, can you think of one more instance where you felt proud or happy about something you did?

User: Hmm, well, there was a time I helped my mom organize her classroom. It felt nice to see everything neat and her being happy with it.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful example! Helping your mom not only made her happy but also shows your ability to contribute positively at home. How might you describe that experience in your success log?

User: I could write, “Organized mom’s classroom and made her happy.” It’s simple but nice.

Consultant: Exactly! Simple but meaningful. The key is to recognize your contribution and how it made both you and others feel. How do you think keeping this log would impact your self-view over time?

User: I think it might help me feel better about myself, like I have more to offer than I thought.

Consultant: Yes, that’s exactly the goal. Over time, these recorded moments can shift your perspective and reinforce a more positive self-image. How do you feel about starting this practice regularly?

User: I’d like to try it! It sounds like a good way to remind myself of the positive things I do.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s make it a habit to revisit this in our sessions. Each time, we can build on your experiences and focus on how you’re growing in confidence. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I'm excited to see how it works for me. 

Consultant: I’m excited for you too! Remember, every little step counts. You’re doing amazing work by reflecting on your experiences. It’s okay to feel uncertain at times, but focus on those moments of brightness and your contributions. 

User: Thank you! I already feel a bit better about sharing myself. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of you for opening up today. Next time, let’s chat more about what you write in your success log. Remember, you have more to share than you might realize. 

User: I will! I can’t wait to share my first entries with you. 

Consultant: I look forward to hearing them! It’s been a pleasure talking with you today. Think about those positive experiences, and remember to be kind to yourself. See you next time!

User: Bye! Thank you again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, L! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I tried talking more during group discussions at home, and it felt nice to share my thoughts with others.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Sharing your thoughts can be empowering. Can you tell me about a specific moment when you felt comfortable speaking up?

User: Sure! At the small gathering at my house, I participated in a conversation about movies. I managed to share my favorite one, and people listened to me—it was kind of exciting!

Consultant: It sounds like you had a positive experience! How did it make you feel to express yourself in that group?

User: I felt happy and proud of myself. I think talking about things I enjoy makes it easier for me to join in the conversation.

Consultant: That makes sense, L. When you discuss topics you're passionate about, it can help to overcome some of the anxiety. Have you noticed any changes in how you approach conversations with your classmates?

User: Yes! I've started to feel a bit more comfortable around my classmates. I still think it's hard, but at least I'm trying. 

Consultant: That’s a significant step! Can you elaborate on what feels hard during those interactions with classmates?

User: Sometimes I worry that my thoughts aren’t interesting enough, so I hesitate to speak. I keep thinking they might not care about what I say.

Consultant: I understand. It can be tough when we doubt the value of our contributions. When you feel this way, where do you think that thought comes from?

User: I think it comes from my fear of being judged. I don't want people to think I’m silly for my opinions.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to worry about judgment. Let’s try to challenge that thought together. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that your opinions are silly?

User: Well, I guess I don’t have any solid evidence. It’s just this nagging doubt in my mind.

Consultant: That's a key realization! A lot of times, our worries can be unfounded. If a friend were in your situation, what would you say to help them feel more confident about sharing their thoughts?

User: I would tell them that their opinions matter and that everyone has different perspectives.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re wise to recognize that everyone’s opinions have value. Now let’s discuss some strategies you can use to express yourself more confidently next time. How about setting a goal to share one thought during your next class or group discussion?

User: That sounds like a good idea! I can really try to do that.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! When you share that thought, how do you think it will change the way you feel about yourself?

User: I think it would help me feel more confident, like I belong there.

Consultant: Yes! Feeling like you belong is essential, and sharing your thoughts can foster that feeling. Also, what helps reinforce this sense of belonging for you?

User: My mom always encourages me to speak up and listen. Her support makes a big difference.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Relying on your mom's support is beneficial. As you practice asserting yourself in conversations, consider sharing your feelings with her as well. It’s a great way to strengthen your relationship even more.

User: I hadn’t thought of that! Talking more openly with my mom could help me feel supported.

Consultant: Definitely! Communication is a two-way street, and being open about your feelings can strengthen your bond. As our session comes to a close, let’s look at what you've achieved so far. How do you feel about the progress you’ve made?

User: I feel really proud! I can see that I’m becoming more comfortable expressing myself.

Consultant: You should be proud, L! You’ve taken valuable steps towards being more independent and confident. As you continue this journey, remember the new strategies we discussed. What is one thing you’d like to focus on before we meet again?

User: I want to work on sharing my thoughts more openly at school. 

Consultant: That’s a great goal! I believe in you, L. You've shown remarkable growth, and I'm excited to hear how your next experiences go. Remember, I'm here for you when you need support.

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and I look forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, L! I'm really glad to see you today. How are you feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. I think I've become a bit more confident and independent. My mom also said some nice things during the parent-teacher meeting that made me feel appreciated.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It's great that your mom recognized your growth. Can you tell me more about how these feelings of confidence have affected your daily life?

User: Well, I feel more willing to try new things, and I’ve been thinking a lot about my transition to middle school. It feels exciting but also a little scary.

Consultant: Transitioning to middle school can definitely bring mixed feelings. It’s normal to feel both excited and a bit anxious about change. What specific thoughts or worries do you have about this new chapter?

User: I guess I'm worried about making new friends and whether I will fit in. I don’t talk much in class, so I'm not sure how social it will be.

Consultant: Those concerns are quite common. It sounds like fitting in and socializing are on your mind. If you found yourself in a different situation with new classmates, what positive thoughts or strategies could help you approach it?

User: Maybe I could focus on just being myself and finding others who like the same things I do. But I also worry I might not know what to say or how to start a conversation.

Consultant: That makes sense. Starting conversations can be tough. What if we brainstorm some easy conversation starters together? This way, you'll feel prepared when opportunities arise to connect with others.

User: That sounds helpful! I think if I have a few ideas ready, it might make it easier for me to talk to classmates.

Consultant: Absolutely! How about starting with questions like, "What’s your favorite subject?" or "Have you read any good books lately?" These simple questions can lead to more in-depth conversations.

User: I like those ideas! They seem easy to remember too. I can definitely try using them.

Consultant: I'm glad you like them! Let’s also consider how to build self-confidence when you’re in those social situations. What are some ways you can remind yourself of your strengths when you feel nervous?

User: I suppose I could remind myself that I’ve made friends before and that I can do it again. Maybe thinking of the good things I’ve achieved this year could help too.

Consultant: Very insightful! Reflecting on your achievements can be a powerful reminder of what you’re capable of. Let’s practice a little affirmation. How about creating a positive statement you can say to yourself in those moments?

User: Okay... maybe something like, “I am confident and ready to make new friends.”?

Consultant: That’s a fantastic affirmation! Repeating that when you're feeling uncertain can help reinforce your confidence. Would you feel comfortable integrating that into your daily routine?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. I might even write it down and say it to myself in the mirror.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Setting up a visual reminder can enhance your commitment. Now, as we move forward, let’s discuss how to maintain these positive changes. What long-term goals do you have for yourself as you enter middle school?

User: I want to be more involved in group activities and grow my social skills. I’d like to join a club or something where I can meet people.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful goal! Joining a club can be a great way to connect with people who share your interests. Have you thought about any specific clubs you might be interested in?

User: I love reading, so maybe a book club? Or there’s also a drama club, which could help me work on speaking in front of others.

Consultant: Both of those sound like excellent choices! They provide opportunities to engage with peers and develop your communication skills. Which one do you think you would like to try first?

User: I think I’d like to try the book club first. It feels more comfortable to start with something I love.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Focusing on something you enjoy can ease that initial anxiety and help you connect naturally. Before we wrap up today, let’s summarize some strategies you've learned to maintain your growth and handle challenges ahead.

User: Sure! I will use conversation starters, remind myself of my strengths, and practice my affirmations. Plus, I’ll explore joining a book club!

Consultant: You're on the right track! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made, L. It’s important to remember these strategies as you face new experiences. How do you feel about everything we discussed today?

User: I feel really good! I have a plan, and I'm excited to try new things.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! You've done incredibly well in this process. Remember, you can always come back if you feel you need more support. Today was our last session, so I want to wish you all the best on your journey.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate all of your help. I feel ready for middle school now!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, L! I’m confident that you’ll do great. Take care, and remember to celebrate your achievements as you move forward. Goodbye!
