Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you again. I remember we discussed your feelings about your marriage last time. How have you been feeling since then? 

User: Hi. Honestly, I’ve been really upset. I can’t stop thinking about my husband’s affair. I feel torn about whether I should stay or leave. It’s driving me crazy, and I haven’t been sleeping well at all.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly challenging. It’s understandable that you’re feeling so anxious and restless. Let’s explore those feelings a bit more. What specifically is making you feel torn about your decision?

User: I love him, but I can’t believe he betrayed me like this. I feel angry and hurt, but I also think about our life together and how it might change if I leave.

Consultant: It’s normal to have mixed emotions in such a situation. You’re feeling a deep sense of love for your husband, but also a strong sense of betrayal. How do you think these conflicting feelings impact your daily life right now?

User: They make it really hard to focus on anything else. I’m constantly distracted at work and even at home. I wake up in the middle of the night and just cry. It’s exhausting.

Consultant: That must be incredibly draining for you both emotionally and physically. When you wake up crying, what thoughts usually run through your mind at that moment? 

User: I think about all the good times we had and how I thought we were happy. Then I get frustrated imagining him with someone else. It feels like I’m stuck in this cycle of sadness.

Consultant: It’s understandable to dwell on happy memories while feeling pain over the current situation. Let’s think about some of the thoughts you mentioned. Are there any particular thoughts that seem to be more critical or negative than others? 

User: Yes. I often think I’m not good enough for him or that I must have done something wrong to make him cheat.

Consultant: That's a heavy thought to carry, and it’s common to blame ourselves in difficult times. Can we challenge that belief a bit? What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts this idea?

User: I guess I don’t really have any evidence. I’ve always tried my best to be a good partner. But then I just feel confused—if that’s true, why did he cheat?

Consultant: It’s valid to feel confused, especially when it seems to contradict your understanding of the relationship. It's important to recognize that infidelity can stem from many factors, often unrelated to your worth as a person. How does that shift in thinking make you feel?

User: It’s comforting, but I still can’t shake off the feeling that I should have seen the signs or done something more to prevent this.

Consultant: It’s understandable to look for signs. Sometimes we think we could have foreseen anything bad. However, relationships can be complex, and it’s not always easy to predict someone else’s behavior. What might you tell a friend in your situation about their ability to foresee such changes?

User: I’d probably tell them it’s not their fault, that they deserve respect and honesty. But it’s hard to apply that to myself.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It’s easier to extend compassion to others than ourselves. How about we practice showing yourself the same kindness? Can you think of a compassionate phrase you might use when you feel guilty or to blame yourself?

User: Maybe something like, "It’s not your fault; you did your best." 

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy affirmation! Next time you start feeling that blame creeping in, you can remind yourself of that phrase. Let’s shift our focus to what you can control. What activities or practices could help you find some peace or joy amidst this turmoil?

User: I used to love reading and going for walks. I haven’t been doing either since all this happened. 

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful activities that could help lift your mood a bit. Would you be open to setting aside some time each week for a walk or a good book? 

User: Yes, I think I’d like that. It might help clear my mind. 

Consultant: That’s a positive step forward! Let’s plan on that together. Remember, these small actions can create pockets of calm in your day. How do you feel about integrating this into your weekly routine?

User: I feel hopeful. I’m not sure I can fully escape my feelings, but I think having something to look forward to could help.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s about creating balance. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what we’ve talked about. What stands out to you as the most helpful insight from our session?

User: I think recognizing that it’s not my fault and that I can choose to focus on myself is really important. 

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! As we move forward, how can you remind yourself of this perspective when those challenging thoughts come up?

User: I can keep repeating that phrase to myself and try to plan some enjoyable activities to shift my focus.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, and I’m glad you’re feeling a little lighter. Remember, it’s okay to take things one step at a time. I’m here to support you. 

User: Thank you. I appreciate your support. It helps knowing I have someone to talk to about this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to our next session. Take care, and remember to nurture yourself. 

User: I will. Thank you again.

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been somewhat better, but I still feel anxious about my marriage. My husband has apologized for his affair, but I can't shake off the doubts and worries. It's been tough.

Consultant: I can see how those lingering feelings of doubt can be really challenging to manage. It sounds like you're in a conflictual emotional state regarding your marriage. Can you tell me more about what specifically is causing you the most anxiety right now?

User: I just keep thinking if I can really trust him again, or if this is just a temporary change. Every time he leaves for work, I feel this wave of anxiety. What if he does it again?

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way after such a significant breach of trust. It sounds like your mind is racing with "what if" scenarios. Let's explore what those thoughts look like. What thoughts run through your mind during those moments of anxiety?

User: I often think, "If he truly cared, why would he do something like this?" I feel like I can't let my guard down and that I can't truly be happy.

Consultant: I hear you—it sounds very painful and confusing. Let’s take a closer look at that thought. Can you tell me what specific feelings arise when you think, "If he truly cared, why would he do this?"

User: I feel hurt and betrayed, and then I start to question my self-worth. I think maybe I am not enough for him.

Consultant: That’s a really heavy burden to carry. It’s important to recognize how these thoughts affect your self-esteem. Let’s challenge that belief for a moment. What evidence do you have that suggests you are not enough? Can we explore this together?

User: I guess I don't have any definitive proof. It’s often just how I feel when I’m upset. 

Consultant: It’s very insightful that you recognize it’s based on feelings rather than facts. Sometimes our emotions can lead us to draw unfair conclusions. If a friend were in your shoes, how would you advise her to look at this situation?

User: I would probably tell her that she deserves to be treated well and shouldn’t just assume it’s her fault. 

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective. You clearly have the capacity for empathy towards others. Let's see how we can redirect that compassion towards yourself. How might you reframe your self-talk when those feelings of inadequacy arise?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that I am worthy of love and respect, regardless of his actions. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful start! Instead of connecting his actions directly to your worth, you could focus on affirming your own value. Let’s practice that in a few scenarios. When you feel anxious, what could a positive affirmation sound like for you in those moments?

User: I could say something like, "I am enough and I deserve happiness.” 

Consultant: That's a powerful affirmation. When you practice that, how do you think it would change the way you feel about yourself in relation to your marriage?

User: I think it could help me feel more secure in myself and perhaps less anxious about his actions.

Consultant: Absolutely. Focusing on your self-worth can create a healthier foundation for how you approach the relationship. Now, let’s think about some practical steps. What’s one small thing you could do this week to reinforce that affirmation and practice self-care?

User: I’ve been wanting to reconnect with my hobbies, like painting. I think I’ll make some time for that. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Engaging in activities you love can certainly help divert your focus and bring you joy. As we move forward, how do you feel about discussing ways to communicate with your husband about your feelings?

User: I think that would be helpful. I often feel like I can’t express myself without feeling vulnerable, but I think it’s important.

Consultant: Expressing your feelings can feel daunting, but creating an open dialogue is key. How could you approach this conversation in a way that feels safe for you?

User: I could start by sharing how I feel rather than making accusations. Maybe opening up about my fears could lead to a better discussion.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Sharing from your perspective can invite understanding rather than defensiveness. As you work on this over the next week, remember to also affirm your progress and feelings. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds good. I feel like I'm finally starting to see a clearer path. My anxiety is still there, but I hope to handle it better.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that. Acknowledging the anxiety is a step forward. Let’s keep practicing these strategies together. Would you feel comfortable summarizing what you've learned and the action steps you’ll take until our next session?

User: Sure! I’ll focus on my affirmations, spend time on my hobbies, and try to communicate my feelings better with my husband.

Consultant: That’s a perfect plan. I look forward to hearing how everything goes in our next session. You’re making positive strides, and remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time.

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been great talking with you. Remember, it’s normal to feel uncertain, and you’re not alone in this journey. Take care until we meet again.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Cui! I'm glad to see you today. Before we dive into our discussion, I’d love to hear how you’ve been feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I’ve been really overwhelmed. Balancing work and family has become increasingly tough, and I feel I'm losing control. It’s starting to affect my performance at school, and I'm worried about my marriage as well.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of pressure from both your job and your home life. Can you share more about the specific challenges you’re facing at work and how they relate to your family situation?

User: At work, I’m not able to focus or give my best, which frustrates me because I have high expectations of myself. At home, there have been some disagreements with my husband about responsibilities. I feel like I’m failing in both areas.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult, feeling pulled in two directions. When you think of these disagreements at home, what specific thoughts go through your mind that contribute to your feelings of failure?

User: I often think that if I can’t handle everything perfectly, I’m not a good teacher or a good wife. It seems like I should be able to manage both, and if I can’t, it feels like I’ve failed.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially with the high standards you set for yourself. Have you noticed how these thoughts make you feel emotionally on a day-to-day basis?

User: Yes, they make me anxious and sometimes even depressed. I get frustrated with myself for not achieving what I think I should.

Consultant: It sounds like these thoughts are quite heavy and burdening. What if we looked at some specific situations that trigger these feelings? Can you think of a recent event that left you feeling particularly stressed?

User: Just last week, there was a parent-teacher meeting that I felt unprepared for. I worried about what the parents would think of me, and the tension at home from my husband not helping added to it.

Consultant: It seems like the pressure to be prepared, combined with issues at home, created a lot of anxiety for you. What thoughts crossed your mind during that meeting, and how did they impact your feelings about your work?

User: I kept thinking that if I didn’t impress the parents, I’d risk my reputation as a teacher. That thought made me even more nervous and disconnected during the meeting.

Consultant: That’s a significant pressure to carry. Let’s explore that thought a bit more—how much evidence do you have to support the idea that not impressing the parents would lead to a failure in your job?

User: I guess not much. I have generally received positive feedback. But I feel like one bad meeting could overshadow all my efforts.

Consultant: It's understandable to worry about how one event might reflect on your overall performance. However, considering the positive feedback you’ve received, is there another way to interpret that situation, perhaps one that’s less critical of yourself?

User: Maybe I could view it as a learning experience rather than a failure. I could tell myself that everyone has off days, and it doesn’t define my worth as a teacher.

Consultant: That’s a great shift in perspective, Cui! Recognizing that one event doesn’t represent your entire career can help reduce anxiety. What steps do you think you could take next time to feel more prepared and less pressured?

User: I think I could set aside specific time for preparation and ask for help from colleagues or my husband when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive plan! By seeking support and dedicating time to prepare, you’re actively taking control of the situation. How do you feel about implementing this approach for upcoming meetings or events?

User: I feel hopeful. It seems manageable, and I also realize I don’t have to do everything alone.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Leaning on support is a strong strategy. Now, let’s discuss your home life. Can you describe a recent disagreement with your husband, and what thoughts went through your mind during that moment?

User: We had an argument about household chores. I felt he wasn’t doing his part. I thought, “Why can’t he see I’m overwhelmed? Why do I have to ask for help all the time?”

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a lot of frustration in feeling like you have to advocate for your needs. How did those thoughts affect your conversations with him during that disagreement?

User: I ended up snapping at him instead of calmly expressing how I felt. It escalated quickly, and I just felt worse afterwards.

Consultant: That’s understandable in the heat of the moment. When we feel overwhelmed, communication can sometimes break down. What do you think would happen if you expressed your feelings and needs more directly next time?

User: I suppose he might respond better if I just told him how I’m feeling instead of assuming he knows. I think he would want to help if he understood the full picture.

Consultant: Opening up that line of communication could definitely help. Would you like to discuss how to frame that conversation with him in a way that feels comfortable?

User: Yes, I think I could start by sharing my own struggles and then ask for his perspective. It might make it feel more like a team effort.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Framing it as a conversation rather than confrontation can really help in fostering understanding. As you work on these strategies, how do you feel about acknowledging the progress you’ve made?

User: I feel like I’m beginning to see things from a different angle. It’s helpful talking about it and planning those next steps.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. It sounds like you’re moving toward a place of more understanding and openness. Before we wrap up, what are some key takeaways from our session today that you’d like to carry forward?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is that I can change the way I think about my challenges. Seeking support is okay, and I need to communicate better with my husband.

Consultant: Those are powerful insights, Cui. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. If challenges arise, you now have strategies to guide you. Thank you for sharing with me today, and I look forward to our next session to see how these changes have begun to impact your life.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more at ease, especially after my recent talk with my husband about our marriage. I feel like I'm starting to understand things better.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It seems like that conversation helped provide some clarity. What aspects of your marriage did you feel more comfortable discussing?

User: We talked about our expectations and how we communicate. I never realized how important it is to express my thoughts and feelings clearly.

Consultant: Yes, clear communication is key to a healthy relationship. It sounds like you're beginning to see the value in being open about your feelings. What did you notice about your emotions during that discussion? 

User: I felt a mix of anxiety and relief, to be honest. It was tough to share, but once I did, it felt like a weight was lifted.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel anxious before such discussions. It's commendable that you pushed through that discomfort. What do you think contributed to that sense of relief afterward?

User: I think it was because my husband listened and responded positively. I felt heard for the first time in a while.

Consultant: Feeling heard is very important in any relationship. It fosters connection and understanding. Based on this experience, how do you think you can continue to improve your communication with him?

User: I want to be more proactive in sharing my feelings and also encourage him to do the same. I think it would help us both.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Encouraging reciprocal communication can indeed strengthen your bond. Are there specific topics you feel more comfortable discussing now?

User: Yes, I think discussing our daily lives and individual feelings more regularly would help. I’ve realized how much we can grow by sharing simple things.

Consultant: Absolutely! Regularly sharing both small daily experiences and deeper feelings can deepen your connection. How confident do you feel about initiating these conversations moving forward? 

User: I feel more confident than before, but I know it will still be a challenge for me.

Consultant: Acknowledging that it’s still a challenge shows self-awareness, which is an important step. Would you like to explore some strategies to help you initiate these conversations?

User: Yes, that would be helpful. I want to create a safe space for both of us.

Consultant: Creating a safe space is essential. We can start by discussing how you might set the right tone. What environment do you think would feel most comfortable for both of you to talk?

User: Maybe during dinner or while watching a show together, when things feel relaxed.

Consultant: Those sound like inviting settings. Besides the environment, what could you say to start a conversation without putting too much pressure on either of you?

User: I could start with asking how his day was and then share something about mine. That feels natural.

Consultant: That’s a lovely approach. Starting with light conversation allows both of you to ease into deeper topics. How would you feel about having a specific moment each week dedicated to these conversations?

User: I think that’s a good idea! It would give us a routine and a sense of expectation.

Consultant: Setting a routine can definitely foster better communication. As you practice this, remember to also check in with each other about how the conversations are impacting your relationship. How does that sound?

User: It sounds great. I can see how feedback can help us adjust and grow.

Consultant: Exactly! Engaging in open feedback can be reassuring and help maintain a positive flow in communication. How do you feel about this new approach you’re planning?

User: I feel hopeful! I’m excited to try these strategies and see how they change our conversations.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Hoping for positive changes can be very motivating. As we wrap up today, what takeaway do you think will stay with you most?

User: I think the importance of creating a safe environment for conversation will stick with me. I see how crucial it is for my marriage.

Consultant: That's a valuable insight. I'm proud of you for recognizing this need. As we continue our sessions, let’s keep working on building these communication strategies. I believe you have the tools to nurture your marriage positively.

User: Thank you! I feel more prepared to tackle our communication issues.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care until then!

User: Thank you! I will. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you today! I hope you’ve been doing well since our last session. How are you feeling now?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty good, actually. I’ve been trying to take small steps to improve the atmosphere at home, and it seems to be helping.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re making progress in creating a positive environment. Can you share what specific actions you’ve taken that you feel have helped?

User: I’ve started having more open conversations with my husband, and I try to express my feelings rather than keeping things bottled up. It feels nice to communicate more freely.

Consultant: Open communication is a significant step toward strengthening your relationship. How has your husband responded to these conversations?

User: He seems to appreciate it. He’s opened up a bit, too, which I didn’t expect. It feels rewarding to connect on that level.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It sounds like you're both creating a space for honesty. How does this new dynamic make you feel?

User: It makes me feel heard and valued. I think I’m more confident now that we can tackle problems together rather than feeling alone.

Consultant: That’s a great feeling! Feeling supported can make a significant difference. Have there been any challenges that you’ve faced while trying to maintain this open communication?

User: Sometimes, I still hold back. I get worried about how my opinions might be received or if I might upset him.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those worries, especially when trying to change communication habits. What do you think might help you feel more at ease when sharing your thoughts?

User: Maybe if I remind myself that it's okay to have differences and that we can discuss them constructively.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! Remembering that differences can be constructive may help you feel more confident. Have you noticed any specific moments when you successfully managed to express your feelings?

User: Yes, just the other day, we talked about our different views on finances, and it went really well. We found a compromise that felt fair.

Consultant: That’s a significant accomplishment! Compromise requires open dialogue and understanding. How does this experience influence your view of addressing other potential issues in your relationship?

User: It gives me hope that we can handle other challenges too. It feels less daunting now, compared to before. 

Consultant: Hope is a powerful emotion! As you continue this journey, how can you ensure that you maintain this momentum in your conversations?

User: I think setting aside time for us to talk without distractions could help a lot. It’s easier when we’re both focused.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical strategy! Creating dedicated time for important discussions can strengthen your communication. How about setting a specific schedule for these conversations?

User: That’s a good idea. Maybe we can do it every Sunday evening. 

Consultant: A weekly check-in sounds excellent! What topics would you like to discuss during these sessions?

User: I guess we could start with our feelings about the week, any stressors, and our goals for the coming days.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re considering both stressors and goals. Talking about feelings can help keep the connection strong. Have you thought about how to encourage each other during these talks?

User: Maybe we could give each other positive feedback or just acknowledge what we’re doing well.

Consultant: Positive reinforcement can significantly impact motivation. How does knowing that you and your husband will support each other in this way make you feel?

User: It makes me feel more secure in our relationship. I think it’ll help reinforce our bond.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! A secure bond can provide both of you with more confidence to face challenges together. How do you feel about the changes you’ve already made in your communication?

User: I feel proud of myself. I’ve noticed a different vibe at home, and I think it’s because I’m being more honest.

Consultant: You have every right to feel proud! Acknowledging your growth is essential. Looking forward, what other changes would you like to make to enhance your relationship and your personal satisfaction?

User: I’d really like to continue working on being more open, but I also want to focus on appreciating the small moments we share together.

Consultant: That sounds like a beautiful plan! Focusing on the small moments can help cultivate a deeper appreciation for your relationship. How might you incorporate more appreciation into your daily life?

User: I could make it a point to express gratitude for little things he does and maybe surprise him with small gestures of kindness.

Consultant: Those are lovely ideas! Small gestures can have a profound effect over time. As we wrap up today’s session, how satisfied are you with the progress you’ve made both personally and in your relationship?

User: I feel quite satisfied! It’s encouraging to see the positive changes. I’m looking forward to continuing this journey.

Consultant: It's been wonderful to see your development! Remember to be gentle with yourself as you grow. If you ever need support, I’m here to help. Would you like to set our next session?

User: Yes, let’s do it! I’m eager to see where this journey takes me.

Consultant: Great! I look forward to our next meeting. Take care and continue nurturing those positive changes.

Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you again! I'm glad to hear that your conversations with your husband have been more positive lately. How are you feeling about everything now?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel pretty good. The open communication with my husband has really helped. I feel more understood and connected, which is nice. But there are still some moments when I doubt myself and our relationship.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that you’re feeling more understood and connected. It’s completely normal to have doubts at times. Can you tell me more about those moments of doubt? What thoughts come to your mind, and how do they make you feel?

User: Well, sometimes I worry that maybe he’s just being nice now, and things might go back to how they were. It makes me anxious, and I question whether I've done enough to really fix our issues.

Consultant: It's understandable to have those anxious thoughts, especially after working hard to improve your relationship. It sounds like you worry it might revert to the past. When those thoughts arise, can you identify any specific feelings or physical sensations that accompany them?

User: I often feel a tightness in my chest and I get a bit restless. It’s like I’m waiting for something bad to happen, even when things are good. I wish I could just enjoy this moment without worrying.

Consultant: That tightness can be quite uncomfortable. It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of anxiety about the future, which makes it difficult to enjoy the present. Have you noticed any patterns in these thoughts—like specific triggers or situations that tend to bring them up?

User: Yes, when we talk about our future together, I sometimes feel that tightening again. It’s like I want to plan and be optimistic, but then I remember our past struggles, and it dampens my mood.

Consultant: Planning for the future can definitely bring up those past experiences. It might help to explore what specific thoughts come up during those conversations. What negative beliefs about yourself or your relationship are you recognizing in those moments?

User: I guess I often think that I’m not capable of maintaining happiness or that I’m destined to fail in our relationship, especially if we face any challenges again. 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy. Let’s take a moment to challenge those beliefs. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts the idea that you’re not capable of maintaining happiness? 

User: I suppose I have been happier lately, especially with how we’ve been communicating. But I keep thinking about the tough times we had before, which makes me doubt my ability to keep things good.

Consultant: It's encouraging that you've experienced happiness recently. Remember, growth often comes with ups and downs. If you were to view those past challenges as part of your journey rather than proof of failure, how might that change your perspective?

User: That’s a good point. I suppose those challenges taught me more about how to communicate better. It feels wrong to only focus on the negatives when I can see how far we've come.

Consultant: Exactly! Emphasizing progress rather than perfection can be empowering. Now, let’s focus on some actions you can take to reinforce this positive change. Are there activities or practices that can help you continue strengthening your relationship and your self-belief?

User: I think keeping up with our regular check-ins would help. They have been so beneficial for both of us! Maybe I could also start journaling my feelings to track changes and emotions better.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful strategies! Regular check-ins can help maintain that open communication, and journaling can be an effective way to process your emotions. How do you feel about incorporating these practices into your routine?

User: I feel excited about trying them! I think it’ll help keep me grounded and aware of our progress.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Keeping a positive focus on your journey will certainly support you. As we wrap up today's session, how would you summarize the key takeaways from our conversation?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is that I can acknowledge my progress, focus on the positives, and find ways to keep strengthening my relationship. I also learned that it’s okay to have doubts but not to let them take over.

Consultant: That’s such an insightful realization! You've made tremendous strides in understanding and managing your thoughts and feelings. Before we finish, what strategies do you feel you can rely on if doubts arise in the future?

User: I can remind myself of the progress we've made and talk to my husband about my feelings instead of letting them fester. I also think journaling can give me a clearer perspective.

Consultant: Those sound like solid strategies! Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s okay to seek support along the way. This session has shown great progress, and I'm confident you'll continue to thrive. If you ever feel the need to talk again, I’m here for you.

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your support and guidance. I feel more equipped to handle my thoughts now. 

Consultant: It’s been a pleasure working with you. I’m excited for your continued progress. Take care, and I look forward to seeing how things evolve for you on your journey!
