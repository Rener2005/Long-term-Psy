Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today, Li. How are you feeling about everything as we start this session?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really anxious lately, especially after being rejected from a job interview. It makes me feel useless, and I can’t seem to shake off this stress. 

Consultant: I’m sorry to hear that. It's understandable to feel this way after experiencing rejection. Let's talk a little about the thoughts you're having. What was going through your mind right after the interview?

User: I just kept thinking that I'm not good enough, and that I'll never find a job. It feels like I’m a failure.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts made you feel quite overwhelmed. Can you identify how those thoughts affected your emotions in that moment?

User: Absolutely. I felt really down and anxious, like a knot in my stomach. I couldn't sleep well after that, and my head hurt a lot.

Consultant: That’s a tough combination to deal with. It seems like the rejection triggered not just anxiety but also physical symptoms. Let’s focus on that thought—"I’m not good enough." What evidence do you have that supports this belief?

User: Well, I didn’t get the job, and I feel like everyone else is moving ahead while I’m stuck here. 

Consultant: It’s natural to feel discouraged by one setback, but is it possible that this one experience doesn’t define your overall worth or capabilities? 

User: I guess so, but it’s hard to believe that right now.

Consultant: Of course, it can be very difficult to shift that perspective. If a friend were in your position, how would you advise them? What might you say to help them see things differently?

User: I would probably tell them that one rejection doesn’t mean they’re worthless and that they have other chances to apply elsewhere. 

Consultant: That’s a really compassionate way to view it. Let’s try to apply that same kindness to yourself. How can we reframe your thoughts about this situation to be more supportive?

User: Maybe I could focus on the skills I have rather than just this one failure. 

Consultant: That's a great start! What skills or qualities do you possess that you can emphasize moving forward? 

User: I’m good at teamwork and have some technical skills from my studies. 

Consultant: Those are valuable assets! Recognizing your strengths can be a powerful way to boost your confidence. How can we incorporate those strengths into your job search going forward?

User: I could highlight those skills in my applications and maybe even practice interviewing to be more confident.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing interviews will help. As for your focus on teamwork, perhaps you could seek opportunities where collaboration is essential. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good, I feel a little better thinking about that.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s important to build upon those positive thoughts. Now, apart from work-related thoughts, how have you been managing your sleep and physical symptoms?

User: Not well. I often lie awake at night, and even when I do sleep, it’s not restful. 

Consultant: Sleep disturbances can definitely compound feelings of anxiety. What do you think might help create a more calming environment for you at bedtime?

User: I’ve heard that relaxation techniques can help, but I’ve never really tried them.

Consultant: Relaxation techniques can indeed be beneficial. Would you be open to learning some simple methods to help ease your mind before sleep?

User: Yes, I’d like to try that! 

Consultant: Fantastic! We can practice some deep breathing exercises together. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a moment, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. How does that feel when you do it? 

User: I feel a little more at ease already.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Practicing this regularly can promote relaxation. How about creating a nightly routine that includes deep breathing and perhaps some calming music or reading?

User: That could help me unwind better.

Consultant: Yes, establishing a routine can signal your body that it’s time to relax. What other activities can you include in this routine that might relax you?

User: Maybe some light stretching or even a warm shower.

Consultant: Those are great suggestions! Light stretching can help release tension in your body. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s highlight some key steps you can take moving forward to address your anxiety and improve your confidence.

User: I will try to reframe my negative thoughts, practice relaxation techniques, and focus on my strengths in my job applications.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Li! Remember, it’s about taking small steps and being kind to yourself. How do you feel about the progress we made today?

User: I feel a bit hopeful and more equipped to handle things now. 

Consultant: That's excellent to hear! As we conclude our session today, if you ever feel overwhelmed again, remember the strategies we've discussed. You're on a positive path. Whenever you're ready for the next session, I'll be here to support you.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you're here for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. I'm still feeling quite anxious, especially with graduation approaching. The job search has been tough, and I often feel like I'm not good enough. 

Consultant: It sounds like the pressure of finding a job is really weighing on you. Can you share a bit more about what specifically makes you feel inadequate during this time?

User: I just think about how many people are competing for the same positions, and I keep questioning my skills and whether I'll ever be successful.

Consultant: I can see how that would be overwhelming. You're in a situation where you feel surrounded by competition, and it's natural to doubt your abilities. Have you had any thoughts that seem to come up repeatedly when you feel this way?

User: Yes, I often think that I'm going to fail, that I won't be able to find a job, and then my family will be disappointed in me.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Li. The fear of failure and disappointing your family can create a lot of pressure. Let's explore these thoughts a little deeper. When you think, "I am going to fail," what feelings does that bring up for you?

User: It makes me feel really anxious and helpless. I just want to hide away and not deal with any of it.

Consultant: It’s understandable to want to avoid such painful feelings. However, avoidance often perpetuates anxiety. Let's try to challenge that thought for a moment. What evidence do you have that you will fail? 

User: I guess I don't have solid proof. I've had some interviews, but I keep thinking the worst. 

Consultant: That's an important realization. It seems your thoughts might be leaning towards the worst-case scenario. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their chances of success?

User: I'd probably tell them that they should keep trying and not be so hard on themselves.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s interesting how we can be more compassionate to others than to ourselves. Can we start practicing that kindness towards yourself? What would a more balanced thought look like for you?

User: Maybe something like, "It's okay if I don’t get every job. I can keep improving and learning from each experience."

Consultant: That’s a great shift! Recognizing that each experience is a learning opportunity is powerful. How does it feel to think that way instead?

User: It feels a bit relieving. I think it could help reduce some pressure.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let’s build on this. What steps can you take this week to reinforce this new perspective?

User: I could practice going to interviews without putting too much pressure on myself to succeed right away. 

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan. Focusing on the process rather than just the outcome can help ease some anxiety. Are there any activities that make you feel better when you're stressed?

User: I like listening to music and going for walks, but recently I've been too anxious to do even those simple things.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way when you're anxious. How about we set a small, achievable goal for you this week? Perhaps a 10-minute walk or listening to your favorite song?

User: I think I can manage a short walk. It might help clear my mind.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect start! Walking can not only help with anxiety but also give you a break from the stress. Let’s also think about how you can remind yourself of your strengths—what are some things you’re proud of?

User: I guess I’m good at coming up with creative ideas and I’ve received praise for my projects in school.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strengths, Li! Creating a list of your achievements and positive feedback might be useful. You can refer back to it when you’re feeling uncertain. How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful. I could use that as a reminder when I start doubting myself.

Consultant: Great! You’re on the right track. Before we finish today, let’s talk about how you might prepare mentally for the challenges ahead. What tools or strategies do you think could help manage your anxiety during this transition?

User: Maybe some breathing exercises or mindfulness techniques to calm down when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Absolutely! Breathing exercises and mindfulness can be incredibly effective. Would you like to try a simple technique together now?

User: Sure, I’d like that.

Consultant: Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a moment, and then slowly breathe out through your mouth. Let’s do that a few times together. 

User: [Practices] Okay, I feel a bit calmer.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You can use this technique whenever you’re feeling anxious. Remember, it’s all about taking small, manageable steps. As we wrap up today, what key takeaways do you have?

User: I think I need to practice self-compassion and remember that it’s okay to make mistakes. And maybe take it one step at a time.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway, Li. Remember, you’re making progress. I look forward to seeing how you apply these insights next time we meet. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful and ready to try some new strategies.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s good to see you leaving with a sense of hope. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to our next conversation.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really anxious, especially after getting rejected in my recent job interviews. It’s making me doubt my abilities, and I can't seem to shake off this feeling of being useless.

Consultant: It sounds like these rejections have really affected your self-esteem and overall mood. Let's start by exploring what you're experiencing. Could you share more about your feelings after these interviews?

User: Well, after each rejection, I just feel more and more discouraged. I start thinking that maybe I’m not cut out for this kind of work, and it just spirals down from there. I can’t focus on anything else, and I keep second-guessing myself.

Consultant: I can see how that cycle of thoughts can be really overwhelming. When you think about not being cut out for this work, how does that make you feel emotionally?

User: It makes me feel really anxious, and sometimes I even get physically sick, like having stomachaches or headaches. I just feel lost and don't know how to approach my job search anymore.

Consultant: That sounds quite stressful, Li. It’s tough to cope with both the emotional and physical symptoms of anxiety. Can we take a moment to identify some of the specific thoughts that come to your mind when you experience these feelings? What exactly are you telling yourself during these moments?

User: I often think, "I'm not good enough." Or, "I'll never find a job." It’s like I am my own worst enemy.

Consultant: Those thoughts you're having seem quite harsh. Can we challenge that thinking a bit? What evidence do you have that supports those statements about yourself?

User: I guess I don't have much evidence except for the rejections. It feels like they confirm my fears.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but let’s think about it differently. Have there been times in your life when you've succeeded or received positive feedback, regardless of these recent outcomes?

User: Yes, I did well in school and had some positive feedback during my internships. But still, it feels different. 

Consultant: Absolutely, those achievements are significant! Let’s focus on them. What if we reframed your thoughts? Instead of “I’m not good enough,” how about something like, “I have succeeded before, and I can improve with practice”? 

User: That sounds better. I can see how that might help me feel a bit more confident. 

Consultant: Great! Confidence often builds over time with practice and positive reinforcement. Now, let’s talk about some small steps you could take to continue on this path. Can you think of any small action that might help you feel more prepared for your next interview?

User: I could maybe practice some interview questions with a friend. It might help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Practicing with a friend can make you more comfortable and boost your confidence. How about planning that for the upcoming week?

User: Yeah, I’ll reach out to a friend and set that up.

Consultant: Fantastic! And while you’re preparing, let’s also talk about managing the anxiety that comes up. When you start to feel overwhelmed, what are some strategies you think might help calm those nerves?

User: I’ve heard about deep breathing and maybe taking short walks to clear my mind. 

Consultant: Those are very effective strategies. Let’s make a plan for you to incorporate them daily. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I think I can manage that.

Consultant: I believe in your ability to implement these changes! Remember, it’s a process, and you’re already taking important steps. As we continue our sessions, we’ll keep focusing on building your self-esteem and tackling any negative thoughts. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful now, and I'm eager to work on these strategies.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. It’s a positive shift! As we wrap up our session today, what do you think is your main takeaway or goal for the next week?

User: I want to be more proactive in practicing interviewing and really challenge my negative thoughts. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember to be kind to yourself through this process. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. You’ve got this, Li!

User: Thanks so much! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome. Take care, and I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling a bit better. I attended the social skills training, and I think it helped me feel a bit more comfortable in social situations. But I still have some lingering anxiety about job interviews.

Consultant: That's great to hear that you're feeling a bit better and finding the training helpful! Let's talk more about that anxiety regarding job interviews. What are some specific thoughts or feelings that come up for you when you think about interviews?

User: Well, when I think about the interviews, I often feel like I'm not good enough or that I won't be able to answer the questions properly. It makes me feel really tense and anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure from those thoughts about not being good enough. Can you remember a particular time during the training or elsewhere when you felt that way? What thoughts were running through your head at that moment?

User: Yes, during the mock interviews in the training, I felt nervous and kept thinking that I would embarrass myself. I was terrified of forgetting my answers.

Consultant: That must have been really challenging for you. It's common to feel nervous in those situations. What emotions did that thinking bring up for you during the mock interviews?

User: I felt a wave of anxiety and I could feel my hands getting cold. I was really uncomfortable and just wanted to escape the situation.

Consultant: I can imagine how overwhelming that felt. When you think about those interviews, do you notice any cognitive distortions, like perhaps jumping to conclusions or putting yourself down?

User: Yes, I often think things like, "I'll definitely mess up" or "There's no way they'll pick me." It feels like I'm just setting myself up for failure.

Consultant: It looks like you’re being really hard on yourself and jumping to the worst-case scenario. What evidence do you have that supports these thoughts, and are there any counterexamples where things went better than you expected?

User: Well, I did pretty well in group discussions, and people told me I expressed my ideas clearly. But when I think about interviews, I suddenly doubt myself.

Consultant: Those are great examples of when you communicated well! Let's challenge that self-doubt a bit. If a friend were in your shoes and expressed those same negative thoughts about interviews, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably say they’re capable and to focus on their strengths instead of the negatives. 

Consultant: That's a very supportive perspective! Let's take that advice and apply it to yourself. How can you remind yourself of your strengths during an interview to alleviate some of that anxiety?

User: I can make a list of my achievements and skills to remind myself of them before an interview. That might help boost my confidence.

Consultant: That's an excellent strategy! Creating a list of your strengths can serve as a powerful reminder. Alongside that, how about we practice a couple of common interview questions together to help you feel more prepared?

User: Sure, that sounds helpful! I often freeze up during the "tell me about yourself" question.

Consultant: Let's role-play that question. When you think about introducing yourself, what are some key points you'd like the interviewer to know about you?

User: I want them to know about my studies, my interest in this field, and maybe mention my participation in the social skills training.

Consultant: That's a great start! Let’s try it out: Try to introduce yourself just as if I were the interviewer. 

User: Okay, here goes. “Hello, my name is Li. I’m a third-year student majoring in … and I'm really passionate about… Recently, I’ve been working on my social skills to boost my confidence in networking and interviews.”

Consultant: Very well done, Li! You came across as confident and engaging. How did you feel while saying that?

User: I felt a bit nervous, but it was nice to hear myself say it out loud. It felt empowering.

Consultant: That's a positive feeling to hold onto! We can gradually build on those positive experiences. Going forward, how do you want to prepare for the upcoming interviews?

User: I want to practice these introductions more and also try calming techniques before interviews, like deep breathing.

Consultant: Those sound like solid plans! Practicing your introduction will enhance your confidence, and deep breathing can help reduce anxiety. As we wrap up today, what do you think is the most important takeaway from our session?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is to focus on my strengths and practice speaking about them, while also managing my anxiety levels beforehand. 

Consultant: Absolutely, Li! You're making significant progress. Remember, challenges are part of growth, and you're well equipped to handle them. How do you feel about our next steps?

User: I feel more confident about tackling interviews now. I’m looking forward to working on these strategies!

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Next time we meet, we can discuss how the preparations and practice went for you. Remember, you’re doing great work. I look forward to our next session!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. See you next time!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li! Take care until then.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you again. Last time we talked about the positive feedback you received during your mock interview and how it helped build your confidence. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better, thanks. I still get anxious thinking about job interviews, but I feel like I can handle it better now. I want to keep that confidence going, though.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you're feeling a bit better and that your confidence has improved! Let’s explore how you can maintain and further develop that confidence. What specific situations make you feel anxious still when thinking about interviews?

User: I think it’s mainly the fear of not being good enough. Even though I did well in the mock interview, I worry that I won’t be able to perform the same way in real ones.

Consultant: That’s a common concern, Li. It sounds like there’s still a part of you questioning your abilities. Can you recall any specific thoughts that come to mind when you worry about not being good enough?

User: I often think, “What if they find out I’m not qualified enough?” or “I’m just going to embarrass myself again.” 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite intense. Let’s take a moment to understand how those thoughts impact your emotions. When you think that way, how does it make you feel?

User: It makes me feel really anxious and, to be honest, a bit defeated. Sometimes I just want to give up looking for jobs because of it.

Consultant: It sounds really tough to feel that way, especially after putting in so much effort. Let’s challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you’re not qualified enough?

User: Well, I didn’t get the last job I interviewed for… but I also did get positive feedback from the mock interview.

Consultant: Right! You did get positive feedback, which shows that you are capable. It’s important to remember those moments. What would you say to a friend who was feeling the same way you are? 

User: I’d probably tell them to focus on their strengths and remember their successes.

Consultant: Exactly! Let’s try to apply that to your situation. Instead of dwelling on what could go wrong, focus on what you did well. Can we create a list of your strengths and accomplishments to remind you of what you bring to the table?

User: That could help. I just worry it won’t be enough.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to have those worries, but focusing on your strengths can empower you. Let’s reflect on your recent successes together. What do you see as your top three strengths or accomplishments from your experiences so far?

User: I think I’m a good communicator, I’m dedicated, and I’m willing to learn. I also helped my friend practice for her interview, and she got the job!

Consultant: Those are fantastic qualities, Li! It’s awesome that you were able to help your friend succeed too. This shows that you understand the interview process and can support others. How can you remind yourself of these strengths before your next interview?

User: Maybe I could keep a notebook with those reminders and read it before the interviews.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Having that tangible reminder can help shift your focus. Let’s also talk about how you can practice managing anxiety in the moment. Do you have any strategies you currently use when you start feeling anxious?

User: Usually, I just try to distract myself with music or videos.

Consultant: Distraction can be helpful, but we can also explore other techniques to help you face the anxiety directly. Would you be open to trying some relaxation techniques like deep breathing or visualization before your interviews?

User: I’d be willing to try deep breathing. 

Consultant: Great choice! Deep breathing can help ground you in those moments of anxiety. Let’s practice a quick deep breathing exercise together now. Inhale deeply for four counts, hold for four counts, and exhale for four counts. Ready?

User: Okay. (inhales, holds, exhales) That feels calming.

Consultant: It’s good to hear that! You can use this technique whenever you start feeling anxious. Keeping it accessible will make it easier to implement when you need it. As we wrap up today, how are you feeling about the strategies we discussed?

User: I feel more hopeful. Listing my strengths and practicing the breathing can really help.

Consultant: That's a positive shift! How will you ensure you integrate these strategies into your routine before interviews?

User: I’ll try to set time aside to practice my breathing and review my strengths regularly.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Li. It’s all about building those habits to support your confidence. Let’s continue to work on these skills in our next session. Remember, you’ve made great progress, and you're capable.  

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today and feel more ready to tackle my next steps. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m proud of you for taking steps to build your confidence. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you again. I'm looking forward to our session today. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi, I've been feeling much better. My anxiety has lessened a bit, and I'm starting to feel more hopeful about the future, especially after submitting those job applications.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some progress, especially with the job applications. How did you feel after submitting them?

User: Honestly, it felt good to finally take that step. I had been nervous about it, but now there's a sense of accomplishment, which is nice.

Consultant: That sense of accomplishment is really important. It seems like you're beginning to build confidence in your abilities. What specific thoughts or feelings come to mind when you think about your future employment now?

User: I feel more positive than before; I believe something good might happen. But I still have moments of doubt, wondering if I'll find a job that suits me.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those doubts. You've taken a significant step forward, and that can bring both hope and anxiety. Can you share what specifically triggers those moments of doubt for you?

User: I think it’s mostly the fear of rejection or not being good enough. I worry about competing with so many candidates.

Consultant: I understand. Those thoughts can be tough to manage. When those feelings arise, how do you usually cope with them?

User: I try to distract myself by watching movies or playing games, but deep down, the anxiety doesn’t really go away.

Consultant: Distractions can provide temporary relief, but they won't necessarily address the underlying feelings. Let's explore those thoughts about being "not good enough" a bit more. What evidence do you have to support this belief?

User: I guess I don't have strong evidence; it's just something that has been there for a long time. It feels like I’m not living up to expectations.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization. It's important to recognize that many of our negative thoughts don’t have a solid basis. If a friend were in your position, what would you say to them?

User: I would probably tell them they’re doing their best and to keep trying. I’d encourage them to look at their achievements.

Consultant: Great insight! You're offering support to a friend that you might not give to yourself. Let's try to flip that around. What would it be like for you to acknowledge your accomplishments and give yourself the same encouragement?

User: It feels strange, but also freeing. I guess I should remind myself of what I have achieved.

Consultant: Exactly! It's about acknowledging your growth and progress. Can we identify some specific achievements or strengths that you can remind yourself of when those self-doubts arise?

User: Well, I successfully completed my degree, and I’ve submitted those job applications. I’ve always been good at learning quickly.

Consultant: Those are significant achievements! Celebrating those can help reinforce your self-esteem. Let's work on a strategy together for when you start to feel that self-doubt creeping in. How about writing down your achievements and celebrating them regularly?

User: I think that could help. Writing things down makes it feel more real.

Consultant: That's a great approach! Regularly reminding yourself of your strengths and successes can help counteract negative thoughts. It might also help to develop a routine for managing stress. What are some activities you enjoy that could help you relax?

User: I enjoy going for walks and listening to music. Sometimes, I even like to sketch.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful activities! Engaging in those regularly can significantly help with reducing stress and anxiety. How about setting a goal to incorporate at least one of these activities into your weekly routine?

User: I can definitely try that! Maybe I can sketch a few times a week as a way to unwind.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Remember, self-care is essential, especially during transitions like this. Let's summarize what we've talked about today. You’ve recognized your progress, identified your achievements, and committed to incorporating some relaxing activities into your routine. How do you feel about that?

User: I feel optimistic. This session has been really helpful in clarifying things for me.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up, it's essential to remember the progress you’ve made and the strategies we've discussed. Keep nurturing that self-efficacy and prioritize your well-being. If you ever feel overwhelmed again, don't hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your support and insights. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I believe in your ability to handle whatever challenges come your way. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
