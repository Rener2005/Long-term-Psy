Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm glad you're here for our session today. I want to start by acknowledging what you've been through recently. How have you been feeling after the surgery?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really sad and lost. The whole experience has been overwhelming, and I still can’t believe my baby is gone. It just hurts so much, and I feel angry and helpless.

Consultant: I can only imagine how painful and difficult this time is for you. It's understandable to have those feelings after such a significant loss. Can you tell me more about what you’re experiencing day-to-day?

User: Well, I often find myself crying and thinking about what could have been. I feel a deep sense of grief, and it just seems to be creeping up on me at unexpected moments. Plus, things have been tense with my in-laws since the surgery.

Consultant: It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of overwhelming emotions and also a challenging family dynamic. It’s important to acknowledge your grief, but also to find ways to express it. What kind of support would you hope for from your family during this time?

User: I wish they would just understand how I feel and maybe offer some comfort instead of making things awkward. I feel guilty, like I’m burdening them.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel that way, especially after a loss. You’re not a burden; your feelings are valid. We can explore some ways to communicate your needs to them. Have you thought about what you would want to convey to your in-laws?

User: I want them to know I'm hurting and that I need them to be patient with me. But I just can't find the right words. It feels so difficult.

Consultant: Communication can indeed be tough, especially during such a sensitive time. Perhaps we can start by identifying some specific feelings you want to express. Would it help if we practiced how you might share these with them?

User: Yes, that might help. I think I want to say something like I'm still processing everything and need their support.

Consultant: That’s a great start! You could also express that you’re not ready to talk about everything yet but would appreciate their understanding. How do you think they might react to that?

User: I hope they would be supportive and give me space if I ask for it. I just don’t want them to feel like I'm pushing them away.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re trying to balance your needs with their feelings, which is really thoughtful. Remember, it’s okay to put your feelings first. We can work on how to set those boundaries with compassion. What has been challenging about this relationship for you?

User: Sometimes I feel they don’t really understand what I’m going through. They seem to want to move on quickly, while I’m still stuck in this sadness.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, and it’s understandable to feel that way. It can be helpful to communicate that healing takes time, and you’re not ready to rush through it. Would you be open to sharing your perspective with them about the time you need?

User: Yes, I think that would be good. But I’m still scared. What if they don't get it?

Consultant: It's natural to worry about their reaction. You might consider approaching the conversation gently, letting them know how important their support is to you right now. How would it feel to know that they may need some time to understand too?

User: I suppose that might help to think about it that way. It might make it a bit easier to talk to them.

Consultant: Exactly! Remember, this is about your feelings, and it’s okay to express those. You deserve that support, especially when you're dealing with such a significant loss. Have you been able to express any of these feelings to someone else?

User: Not really. I feel embarrassed. It’s like I don’t want to burden my friends either. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but remember that friends often want to support you. Maybe you could reach out to someone you trust and share a little; it might help lighten some of the emotional weight. Would that be something you might consider?

User: Yes, I think I could try that. Maybe just sending a message would be a start.

Consultant: That sounds like a great first step! Small steps can lead to feeling more connected. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: A bit nervous but also relieved at the thought of not keeping everything bottled up anymore.

Consultant: That’s a positive response! It’s okay to feel nervous; it shows that you care about your feelings and relationships. We can work on strategies to help you with the nerves and how to stay grounded while you share your experiences. What techniques do you think might help you feel calmer?

User: I guess I could try some deep breathing before I reach out. I’ve heard it can help.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a fantastic tool to manage anxiety! Let’s practice a simple technique together so you feel more comfortable using it. How about taking a slow breath in for four counts, holding it for four, and then exhaling for four? Would you like to try that?

User: Sure, that sounds good. I’ll give it a shot.

Consultant: Great! Let’s try it together. Inhale… 1, 2, 3, 4. Hold… 1, 2, 3, 4. Now exhale… 1, 2, 3, 4. How did that feel?

User: It was relaxing. I think I could use that when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You can make it a new habit to help you manage those feelings before conversations. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we've discussed and the steps you’d like to take moving forward.

User: So, I’ll try to communicate my needs to my in-laws, maybe practice some deep breathing, and also reach out to a friend. 

Consultant: Yes, that sounds like a solid plan! You’re taking important steps to express your feelings, and I’m here to support you as you navigate this. Remember, it’s okay to take your time. Do you feel a little better about things now?

User: Yes, I do. Thank you for your help; it feels good to talk things through.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Chen! Remember, it’s okay to seek support whenever you need it. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you at our next session.

Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling overwhelmed. The pressure from my in-laws has been really intense since the procedure. I can’t shake off this feeling of guilt.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of emotional turmoil, especially with the added pressure from your in-laws. Could you share more about what specifically has been bothering you lately?

User: Well, my in-laws keep bringing up the topic, and it feels like they don’t understand how hard this has been for me. I feel guilty for the decision I made, even though I know it was necessary.

Consultant: That makes sense. You’re caught between your own feelings of grief and the pressure from your family, which is incredibly challenging. Let’s explore what thoughts run through your mind when they bring it up. What do you typically think or feel in those moments?

User: I usually think that they must blame me or think I’m a bad person. I feel like I'm failing as a daughter-in-law because I couldn’t give them the grandchild they wanted.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really internalizing their expectations, which is making you feel worse. Can you tell me how these thoughts affect your emotions? 

User: They make me feel more anxious and depressed. I end up withdrawing from conversations, which doesn’t help the situation at all.

Consultant: It's understandable to want to avoid that discomfort. However, avoiding these conversations might be causing more tension. What if we could try to express your feelings in a way that feels safe for you? 

User: I’d like that, but I’m not sure how to approach it without feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: We can work on that together. Let’s break it down. What would you want to say to your in-laws if you felt completely comfortable? 

User: I think I’d want to explain how painful this experience has been for me and that I just need time to heal.

Consultant: That’s a powerful start. Communicating your feelings could help them understand your perspective better. Would it help if we practiced how to express that? 

User: Yes, practicing would definitely help. I get really scared when I think about talking to them.

Consultant: Let’s role-play that situation. I can be your mother-in-law, and you can practice sharing your feelings. How does that sound?

User: Okay, sounds good. I’ll try to tell you how I feel.

Consultant: Great! Whenever you're ready, go ahead.

User: "I know you’ve been looking forward to having a grandchild. I want you to understand that this decision was really hard for me and I’m still upset about it."

Consultant: That’s a solid start! It’s honest and clear. How did saying that out loud make you feel?

User: A little bit relieved, but also anxious about their reaction.

Consultant: Feeling relieved is a good sign. You’re opening up, which is a positive step. What could you remind yourself about their potential reactions that might help ease your anxiety?

User: I guess they could surprise me and be more understanding than I expect. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s possible they’ll show support, which is important to consider. Would you like to try another part of the conversation?

User: Sure! After I say that, I want to express that I need space to heal.

Consultant: Let’s continue. Go ahead.

User: "I also need some time to heal. I hope you can understand that this is tough for me."

Consultant: That’s excellent! You’re establishing a boundary while being honest. How do you feel about this part?

User: I feel stronger saying it. It’s like I’m reclaiming my voice a bit.

Consultant: That's a wonderful feeling to have! Not only are you expressing your needs, but also taking control of the conversation. How do you think practicing this will affect your interactions with them moving forward? 

User: I hope I can communicate better and not feel so overwhelmed or guilty.

Consultant: That’s definitely a strong aim. As you express your feelings, it may help in reducing that guilt over time. Would you want to try writing down these expressions? 

User: Yes, writing it down could help me remember what to say when the time comes.

Consultant: That's a practical approach! Bring those notes with you to help guide your conversation when you're ready. How are you feeling about our progress today?

User: I feel somewhat hopeful. Practicing really helped. It makes it easier to face them now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Chen! Remember, you’ve taken significant steps toward expressing your feelings. How do you plan to carry this momentum into your upcoming conversations?

User: I’ll keep practicing what I want to say, and I’ll try to remind myself that it’s okay to feel the way I do.

Consultant: Sounds like a solid plan! Reflecting on this will allow you to remain centered, even when the discussions get tough. If you ever feel overwhelmed, we can always revisit these strategies together.

User: Thank you. I appreciate your support—it really helps to talk through things.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. As we wrap up today, do you feel there is anything else you want to address before our next session?

User: Not right now, I think I just need to process everything we’ve talked about.

Consultant: That's perfectly fine. Processing can take time. I'm here if you need to share more in our next session. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing how you progress!

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to our next talk too.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been trying to get back into the routine of running my hair salon, but I still feel a lot of emotional ups and downs. It's affecting my work, and I want to find a way to feel more stable.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're making an effort to adapt, but those emotional fluctuations are still challenging. Can you tell me more about what specific emotions you’ve been experiencing? 

User: Sometimes I feel really sad and overwhelmed, especially when I think about what happened with my pregnancy. Other times, I feel frustrated at work because I can’t focus or keep up with everything.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way after such a significant event. Those emotions can really impact your focus and work performance. Have there been any particular moments at work that triggered these feelings recently?

User: Yes, just yesterday, I had a client who was really chatty about their own pregnancy, and it hit me hard. I felt so envious and upset that I just couldn’t continue our conversation.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Chen. It's natural to feel those emotions when reminded of your own experience. In those moments, what kind of thoughts or beliefs crossed your mind?

User: I kept thinking that I should be happy for others, but instead, I felt bitter and guilty about my feelings. It’s like a cycle that I can’t escape from.

Consultant: It seems like you're caught in a cycle of guilt and bitterness, which is a common reaction. Let's take a moment to identify some of these thoughts. Can you recall the specific thought that triggered your feelings of bitterness during that conversation?

User: I thought, “Why can’t I have that happiness?” and “I should be stronger and handle this better.” 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very heavy to carry. Let’s examine them together. How much evidence do you think supports those thoughts? Are there any alternative interpretations you could consider?

User: I don’t know… Maybe it’s okay to feel sad and not just push through it? It's just hard to accept.

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s completely valid to feel sad, especially about something so important. What if we tried replacing the thought "I should be stronger" with something a bit softer, like "It’s okay to feel this way right now"? How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds easier to accept. I guess I don’t always have to be strong, do I?

Consultant: Exactly! Strength can also mean allowing yourself to feel your emotions without judgment. How do you think this shift in thinking could change your emotional state moving forward?

User: I think it might help me give myself a break from the pressure. Maybe I won’t feel so bad about having those feelings. 

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step. Now, let’s talk about some strategies you can implement when those feelings arise at work. Can you think of any activities or coping mechanisms that you find comforting?

User: I usually enjoy listening to music or taking short breaks when I feel overwhelmed. 

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Incorporating music or short breaks can help you reset when you start feeling those waves of emotion. How about we create a plan for when you face triggers at work?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful. I could take a five-minute break to listen to a calming song when I feel anxious.

Consultant: Great! That could really help you recenter yourself. Let’s also think about ways to express your emotions in a safe space. Is there someone you trust that you could talk to about how you’re feeling?

User: I have a close friend I might reach out to, but I'm worried they wouldn't understand.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel apprehensive. However, sharing your feelings with someone you trust can be very healing. You could even let them know that you’re trying to process some emotions related to your pregnancy. How do you feel about trying that?

User: I think that would be okay. It would be good to talk to someone who cares.

Consultant: Absolutely! It can help alleviate some of the emotional burden. Let’s also recap what you’ve taken from today’s session. What do you think your biggest takeaway is regarding your feelings?

User: I need to allow myself to feel sad without guilt and have some strategies in place to deal with those emotions at work.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization, Chen! Taking this step of self-acceptance is crucial. As we conclude this session, how do you plan to implement these strategies in the coming days?

User: I’ll focus on being kinder to myself and take breaks when needed. I’ll also try to reach out to my friend.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s okay to ask for support when you need it. You’ve made excellent progress today and I'm here whenever you need assistance. 

User: Thank you, I really appreciate that! I feel a bit more hopeful now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Chen! I’m glad to hear that. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Chen. I'm glad to see you today. Last time, we talked about your feelings regarding your pregnancy and the recent decision you made. How have you been feeling since then? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better thanks to my sisters' support. But there are still moments when I find it hard to cope with everything that's happening around me.

Consultant: It's great to hear that your sisters have been supportive. It sounds like you're navigating some tough emotions. Can you tell me more about these moments and what triggers them?

User: Sometimes, I just feel overwhelmed with sadness and uncertainty. I think about the future and it scares me. 

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way given the circumstances. It seems like the uncertainty you're facing is quite heavy on your mind. When those thoughts come up, what specific thoughts do you notice running through your mind?

User: I often think, "What if I can't handle this?" or "What if I never feel happy again?" 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really challenging to deal with. They suggest a fear of not being able to cope in the future. Can you share with me how those thoughts make you feel in the moment?

User: They make me feel anxious and helpless, like I am stuck and don’t know how to move forward. 

Consultant: Feeling anxious and helpless can be very tough. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. Do you think there is any evidence that supports the belief that you won't be able to handle this?

User: Not really. I mean, I've dealt with tough situations before, but those specific thoughts just take over sometimes.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. It’s good to acknowledge that you have coped with difficulties in the past. What if you tried to reframe those thoughts? Could there be other ways to look at your situation?

User: I suppose I could think, "I have support from my family," or "It's okay to feel sad; it doesn't mean I won't be happy again." 

Consultant: Those are excellent alternative thoughts! They emphasize your support system and validate your feelings rather than dismiss them. How does considering those thoughts make you feel?

User: It makes me feel a bit more hopeful and less confined by negativity. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful shift! Hopefulness can be a powerful motivator. What steps can you take today to embrace these new ways of thinking and integrate them into your daily life?

User: I think I could start journaling about my feelings and the positive thoughts I come up with. 

Consultant: Journaling sounds like a great idea! It can help you articulate your feelings and track your progress. Would you set aside a specific time each day to spend on journaling?

User: Yes, I could try to do it every evening before bed. 

Consultant: Perfect! That will give you a chance to reflect on your day. Alongside that, are there any activities you enjoy that could also help lift your spirits and reduce anxiety?

User: I like painting. I find it relaxing and a good way to express myself. 

Consultant: Painting could be a wonderful outlet for your emotions! Integrating something you love into your routine is crucial for emotional well-being. Would you commit to setting aside time for painting this week?

User: Absolutely! I’ll try to do it a couple of times. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan. As you continue this week, remember to check in with those thoughts we discussed. It’s about building a habit of recognizing and reframing your thoughts. 

User: I will. I will also keep an eye on how I’m feeling throughout the week.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! It will help you stay mindful of your emotional journey. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel you have gained from our conversation?

User: I feel more equipped to handle my thoughts and emotions. I know I can reframe my perspective and that it’s okay to seek joy amidst everything.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Embracing positive perspectives can lead to personal growth. Moving forward, keep practicing those self-dialogues. You’re doing great, and remember, I'm here to support you whenever you need it.

User: Thank you for your support! I appreciate our time together.

Consultant: Thank you, Chen. Don’t hesitate to return if you need more assistance. I wish you all the best with your journaling and painting this week. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Chen! I'm glad you decided to come back for another session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I started engaging more in group activities, and it feels nice to reconnect with others. But I still have worries lingering.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step towards connecting with others and working on your feelings. Can you share what worries are still on your mind?

User: I think about my pregnancy and the decision to terminate. It was the right choice, but sometimes I feel sad and guilty. I'm trying to understand those feelings better.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have mixed emotions after such a significant decision. Let's explore those feelings together. What specific thoughts or memories trigger those feelings of sadness or guilt for you?

User: Sometimes, I picture the baby and feel like I failed somehow. I know I made the right choice rationally, but emotionally, it’s tough.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way; you’re processing something very emotional. Let's take a moment to reflect on your feelings. When you think about your decision, what thoughts come to mind?

User: I often think, "What if I could have done something different?" It sometimes overwhelms me.

Consultant: That sounds heavy to carry. It’s important to recognize that these thoughts, while painful, are also a part of your healing journey. Have you noticed how those thoughts affect your feelings in different situations?

User: Yes, when I have those thoughts, I tend to withdraw from social interactions. I start avoiding people because I don’t want to talk about it.

Consultant: Avoidance can be a natural response when facing discomfort, but it can also hinder your emotional healing. Let's try to identify some small steps to gradually re-engage socially. What is one social situation you feel comfortable trying again?

User: I think joining the group activities I've been participating in can help. I feel somewhat accepted there.

Consultant: That’s a great choice! It sounds like you’ve already had some positive experiences in those activities. What small goal can we set for your next group meeting to help you feel more connected?

User: Maybe I can aim to share more about myself. I usually keep quiet, but I would like to open up a bit.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful goal, Chen! Opening up can help build deeper connections and support. What’s one thing you might share that feels comfortable for you?

User: I might talk about my experience with my pregnancy and how I’m processing it. I hope to find some understanding from others.

Consultant: Sharing that can definitely foster connection, and it can also help you feel understood. Do you have any fears about how others might respond to your sharing?

User: Yes, I worry that people might judge me or not know how to react. I fear it might make things awkward.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those fears. However, it’s important to remember that many people appreciate honesty and vulnerability. If someone reacts unfavorably, it reflects more on them than on you. How do you think you’ll handle any awkwardness if it arises?

User: I guess I could just reassure myself that my feelings are valid regardless of others’ reactions.

Consultant: That’s a strong approach, Chen! Validating your own feelings is crucial. How can we reinforce this understanding before your next group meeting?

User: Maybe I can remind myself of this before I go, and I could even practice what I want to say in the mirror.

Consultant: Practicing in front of the mirror is an excellent way to build confidence! Would it help if we role-play a little here to prepare you for that sharing?

User: Yes, I would like that. It might help ease some of my anxiety.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine that you’re sharing your experience. You can start with an introduction and how you’re feeling now. What would you say?

User: Hi, everyone. I wanted to share a bit about my recent experience with my pregnancy. It’s been a challenging time for me emotionally, especially with the decision to terminate.

Consultant: That’s a strong start. Sharing your story openly can invite empathy. How do you feel saying that out loud?

User: A bit nervous, but also free in expressing what’s on my mind. 

Consultant: That’s an important realization. Freedom in expression is a big step towards emotional stability. As you prepare for the group, keep reminding yourself of this emotional release. What else can we do today to solidify this confidence?

User: I think understanding that it's okay to feel this way is helpful. Maybe writing my thoughts down before sharing could also assist me.

Consultant: Absolutely! Journaling can be a powerful tool for processing your emotions. Let’s set a goal for the week: write down your thoughts about your experience and any comfort you find from them.

User: That sounds reasonable. I can do that.

Consultant: I believe in your ability to move forward, Chen. How do you feel about our conversation today, and what are your next steps?

User: I feel more settled. I’ll practice sharing my thoughts, write them down, and stay connected with the group. I feel hopeful!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re embracing your emotions and seeking to connect more deeply. Remember, it’s a journey, and I’m here to support you. Let's touch base again soon to see how your experiences unfold. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Take care, Chen! Looking forward to our next conversation.
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again, Chen. I'm glad to hear that your emotional state has stabilized and that you're engaging more actively in life. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! Thanks for having me back. I feel much better, actually. I've been able to enjoy some time with my family, and our relationships are improving a lot. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re finding joy in your relationships again. Can you share what specific moments or experiences have contributed to this improvement?

User: Well, we recently had a family dinner together, and it felt really nice to connect and laugh. I also spent some quality time with my sisters, which helped me feel more supported.

Consultant: Family connections can be so uplifting. It sounds like spending time with your loved ones has played a significant role in your recovery. What do you think has changed in your mindset to allow you to enjoy these moments more?

User: I think I’ve been trying to focus more on the positives instead of dwelling on the past. I realized that I need to be present and appreciate the love and support around me.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, Chen. Focusing on the positives can greatly enhance your emotional well-being. How has this shift in perspective affected your daily life and interactions with others?

User: It has made me more open to engaging with people. I used to avoid social situations because I felt overwhelmed, but now I seek them out. I feel more confident and less anxious.

Consultant: It's inspiring to see how you've embraced social interactions again. What do you hope to achieve in the long term regarding your emotional health and well-being?

User: I want to keep building on this positive mindset and work through challenges as they arise. Overall, I’d like to feel more balanced and fulfilled in my life.

Consultant: That's a great long-term goal. Reflecting on your journey, what strategies or tools do you think could help you maintain this positive mindset moving forward?

User: I’ve started journaling my thoughts and feelings. It’s really helped me process what I’m going through and track my progress. I’d like to do more of that.

Consultant: Journaling can be a powerful tool for self-reflection and growth. It’s wonderful that you’ve found something that works for you. How do you feel about the idea of setting aside specific time each week to reflect on your experiences and feelings?

User: I think that’s a smart idea. It could give me a chance to really focus on my emotions and ensure I'm staying on track.

Consultant: Absolutely! Setting a routine can help reinforce your efforts and keep you accountable. Is there any particular day or time that feels right for you to do this?

User: Maybe Sunday evenings? It feels peaceful, and I can set the tone for the week ahead.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Sundays can be a great time for reflection. In addition to journaling, are there any other activities or practices you think might support your mental health journey?

User: I’ve thought about trying mindfulness or meditation. I’ve heard it can be beneficial for anxiety.

Consultant: Mindfulness can indeed help with anxiety and grounding yourself in the present moment. Would you like to explore some simple mindfulness exercises to start integrating them into your routine?

User: Yes, I’d love that! I’m not really familiar with mindfulness techniques, so any guidance would be helpful.

Consultant: We can start with something simple like focused breathing. Just taking a few minutes each day to sit quietly and pay attention to your breath can make a difference. Would you be interested in trying that?

User: Definitely! That seems manageable, and I can do it anywhere.

Consultant: Absolutely! It's a versatile practice. As you begin this new routine, how would you plan to track your progress with both journaling and mindfulness?

User: Maybe I could create a weekly checklist in my journal to see which exercises I completed? That way, I stay accountable.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! A checklist can help visualize your progress and keep you motivated. How about at the end of each week, you reflect on how you felt during each practice?

User: Yes, that would help me understand what’s working and what I might need to adjust.

Consultant: Exactly! Reflecting on your experiences will give you insights into your growth. As we wrap up today’s session, I'm proud of the initiative you've taken in your emotional journey. 

User: Thank you! I feel like I have a clearer path ahead now.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that, Chen. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. You've already made significant strides. If you ever feel the need for extra support, don't hesitate to reach out.

User: I really appreciate your guidance. It means a lot to me.

Consultant: Thank you for trusting me with your journey. You've got this, and I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!

User: Thank you! I will. See you soon!
