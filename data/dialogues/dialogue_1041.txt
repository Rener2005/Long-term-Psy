Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyu! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious about the upcoming exams. I can't seem to focus on my studies, and I feel like I'm falling behind. It’s frustrating.

Consultant: I can understand how overwhelming that must be for you. It's tough when you feel pressure to perform well, especially with the added stress of the exams. Let’s explore this feeling a bit more. What specific thoughts go through your mind when you think about your studies?

User: I keep thinking that no matter how hard I try, I won’t do well. I also feel like I’m not as smart as my classmates, and that makes me anxious.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It seems like you’re facing a lot of self-doubt. When you say you're not as smart, can you tell me where that thought comes from? 

User: I don't know...maybe because my parents always compare me to others, and I feel like I'm not meeting their expectations.

Consultant: It's understandable that parental expectations could influence how you view yourself. It's common to internalize those comparisons. When you think about not meeting those expectations, what feelings arise for you? 

User: I feel really sad and isolated. Sometimes, I even think that if I don’t do well, nobody will like me.

Consultant: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry. Feeling isolated can really amplify those thoughts. Let’s take a moment to unpack that belief—that if you don’t perform well, you won’t be liked. What evidence do you have that supports that thought?

User: Well, sometimes I notice my friends getting excited about their achievements, and I feel left out. I think if I don’t achieve similar results, they won’t want to include me anymore.

Consultant: It’s tough to feel like you’re on the outside looking in. However, have you considered that your friends may appreciate you for who you are, not just for your achievements? 

User: I suppose, but it’s hard to believe that. I feel like they value success so much.

Consultant: It’s perfectly okay to have those feelings, but perhaps we can challenge that belief together. Can you recall any moments when your friends enjoyed spending time with you, regardless of academic success? 

User: Yeah, there have been times we’ve just had fun together, even when I wasn’t doing great in school. I just forget those moments sometimes.

Consultant: Those joyful moments highlight the value of your friendships beyond academics. You've mentioned how self-critical you can be—how does that affect how you see yourself in relation to your friends?

User: I guess I always think they see me as a failure if I don’t do well. It makes me withdraw from them.

Consultant: That makes sense; the self-criticism can create a wall between you and others. What do you think would happen if you allowed yourself to be vulnerable and shared these feelings with your friends?

User: I'm not sure. I worry they might judge me or think I'm weak. 

Consultant: Vulnerability can be scary, but it can also strengthen connections. Sometimes, sharing our struggles allows others to open up too. How might your friends respond if they knew you were feeling this way? 

User: They might be understanding. I’ve had friends share their struggles before, and it made me feel better to know I wasn't alone.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Xiaoyu. It seems that there's potential for connection if you open up. As we look ahead to managing these feelings, what activities or strategies can we identify that could help you feel more connected and supported during your studies?

User: Maybe I can try to study in groups or reach out to friends more, even if I'm not feeling great about my performance?

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Engaging with friends can offer support and lessen that feeling of isolation. What other small actions can you take to manage your anxiety about the exams while staying connected with your friends?

User: I think I could also take breaks and do something fun with them, like watching a movie or going for a walk, to take my mind off things.

Consultant: Absolutely! Balancing study with enjoyable activities can help ease anxiety. It’s important to let yourself recharge. Let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today. What are your key takeaways from our conversation, and how will you put them into practice moving forward?

User: I realized that I tend to be really hard on myself and assume others see me the same way. I want to try opening up to my friends more and engaging in activities that can relieve stress and anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful reflection, Xiaoyu! Recognizing your self-criticism is a great first step. Remember to give yourself grace during this time. 

User: Thank you. I just hope I can stick to these strategies. 

Consultant: You’re already on the right path by acknowledging your feelings and seeking support. As we wrap up today, I encourage you to keep practicing these strategies and reach out if you ever feel overwhelmed. You’re not alone in this.

User: Thanks a lot for your help. I appreciate it!

Consultant: You're welcome! I'm glad we could talk today. You have what it takes to navigate this, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyu! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! Honestly, I've been feeling pretty low. I had a fight with a friend recently, and it made me feel really isolated. I just can't stop thinking that maybe I’m not a good friend or that I did something wrong.

Consultant: It sounds like that conflict has really affected you, and you’re feeling some self-doubt about your friendships. Let's explore that more. What specific thoughts have been coming to your mind since the argument?

User: I keep thinking that my friends will talk behind my back and that maybe they don’t really want me around. It's like I’m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts about myself.

Consultant: That’s really tough to experience. These spiraling thoughts can really weigh you down. Can you identify what emotions those thoughts are bringing up for you?

User: I feel really sad and anxious. It’s like my mind is just running wild, and I can’t find a way to calm down. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you’re under emotional stress. Let's try to identify a specific thought you’ve had recently about yourself or the situation. What’s one thought that stands out to you?

User: I keep thinking maybe I’m not worth being friends with. Like, if I can't even keep a friendship, what does that say about me?

Consultant: I hear you, Xiaoyu. Your mind is telling you that you’re not valuable as a friend. Let’s take a moment to challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts this belief about yourself?

User: Well, I mean, I’ve had friends before, and some still stick around. But I don’t think about that when I feel this way; I just focus on the bad moments.

Consultant: That’s a great insight. It seems like your mind is highlighting the negative moments while minimizing the positive ones. Can we think of instances where friends appreciated you or where you felt valued by them?

User: I guess there were times when they reached out or supported me. I just forget those when I’m feeling down.

Consultant: It makes sense that those positives can get overshadowed in tough times. Let’s work on a new way to view things. If you were to offer a friend support after they had an argument, what would you say to them about their worth?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it doesn’t define who they are as a person.

Consultant: Exactly! Those words are wise and show compassion. Why not consider applying that same compassion to yourself? 

User: I don’t know; it’s easier said than done. I feel like I should be tougher on myself to improve.

Consultant: It can be challenging to shift that mindset. However, self-compassion can actually promote growth rather than hinder it. What if we started practicing some affirmations that remind you of your worth as a friend?

User: That could help, I think. But I’m just worried I might forget them in tough moments.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. We can create a plan together. How about writing down affirmations and posting them somewhere visible, like your study area?

User: I could definitely do that! It could be nice to have reminders around me.

Consultant: That’s a great idea. Let’s start with a few affirmations together. How about “I am deserving of friendship” or “I learn and grow from my experiences”?

User: Those sound good. I can try to remember that, especially when I’m feeling doubtful.

Consultant: Perfect! Also, how about we discuss some positive social activities you might want to get involved in? Connecting with others can sometimes help alleviate feelings of isolation.

User: I know I should reach out to my other friends, but it feels so difficult right now. 

Consultant: It's completely understandable. We can approach this gradually. Maybe start with a small message or invite someone for a quick chat? 

User: That sounds doable. I could send a message to an old friend I haven’t spoken to in a while.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful step! It might feel a bit uncomfortable at first, but it can lead to feeling more connected. 

User: I’ll give it a shot. Just thinking about it makes me a bit anxious, though.

Consultant: That’s normal, but I believe you can handle it. Let’s also think about how you can manage that anxiety. Are there coping strategies that have worked for you in the past?

User: Maybe just taking deep breaths and reminding myself it’s okay to be nervous?

Consultant: Those are effective strategies! Using those techniques can help calm you before you reach out. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection.

User: Okay, I like that! I’ll try to be patient with myself.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset to have. As we conclude today’s session, let’s summarize what you want to focus on moving forward.

User: I want to work on being kinder to myself, using affirmations, and reaching out to friends.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Xiaoyu! You’re taking positive steps. Remember to practice those affirmations regularly and take things one day at a time.

User: I will. Thank you for your support! It really does make a difference.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. You've made great progress today, and I’m here whenever you need support. You'll do great in your journey ahead.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyu! I'm glad you're here today. Let's start by discussing how you've been feeling since our last session. How are you doing?

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty down lately. Since the competition, I've been doubting my abilities. I can’t shake off this anxious feeling that I’m just not good enough.

Consultant: It sounds really tough. You're feeling a lot of pressure and self-doubt after the competition. Let’s explore that a bit more. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about your performance?

User: Honestly, I keep thinking that I let everyone down, especially my parents. I just feel like I'm not living up to their expectations.

Consultant: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden. Feeling like you've disappointed your parents can be really painful. How do these thoughts make you feel on a daily basis?

User: They make me really anxious and sad. I find it hard to concentrate on my studies because I keep replaying the competition in my head.

Consultant: I see. Your thoughts about the competition are affecting your ability to focus on your studies. It’s important we identify these thoughts. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts are running through your mind when you try to study? 

User: I keep telling myself that I’m going to fail my exams just like I failed in that competition. It’s like I can’t escape the feeling that I’m just not cut out for this.

Consultant: That’s a strong belief you're holding onto. Let’s take a moment to challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that supports this belief? And what evidence contradicts it?

User: Well, I’ve done well in the past, but this failure just overshadows it all. I guess I have had some successes before, but those don’t feel relevant now.

Consultant: It’s understandable that one setback can overshadow your successes. But those past achievements are still a part of you. If a friend came to you feeling this way about their performance, what would you say to them?

User: I would tell them that one bad experience doesn’t define their abilities. I know that’s true, but I just can’t believe it for myself.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective to have. Let’s practice believing in that perspective for you as well. How about we try to reframe your thinking? Instead of seeing this as a total failure, let’s view it as an opportunity to grow and learn. What could you learn from this experience?

User: I suppose I could analyze what went wrong and try to improve. It might help me be more prepared next time.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a constructive way to look at it. Planning for future improvements can empower you. What specific changes do you think you could make in your preparation for exams?

User: Maybe I can create a better study schedule and try to stick to it. I’ve never done that thoroughly before.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! A structured study schedule can help you feel more in control. What kind of activities could you include in your schedule to make studying more enjoyable or effective?

User: I think including group study sessions might help. I do enjoy being around classmates, and it could make studying less lonely.

Consultant: Great! Incorporating group sessions can definitely provide support and motivation. It sounds like you're discovering ways to build connections with others. How do you think this will affect your feelings of anxiety or self-doubt?

User: I feel like having that support might help me feel less isolated. It could make studying more fun and less stressful.

Consultant: Absolutely. Engaging with others can shift your focus and create a more positive experience. Are there any other activities outside studying that you enjoy and could incorporate more into your life to boost your mood?

User: I like drawing and listening to music. I usually do those things when I have free time, but I’ve not made them a priority lately.

Consultant: Those are wonderful activities! Making time for things you enjoy can help lift your spirits. How can you ensure that you incorporate drawing or music into your week?

User: I could set aside some time every weekend for drawing, and maybe I could listen to music while I study for a bit of relaxation.

Consultant: That sounds like a balanced plan! Balancing work with enjoyable activities is important for your mental health. Let’s summarize what you’ve decided on: a study schedule that includes group sessions, and making time for drawing and music. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds good! I feel a bit more hopeful thinking about it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s okay to have setbacks, but focusing on your strengths and building on them is key. As we move forward, what can you do to maintain this newfound confidence and motivation?

User: I’ll remind myself of my past successes and make sure to keep my support network close. I think that can really help.

Consultant: That’s a powerful strategy! Keeping in touch with your support network can nurture your confidence. As we wrap up our session, think about how far you’ve come. What would you consider your biggest takeaway from today?

User: I realized that I need to be kinder to myself and recognize my achievements. I can learn from failures instead of letting them define me.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight, Xiaoyu. Being kinder to yourself and viewing failures as learning opportunities can truly transform the way you approach challenges. I'm proud of you for exploring these feelings today. Remember, you’re not alone on this journey. If you need to talk again, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you! I feel like I have a plan now. I appreciate your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoyu! I’m here to support you, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyu! I'm glad to see you today. You've made some progress in exploring new relationships and activities. How are you feeling about everything since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel quite good, actually. I've been participating more in group activities, and I've started to connect with some classmates. It's been nice to feel included.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're enjoying the sense of belonging. What activities have you been involved in that you found particularly enjoyable?

User: I've joined the drama club and participated in a few rehearsals. I really like acting, and I felt really welcomed by everyone.

Consultant: Joining the drama club seems like a great way to express yourself and meet new people. How has being part of the club affected your feelings toward your classmates?

User: I feel more comfortable around them now. Earlier, I would hesitate to join conversations, but now I can joke around and laugh with them.

Consultant: It's great to see you becoming more comfortable and engaged! Has this experience impacted how you view yourself as well?

User: Yes, I think so. I used to be quite critical of myself, but now I feel I'm worth being part of the group. I can see that I'm capable of making friends.

Consultant: That's an important realization! It sounds like you are developing a healthier self-image. Can you share a specific moment in the drama club that made you feel proud or accepted?

User: During our last rehearsal, I was able to improvise a scene, and everyone found it funny. They complimented me afterward. It felt really good!

Consultant: That must have felt amazing to receive such positive feedback! How did that experience affect your mood afterward?

User: I was really happy! It gave me a boost in confidence. I even wanted to perform more and take on bigger roles.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It's great that you're gaining confidence through your experiences. How can you build on that momentum and continue developing these positive feelings?

User: I think I could try taking the initiative more in conversations and maybe lead a few activities in the club. I want to challenge myself.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Taking initiative can definitely help strengthen your connections with others. What might be some small steps you could take to start this process?

User: I could suggest a game during our next rehearsal or create a fun exercise for us to do. It seems like it could be enjoyable.

Consultant: Suggesting a game sounds like a perfect step! What emotions do you think you might experience when you take that initiative?

User: I might feel a bit nervous initially, but I believe once I start, I’ll feel excited and happy to share something fun with everyone.

Consultant: It's normal to feel a little nervous when trying something new. Remember that those feelings often indicate you're stepping out of your comfort zone. Are there any thoughts that come up for you when you think about leading an activity?

User: I worry that everyone might not enjoy it or that I might mess it up.

Consultant: Those thoughts are understandable. Let's explore them a bit. What evidence do you have that leading an activity might not go well?

User: I guess I don't really have any solid evidence. It’s just a fear I have. Most people seem open to my ideas.

Consultant: That's an important insight. If a friend of yours in the club felt that way, what would you tell them about their fears?

User: I would tell them that it’s okay to be nervous and that everyone has off days. Plus, it’s all about having fun together.

Consultant: Exactly! That's a compassionate way to support a friend. Now, can you remind yourself of this supportive perspective when you face your own fears?

User: Yes, I can definitely try that. Maybe I need to be kinder to myself and remember it’s okay to not be perfect.

Consultant: Absolutely! Self-compassion can make a big difference. As you continue on this path, what are some strategies you think will help you maintain this positive outlook?

User: I could keep journaling my experiences and maybe practice some positive affirmations. I think reflecting could really help.

Consultant: Journaling and positive affirmations sound like excellent strategies to enhance your self-awareness and positivity. How do you envision using these tools moving forward?

User: I think I could write after each rehearsal about what went well and remind myself of my strengths. That might help reinforce the good feelings.

Consultant: That's a great plan, Xiaoyu! Let’s commit to discussing your reflections next time. How do you feel about our conversation today?

User: I feel really encouraged. I’m excited to take those steps and keep building my relationships.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You're making wonderful progress. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what you've accomplished and how you can continue to grow. How do you feel about your situation now compared to when we started?

User: I feel much more confident and positive. I see more possibilities for myself and my relationships.

Consultant: That's a significant shift! I'm proud of you for recognizing your growth. Remember, you have the tools to navigate new challenges and keep fostering those connections. I'm here to support you whenever you need.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and am looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: You're most welcome, Xiaoyu! I look forward to hearing about your continued journey next time. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Yu! I’m really pleased to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling good mostly. I’m still on a high from the recognition I received at school, but I’m also trying to keep that momentum going. 

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Receiving recognition can really boost confidence. Can you tell me more about how this recognition has changed your feelings or interactions with others, especially with your parents?

User: I feel more confident talking to my parents now. They actually listened to me when I shared my achievements, which felt nice. But sometimes, I still feel like they don’t fully understand me. 

Consultant: It’s great to hear that your parents listened! It seems like the recognition has opened a door for better communication. What do you think gets in the way of them understanding you fully?

User: I think it’s just that they’re really busy with work and sometimes I feel like my feelings are just an afterthought to them. 

Consultant: That’s understandable, and it sounds like a frustrating experience. Feeling overlooked can be tough, especially when you desire that emotional connection. Have you found any ways to express your feelings to them that feels comfortable for you?

User: I've tried to talk about my day more, but I still end up feeling like I’m not being heard. I wish they could ask me about my feelings more often.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to want more engagement from them. It might help to express to them how much it means when they show interest in your feelings. How do you think they might react if you shared this desire with them?

User: I guess they would understand, but part of me worries they’d just brush it off. I’ve been meaning to bring it up, but it’s hard.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Sharing your feelings can be intimidating, especially if you fear they might not take it seriously. What if we brainstorm ways to approach this conversation that makes it feel less daunting for you?

User: That sounds like a good plan. Maybe I could write them a note? Writing sometimes helps me express myself better. 

Consultant: Writing a note can be a great way to communicate your feelings without the pressure of a face-to-face conversation. It gives you time to express everything you want clearly. What would you like to include in that note?

User: I think I’d want to express how their support means a lot to me and how I’ve been feeling lately, especially about our discussions.

Consultant: That sounds very thoughtful. This could help them see your perspective and perhaps foster more open conversations in the future. Once you write it, how would you feel about reading it aloud to them?

User: I think I would feel nervous but also excited. I’d love for them to understand me better.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that mix of emotions. Taking that step can bring you closer to them. Also, how have you been managing your emotional state lately? Any new strategies or techniques you’ve found helpful?

User: I’ve been trying mindfulness exercises. They help me calm down when I feel overwhelmed, but I still forget to use them sometimes.

Consultant: Mindfulness can be very powerful! Perhaps we could integrate reminders into your daily routine to help you remember to practice it more regularly. What do you think might work for you?

User: Maybe setting an alarm on my phone or pairing it with something I already do every day, like my morning routine?

Consultant: Those sound like excellent strategies! Pairing mindfulness with an existing habit can make it easier to integrate into your life. Would you like to set a specific goal for how often you want to practice this week?

User: I think I’ll start with three times this week and see how it goes. 

Consultant: That sounds very achievable! How will you check in with yourself to see how those sessions are impacting your emotions?

User: I could keep a little journal about how I feel before and after I practice. That way, I can track any positive changes.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant idea! Keeping a journal can help reinforce positive experiences and highlight any improvements in your emotional state. As we near the end of our session, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed today.

User: Sure! I feel like I have some concrete steps to take, like writing the note to my parents and practicing mindfulness more regularly.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve come up with effective strategies to enhance your communication with your parents and maintain your emotional balance. How confident do you feel about implementing these steps?

User: I feel pretty confident! Talking it through with you really helped clarify my thoughts.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiao Yu. Remember, it’s okay to take it one step at a time. As we conclude today’s session, are there any lingering thoughts or feelings you would like to share?

User: No, I think I’m good! I’m looking forward to trying out these ideas.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You've done an excellent job today, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Remember, you're making fantastic strides, and it’s okay to reach out anytime you need support. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’ll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyu! I'm glad you're here for our session today. How are you feeling about your progress since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I'm feeling pretty good, actually. I've noticed that I’m more confident in my studies and interactions with my peers. It's a nice change.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made significant strides. Can you share more about what specific changes you've noticed in your confidence levels?

User: Well, I used to worry a lot before exams and feel paralyzed by the pressure. Now, I approach my studies more calmly and I even participated in discussions in class without feeling overly anxious.

Consultant: That’s impressive, Xiaoyu! It seems like you've developed a more positive mindset towards your studies and social interactions. What do you think contributed to this shift in your mindset?

User: I think it’s a combination of things. The coping strategies we discussed really helped, and I also started communicating with my classmates more, which made me feel less isolated.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you're using the strategies effectively and building connections with your classmates. Reflecting on these strategies, which ones do you feel have been the most beneficial for you?

User: Definitely the breathing exercises and the way you taught me to challenge negative thoughts. They both helped me manage my anxiety much better.

Consultant: Those are powerful techniques. How do you plan to continue using these strategies to maintain your progress moving forward?

User: I want to set a regular time each day for those breathing exercises, maybe before I start studying or even when I wake up. It helps me start my day on a positive note.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Establishing a routine can truly make a difference. Apart from your studies, are there any other areas in your life where you feel you could apply these strategies?

User: I think I could also use them in family interactions. Sometimes I still feel disconnected from my parents, and I get anxious about talking to them.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It might be helpful to use your strategies when engaging in conversations with them. What do you think you could say or do in those moments to alleviate the anxiety?

User: I could try to remind myself that they care about me, even if they might not show it all the time. Maybe I can initiate conversations about my day more actively.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Reminding yourself of their care can shift your perspective. What kind of topics would you like to discuss with them?

User: I’d love to share some of the things I’m learning at school, and maybe even some of my personal interests. I think it could help bridge the gap.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your interests can create more connection. As you think about this, what fears do you have about initiating such conversations?

User: Sometimes I worry they won’t be interested or they’ll dismiss what I say, which makes me hesitate to bring it up.

Consultant: I understand that fear. However, it could be worth testing out. If you find that it goes well, it might reinforce your confidence in communicating with them. How do you feel about trying this approach?

User: I think I’ll give it a try and see how it goes. It feels a bit scary, but I know I've been managing my anxiety more effectively.

Consultant: That’s a brave step! Remember, even if the response isn't what you hope for initially, it’s part of the process. How can you prepare yourself emotionally for this conversation?

User: I can remind myself that it’s okay not to have a perfect conversation and that I can use my breathing techniques if I start to feel anxious.

Consultant: That’s a very constructive approach! Managing your emotional state before and during the conversation can be incredibly helpful. Is there anything else you’d like to explore or discuss today?

User: I think we’ve covered a lot already. I’m feeling good about my action plan moving forward!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! To wrap up, let’s summarize what you’ve decided to focus on. You plan to continue your breathing exercises, initiate more conversations with your parents, and share your interests to foster better connections. How do you feel about this plan?

User: It feels empowering! I think being proactive will help not just with my family but with my overall well-being.

Consultant: Absolutely! I believe you have the tools you need to keep moving forward positively. Remember, you have made substantial progress, and I encourage you to continue reflecting on your successes. If any challenges arise, don't hesitate to reach out. This wraps up our session today, and I'm here whenever you need support in the future.

User: Thank you so much for your guidance! I really appreciate it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoyu! You've done great work. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
