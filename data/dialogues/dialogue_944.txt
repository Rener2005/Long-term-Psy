Consultant: Hello, Y! It’s nice to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. Honestly, I still feel a bit lost and anxious, especially around my classmates. Sometimes I think I'll never fit in or be liked. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're still struggling with feelings of loneliness and anxiety in social situations. Can you tell me more about any specific incidents that triggered these feelings recently? 

User: Well, just the other day, I saw a group of classmates laughing and having fun without me. It made me feel really sad and like I'm an outsider. 

Consultant: I can understand how witnessing that kind of interaction could feel isolating. What thoughts were running through your mind when you saw them? 

User: I thought to myself, “They must think I’m boring or annoying.” It just reminds me that I'm not part of their group. 

Consultant: So, it sounds like you’re interpreting their laughter as a rejection of you personally. Let's explore that thought a bit. What evidence do you have that they think that about you? 

User: I don’t know... maybe it’s just how I feel in those moments. There’s no real evidence, but it feels so true to me. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Sometimes our feelings can distort how we see situations. Do you think someone else might interpret that situation differently? 

User: I guess a friend might think it’s just them having a good time and not necessarily about me. 

Consultant: Exactly! If you were to support a friend feeling this way, what would you suggest they consider? 

User: I’d probably tell them to focus on the positive things and maybe try talking to those classmates. 

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! What if we applied that to your situation? How could you challenge your thoughts when you feel excluded? 

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it’s not always about me and think of it as them just enjoying themselves. 

Consultant: That’s a positive step! Let’s think about real-life scenarios. When you feel left out like this, could we brainstorm some actions you could take to connect with others instead of withdrawing? 

User: I could try to join a conversation, even though it feels awkward. 

Consultant: That’s a brave approach! Setting small goals like joining in on conversations can help build your confidence. Can we explore what you might say in those situations? 

User: I could ask what they’re laughing about or what they did over the weekend. 

Consultant: Great ideas! Asking questions opens the door for connection. How do you feel about approaching your classmates with that mindset? 

User: It feels a bit scary but also exciting. I hope they respond positively. 

Consultant: It’s normal to feel a bit scared, but remember, taking that first step can lead to new experiences. How would you cope if the interaction doesn’t go as planned? 

User: I suppose I could remind myself that not everyone will respond negatively. It doesn't define my worth. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent insight, Y. Your worth isn’t determined by others’ reactions. Are there specific next steps you could take this week to practice these skills? 

User: Maybe I can make a point to say hello to someone I don’t usually talk to during lunch. 

Consultant: That sounds like a realistic plan! Let’s check in next week to hear how it went. In the meantime, remind yourself of the positive qualities you bring to these interactions. 

User: I will try to remember that. It’s just hard to see those qualities sometimes.

Consultant: It’s understandable. Journaling those positive traits or feedback from trusted people can be a helpful reminder. Would you be open to trying that? 

User: Yes, I think writing it down might help me feel more positive.

Consultant: Fantastic! Reflecting on your strengths will help reinforce your self-worth. Let’s wrap up for today. What do you think your biggest takeaway is from our session? 

User: I think it’s that I can challenge my negative thoughts and be proactive in social situations. 

Consultant: Exactly! You have the tools to change how you view these interactions. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. 

User: Thank you so much! I'm feeling a little more hopeful now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Y. I look forward to hearing how it goes next time. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Y! I’m glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling quite anxious about my interactions with classmates. I overthink everything and misinterpret what they say, which makes me feel even more isolated.

Consultant: It sounds like you've been struggling with those social interactions. Can you tell me more about a specific situation that made you feel this way recently?

User: Well, the other day, I overheard some classmates laughing, and I thought they were laughing at me. I felt so embarrassed and ended up withdrawing from them. 

Consultant: I see. That moment must have felt really hurtful and isolating. What thoughts were going through your mind at that time?

User: I thought they must think I'm weird or that they don’t want me around, which made me feel really sad and alone.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when you're trying to fit in. However, have you considered that there could be other explanations for their laughter?

User: I guess they could have been laughing about something else. But I can’t help but feel it’s about me.

Consultant: It's common to jump to conclusions in such situations. Let's examine that thought more closely. What evidence do you have that supports the idea they were laughing at you?

User: Well, I don't have evidence, just a feeling. But it feels so real to me.

Consultant: Feelings can be very powerful, yet they don't always reflect the reality of the situation. What if you tried to think about how you would advise a friend if they felt the same way? 

User: I would probably tell them to give it some time and not take things too personally. 

Consultant: Exactly! That perspective is helpful. It shows that there might be more to situations than what we perceive. Would you be willing to try changing how you interpret these interactions?

User: I think so, but it’s hard to not feel hurt.

Consultant: Certainly, it's a difficult process. Let's try a little exercise. Imagine a similar situation where you hear laughter, but this time consider various scenarios. 

User: Okay. I could think they were just having fun about a joke, or maybe something unrelated to me.

Consultant: Great! That's a wonderful start. By generating alternative explanations, you can lessen the sting of that feeling you have. How does that make you feel now?

User: It helps a bit. I suppose it’s worth trying to think that way.

Consultant: Absolutely! And with practice, it could become easier. What else do you think could help you feel more secure in social settings?

User: I don’t know. Maybe if I practiced talking to people more or learned what to say in those situations?

Consultant: That’s a solid idea! Practicing dialogues can help build your confidence. How about we role-play a simple interaction together?

User: That sounds helpful. What scenario should we use? 

Consultant: Let’s create a scenario where you approach a group of classmates during lunch. How would you want to start that conversation?

User: Um, I might say something like, “Hey, what are you all talking about?” 

Consultant: Perfect! That’s an excellent opener. Let’s try that in our role play. I’ll be one of your classmates. Ready?

User: Yes, let’s do it.

Consultant: *smiling* Hey, we're just talking about the new movie that came out. Have you seen it?

User: Actually, no, I haven’t. But I heard it was really good. What do you like about it? 

Consultant: I liked the special effects! It was quite thrilling. What type of movies do you enjoy?

User: I like comedies. They help me relax after school. 

Consultant: That's great! That was a really good interaction, Y! How did it feel to engage in that conversation?

User: It felt nice! I think if I keep practicing, I might be able to talk to them more often.

Consultant: Exactly! With practice, it becomes easier. How about we summarize what we've covered today and identify your next steps?

User: Sure! I want to try to reframe my thoughts when I feel anxious and practice talking to my classmates.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan. Remember, it's about taking small steps towards improving your interactions. How confident do you feel about these strategies now?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I still worry, but I think I can make an effort.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset to have. Keep reminding yourself that it’s normal to feel anxious, and the more you practice, the more comfortable you’ll become. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're welcome! I’ve enjoyed our session today. Remember, you’ve got the tools to handle these situations. Whenever you're ready for our next session, I’ll be here to support you. 

User: I will! Thank you again, and see you next time!

Consultant: See you next time, Y! Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Y! I'm glad to see you today. Let's talk about how you've been feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi! I've been really anxious about making friends with my classmates. I tried talking to them, but it just didn’t go well. I feel like I’m failing at this.

Consultant: That sounds tough, Y. It’s understandable to feel anxious about these situations, especially when you’re trying to connect with others. Can you tell me more about what happened during that interaction?

User: Well, I thought I was being friendly and funny, but they just laughed at me, and I felt so embarrassed. It made me feel even more alone.

Consultant: It must be really painful to feel rejected like that. It sounds like that experience has made you doubt your ability to connect with them. What thoughts were going through your mind at that moment?

User: I thought maybe I’m just not likable, or that everyone prefers to be with others instead of me. It feels like I never fit in.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy to carry, and they can certainly contribute to your anxiety. Let’s explore those thoughts. Do you think there might be other explanations for their laughter?

User: I guess they could have been laughing at something else, but my mind just jumped to thinking it was about me.

Consultant: It’s common for our minds to make quick judgments, especially when we’re feeling vulnerable. What could be an alternative perspective? If you were to look at it differently, how might that change how you feel?

User: Maybe they were just being playful and not meaning to hurt me. It's just hard to think that way when I feel so anxious.

Consultant: That makes sense. It can be really challenging to shift our thinking, especially when we’re feeling vulnerable. Maybe we can work together on some strategies to help you feel more confident in those social situations. Would you be open to practicing some skills that could help?

User: Yeah, I think practicing could help. I just want to feel more comfortable talking to them.

Consultant: Great! Let's start with some simple conversation starters that you can use next time you’re in a group. What topics do you enjoy that you think might be interesting to your classmates?

User: I like music and some movies. I think I could talk about that.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Sharing interests can create a connection. How about we practice introducing a topic about music? You could say, "I just discovered this new song, have any of you heard it?" How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds okay, but what if they don’t respond?

Consultant: It's natural to worry about that, but remember that not every conversation will go perfectly, and that's okay. If they don’t respond, how might you handle that?

User: I guess I could try to change the topic or bring up something else I like.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’re already thinking creatively about how to engage with them. Each attempt is a step forward, even if it doesn’t go as planned. Together, we can build up your confidence to keep trying. Would you like to role-play this scenario to increase your comfort level?

User: Yes, I’d like to try that!

Consultant: Perfect! Imagine we're all hanging out, and you just approached the group. Go ahead and give it a shot!

User: Okay! I would say, “Hey, I just discovered this awesome new song by XYZ, have you heard it?”

Consultant: That was fantastic! You approached them with confidence and shared something you enjoy. How did it feel to say that?

User: It felt good, but I still feel a bit nervous thinking about the actual situation.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel nervous, especially when you’re trying something new. It shows you care about connecting with others! What can you remind yourself in those moments to help ease that nervousness?

User: I can remind myself that not every conversation has to go perfectly and that I’m just trying my best.

Consultant: That’s an excellent reminder, Y! You’re taking positive actions to engage with others, and that in itself is a great achievement. As we continue working together, you'll build more skills and confidence. Let’s also discuss ways to maintain friendships. What do you think you could do to nurture new connections once you’ve made them?

User: Maybe I could check in with them occasionally or invite them to hang out.

Consultant: Absolutely! Initiating plans or simply sending a message can be a great way to show you care. What are you thinking would be a good first step to take with someone you’d like to befriend?

User: I think I could invite someone to listen to music together or talk about a movie.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a little excited and a little scared, but it seems manageable.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mix of emotions! Feeling both excitement and fear is part of the process. You’re really showing progress by being willing to try. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s take a moment to reflect on what you’ve learned and how you can apply it moving forward.

User: I learned about the importance of sharing my interests and how to frame my thoughts differently. I feel more hopeful about making friends!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization, Y! It’s clear you’re beginning to see your potential for social connections. Remember, practice makes progress. I’m here to support you, and you can always come back when you need more guidance. How does that sound?

User: It sounds really good. Thank you for your help today!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. Keep believing in yourself, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time.

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Y! It's great to see you again. I'm glad to hear that you've participated in your classmates' group activities recently. How are you feeling about that experience?

User: Hi! I feel really happy that I could join in. It was nice to feel accepted, but I still worry about how to keep these friendships. 

Consultant: It's wonderful that you're feeling accepted. It's normal to have concerns about maintaining friendships, especially after just starting to connect with others. What specific thoughts do you have about keeping these relationships going?

User: I just think I might mess things up or maybe they don't actually like me as much as I hope. I feel pressure to always be friendly and fun.

Consultant: Those feelings are completely valid. It sounds like you're worried about living up to others' expectations. Let's explore those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that they might not genuinely like you?

User: Well, sometimes they laugh and talk without including me, and I feel left out. It makes me think maybe they just put up with me.

Consultant: I can see how that would make you feel sad and anxious. Sometimes our minds can jump to conclusions based on limited experiences. Can you think of any moments where they included you or showed you they value your presence?

User: Yes, actually! During the last activity, they asked for my opinion and seemed to value my ideas. I felt really good then.

Consultant: That's a great observation! It shows that they appreciate you. It’s important to remind yourself of those positive moments. How can we keep building on this connection with your classmates?

User: Maybe I could try initiating conversations more or plan some group activities myself?

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Being proactive can really help reinforce your bond. What kind of activities do you think would be fun for everyone?

User: I was thinking about a game night or a movie session. Something relaxed where we can just hang out.

Consultant: That sounds like a great way to create a comfortable environment for everyone. How do you feel about suggesting that to your classmates?

User: I feel a bit nervous but excited at the same time. What if they say no or don’t show up?

Consultant: It’s perfectly natural to feel nervous, but remember, you’re taking a brave step by reaching out. What if you approached it casually? If they can’t make it, it doesn't mean they don’t like you.

User: I guess that makes sense. I just worry about rejection.

Consultant: Rejection can be tough, but it happens to everyone. It doesn’t define your worth or the potential for future friendships. Could we think of a few coping strategies for you if this happens?

User: Yeah, that would help. Maybe I could remind myself of good times I've had or talk to someone about it afterward.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Focusing on the positives can help you handle the difficult moments better. How do you feel about practicing gratitude for the relationships you have so far?

User: I like that! I could write down things I appreciate about my friends.

Consultant: Writing down those positive thoughts is a great method to reinforce your appreciation. It will also help maintain a positive mindset. Would you be open to sharing those thoughts with your friends?

User: That sounds nice. It could be a way to strengthen our bond too!

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your candid feelings can deepen those connections. As you practice these steps, how confident do you feel about maintaining these friendships over time?

User: I feel a bit more confident than before. I want to try and see how it goes.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful attitude! Remember, friendships take time to develop. Give yourself grace as you navigate these relationships. What will be the first step you take moving forward?

User: I think I’ll suggest the game night this week and see how it goes!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic first step! I’m excited for you. After you do that, how would you like to reflect on the experience together in our next session?

User: Maybe I can tell you how it felt to suggest it and what happened afterward.

Consultant: Perfect! It’ll be a great opportunity to discuss your feelings and experiences. As we wrap up, what are you taking away from our session today?

User: I feel more hopeful about keeping my friendships and less worried about everything. I will try to be more proactive.

Consultant: That's an amazing insight! I'm proud of the progress you’ve made today. Remember, you have the ability to create and nurture these connections. Keep practicing those strategies, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. 

User: Thank you, I feel better now! I'll see you next time!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad to hear that. Take care, and see you soon!

Consultant: Hello, Little Y! I'm glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel a bit better actually. I've been getting more positive feedback from my classmates during our recent activities, and I think my social confidence is improving.

Consultant: That sounds great! It’s wonderful to hear that you’re feeling more accepted by your classmates. Can you share more about these activities and how they’ve helped you feel more positive?

User: Sure! Last week, I participated in a group project, and I felt comfortable sharing my ideas. My classmates seemed to appreciate my input, which was really nice. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It sounds like you were able to express yourself and were acknowledged by your peers. What emotions did you experience during this project?

User: I felt happy and relieved. I was nervous at first, but once I started talking, it felt good to be listened to. 

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you felt happiness and relief. Those positive emotions are important. How has this experience changed your perception of yourself in social settings?

User: I think I’m starting to see myself as someone who can contribute, rather than just feeling like an outsider. It’s encouraging.

Consultant: That’s an excellent insight, Little Y! Recognizing your own contributions is a big step towards building confidence. What specific social goals would you like to focus on moving forward?

User: I’d like to be able to initiate conversations more often and maybe make a few close friends. Right now, I still feel shy about starting chats.

Consultant: Initiating conversations is a great goal! It can be challenging, but practicing small steps can make it easier. How about we come up with a few strategies to help you start those conversations?

User: Yes, I’d like that. Maybe I could start with a simple compliment or a question about something we’re doing in class?

Consultant: That’s a perfect idea! Compliments or questions can break the ice easily. How do you feel about trying these strategies in your next class or group activity?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. I hope it goes well!

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous. Remember, even a small interaction can be meaningful. Finding comfort in these moments is key. What would you say to yourself to encourage your courage before trying it out?

User: I think I could tell myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that every small step counts.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s great that you are embracing the idea of learning from each experience. Reflection is key. After your next interaction, would you be open to sharing how it went during our next session?

User: Yes, I would love to share! I think it will help me process what happened.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Alongside initiating conversations, is there another way you can celebrate your social victories, no matter how small?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal of my experiences? Writing down what went well might help me see my progress.

Consultant: A journal is an excellent idea! It allows you to reflect and see patterns in your interactions and progress. What will you specifically record in your journal?

User: I’d note the positive interactions I have, how they made me feel, and any compliments or good things I received from others.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! By focusing on positivity, you'll strengthen your self-perception. How do you feel about doing this regularly?

User: It sounds manageable. I think I can commit to writing a few times a week.

Consultant: Perfect! Make it a routine, and remember to be kind to yourself during this process. Looking back at your entries will help boost your confidence. 

User: Thank you! I feel like I’m developing some tools to address my challenges.

Consultant: You definitely are, Little Y. I'm proud of the progress you’re making. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any concerns you have?

User: I think I just need to stay focused on my goals and remind myself to take it one step at a time.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset. Each step, no matter how small, is valuable. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Remember, you’re not alone in this.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and advice. I feel more motivated now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s been great chatting with you today, and I can’t wait to see how you continue to grow. Take care until next time, Little Y!

User: Bye! I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Little Y! It's great to see you today. I'm really looking forward to our session. How are you feeling about your social experiences lately?

User: Hi! I'm feeling pretty good actually. Since my class presentation, I've received some applause and compliments from my classmates. That made me really happy and gave me a confidence boost.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like that experience was quite uplifting for you. How do you think this newfound confidence has influenced your interactions with your classmates?

User: I think it made me a bit more willing to engage with them. I used to hold back a lot, but now I feel like I can share more of myself without worrying so much about what they think.

Consultant: That's a significant shift, and it’s great to see you embracing this change. Can you think of a specific moment or situation recently where you felt this confidence in action?

User: Yes! After the presentation, I joined in on a group discussion during lunch. I usually sit alone, but this time I jumped in and contributed to the conversation.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic step forward! Being able to participate in group discussions can really help build connections. How did you feel during and after that experience?

User: I felt nervous at first, but once I started talking, it got easier. Afterward, I felt proud of myself for pushing through my anxiety.

Consultant: Feeling proud of yourself is an important affirmation of your progress. Have you noticed any changes in how your classmates respond to you since you’ve become more open?

User: Yes, I think they’ve been more friendly and inclusive. It’s nice to feel that warmth, and it makes me want to keep that up.

Consultant: That’s a positive reinforcement! It seems like your efforts are creating a more welcoming environment. Looking ahead, are there any challenges you anticipate in continuing to build these social connections?

User: Sometimes I still worry about what they might think of me, especially if I say something that doesn’t come out right. I don’t want to go back to feeling alone.

Consultant: It's completely natural to have those worries. A lot of people experience that fear of judgment. How about we discuss some strategies that might help you manage those feelings when they come up?

User: Sure, that sounds helpful. I want to feel more secure in my interactions.

Consultant: One approach could be reframing your thoughts when you start to feel anxious. For instance, if you think, "They won't like what I say," you might challenge that by reminding yourself of your recent positive interactions. How might that feel to practice?

User: That could help, yes. I need to remind myself that not everything is going to be negative.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s all about shifting your perspective. Additionally, you can try focusing on the positive feedback you've received. Keep a list of compliments or supportive moments to refer back to when you need a confidence boost.

User: That's a great idea! I can definitely do that.

Consultant: Fantastic! Keeping track of those encouraging moments can really solidify your confidence. As we wrap up today, what do you think is the most valuable insight you've gained from our discussion?

User: I think reflecting on my progress is really important. It reminds me that I can change and improve my social life.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization, Little Y. Remember, recognizing your progress is crucial for building confidence. Do you feel more prepared now for future social situations?

User: I do! I think I have a better mindset to approach things.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Thank you for sharing your journey with me today. You've made remarkable progress, and I believe you can continue to grow in your social interactions. Remember, it's okay to reach out if you feel uncertain in the future. I'm always here to support you.

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate all the help.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m proud of how far you’ve come. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your continued successes next time we meet!
