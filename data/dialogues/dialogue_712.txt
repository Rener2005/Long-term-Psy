Consultant: Hello, Xiaom, welcome to today's session. I remember from our last conversation that you've been feeling quite depressed and confused, especially regarding your father's influence on your major choice after the college entrance examination. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi. I still feel pretty much the same, to be honest. I don't really know what I want to do with my major, and it's frustrating. Sometimes I wonder if my dad's choices are weighing on me too much.

Consultant: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy emotional load right now, especially with the pressure from your dad's expectations influencing your choices. What specific thoughts or feelings come up when you think about your major and your father's impact?

User: I often feel that choosing a major is just what my dad wants. I don’t feel like it’s what I truly want. It makes me feel lost.

Consultant: Feeling lost can be overwhelming, and it’s understandable that you’re feeling this way, especially if you perceive a disconnect between your desires and your father's expectations. Can you recall any specific moments or thoughts you have when you think about your major?

User: Well, I think about how my dad dropped out of his job as a bank employee to become a driver, and I feel like he wanted me to have a stable job. Sometimes I feel like I’m letting him down.

Consultant: That’s a really important insight. It seems like your father's transition has influenced how you view stability in a career. It’s natural to worry about letting someone down, but let's try to explore this further. Do you think there are possibilities in your major that excite you, away from just the pressure of expectations?

User: I guess there might be some parts I could enjoy, but I feel so detached from it all. I just don’t want to disappoint him.

Consultant: It’s understandable to want to meet your father's expectations, but it's also crucial to consider your own desires. What would it feel like to start recognizing your own interests, irrespective of his influence?

User: It would feel freeing, I think, but I can’t help but worry about what he would say if I chose something different.

Consultant: That’s a very valid concern. Acknowledging that fear is the first step. Let’s think about ways to reconnect with your own interests. Can you remember a time when you did something that truly interested you, regardless of external expectations?

User: I used to love painting and drawing when I was younger. It felt good to express myself that way.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful and creative outlet. How did engaging in painting and drawing make you feel, especially compared to how you feel about your current situation?

User: It made me happy and relaxed. I don’t feel that way about my studies at all.

Consultant: It’s great that you have something that brings you joy! Maybe we can explore how to incorporate that creative side into your current routine. Would you be willing to set aside some time each week to engage in painting or drawing again?

User: I’d like that, but I’m worried about being too busy with my studies.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Let's think about small steps. Perhaps you could start with just 15 minutes a few times a week? It might help you relax and could even improve your focus on your studies.

User: That sounds manageable. I never thought of it that way before!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. It’s all about finding a balance. Remember, it’s okay to take breaks and engage in activities that bring you joy. They can enhance your overall well-being. How do you plan to include that in your schedule?

User: I could try doing it on weekends when I have more free time. I think that would work for me.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan! By allowing yourself to indulge in something you love, you might find it easier to cope with the pressures of your major. Have you thought about discussing your feelings about your major with your dad?

User: Not really. I’m afraid of how he might react.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel apprehensive. Perhaps you could approach the topic by sharing your love for art and how it has positively impacted your life. It might open up a balanced conversation.

User: I suppose that makes sense. He might appreciate hearing about my passion.

Consultant: Absolutely! It seems like fostering this dialogue could be beneficial. It’s important to share not just your challenges but also what brings you joy. What do you think holds you back from talking to him?

User: I think it’s just fear of disapproval. I don’t want to cause any conflict.

Consultant: Conflict can feel daunting, but remember that expressing your feelings doesn’t equate to rejecting his values. It’s about finding your own path. What if we role-play how that conversation might go to help you feel more prepared?

User: That could help. Talking about it beforehand would definitely ease my anxiety.

Consultant: Great! Let’s envision a scenario where you start the conversation, expressing your thoughts and feelings. How would you begin?

User: I think I might say something like, “Dad, can we talk? I feel like I need to share my thoughts on my major and what I enjoy.” 

Consultant: That’s a thoughtful start! You're opening the door for dialogue. What do you think your dad’s response might be?

User: I hope he listens, but I’m not sure if he will understand right away.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel unsure about his reaction, but expressing yourself is a significant move. Remember, it may take time for him to process what you're sharing. Just being open and honest can lay the groundwork for better understanding in the future.

User: I guess so. I like the idea of being honest with him, even if I'm not sure he will agree.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s all about finding your voice. As we reach the end of our session today, let’s summarize what we talked about. You've identified some of your feelings about your major and your father's influence, explored ways to incorporate your passion for art into your life, and considered how to start a conversation with your dad. How do you feel about the steps we’ve discussed?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It’s nice to have a plan and to think about having open communication with my dad.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s a journey, and taking these small steps can lead to positive changes. I'll be here to support you as you move forward. If you ever need to revisit these discussions or explore new feelings, I'm just a session away.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaom! Take care until we meet again, and remember to prioritize those moments of creativity.

Consultant: Hello, M! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I still feel quite lonely, and I'm struggling to connect with my classmates. I’m also confused about my father’s actions. It feels like everything is just overwhelming.

Consultant: It sounds like you're still grappling with feelings of loneliness and uncertainty about your father's actions. Let's start by exploring how your attempts to connect with your classmates have been going. What experiences have you had?

User: I tried to invite some classmates for coffee, but they seemed busy and didn’t really engage with me. I felt rejected and went back to my room feeling even more isolated.

Consultant: I appreciate your courage in reaching out to them. It's tough to put yourself out there, especially when the response isn't what you hoped for. Can you share what thoughts went through your mind when that happened?

User: I thought maybe it was my fault. Maybe they just don’t like me or find me boring. Those thoughts make me feel even worse.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite heavy to bear. It's common to internalize feelings of rejection, but let's take a moment to challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that they don't like you?

User: I guess there isn’t really any clear evidence. It’s just how I feel, but I can't shake it off.

Consultant: Feelings can often feel very real, even if they aren't based on evidence. Let’s consider another perspective: if a friend faced a similar situation, how might you encourage them to view it differently?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay, and it doesn’t necessarily mean people don’t like them. Maybe they just have other things going on.

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate outlook! It shows that you have the ability to think more positively, even if it’s challenging for you right now. How might you apply this perspective to your own situation?

User: I suppose I could remind myself that it doesn't mean I'm unlikeable if people are busy. I guess I just need to try again another time.

Consultant: Exactly! Trying again is a positive step. What small action could you take next to connect with someone again, keeping that perspective in mind?

User: Maybe I could join a study group? That way, I can meet more people in a more structured setting.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! It provides both a social opportunity and a chance to focus on your studies. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. It could be a good way to make friends.

Consultant: That's a wonderful mix of emotions! It's normal to feel nervous, but your excitement shows you're open to change. Let’s also discuss your relationship with your father. What’s been on your mind about him?

User: I’m confused about why he chose to become a driver instead of staying in a stable job at the bank. It feels like he doesn't care about our future.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel confused over his choices, especially when they impact the family. Can you share more about what thoughts or feelings this brings up for you?

User: I feel worried about financial stability. I sometimes think he’s being selfish for not prioritizing us.

Consultant: Those are valid concerns. It might help to reflect on what his motivations could be. Do you think there could be reasons behind his decision that might not be apparent?

User: Maybe he feels trapped or overwhelmed. I never really thought about his feelings. 

Consultant: Considering his potential feelings is really insightful. Understanding that he may have his own struggles can shift your perspective. How might this understanding influence your relationship with him?

User: It could help me be more compassionate towards him. I guess I should talk to him about it.

Consultant: That's a significant realization, M! Having an open conversation with him could bridge the understanding between you two. What do you think you’d want to express to him?

User: I want to tell him that I care about him and that I want to understand his choices better. I think that could help.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful intention! Expressing care and curiosity can create a supportive dialogue. How can you prepare for this conversation?

User: I can think about some questions to ask and remind myself to listen to him without judging.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach! Active listening and asking open-ended questions can foster deeper understanding. How are you feeling as we wrap up today’s session?

User: I feel a bit brighter, actually. Talking about these issues is helping me think differently.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! You've made some significant progress in recognizing your feelings and developing new perspectives. For our next meeting, let’s continue exploring your interests as well as any experiences with your father or classmates. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I'm looking forward to it.

Consultant: Perfect! Remember to take small steps towards connecting with others and having that important conversation. I believe you're capable of making meaningful changes. I look forward to seeing you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, M! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been thinking a lot about my interests lately. I'm still feeling a bit lost, but I think I’m starting to notice what I might enjoy.

Consultant: That sounds like progress, M! Discovering your interests can be quite a journey. Can you share more about what you've been noticing?

User: Well, I’ve started reading some physics books, and I find them surprisingly intriguing. I think it could be something I really like, but I’m not sure yet.

Consultant: It's wonderful that you're exploring physics! What specifically about it has caught your attention? 

User: I think it's the way it explains the world around us. It makes me curious, but at the same time, I feel pressure to find something I can commit to.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel pressure, especially when you're trying to find your passion. How does this pressure affect your enjoyment of the subject?

User: I tend to overthink it. Sometimes, I find myself worried that I won't be able to do well or that I'll choose the wrong path.

Consultant: I understand. Those worries can be quite overwhelming. Let’s take a moment to explore those thoughts. What specific thoughts come to mind when you feel pressure about your choices?

User: I often think things like, "What if I'm not good enough?" or "What if I regret changing my major later?"

Consultant: Those are very common concerns. Can we take a closer look at those thoughts? What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts them?

User: I guess I have done well in some subjects before, so maybe I could do well in physics too. But I still feel uncertain.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize your past successes! That's a strong evidence that you're capable. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them to help ease their worries?

User: I’d probably tell them to give it a try and not to be too hard on themselves. That it is okay to explore different paths.

Consultant: That’s an excellent perspective! Why not apply that same kindness and encouragement to yourself? What small step could you take to explore this interest in physics without feeling too much pressure?

User: I could try reading one physics book for fun, without worrying about grades or commitments. Just for enjoyment.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea, M! Enjoyment is a key part of finding your interests. How do you think you could incorporate that approach into your studies this week?

User: I could schedule some time each day to read without any goals attached. Just to see how I feel about it.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! Setting aside time to explore your interest in a relaxed manner can help alleviate some pressure. How do you feel about participating in study groups or discussing these topics with classmates?

User: I’m a bit hesitant about group discussions. I usually keep to myself, but I guess discussing ideas might help me understand things better.

Consultant: Engaging with others can often enhance understanding and spark interest. What if we brainstorm some gentle ways for you to start interacting with your classmates? 

User: Maybe I could start by asking a classmate about their favorite physics topic. That feels less intimidating.

Consultant: That’s a great first step, M! Starting with a simple question can make it less overwhelming. How do you think you might feel after trying that?

User: I think it might feel nice to connect with someone, even if it’s just a small interaction. I hope it might lead to more discussions.

Consultant: Connecting with others can be very fulfilling. Let’s set that as a goal for our next session. How comfortable do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel good about it! I think taking small steps is manageable.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it's all about gradual progress. As you try new things, pay attention to how they influence your feelings about your studies and your interests. 

User: I will! I hope that I can start feeling more engaged and less isolated.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset, M! Engaging with others can significantly improve your experience and motivation. How do you envision your feelings changing as you take these steps?

User: I hope I’ll feel less anxious and more excited. Maybe I’ll even find the motivation to explore more topics.

Consultant: That’s a lovely vision! Fostering that excitement can lead to many explorations. Let’s summarize what you've discovered today and set expectations for our next session.

User: Sure! I want to read physics for fun and try chatting with a classmate about it.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve identified some actionable steps. Also, consider how these experiences might help you feel more connected and motivated. 

User: Yes, I like that idea. Thank you for your support!

Consultant: You're very welcome, M! I'm proud of your progress today. Remember, I'm here to support you on this journey. If you have any thoughts or feelings before our next session, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: I will! Looking forward to our next chat. 

Consultant: Me too, M! Take care, and see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, M! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a little better, actually. I participated in a group study session recently, and I found that I enjoyed discussing ideas with my classmates.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're slowly discovering the benefits of group activities. Can you tell me more about what made that experience enjoyable for you?

User: I liked hearing different perspectives and even found myself sharing some of my own thoughts. It felt good to contribute to the discussion.

Consultant: It’s great that you felt comfortable sharing your thoughts. Contributing can really enhance your sense of belonging within a group. Do you think this experience has changed your view on participating in group activities?

User: Yes, I think so. Before, I was really hesitant to join in, but now I see it can actually be fun and informative.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! Engaging in group activities can indeed open up new perspectives. How do you feel when you think about participating in future group projects or discussions?

User: I feel a bit excited, but also nervous. Sometimes I worry that I won’t have anything valuable to say.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about that. Can I ask you, what thoughts come to your mind that make you feel like you won’t have anything valuable to contribute?

User: I often think that my ideas might not be as good as others or that people won’t be interested in what I have to say.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really challenging to deal with. Let’s explore them together. What evidence do you have that suggests your ideas are not valuable or interesting?

User: Well, I haven't shared much before, so I guess I just assume it won't be good enough.

Consultant: It sounds like there's a bit of a cycle happening here. Because you haven’t shared much, it leads to the belief that your contributions wouldn’t be worthwhile. What do you think would happen if you decided to share an idea, even a small one?

User: I suppose it could surprise me. Maybe people would actually appreciate my input.

Consultant: Exactly! It can be helpful to try and test out those thoughts. What if we made a plan for you to share at least one thought in your next group setting? How does that sound?

User: That sounds doable. I think I could prepare something to say in advance to help me feel more confident.

Consultant: Preparing in advance is a great strategy! It can help reduce anxiety and build your confidence. What kind of topic might you want to prepare for?

User: Maybe I could share my thoughts on the project guidelines. I feel I have some ideas about how we can organize our work better.

Consultant: That’s an excellent choice! You already have something to say that could benefit the group. How about we practice a little together? You can share your thoughts with me, and I'll provide feedback.

User: Okay! So, I think we could break the project into smaller parts and assign tasks based on everyone's strengths. That way, we can work more efficiently.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Breaking it down can definitely make the project feel less overwhelming for everyone. How do you feel about sharing this idea in front of your group?

User: I feel a bit less anxious about it now that I've said it out loud.

Consultant: That's a great step forward! Remember, confidence can build with each time you share. How do you want to reinforce this positive experience moving forward?

User: I think I’ll remember how this idea was well-received, and I will remind myself that my input matters.

Consultant: That’s a solid strategy! Keeping track of those positive experiences can be very helpful. As we continue our sessions, we can work on other aspects of your participation and confidence. How are you feeling about our progress today?

User: I feel good! I’m excited to try sharing my ideas again. It feels empowering.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Embracing that sense of empowerment is key. As you continue to engage more, you’ll build your confidence even further. What specific goals do you want to set for yourself before our next session?

User: I want to successfully share my thoughts in our next group (discussion) and maybe even ask someone else's opinion to keep the conversation going.

Consultant: Those are fantastic goals, and they seem very achievable! It’s also great that you’re thinking about facilitating the conversation. We can touch base on how that goes in our next session. Remember, each step you take is progress.

User: Thank you! I feel like I have a plan now, and I'm looking forward to it.

Consultant: You're very welcome, M! I believe in your ability to navigate these social experiences. Keep practicing those skills, and I’m excited to hear about your adventures in group discussions next time. Take care!

User: Thanks, I will! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello there, M! It's great to see you back today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I've been participating in some extracurricular lectures and found that I'm starting to enjoy learning new things. But I still sometimes struggle with talking to my classmates.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear that you're engaging with the lectures and developing an interest in learning! It’s understandable to feel uneasy about social interactions. Can you tell me more about what you experience when you try to engage with your classmates?

User: I often feel nervous and think that they won't want to talk to me or that I won’t have anything interesting to say. So, I usually just stay quiet.

Consultant: It sounds like you're facing some anxiety about social situations, which is quite common. What kind of thoughts run through your mind in those moments? 

User: I guess I feel like I'm not interesting enough. I worry they might judge me, which makes it hard to reach out.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing those thoughts with me. It's important to recognize this kind of thinking. Have you noticed if these thoughts influence how you feel in those moments?

User: Yes, I definitely feel more anxious and just end up avoiding the conversations altogether.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight, M. Let’s explore this further. If you were to challenge that thought about not being interesting enough, what evidence could you find to support or oppose it?

User: Well, I’ve had some good conversations with my teachers, and they seemed interested in what I had to say. I guess that means I can be interesting when I find the right context.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve recognized that there are times when your thoughts don’t reflect reality. If a friend were feeling like you do in that situation, what would you advise them?

User: I’d probably tell them to just be themselves and that most people are probably focused on their own worries too.

Consultant: That's a great perspective, M! It seems there’s an opportunity for you to apply that same advice to yourself. How do you feel about trying to reach out to one classmate this week with that in mind?

User: I think I can try that! Maybe I could start with a simple question about class.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect start! Maybe make a plan for when you’ll do it. How about we build a bit of confidence around that?

User: I could maybe ask someone after the next lecture. I’ll try to remind myself about those good conversations I’ve had with my teachers.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! It's about taking small steps. How do you feel about your ability to reach out now, compared to before?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I think I can do it, especially if I keep my past experiences in mind.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, M. Reflecting on those experiences can really support your confidence! How has your interest in learning impacted your feelings about reaching out to your peers?

User: I think it makes me feel more motivated to connect, especially if we’re both interested in the lectures. I can share my thoughts with them.

Consultant: Absolutely! Engaging with topics that excite you can spark great conversations. As you share your enthusiasm, it might ease some of that social anxiety. How do you think your interactions might change as you practice this?

User: I hope I can find common interests and maybe even make some friends along the way. That would be nice.

Consultant: It certainly would! Building those connections can really enhance your college experience. Let’s think about how you can keep this momentum going. What else can you do to engage with your classmates or expand your interests?

User: I could join a study group or even participate in some clubs related to my studies. That might be easier to start conversations.

Consultant: Joining a study group or club is a great idea! Those shared interests can provide a natural way to connect with others. What steps can you take to explore these options?

User: I could look up which clubs are available on campus. I might also ask my teachers if they know of any study groups.

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive approach! It’s great to see the steps you're willing to take to expand your social circle and interests. Now, let’s reflect on our conversation today. What do you think is your biggest takeaway from this session?

User: I think it's about challenging my negative thoughts and remembering that I have something valuable to offer in conversations. 

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight, M! You have unique experiences and perspectives. As we move forward, what strategies can you use to keep reinforcing these positive thoughts?

User: I could write them down and remind myself, especially when I feel anxious. I can also reflect on my conversations that go well.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan, M! Keeping a record of your successes can help reinforce those positive changes. As we wrap up today, how has our time together affected your feelings?

User: I feel much lighter and more motivated. I'm excited to try reaching out and joining new activities.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, M! You’ve made significant progress, and I'm confident you'll continue to thrive. Remember, it's okay to take small steps. Let's reconnect soon to discuss your experiences!
###################
Consultant: Hello, M! It’s great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more at ease. Communicating with my dad about my studies has helped me understand what I want to achieve, but I still struggle with connecting to my classmates.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear that your communication with your dad has improved! It sounds like you’re gaining clarity about your goals. Can you tell me more about what's been challenging you when it comes to engaging with your classmates?

User: I just feel disconnected. Everyone seems to get along well, and I feel like an outsider. Sometimes I wonder if they even notice I'm there. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a bit lonely and unsure of your place within your peer group. That can be tough. What thoughts go through your mind when you find yourself in those situations with your classmates?

User: I often think that they probably don't want to talk to me or that I would just be bothering them. It makes me hesitate to approach them.

Consultant: I can see how those thoughts might hold you back from reaching out. Let's explore that a bit. How confident are you that those thoughts reflect reality?

User: Not very confident, I guess. But they feel so real in the moment that I just end up staying quiet. 

Consultant: That makes sense. Sometimes our thoughts can feel so convincing. If a friend were in your position, what advice do you think you would give them about feeling left out and hesitant to join in?

User: I suppose I would tell them that they should just go for it and talk to people. It could lead to great connections.

Consultant: That's a great perspective! So, if you were to treat yourself as that friend, what small step could you take to start engaging with your classmates? 

User: Maybe I could try to join in on group projects or study sessions. It isn't too daunting, right?

Consultant: Exactly! Joining a group project or study session can be a less pressure-filled way to connect with others. How do you think taking that step would make you feel?

User: I think it might help me feel more included and a bit more comfortable being around them.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive outlook! It's crucial to build those connections gradually. How do you feel about setting a specific goal to approach a classmate about a group project this week?

User: I think I can do that. I might feel nervous, but it could be worth it.

Consultant: Feeling nervous is completely normal, but you're taking proactive steps. Remember, it's about making progress, not perfection. When we feel anxious, what strategies can we remind ourselves to stay calm?

User: I could take deep breaths, or maybe remind myself that it’s okay to feel nervous.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Practicing deep breathing and self-compassion can help ease your anxiety. How are you feeling about this plan as we talk about it?

User: I'm feeling a bit more optimistic! It’s reassuring to have a practical step to work on.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Maintaining open dialogue with your dad is also a positive step forward. How can you continue to balance that and your goal of socializing with classmates?

User: I think I can share my experiences with my dad. Maybe he’ll have some additional ideas or encouragement.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your feelings and experiences with him can provide you with more support and insight. Would you like to set up a plan for the upcoming week regarding these goals?

User: Yes, I think writing everything down might help me stay on track.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Writing your goals will create a visual reminder and help you stay accountable. We could document your target for the week and reflect on it in our next session.

User: I would like that! Having a plan would make me feel more organized.

Consultant: Great! You're taking significant steps towards maintaining emotional balance and improving your relationships. As we wrap up, let’s summarize the key points of our discussion today.

User: Sure! I want to make an effort to engage with my classmates, potentially by joining a group project. I’ll also share my feelings with my dad and use calming techniques when I feel nervous.

Consultant: Perfectly summarized! You're on the right path, and I believe you'll find socializing more manageable with these strategies. How do you feel about all this as we come to a close?

User: I feel a sense of relief and hope. Thank you for your support!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, M! Remember, it's okay to take it one step at a time. I’m proud of the progress you’re making, and I look forward to hearing how it goes next time. 

User: Thank you! I’ll see you next week.

Consultant: Take care, M! I'm looking forward to our next session.
