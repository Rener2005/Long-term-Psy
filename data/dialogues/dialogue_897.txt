Consultant: Hello, it's nice to see you today! I know that we've talked about some of the challenges you're facing with your English studies. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I think I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed. My parents are really pushing me to do well, and I didn’t do great on my last exam. Now, I feel like I can't even look at my English books without getting anxious.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like there's a lot of pressure coming from your parents, and it's affecting how you feel about studying. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you anxious when you think about English?

User: Well, I just feel like I won’t ever improve. Sometimes, I think I’m just not good at it. Also, my dad is really upset because of my last test, and he doesn't want me to use my phone at all.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult, feeling like you can’t improve and having your dad’s reaction weigh on you. When you say you're "not good at it," what thoughts go through your mind?

User: I keep thinking, "I’ll never pass my English class," or "I’m just wasting my time." It feels like there’s no point in even trying.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re having some pretty heavy thoughts about your abilities. What emotions do those thoughts bring up for you?

User: I feel really sad and frustrated. I want to do better, but it just seems impossible. I’d like to show my parents that I can improve, but they just keep focusing on my failures.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a mix of sadness and frustration, especially because it seems like your parents are not seeing your efforts. Let's try to look closely at the thought, "I’ll never pass my English class." What evidence do you have that supports this thought? And what evidence might challenge it?

User: I guess I don’t have strong evidence. I’ve passed before, but it’s just that I’m struggling right now and it feels like I’m always behind compared to my classmates.

Consultant: That’s a great observation! You have passed before, and it’s normal to struggle sometimes. How might you reframe the thought of "I’ll never pass my English class" into something more realistic or kind?

User: Maybe I could say, "I'm currently struggling, but I can improve if I keep trying." 

Consultant: That’s a much more encouraging thought! It recognizes your current feelings while also acknowledging your potential for improvement. How does it feel to think this way instead?

User: It feels a bit lighter, but it’s hard to believe sometimes, especially with my dad’s expectations.

Consultant: I understand; it can be tough to hold onto a positive thought when there's external pressure. Let's talk about those expectations. How do you think you can communicate your struggles to your dad so he understands what you’re going through?

User: I think I could tell him that I’m trying, but I need more help and support, especially in English. 

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach! Expressing your need for support is important. How do you feel about discussing this with him?

User: I’m a bit scared he won't understand. He can be really strict. 

Consultant: It's natural to feel scared about how he might react. One way to prepare for this conversation is to practice what you want to say. Would you like to role-play that dialogue with me?

User: Sure, that might help. 

Consultant: Great! You can start by telling me about how well you’ve been trying in English, then share that you're feeling anxious and would like his support.

User: Okay… “Dad, I've been studying really hard for English, but I’m feeling really anxious about it. I need your support to help me improve.”

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! How do you think your dad might respond to that?

User: I think he might just tell me to work harder, but I hope he could listen.

Consultant: Let’s imagine a possible response where he might listen: “I want to support you. What do you need from me to help you feel more confident in your studies?” How would you feel if he responded like that?

User: I’d feel relieved, like maybe he does care more than I thought.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sometimes parents may not realize the pressure they are putting on us. What steps can you take to help facilitate this conversation when the time is right?

User: I think I’ll wait for a calm moment and try to bring it up gently.

Consultant: That sounds like a wise plan. Remember, preparing yourself with positive thoughts can help you feel more confident during the conversation. What's one small action you can take this week to reinforce that positive thought about your ability to improve in English?

User: I could set a small goal, like reviewing a couple of vocabulary words every day. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Small, manageable steps can make a big difference. How do you feel about setting that goal?

User: I feel more hopeful, maybe I can see some progress.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! I’m glad to hear that. Before we wrap up today, let’s talk about our next steps. How can I support you in the next session to continue this progress?

User: Maybe we can talk about how the conversation with my dad went and what I achieved with my study goal.

Consultant: Definitely! I’ll look forward to hearing about your progress and how things go with your dad. Remember, it’s all about your journey, and you are not alone. It was great talking with you today! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in your ability to improve. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad that you could join me today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed, especially with school and my parents' expectations. I just don't know how to talk to my dad anymore. It seems like no matter what I say, he believes I'm not trying hard enough.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, especially when you're feeling pressure from your dad and struggling with your studies. Can you share a bit more about what happened during your recent conversation with him?

User: Well, he thinks my grades aren't good because I'm playing on my phone too much. I tried to explain that I'm having trouble with English, but he just didn't listen. I feel like he thinks I’m lazy.

Consultant: I can see why you'd feel that way, especially if you feel misunderstood. It’s important that your concerns about your studies are heard. What sort of things do you wish your dad would understand about your struggles with English?

User: I just wish he knew how hard it is for me. I really try, but it feels like everyone else gets it so easily. I don't even know how to tell him that without making things worse.

Consultant: It makes sense that you feel that way. It's tough to communicate when you feel like you're being judged. Let's work on some ways you might express your feelings to him. What if you approached the conversation by showing him you’ve been working hard, but you're just facing some difficulties?

User: I guess that could help, but what if he still gets mad? I don’t like it when he raises his voice. 

Consultant: That's a valid concern. Have you thought about how to express your feelings in a calmer way? For instance, you could start by saying something like, "I really want to improve my grades, but I'm struggling with English. Can we talk about it?" This way, you're opening up a conversation rather than just presenting problems.

User: That sounds like a good start. But what if he just goes back to blaming my phone again? 

Consultant: It's possible he might. If that happens, you can gently steer the conversation back to your feelings. You could say, "I understand you’re worried about my phone use, but I really want to focus on how I can get better at English." That shows you’re listening while also directing the discussion.

User: I can try that. It feels a bit scary to think about talking to him like that, though. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel scared about initiating those kinds of conversations. But remember, practice can help! How about we role-play this interaction? I can be your dad, and you can practice expressing your feelings and needs.

User: Okay! That sounds helpful. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s begin. I will play the role of your dad. "Hey, I’ve noticed your grades are slipping, and I think it’s because you’re spending too much time on your phone. You need to focus more on studying." 

User: "Dad, I understand you're worried, but I really am trying hard. English is difficult for me, and I need some help." 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic response! You’re clearly stating your feelings and concerns. How did that feel for you?

User: It feels better saying it out loud. It’s easier than I thought.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Practicing helps build your confidence for the real discussion. What else do you think would help reduce your worries during the conversation?

User: Maybe if I write down what I want to say, I won’t forget it if I get nervous.

Consultant: Yes, writing things down is a great strategy. It can help you feel more prepared and organized. You could even take the notes with you if you feel comfortable doing so.

User: I like that idea. It could help me feel less anxious. 

Consultant: Absolutely! And remember, it’s okay to take a moment during the conversation if you need to collect your thoughts. What other strategies or support do you think would help you cope with the stress from school and family expectations?

User: I guess talking to my grandma could help, since I live with her on weekends. She usually listens to me.

Consultant: That sounds like a comforting option. Sharing your feelings with someone you trust, like your grandma, can really lighten the burden. How do you think discussing your experiences with her will help?

User: I think she will understand better and maybe give me some advice on how to handle it.

Consultant: That sounds promising. Having support from someone who cares can make a big difference. Can you imagine what kind of advice she might offer?

User: She might tell me to be patient with myself and not to be so hard on my grades. 

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective. It’s important to remember that everyone has their own pace of learning. Being patient with yourself will help reduce some of that pressure. 

User: Yes, I think so. I really need to be nicer to myself.

Consultant: Absolutely! Self-compassion is crucial. As we move forward, how can you apply this new understanding towards your studies and your relationship with your dad?

User: I will remind myself that it’s okay to struggle and that I can ask for help. I’ll try to talk to my dad about how I feel, too. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! You’re taking a big step towards improving your communication and how you view challenges. How do you feel about the progress you've made today?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful and confident. This is really helping me think differently.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It sounds like you’re on the right path to improving both your studies and your relationships. For our next session, we can discuss how your conversations went and continue working on any challenges. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: Great! I’m proud of the steps you're taking. Remember, it’s all part of the journey. See you next time, and take care!

User: Thank you, see you!

Consultant: Hello there! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately with everything that's going on?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit mixed. I’ve started to make more friends at school, which is nice, but I still feel a lot of pressure about my studies, especially in English. I often think I’m just not good enough, and that really bothers me.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of change right now, both socially and academically. Making new friends is a significant step forward! Let’s talk more about this pressure you feel regarding your studies. What thoughts come to your mind when you think about your English skills?

User: I just keep telling myself that I’m hopeless at it. My homework feels so hard, and I start to think that no matter how hard I try, I won’t get better. Sometimes I feel like I’m just wasting my time.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing this with me. It's tough to feel that way about something that matters to you. Can we explore those thoughts a little deeper? When you think you're "hopeless," what feelings does that create for you?

User: I feel really anxious and embarrassed. It’s like I don’t want anyone to see my mistakes, especially my teacher. I just want to avoid speaking in class because of that.

Consultant: Those feelings of anxiety and embarrassment sound very overwhelming. It’s understandable that you would want to avoid situations where you feel judged. But let’s consider this—what evidence do you have that supports the thought that you are "hopeless" in English?

User: Well, I usually don’t do as well as some of my classmates, and I tend to get confused during exercises. I don’t really feel as confident as they are.

Consultant: It’s normal to compare ourselves to others, but those comparisons can be really unfair. Every student has their strengths and weaknesses. How do you think your classmates would react if they knew how you felt about your English skills?

User: I don’t know. Maybe they’d think I’m silly for feeling this way. Sometimes I think they have it much easier than I do.

Consultant: It’s completely valid to feel that way, but remember that everyone has their struggles—even those who seem confident. What if we brainstorm some ways to challenge that “hopeless” thought? What’s one small step you could take to improve your English?

User: I guess I could ask my teacher for help with the topics I find really hard. Maybe I could practice speaking with my friends too, but that seems scary.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Asking your teacher for help is a proactive step. And practicing with friends could really help ease your nerves. What can we do to make that seem less scary for you?

User: Maybe I could start by preparing a little before I talk to them, like practicing some phrases I want to say.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Preparing in advance can give you more confidence. How does it feel thinking about that approach?

User: It feels a bit less intimidating, actually. I think I can do that!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. Now that we’ve talked about English, how do you feel about your new friendships at school? 

User: My friends are really nice, but sometimes I worry that they don’t really like me. I feel like I have to prove myself to them.

Consultant: That can be a common worry, especially when forming new relationships. Let’s reflect on this feeling—what evidence do you have that they might not like you? 

User: They often invite me to hang out, but I guess I’m just afraid that when they really get to know me, they’ll think I’m not interesting.

Consultant: It’s okay to have those fears. However, if they invite you to hang out and enjoy your company, that’s already a strong signal they value you. How might you remind yourself of this when those worries creep in?

User: Maybe I could keep telling myself that they want to be friends with me for a reason. I could also try to be more open with them.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on their actions and your positive qualities can help build your confidence. As we approach our session's end, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today. How do you feel about your plan to improve in English and strengthen your friendships?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful now. I think I have some strategies to work on, and I’m excited to try them out.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You’ve made significant progress today. Remember that it’s okay to seek help and to practice openly with friends. The important thing is to keep moving forward. Are there any other areas you’d like to discuss next time we meet?

User: I think we covered a lot today. I want to focus on these changes first and see how I feel.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I believe in your ability to tackle these challenges. If you ever feel overwhelmed, just remember the strategies we talked about. I look forward to seeing how things unfold next time. Take care! 

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: Hello! I'm so glad to see you again today. Last time we talked about your new understanding of learning English and how you've tried to apply those strategies. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident about my English learning. The strategies I learned in the study group have helped, but sometimes I still doubt myself.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling more confident! Self-doubt can be quite common, especially when learning something new. Can you share more about those moments when you feel doubt? What thoughts go through your mind?

User: Well, sometimes when I'm studying, I think things like "I'll never be good at this" or "I'm just not smart enough." It makes me want to give up.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really challenging. It seems like they can make you feel quite discouraged. Let's explore that a bit. When you think, "I'll never be good at this," how does it make you feel emotionally?

User: It makes me feel really anxious and sad. I just want to do well and not disappoint my teachers or my family.

Consultant: I can understand why you would feel anxious and sad; wanting to meet expectations can be very stressful. Now, let's think about that thought: "I'll never be good at this." Is there any evidence that supports this thought, or might there be other explanations?

User: I guess I've had some difficulties before, but I’ve also improved a bit in my English since joining the study group.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! You're recognizing progress, which is key. If a friend were in your position and expressed that same thought, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably say they should give themselves credit for trying hard and that it's okay to make mistakes while learning.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to be kind to ourselves, just like we would be to our friends. Can we try to reframe that thought into something more supportive? What might a more positive phrase sound like?

User: Maybe something like, "I am improving, and it's okay to ask for help when I need it."

Consultant: That's a wonderful reframe! Embracing improvement and recognizing that asking for help is a strength can really boost your learning journey. How does that make you feel when you think of it this way?

User: It feels a bit lighter, like I can actually keep trying without feeling so overwhelmed. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let’s focus on reinforcing that feeling. What actions could you take in your studies that would align with this new, supportive mindset?

User: I think I could start by setting small goals for my English practice, like learning a few new words each day instead of trying to learn everything at once.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Setting small, manageable goals can really help you build confidence over time. How do you think achieving those small goals will affect your motivation?

User: I think it will make me feel more accomplished and encourage me to keep going. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Celebrating small victories is important. What’s one small goal you could set for the upcoming week that would help you feel that sense of accomplishment?

User: I could try to learn five new words this week and use them in sentences.

Consultant: That's a perfect goal! How will you keep track of your progress on this goal?

User: I could write them down in a notebook and try to use them when I speak with my classmates.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid approach! Keeping a record can help you see your growth. Now, let’s think about any potential challenges you might face while trying to achieve this goal. What might they be?

User: I might forget to practice or feel too shy to use the new words in conversation.

Consultant: It's very normal to face those challenges. Let's brainstorm some strategies together to handle them. What could you do if you forget to practice?

User: Maybe set reminders on my phone or have a specific time for studying each day.

Consultant: Great ideas! Consistency can be really helpful. And if you feel shy to use the new words, what could you do to ease that hesitation?

User: I could practice with my grandma since she’s encouraging. Or maybe find a friend from the study group to help.

Consultant: Those are excellent options! Having supportive people around you can make a big difference. As we wrap up today's session, how do you feel about your progress and what you’ve discussed?

User: I feel more hopeful and ready to try out these strategies. I think it will help me a lot.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Remember, you’re not alone on this journey. Keep using those supportive thoughts and strategies, and feel free to share your successes next time. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! Thank you so much for your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your progress. Take care until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're here for our session today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better since my parents came back home for a visit. They were happy to see my progress, and I think our relationship has improved a little bit. But I still want to feel more connected to them.

Consultant: It's great to hear that your parents' visit has positively impacted you and your feelings about your relationship with them. What does it mean for you to feel more connected to your parents?

User: I guess it means being able to share my feelings with them more and feel like they really understand me. Sometimes, I feel like I can’t express myself well, especially about school and my worries.

Consultant: I understand. Sharing your feelings and being understood can make a big difference in relationships. What kinds of things do you find most challenging to express to your parents?

User: Mainly about my difficulties in English. I feel embarrassed talking about it because they might think I'm not trying hard enough. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Many people often worry about what others will think. How do you think your parents would react if you shared your difficulties with them?

User: I think they would try to help, but sometimes I'm scared they might get disappointed. I don’t want them to think less of me. 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It can be tough when we fear disappointing others. Have you had any opportunities to talk about your English challenges with them before?

User: Not really. We usually talk about other subjects, but I don’t bring up my struggles. 

Consultant: It's common to shy away from difficult topics. What if we discussed some ways you might feel comfortable opening up about your English struggles with them? This could help enhance that connection you desire.

User: I think that would be helpful. Maybe I could practice what I want to say before talking to them?

Consultant: Practicing can be a great tool! It might help you feel more confident. Would you like to identify a few specific phrases or thoughts to express your feelings and challenges about English?

User: Yes! I think I could say something like, “I’ve been trying hard, but I still find English difficult, and I would appreciate any help or suggestions.” 

Consultant: That sounds like a great way to start the conversation! It’s honest and shows that you're open to support. How do you feel about having this kind of conversation with them?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also hopeful. I really want to connect more with them. 

Consultant: That’s a positive step forward! It's okay to feel nervous. With practice, it’s possible to feel more at ease. Do you have any ideas about activities you could do together as a family to strengthen that bond?

User: Maybe we could play some board games or do a family movie night. That could help us relax and talk more.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful ideas! Fun activities can create a safe space for open discussions. How do you think you could suggest these ideas to your parents?

User: I think I could just bring it up casually, like, “How about we have a game night this weekend?” 

Consultant: A casual approach sounds perfect! It maintains a light atmosphere. Do you feel prepared to share this suggestion with them?

User: Yes, I think so! It feels more achievable now. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! As we continue, let’s think about how you can express your emotions during these interactions, which will help strengthen your bond. How do you typically deal with emotions in conversations?

User: I often keep my feelings to myself, but I want to change that. 

Consultant: Expressing your feelings is an important part of connection. Would you be open to practicing sharing one small emotion or thought with your parents next time you talk?

User: I could try saying something like, “I feel a bit overwhelmed with school sometimes.” 

Consultant: That’s a great start! It’s a simple yet effective way to express yourself. How do you think they would respond?

User: I think they might understand and want to help me. 

Consultant: Yes, sharing feelings can often lead to understanding. Do you feel that this practice can contribute to your desired goal of feeling more connected with your family?

User: Absolutely! I’m actually excited to give it a try. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Progressing towards your goal can be very encouraging. Now, reflecting on our discussion today, what do you feel has been the most valuable insight you've gained?

User: I think the idea of practicing what I want to say is really useful. It makes me feel more confident.

Consultant: That’s an excellent reflection! Confidence in communication can certainly empower you. As we wrap up today, what steps will you take moving forward based on our conversation?

User: I will practice my phrases and suggest a game night. I will try to express my feelings more openly.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful actionable steps! I’m proud of your willingness to grow. Let’s set a time to reflect together on how it goes next week. 

User: Sounds good! I’m looking forward to it! 

Consultant: Great! Thank you for sharing today, and remember, it’s okay to take small steps. You’ve made some significant progress today. I believe in your ability to enhance your family connections. 

User: Thank you! I feel better about everything now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to hear that. Looking forward to hearing from you next time. Take care!

User: Bye!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling much better, actually. I think participating in that learning showcase really helped me gain some confidence. But now I want to talk about what’s next for me.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It's great that the showcase boosted your confidence. Let's focus on what you would like to achieve moving forward. What specific goals or skills do you want to work on next?

User: I want to improve my English because it’s been a challenge for me in school. I also want to keep building my confidence in speaking with others.

Consultant: That's a fantastic goal. Improving your English and communication skills will definitely help you feel more confident overall. Can you share what specifically about English feels challenging for you right now?

User: I struggle with vocabulary and sometimes I feel embarrassed speaking because I worry I might pronounce words wrong.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way. Many people feel nervous about speaking a new language. Let’s explore your thoughts around this. What do you think when you worry about making mistakes while speaking?

User: I just think that everyone will judge me if I make a mistake. It makes me feel anxious and like I want to avoid speaking altogether.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It seems like the fear of judgment is holding you back. Let’s discuss how we can challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that others would judge you harshly?

User: I guess I don’t really have any solid evidence. It’s more of a feeling I have.

Consultant: Feelings can often seem very real, but they aren't always factual. If your friend made a mistake while speaking, what would your reaction be?

User: I would probably encourage her and tell her it’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: Exactly! So, if you’re able to show kindness to a friend, maybe you can learn to be that compassionate with yourself as well. How does that idea resonate with you?

User: I think it makes sense. I should be more understanding toward myself and allow room for mistakes.

Consultant: Absolutely! Allowing yourself to make mistakes could be a significant step in building your confidence. What do you think would help you practice speaking English more comfortably?

User: Maybe I could start with simple conversations with my grandma or friends who are patient. 

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Practicing with supportive people can help ease some of that anxiety. How do you feel about setting a small goal around that for the coming week?

User: I could try to have a short conversation in English with my grandma every day this week. 

Consultant: That's an excellent goal! Small steps can lead to significant progress. How do you plan to feel after you achieve this goal?

User: I’d feel proud and maybe even a little more confident. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful outcome to look forward to! It's also helpful to remind yourself that progress takes time and practice. What other ways can you celebrate your successes, no matter how small?

User: I think I could reward myself with a treat or something fun after each successful conversation.

Consultant: Perfect! Positive reinforcement can really help keep motivation up. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed and your actionable goals for the week. 

User: Sure! I want to practice speaking English with my grandma for short conversations daily and reward myself afterwards.

Consultant: That summarizes our session perfectly! Remember to be gentle with yourself as you practice. Next time, we can chat about how it went and what you’ve learned. 

User: Thank you! I feel really good about this plan. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made and can’t wait to hear about your experiences next time. Take care until then!
