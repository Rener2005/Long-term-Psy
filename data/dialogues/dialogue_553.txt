Consultant: Hi there, Azh, I'm glad to see you today! I understand you’ve been dealing with some challenges in class. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling regarding your need to speak out in class?

User: Hi! Well, I really like participating and sharing my thoughts, but I often get in trouble for talking too much during lessons. I just want to express myself, but I feel confused about why I can't control it.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a strong desire to contribute to the class, but the feedback you're receiving is making you feel frustrated. Let's explore this a bit—what do you feel when you want to speak up in class?

User: I feel excited and eager to share, but then I get nervous when the teacher tells me to be quiet. It makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong.

Consultant: That excitement to share is completely understandable, Azh. It's great that you want to engage actively! But when the teacher responds negatively, it can create a conflict inside. What do you think could help you express your thoughts at the right moments without interrupting?

User: I think maybe I could wait until the teacher asks if anyone has something to say. But sometimes I just can't help it!

Consultant: Waiting for the right moment is a good strategy! Let's work together to build some skills around that. Can you think of a time in the past where you managed to wait for your turn to speak in class?

User: Hmm, I remember once I raised my hand and waited until I was called on. I really enjoyed sharing my idea then!

Consultant: That sounds like a successful moment! It shows that you can wait and it feels good when you do. How about we practice that experience today? I could help you role-play situations where you might want to speak, and we can find out how to manage those feelings.

User: Sure! That sounds fun. I really want to get better at this.

Consultant: Great! Let's envision a classroom scenario together. Imagine it's an exciting part of the lesson, and the teacher asks if anyone has ideas about the topic. What feelings do you think will arise when you want to speak?

User: I would feel really eager and my hand would probably shoot up. I want to share my thoughts immediately!

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel that burst of excitement. Let's think about how we can channel that energy productively. What if you took a deep breath first and reminded yourself that you can share your thoughts after others have spoken?

User: That makes sense! I could try to take a deep breath and wait. It might help me calm down a bit.

Consultant: Exactly! Deep breathing can serve as a great tool to help center yourself. Now, how about we practice that? Imagine you're in class now; take a deep breath and picture how you would feel waiting to share your thoughts after others.

User: Okay, I'm taking a deep breath… It feels calming. I think I can do this!

Consultant: Fantastic, Azh! Remember that feeling. You're doing really well. What do you think would help you remind yourself to wait when you feel that excitement bubbling up?

User: Maybe I can have a note or something with me to remind me to breathe and wait. That would help!

Consultant: A note is a very clever idea! Having that reminder could really help you manage those moments. When you see it, it can prompt you to take that breath and control the urge to speak out immediately. 

User: I like that idea! I’ll definitely try to make a note for myself.

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember, it's okay to feel excited about sharing. The more you practice waiting for your turn, the easier it will become. How do you feel about your progress today?

User: I feel really good! I'm excited to practice this in class and see if I can do it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Azh! Your enthusiasm is an important asset. Just take it one step at a time, and keep observing how others share in class. It will help you with your timing. 

User: Yes, I’ll definitely watch how my classmates wait their turn to speak too!

Consultant: That's a great idea! Observing others can provide valuable insights. Before we wrap up, is there anything specific you'd like to work on or any thoughts you have about our session today?

User: Just that I feel happier thinking about how to improve. I want to keep pushing myself to speak at appropriate times.

Consultant: I’m so pleased to hear that, Azh! You've made a lot of progress today. As we finish, remember to be patient with yourself. Change takes time, and you’re already doing great. You're welcome to come back anytime if you need further support.

User: Thank you! I’ll remember everything we talked about. I appreciate your help! 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m proud of you for taking these steps. I look forward to hearing how things go in class next time. Take care, Azh!

User: Bye!
###################
Consultant: Hi Azh, I'm really glad to see you today. Last time, you mentioned that you were happy with the teacher's positive feedback, but sometimes you still felt the urge to speak out in class. Let's start by discussing how things have been going for you lately. How have you felt about your progress in controlling your class participation?

User: Hi! I feel happy that my teacher noticed my efforts, but I still find it hard to hold back sometimes. I really want to keep improving and not interrupt so often.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're happy with your progress! It's normal to have some difficulties along the way. Can you share with me what happens in your mind when you feel the urge to speak up in class? What thoughts do you have at those moments?

User: Well, sometimes I think my idea is really important, and I don’t want to forget it if I wait. Other times, I just get really excited about what we’re discussing.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. It sounds like you have some strong feelings about wanting to share your thoughts. Let's explore that a little. How does it feel when you manage to hold back from speaking out? 

User: When I hold back, I feel a bit anxious but also proud of myself. But sometimes it’s really hard, and I worry my ideas might get lost if I don’t say them right away.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. Balancing your excitement with the classroom environment can be tough. What if we brainstorm some strategies together? We could come up with a plan for when you feel the urge to speak. Would you be open to that?

User: Yes, I would like that! I’m not sure what to do, though.

Consultant: Okay! One idea could be to use a signal, like raising your hand, so your teacher knows you want to speak. This could help you hold back while still having the chance to share your thoughts. How does that sound to you?

User: I think that could work! But what if I forget to raise my hand or get too eager again?

Consultant: That's a valid concern. Remembering to raise your hand can take practice. One way to help is to remind yourself before class starts. We could create a small reminder or mantra that you can think about when class begins. What do you think would help you remember?

User: Maybe I could write a note and keep it on my desk. That could help me remember to raise my hand.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Having a visual reminder can be really effective. After you try this for a while, we can check in and see how it's working for you. Additionally, we can also discuss how it feels when you do speak after raising your hand—what differences do you notice?

User: I think I would feel more confident if I raised my hand. It might also help me remember my ideas better. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Feeling more confident can make a big difference. The more you practice, the easier it will become. If you find yourself feeling anxious about holding back, remember it’s okay to feel that way—practicing is how you’ll improve. How does this approach feel to you so far?

User: It feels good! I’m excited to try it. Sometimes I just get really scared about making mistakes, though.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel scared about making mistakes. But remember, making mistakes is part of learning. We can practice some positive thoughts together. What would you say to yourself if you were comforting a friend who felt the same way?

User: I might tell them that it’s okay to make mistakes and that they can learn from them. 

Consultant: Exactly! Now, try using those same comforting words for yourself. Try saying, "It's okay to make mistakes. I will learn from them." Would you be willing to give that a try in class?

User: Yes, I think I could. That might help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: Great decision, Azh! Let's make sure you also keep track of how this approach works for you. You could note down any moments when you successfully raised your hand and how you felt afterward. How does that sound?

User: Sounds good! I could keep a little notebook for that.

Consultant: Perfect! This way, you can see your progress over time, which can help boost your confidence even further. Before we wrap up today, is there anything else you’d like to talk about or any other worries you'd like to share?

User: I think we covered a lot. I feel more hopeful about class now!

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Remember, practice makes progress. You’re not alone in this, and I’m here to support you. Next time we meet, let’s discuss how the strategies worked for you, and we can adjust them if needed. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I look forward to our next session.

Consultant: Me too, Azh! You've made some wonderful steps today. Keep practicing those strategies, and remember to be gentle with yourself along the way. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Azh, it's great to see you again! I’m glad to hear about your recent improvements in class. How have you been feeling about your progress?

User: Hi! I feel pretty good because my teachers are more supportive now, and my classmates are nice to me. But sometimes, I'm worried about whether I can keep this up.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a bit anxious about maintaining your progress. Let’s explore those feelings together. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you worry about keeping it up?

User: I often think that maybe I won't be able to participate as well as before, or that I might disappoint my teachers if I don’t keep doing well.

Consultant: I can see how that would make you feel concerned. So, these thoughts about disappointing your teachers seem to add pressure to your classroom experience. What emotions do you feel when those thoughts arise? 

User: I feel nervous and sometimes a bit discouraged. It's like I want to do well but am scared of messing up.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, Azh. Wanting to do well is a good thing, but feeling scared of failure can be challenging. Let’s think about it—are there any past situations where you felt similarly but still managed to succeed?

User: Yes! A while back, when I presented a project, I was really nervous, but I ended up doing well and got good feedback from my classmates and teachers.

Consultant: That's an excellent example, Azh! You faced your nervousness and came out successful. Reflecting on that experience, how might you remind yourself of it when you're feeling anxious about participating in class?

User: I guess I could tell myself that I have done well before, so I can do it again. Maybe I should think about the positive feedback I received.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Focusing on your strengths and past successes can help calm those worries. Let’s work on some practical techniques to maintain that positive mindset when you're in class. What do you think you could try when you feel nervous before participating?

User: Maybe I could take a deep breath and remind myself that it’s okay to try even if I make a mistake.

Consultant: Absolutely! Deep breathing can really help you relax. Also, remembering that making mistakes is part of learning can take off some of that pressure. How about setting a small goal for your next class? 

User: I can try to ask one question or share one thought during class. That feels doable!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, Azh! Starting with one question or thought can make a big difference. How do you think you’ll feel after you achieve that goal?

User: I think I’d feel proud of myself, like I’ve taken a small step forward.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! Celebrating those small achievements is important. What would help you to remember to take that step during class?

User: Maybe I can write down my goal and keep it in my notebook so I see it before class starts. 

Consultant: Great idea! Keeping your goal visible can serve as a helpful reminder. You’re building a strong toolkit to support your classroom participation. How about we also think about how you can positively reinforce yourself after participating? 

User: I could reward myself with extra time on my favorite game if I meet my goal!

Consultant: That sounds motivating! Associating positive experiences with your achievements can encourage you to keep participating. Lastly, let’s think about how you can handle any negative thoughts that pop up during class. What could you tell yourself to counter those thoughts when they arise?

User: I could say, “It’s okay to make mistakes, and I can always try again next time.”

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a powerful reminder. It's all about progress, not perfection. How are you feeling about these strategies we’ve discussed for your next class?

User: I feel more confident. I think these ideas will help me a lot.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that, Azh! You’ve made wonderful progress in building your confidence. As we wrap up today, what is the one thing you’re most excited to try out in your next class?

User: I’m excited to ask a question! I really want to see how it goes.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! I believe you’ll do great. Remember, taking that action lays the foundation for your continued growth. I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session. You’ve got this! 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Azh! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. See you next time, and keep up the great work!

Consultant: Hello, Azh! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling about your recent experiences, especially with the extracurricular activities?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good. Since joining the activities at school, I've received a lot of positive feedback from my teachers and classmates. It makes me feel more confident about myself!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Azh! It sounds like those experiences have really boosted your confidence. Can you share more about how this newfound confidence has affected your studies?

User: Well, I've been trying to participate more in class. I want to improve my grades like I did with my extracurricular activities. Sometimes, I feel nervous when we have group discussions, though.

Consultant: It's great that you're applying that confidence to your class participation. Feeling nervous during group discussions is completely normal, especially when you want to make a good impression. What specific aspects of these discussions make you feel nervous?

User: I worry that I won't express my thoughts clearly or that others won’t agree with me. I also tend to focus on what others say instead of sharing my own ideas.

Consultant: I understand. It's common to have those concerns, but remember, your perspective is valuable too! Let's explore some strategies that can help you feel more at ease when sharing your thoughts. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I really want to get better at it.

Consultant: Fantastic! One approach is to practice active listening first. This means really paying attention to what others are saying and then summarizing their points before sharing your own. Would you like to try a little role-play to practice this?

User: Yes, I think that might help!

Consultant: Great! Imagine you’re in a group discussion and a classmate shares their idea. You could respond with something like, "I appreciate your point about..." then share your own thoughts. Ready to give it a shot?

User: Okay! “I appreciate your point about teamwork being important for our project. I think we could also benefit from dividing tasks to work more efficiently.”

Consultant: That was excellent, Azh! You acknowledged your classmate's idea and added your own perspective. How did that feel for you?

User: It felt nice! I was nervous at first, but saying it out loud made me feel more confident. 

Consultant: That’s a great takeaway! Practicing like this can help you gain more confidence. What do you think you could focus on during your next group discussion?

User: I think I can try to remind myself to listen first and then share my idea. That will help me feel less worried.

Consultant: Absolutely, focusing on listening first can take some pressure off. Also, remember that it’s okay to take a moment to gather your thoughts before speaking. Do you feel ready to apply this in your next discussion?

User: Yes! I’m excited to try it. I really want to improve my skills.

Consultant: That's a fantastic attitude, Azh! As you practice, pay attention to how it feels to contribute your ideas. It's all about progress, not perfection. 

User: Right! I’ll keep practicing. I really want to be able to listen better too, not just talk.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Active listening is key in discussions. Being open to what others say can help you engage more. Maybe we could work on some tips to enhance your listening skills next session. How does that sound?

User: That sounds perfect! I definitely want to learn how to listen better.

Consultant: Excellent! I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember to celebrate your small victories in conversations as well. You’re doing great!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Azh. It’s been a pleasure working with you. Just take it one step at a time. I believe you can continue to grow in your discussions!

User: I will! I'm feeling more motivated now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, building your skills takes time. Keep practicing, and you'll see improvement.

User: I will! I’m looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: Me too, Azh. Until then, take care and keep up the great work! 

User: Thanks! Bye! 

Consultant: Goodbye! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Azh, it's great to see you today! Last time, we talked about your role as a group leader. How have you been feeling about your discussions with your group since we last met?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty good, actually. I enjoy leading the discussions, but sometimes I still find it hard to listen to everyone. I want to make sure everyone feels heard.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that you're enjoying leading! It's wonderful that you want to ensure everyone feels included. Can you tell me about a specific situation where you felt you struggled to listen or include others?

User: Well, during our last meeting, I got really excited about my ideas and ended up talking a lot. I noticed some of my group members were quiet, and I wondered if they wanted to share their thoughts.

Consultant: It sounds like your enthusiasm might have made it hard for others to express themselves. That awareness is an important first step! How do you think you could balance sharing your ideas with allowing others to contribute?

User: Maybe I could ask them directly for their opinions instead of just going on and on about mine. I just feel like if I pause too much, we might lose momentum in the discussion.

Consultant: That's a great approach, Azh! Asking for their input shows that you value their perspectives. It’s okay to pause and invite others to share; in fact, it could enhance the discussion. What do you think would happen if you tried this in your next meeting?

User: I think it would help everyone feel more included. I just worry that if I stop too often, it might feel awkward.

Consultant: Feeling awkward is completely normal, especially when trying something new. You could start small, like pausing every few minutes to check in with your group. How do you feel about giving that a try?

User: I’ll give it a shot! I think it could work. 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Remember, it’s about creating a space where everyone can share. After your next meeting, we can discuss how it went. What do you hope to achieve in your discussions moving forward?

User: I want to be more confident as a leader and also help my group come up with better ideas together. I think we can do great things!

Consultant: That's a fantastic goal! Being confident as a leader will help you facilitate discussions more effectively. What steps do you think you could take to further develop that confidence?

User: I guess practicing listening and asking questions would help. Also, maybe planning some activities that encourage everyone to speak up.

Consultant: Excellent ideas! Planning engaging activities will create a friendly atmosphere for sharing. Would you like to brainstorm some activities that could encourage participation?

User: Sure! I think games where everyone can express their thoughts would be fun. Maybe something like a debate or a group project where everyone has different roles.

Consultant: Those are wonderful suggestions! Group projects can help everyone feel responsible for contributing. As you facilitate these activities, how can you ensure that each person has the chance to speak?

User: I could set a rule that everyone has to share at least one idea or thought in every discussion. That way, nobody gets left out.

Consultant: That's a strong strategy! It encourages participation and balances the conversation. How do you feel about implementing this rule in your group?

User: I feel excited! It seems fair and should help everyone feel like they belong.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear you're feeling excited! It's clear you're taking a thoughtful approach to your leadership. Before our next meeting, might you also reflect on how you feel when engaging with your group? 

User: Yes, I think reflecting on my feelings will help me grow. I want to be aware of my reactions and how I can adapt.

Consultant: That's a great mindset, Azh. Awareness is key to growth. When you pay attention to your feelings, it can help you navigate the group dynamics better. What specific feelings do you want to observe?

User: I want to notice if I start feeling impatient or if I get too focused on my own ideas. I want to find a way to manage those feelings more effectively. 

Consultant: That’s a very insightful goal. If you can recognize those feelings as they arise, you can consciously choose to adjust your behavior. What positive outcomes do you envision from this reflection process?

User: I think it will help me stay calm and patient, which will make me a better leader. I want to encourage my friends to share and feel comfortable.

Consultant: Absolutely! Staying calm and patient will create a welcoming environment that fosters open communication. By the way, as you work on these skills, what do you think would motivate you to keep practicing?

User: I think seeing my group respond positively will motivate me. When they feel comfortable, it makes me feel proud.

Consultant: That pride and positive feedback from your group will certainly reinforce your efforts! Remember to acknowledge your progress, no matter how small. How do you plan on celebrating your achievements?

User: I could share my experiences with my family or friends and maybe even reward myself with something fun when I lead a successful meeting!

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas, Azh! Sharing your experiences and rewarding yourself will boost your motivation. As we conclude today’s session, can you summarize what you’ve planned to work on? 

User: Yes! I will practice listening more, invite others to share, set a rule for input in discussions, reflect on my feelings, and celebrate my progress. 

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, Azh! I'm proud of the progress you're making. As you move forward, remember that each meeting is a new opportunity to learn and grow. I believe in your ability to lead effectively. How do you feel about everything we've discussed?

User: I feel really good! I’m excited to try out these ideas and become a better leader. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It's been great to see your confidence grow, and I'm excited for you to take on these new challenges. If you ever need guidance, I’m here to help. Good luck, and I'll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Azh! I'm really glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially after doing so well in that school event?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good, actually. I was recognized for my self-control and teamwork, and it made me feel more confident. I'm excited, but also a bit nervous about what comes next.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Gaining recognition can really boost your confidence. What are some of the thoughts or feelings you have about setting new goals now?

User: I want to challenge myself more and maybe try for a leadership role in our next school project. But I'm also worried that I might not be able to handle the pressure.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a strong desire to take on new challenges, which is fantastic! Let's explore that worry a bit. What specifically makes you feel like you might struggle with the pressure?

User: I guess I worry that if I take on too much, I might not do a good job or let my team down. I don’t want to disappoint anyone.

Consultant: That’s a very normal concern, especially when you care about your team’s success. What evidence do you have that suggests you might let your team down? Have there been times in the past when you successfully handled similar situations?

User: Well, during the event, I actually helped my team win, and I felt really proud of that. But that was just one time, and I fear I won’t always succeed like that.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a great success to build upon! What if we reframed that thought? Instead of focusing on the possibility of failure, can we think about how your previous success can prepare you for future challenges?

User: I suppose I can remind myself that I’ve done well before, and I just need to focus on doing my best rather than worrying about the outcome.

Consultant: Exactly! Setting that mindset can be very powerful. What are some specific goals you’d like to set for yourself, knowing your strengths?

User: I want to work on developing better communication skills and maybe try to take the lead on tasks. But I’m not sure how to start.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! To start developing communication skills, you could practice speaking up during team meetings or even lead a small group discussion. Would you feel comfortable trying that?

User: That sounds doable! I can start by sharing my ideas more during class projects. 

Consultant: That’s a great first step! How about we come up with a plan for your first discussion? What topics are you passionate about that you would like to share?

User: I really like discussing science topics. Maybe I can suggest a science project during our next group. 

Consultant: Perfect idea! Science can be a fascinating topic, and suggesting a project shows initiative. How about we think of some key points you’d want to communicate to your team?

User: I could start with the basics of the project and share why it excites me. Making it interesting for them might help engage everyone.

Consultant: That sounds like a great approach! Presenting your excitement can captivate others. How do you feel about this plan? 

User: I feel a bit nervous, but mostly excited! It seems more manageable now that I’ve thought it through.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you’re feeling more excited and confident. Remember, it’s natural to feel some nerves, but they don’t have to stop you. How can we prepare for those moments when anxiety might creep in?

User: I could practice deep breathing when I feel nervous. That usually helps me calm down.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a fantastic strategy! Let’s commit to practicing it regularly. Can you try incorporating it into your preparation for the group discussion?

User: Yes, I’ll make it a point to do that. I feel like I have a solid plan now.

Consultant: Absolutely! We’re building a strong foundation here. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s recap your goals and the steps you plan to take.

User: I’m going to improve my communication skills, lead a small science project discussion, and use deep breathing to manage anxiety.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan, Azh! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made in our sessions. Remember, you can come back if you need further support. How are you feeling about everything we discussed today?

User: I feel really good! I’m excited about taking on these new challenges. Thank you for your help!

Consultant: You’re welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. I believe in your ability to meet these new challenges head-on. Take care, and I wish you all the best with your upcoming discussions!
