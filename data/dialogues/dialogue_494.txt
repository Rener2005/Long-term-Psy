Consultant: Hello Eve! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since your treatment, especially with your son returning home?

User: Hi. It's been a mix of emotions, honestly. I'm happy to have my son back, but I also feel really overwhelmed. Sometimes, I question if I can handle everything.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. The transition can be challenging, and it's normal to feel both excitement and anxiety. Can you tell me more about what specifically feels overwhelming right now?

User: I think it's figuring out how to manage my emotions while being a mother. I’m worried about my past mental health issues affecting my parenting.

Consultant: That concern is valid and shows how much you care about being a good mother. Understanding your emotions, especially after your experiences, is very important. Can we explore what emotions you find challenging right now?

User: I often feel anxious and sometimes get bouts of sadness. It feels like there's a constant battle within me. I worry I might snap at my son or not be able to connect with him.

Consultant: It sounds like there's a lot going on internally for you. The fact that you're aware of how your emotions affect your relationship with your son is a positive step. Have there been specific moments when you felt these emotions particularly strong?

User: Yes, the other day, he was trying to talk to me about his day, but I felt so overwhelmed that I just ignored him. I hate that I did that.

Consultant: Ignoring your son in that moment must have felt difficult for you. It’s okay to have moments like that, especially during such significant changes. Did any thoughts come to your mind when you decided not to engage with him?

User: I just kept thinking that I needed space, but then I felt guilty afterward. It’s like I can’t find a balance.

Consultant: That guilt is a common feeling in such situations. It seems like you need both space for yourself and connection with your son, which can be tricky. Would you be open to exploring how you can create that balance without feeling overwhelmed?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I want to be there for him, but I don’t want to sacrifice my own mental health.

Consultant: Absolutely, taking care of your mental health is essential for both you and your son. Let’s identify some small steps you could take to manage your emotions better. What are some activities that help you feel relaxed or more centered?

User: I enjoy reading, but lately I haven't had the energy for it. I used to meditate too, but that feels hard right now.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel that way. Sometimes, even activities we enjoy can feel daunting. How about starting with very brief moments of those activities? Perhaps just five minutes of reading or meditation. Would that feel manageable for you?

User: That sounds doable. I could try reading a few pages before bed.

Consultant: That’s a great idea, Eve! Small steps can lead to bigger changes. How do you feel about incorporating that as a regular part of your routine?

User: I think it would help me unwind. I just need to remember to do it regularly.

Consultant: Routine can be very helpful, especially for managing anxiety. Would you like to set a reminder for yourself or maybe connect it with another daily activity to help you remember?

User: Maybe I can link it to bedtime. Like, after I put my son to bed, I can read for a bit.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan! Connecting it with your son's bedtime creates a structure for yourself. It's also a wonderful way to wind down. What do you think might help you stay consistent with this new routine?

User: I suppose writing it down in a planner could help. I'll try that.

Consultant: Writing it down can definitely reinforce the habit. You might even jot down how you feel after reading—it could help you recognize any shifts in your emotions. How do you feel about keeping track of those feelings?

User: That sounds helpful! I’ll try to note how I felt before and after reading.

Consultant: Excellent! Keeping track of those emotions will give you insight into your patterns. Just so I know, how else can I support you in this journey of adjustment with your son?

User: I think I also need to work on understanding why I feel so anxious. I want to tackle that issue more directly.

Consultant: That’s a great insight. Recognizing the source of your anxiety will be an important part of our work together. Would you like to discuss specific situations that trigger that anxiety for you?

User: Yes, mainly when I feel out of control about my surroundings or emotions. It’s like I can't predict how I'll react.

Consultant: Feeling out of control can definitely heighten anxiety. Let's take a moment to explore those situations together. Can you think of a recent example where you felt that way?

User: Last week, when my son came back, I felt overwhelmed at home with all the changes. I didn’t know how to calm him or me.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, and it's perfectly understandable given the transition you’re both undergoing. Next time you feel that overwhelm, I want to encourage you to pause. What might help you regain a sense of control in those moments?

User: Maybe I could take a deep breath or step outside for a moment to gather my thoughts?

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking a moment to breathe or stepping outside can be very grounding. These small practices can help you feel more centered. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds promising. I’d like to work on that.

Consultant: Great! This will be a valuable skill to develop. I’m proud of you for these commitments you're making toward your wellness. As we work together, let’s keep revisiting your feelings and actions to guide your growth.

User: Thank you! I feel more optimistic about this process.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Eve. Before we wrap up, let’s briefly summarize what we’ve discussed. We’ve talked about your emotions, established a small reading routine, and explored strategies for managing anxiety. How do you feel about these steps?

User: I feel good about them. I think they can really help me.

Consultant: Wonderful! I'm excited for you to start implementing these changes. Remember, it's a journey, and progress can come in many forms. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to our next session where we can continue exploring your feelings and strategies.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Eve! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially with your new living arrangements with your son?

User: Hi. Honestly, it’s been a bit challenging. I feel excited to have my son back home, but at the same time, I'm unsure about how to manage things daily. I find myself anxious about whether I can provide a stable environment for him.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way after such a significant change in your life. You're looking to balance your excitement with some concerns, which makes sense. Can you share more about what specific situations make you feel anxious when thinking about parenting?

User: I worry about how to keep him engaged and happy. I feel overwhelmed with the idea of daily routines; sometimes, I just freeze when I think about it.

Consultant: It sounds like structuring your day feels daunting at times. Let’s break this down together. What kind of routines have you thought about implementing, or what have you done in the past that felt manageable?

User: I think having a set time for meals and maybe some activities would help. But I’m afraid that if things don’t go as planned, I’ll lose control.

Consultant: That’s a realistic concern. Routines can provide a sense of stability, but flexibility is also essential. How about we explore a few simple routines together and then discuss how you might adapt them if needed? 

User: That sounds good. I think starting with breakfast and then planning some activities might be useful.

Consultant: Great idea, Eve! Breakfast can be a wonderful way to start the day. What are some activities that you and your son enjoy together, or ones you think he might like?

User: He really enjoys drawing and playing outside. I was thinking of incorporating those more often.

Consultant: Those are wonderful activities! Drawing can also be a great way for him to express his feelings. How do you feel about setting aside specific times for these activities in your routine?

User: It makes sense, but I still feel a little anxious about being consistent with it. What if I don’t stick to it?

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Consistency can be tough, especially when you're adjusting. Perhaps we can create a flexible schedule that allows for breaks or alternative activities in case something disrupts your plans. Would that help alleviate some of the pressure?

User: Yes, it might. Having flexibility could make it less overwhelming.

Consultant: That's a positive mindset! Adjusting your expectations can reduce anxiety. We can develop a plan that includes room for spontaneity while still having those anchor points, like breakfast and time for drawing. Does that feel comfortable to you?

User: Yes, it feels more manageable when I think about it that way.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Besides structuring your time, how do you feel emotionally when you're engaging in these activities with your son? 

User: I feel happy when we do things together. But I’m afraid my old feelings of anxiety might come rushing back.

Consultant: It’s a valid concern, especially after what you’ve been through. Remember, it’s normal to have ups and downs. Let’s talk about some techniques that might help you regulate your emotions during those times when you start feeling anxious. 

User: I’d like that. I want to ensure I can manage my feelings better.

Consultant: One useful technique involves mindfulness, which helps you stay present in the moment. Would you be open to practicing this when you start feeling overwhelmed?

User: Yes, I want to give it a try. How does it work?

Consultant: Mindfulness involves focusing on your breath and allowing yourself to acknowledge your feelings without judgment. For instance, when you feel the anxiety creeping in, you can take a moment to breathe deeply and say to yourself, “I acknowledge this feeling, but it doesn’t define my abilities.” 

User: That sounds very helpful. It might help me not to spiral if I remind myself like that.

Consultant: Exactly! It could provide you with a way to pause and regain a sense of control. How do you feel about trying to incorporate this practice into your daily routine?

User: I think I could do that, especially in the morning before starting our day. 

Consultant: That’s a perfect time to set the tone for the day. Starting your day with mindfulness can help ground you. You’re making great progress on building your strategies, Eve. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel more hopeful now, especially with having a plan. I think there’s a way forward, even with my fears.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! This is a process, and it’s great to see your openness to new strategies. Remember, we can always adjust things as we go along. 

User: Yes, I need to keep reminding myself that it’s okay to adjust.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s about progress, not perfection. For our next session, let’s review how implementing these routines and mindfulness has gone for you. I’m here to support you along the way.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate the support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Eve! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Eve! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been okay, but I still feel overwhelmed by my work environment. The stress is really getting to me, and I'm worried about managing it.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like the pressure at work is still quite challenging for you. Let's start by discussing what specifically has been causing you stress lately.

User: Well, I have new responsibilities that I wasn't prepared for, and it feels like I'm constantly under pressure to perform. I sometimes think about my past experiences and worry that I might have a breakdown again.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way, especially after everything you've been through. Balancing new responsibilities can be tough, and fearing a relapse adds another layer of stress. Could you tell me more about what these new responsibilities are?

User: Sure, I have to manage some paperwork and assist with more demanding tasks that require constant communication. It's hard for me to adjust, and I feel like I'm failing.

Consultant: It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to succeed in these new roles. When you think about failing, what thoughts come to mind? How does that make you feel?

User: I often think that if I fail, it'll prove that I'm not capable. That thought makes me feel anxious and even a bit hopeless.

Consultant: Those feelings are valid. Let's explore that thought a bit more. How realistic do you think it is that failing at a task defines your capability as a whole?

User: I guess it's not entirely realistic. After all, I've had success in other areas. But the anxiety still creeps in.

Consultant: Recognizing that distinction is important. What if we try to reframe that thought? Instead of viewing failure as a definition of your worth, how about seeing it as a learning opportunity?

User: That makes sense, but it's still hard for me to see it that way in the moment.

Consultant: I understand that it can be challenging to shift your thinking when you're in the heat of the moment. Would you be open to practicing some relaxation techniques to help manage that anxiety when it arises?

User: Yes, I’d definitely be willing to try that.

Consultant: Great! One effective technique is deep breathing. It can help ground you in stressful situations. Would you like to practice it together right now?

User: Sure, I’d like to try!

Consultant: Okay, let’s take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a moment, and then slowly exhale through your mouth. Let's do that a few times. Inhale... and exhale... How do you feel?

User: I feel a bit calmer after doing that a few times.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Practicing this technique regularly, especially when you feel the stress building, can really help. Do you think you can incorporate this into your daily routine?

User: Yes, I can definitely try to remember to do this when I start feeling anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Along with that, let’s also explore support systems. Who do you feel you can rely on for support when work feels overwhelming?

User: I have some friends and family, but I haven’t really talked to them about how stressed I am.

Consultant: Opening up to them could be a valuable step. Sometimes just sharing your feelings can lighten the load. Would you consider reaching out to them?

User: Yeah, I think I could. I just have to find the right time to talk to them.

Consultant: That’s a good approach. Remember, your well-being is important. You might be surprised by how understanding and supportive they can be. What else can we do today to help you feel more prepared for managing work stress?

User: I think discussing ways to balance my responsibilities would really help.

Consultant: Absolutely! We could create a simple plan to prioritize your tasks. This could help reduce feelings of overwhelm and provide clarity on what’s most important each day. How does that sound?

User: That sounds really helpful. I like the idea of having a plan.

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s outline what your main responsibilities are and determine which ones can be broken down into smaller, manageable tasks. 

User: Okay, I have meetings, paperwork, and then supporting my team. 

Consultant: Great, let’s focus on one responsibility at a time. Which one feels the most pressing right now?

User: The paperwork, because it’s piling up and making me anxious.

Consultant: Let’s break that down. We can set a specific time each day to tackle a portion of it. How much time do you think you could commit to each day for this?

User: Maybe an hour each morning before the meetings?

Consultant: That sounds realistic! Starting your day with an hour dedicated to paperwork could help reduce anxiety throughout the day. How do you feel about that plan?

User: I feel better about it. Having a set time makes it feel less daunting.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It seems that structuring your time can make a significant difference. Remember, it’s also okay to ask for help if you need it. You’re not alone in this.

User: Thank you! I appreciate the reminder.

Consultant: Absolutely, Eve. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed. You’ve recognized some pressures, learned relaxation techniques, and developed a plan for managing your workload. 

User: Yes, it feels like I have some tools now to help me.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. In our next session, we can build on these skills and check in on your progress. Do you feel prepared to implement these strategies until then?

User: I do. I feel more hopeful about managing my stress now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Remember, support is out there for you, and you’re making great strides. Looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next meeting.

User: Thank you so much! I’m looking forward to it as well.
###################
Consultant: Hello Eve! I'm really glad to see you today. I know you've had a challenging time recently, and I'm here to support you. How are you feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I feel a lot more stable now, especially after being in the support group. It's nice to connect with others who understand what I went through.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like the support group has had a positive impact on you. Can you tell me more about what you experienced in the group that felt beneficial?

User: I felt like I was not alone anymore. Hearing others share their stories made me realize I’m not the only one dealing with this. It felt comforting.

Consultant: It’s really valuable to have that sense of connection and understanding. How do you think being part of that group can help you in your recovery process?

User: I think it can give me the courage to express myself more openly. I want to strengthen my communication skills, especially with my family.

Consultant: That’s a great goal, Eve! Improving communication can definitely enhance your relationships. What specific situations do you find challenging when talking with your family?

User: Sometimes, I struggle to share my feelings. I get overwhelmed and just shut down. I don’t want to worry them.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but keeping your feelings inside can be tough on both you and your family. What thoughts go through your mind when you want to share but hold back?

User: I often think they won’t understand or that my feelings are too much for them to handle. 

Consultant: It sounds like there might be some negative thoughts about sharing your feelings. Let's explore that—how much evidence do you have that your family wouldn’t understand or would find your feelings overwhelming?

User: I guess I don’t have strong proof. They’ve been supportive in the past, but my fear just takes over.

Consultant: It's common for us to fear negative outcomes without concrete evidence. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them to do?

User: I would tell them that it’s okay to share and that their family might want to help. 

Consultant: Exactly! It seems like you recognize the value of sharing. So let's think about practical steps. How about we role-play a conversation where you express your feelings to a family member? 

User: That sounds helpful. I could practice what I want to say in a safe space.

Consultant: Great! Imagine you’re talking to your son. What would you want to tell him about how you’re feeling?

User: I would tell him I’m feeling better but still have tough days. I want him to know he can talk to me, too.

Consultant: That’s a lovely way to start the conversation. Remember to take your time and breathe—what about inviting him to share his thoughts and feelings as well?

User: Yes, I think that would help him feel included. Maybe we could talk about our days together.

Consultant: Absolutely! That could strengthen your bond. After session today, would you consider planning a time to have this conversation with him?

User: I definitely will. I want to create that space for both of us.

Consultant: That’s a positive step, Eve. Reflecting on our session today, what do you think will be your biggest challenge in implementing this?

User: I think it might be my fear of being vulnerable. But practicing here gives me confidence.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel nervous about vulnerability. Remember, it’s a process, and each step you take is moving you forward. How do you think you can remind yourself of this when you feel afraid?

User: Maybe I can write it down—my reasons for sharing and how it can help us connect.

Consultant: Writing that down sounds like a powerful strategy! It can serve as a reminder to help you feel more prepared. As we conclude today, how do you feel about your progress in using your support network?

User: I feel good about it! I’m excited to apply what we talked about in my life.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Eve! I’m really proud of you. Remember, the skills you’re learning will help you in many areas. Don’t hesitate to come back if you need further support. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Eve. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Eve! It’s great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel like I'm doing better overall. My communication with my family has improved, and I’m really happy about that. I want to keep working on it though.

Consultant: That sounds like wonderful progress, Eve! It's great to hear that you feel more confident in your communication with your family. What specific areas do you feel you want to continue improving?

User: I think I want to be able to express my feelings more openly, especially when it comes to discussing tough issues. Sometimes, I still hold back.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Being able to express feelings, especially during tough conversations, can strengthen your relationships. Can you tell me about a recent instance where you felt you could express yourself better?

User: Well, there was a moment last week when we were discussing some household issues, and instead of saying how I felt, I just agreed with everyone. I didn’t want to cause conflict.

Consultant: I see. It’s understandable to want to avoid conflict, but holding back can also create distance. How did you feel after the conversation when you didn't express your true feelings?

User: I felt a bit frustrated and like I missed an opportunity to be heard. I don't want to feel that way anymore.

Consultant: That frustration is completely valid. Recognizing that feeling is the first step towards change. Let’s explore how you might approach those discussions differently next time. What might it look like to express your feelings in a constructive way?

User: Maybe I could start by saying how I feel about the issues rather than just agreeing. I want to express my thoughts before everyone else speaks.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy, Eve! Starting with your feelings can pave the way for a more open dialogue. What feelings do you think would be important for you to express in future conversations?

User: I think I often feel unappreciated or overwhelmed. It’s hard to say that, but I think being honest about it could really help.

Consultant: Absolutely, expressing feelings of being unappreciated or overwhelmed can really open that conversation. How do you think your family would react if you communicated those feelings?

User: I hope they would understand. I want to believe they care, but sometimes I doubt that.

Consultant: It’s normal to have those doubts, but expressing your feelings honestly can help clarify things. We could practice how to communicate those feelings together. How does that sound to you?

User: Yes, I’d like that. Practicing would help me feel more confident.

Consultant: Great! Let’s role-play a conversation where you express feeling overwhelmed about a specific issue. What situation can we use as an example?

User: I could talk about the chores. Sometimes I feel like I'm doing most of it, and I get overwhelmed.

Consultant: Perfect choice. Let's start. You could say something like, "I want to talk about the chores. I feel overwhelmed because I feel like I’m taking on a lot." Would you like to try saying that?

User: Okay. "I want to talk about the chores. I feel overwhelmed because I feel like I’m taking on a lot." 

Consultant: That was a great start! How did it feel to say that?

User: It felt a bit scary but also empowering. 

Consultant: That’s understandable! Recognizing that your feelings are valid is an important step. What do you think could happen next after sharing that?

User: I hope they will listen and maybe we can talk about how to divide the chores better.

Consultant: That would be a beneficial outcome! By expressing yourself, you become part of the solution. It's also important to anticipate different reactions. What could you say if they don't respond positively?

User: I guess I could remind them this is how I feel, and that’s important. I could say it’s hard for me to talk about this, and I just want to be heard.

Consultant: Excellent strategy! Reminding them that your feelings are important is a powerful way to reinforce your needs. Do you feel more prepared to handle these conversations now?

User: Yes, I feel more confident and ready to approach it differently!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As a recap, what strategies do you think will help you maintain this progress in your communication?

User: I want to practice expressing my feelings before others do and remind myself that it’s okay to voice my concerns.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies, Eve! Keeping in mind that it’s okay to express yourself is vital. How can you ensure that you keep practicing this in your daily life?

User: I could set a goal to share my feelings once a week during family discussions. Just to start small and build up my confidence.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! Starting small will allow you to gradually increase your comfort level. Remember, it's a journey. How do you feel about our progress today?

User: I feel hopeful and ready to work on it. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re welcome, Eve! It’s inspiring to see your progress and determination. I believe you can manage these challenges. Remember, I'm here for you if you need support in the future.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Eve! I'm glad to see you today. Before we begin, I’d like to talk about how you’ve been feeling since our last session and your journey so far. How are you doing?

User: Hi there! I'm feeling quite hopeful, actually. My mental state has been stable since I completed the treatment at the hospital, and it feels good to have my son back home. I’m trying to focus on the positives.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Reuniting with your son must be a significant boost for you. Can you share a bit more about what you've been enjoying recently or any challenges you've faced?

User: Well, I’ve been more social lately. I attended a couple of community events, and it felt great to connect with others. However, sometimes I still feel a bit anxious in social situations, even though I’m handling it better than before.

Consultant: It sounds like you're making great strides in your social engagement, which is very encouraging. When you feel anxious in those situations, what thoughts cross your mind?

User: Sometimes I worry that people will judge me or that I won’t fit in. I have to remind myself that I’ve been through a lot and I have every right to be there.

Consultant: That’s a strong realization, Eve. It’s important to acknowledge your journey. When you find yourself thinking that way, how does it affect your emotions or behaviors?

User: I think it makes me hesitate before joining conversations. I feel this sense of self-doubt creeping in, but I try to push through it because I really want to connect.

Consultant: It's great to hear you're pushing through those challenges. Questioning those self-doubts can help you when you encounter them again. What evidence do you have that supports these negative thoughts?

User: I guess there isn't much concrete evidence. Most of the time, people are welcoming, and I do have things to share.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you’re recognizing the disconnect between your thoughts and reality. If your friend were in your position, what would you tell them in response to those self-doubts?

User: I’d tell them to focus on the people who support them and to remember that every experience is valuable, even if it's not perfect.

Consultant: That’s a lovely perspective! It seems like you have a good understanding of how to encourage yourself. To challenge those negative thoughts, would you be willing to try a small exercise in your next social situation to test your beliefs?

User: Sure! I’d love to know what you suggest.

Consultant: How about setting a simple goal for yourself to start a conversation with at least one new person next time? Notice how it feels and what thoughts come up.

User: I think I can do that. It will be a good way to push myself a bit!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Remember, it’s about taking little steps. Besides social activities, what other ways have you considered to maintain your mental health in the long run?

User: I’ve thought about joining a support group. I believe talking with others who have similar experiences could help me feel less alone.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent idea! Support groups can provide a strong sense of community. Would you like to explore some options for groups you might join?

User: Yes, I’d be interested in seeing what’s available. It would be nice to share and hear others' stories.

Consultant: Great! I can help you find some local support groups. Additionally, how about setting aside time each week for activities that make you feel happy and fulfilled? What activities come to mind?

User: I enjoy gardening and reading, so I could dedicate more time to those. They help me relax and focus.

Consultant: Wonderful choices! Allocating time for things you love can really enhance your mood. Let’s create a plan to ensure you have dedicated time each week for these activities.

User: That sounds good! I’d feel more motivated knowing I have set times for these.

Consultant: Let’s also think about how to track your progress. Would it help for you to keep a journal of your feelings, activities, and any social interactions?

User: Absolutely! That could help me visualize my progress and keep me accountable.

Consultant: Great plan, Eve! Reflecting on your experiences can provide insights and reinforce the positive steps you're taking. As we wrap up today, what do you feel your biggest takeaway from our session is?

User: I think recognizing my progress and having a concrete plan for social interactions and self-care is my biggest takeaway. It feels empowering!

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Remember, you’ve come a long way, and it’s important to celebrate every small victory. If you continue to practice these strategies, I’m confident you’ll maintain this positive trajectory.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. I feel prepared for the next steps.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Eve! I believe in your ability to manage the challenges ahead. Whenever you need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!
