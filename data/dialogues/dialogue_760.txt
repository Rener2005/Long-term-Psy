Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad you're here today. You mentioned feeling anxious and a bit lost after starting college. Could you share more about what's been bothering you lately?

User: Hi. I've really been struggling to adjust to university life. The heat and my dorm environment feel so unfamiliar, and I'm feeling really lonely. It’s hard to focus on my studies, and I’m worried I won’t perform well.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like the transition has been quite overwhelming for you, especially with the added pressure of wanting to succeed academically. What specific thoughts or feelings come up for you when you try to study in this environment?

User: I keep thinking, "What if I can't keep up? What if I fail?" Those thoughts make me feel even more anxious, and I end up just staring at my books without really studying.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It's understandable to have those fears, especially in a new setting. Let’s take a moment to explore those thoughts closer. When you think, "What if I fail?" what emotions do you feel in your body?

User: I feel this tightness in my chest and my heart races. It’s like I can’t breathe for a second, and I just want to escape the situation.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling that physical reaction to stress. It’s common for anxiety to manifest in our bodies like that. Now, let’s try to identify the patterns in your thinking. Could you describe a time when you felt this way lately?

User: Well, last week during orientation, everyone seemed to know each other, and I felt left out. I thought, "They’ll never accept me," which made me even more withdrawn.

Consultant: That’s a painful experience, feeling isolated like that. It seems like your thought, "They'll never accept me," contributes to your loneliness. Can we challenge that thought together? What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts this belief?

User: I guess I don’t really know them yet. But sometimes I overhear them laughing and it feels like they’re not including me.

Consultant: It’s completely rational to feel excluded when you witness that. However, it's also possible that they simply don’t know you yet. If a friend faced a similar situation, what might you advise them?

User: I would probably tell them to try to engage with others more and not to assume they won’t be welcome.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a supportive thought to consider. Could we explore some actions you might take to connect with others despite your fears?

User: Maybe I could join a club or participate in events where I can meet new people.

Consultant: That's a great idea, Liu! Engaging in activities can provide opportunities to connect with others who share your interests. What would be a first step you would feel comfortable taking this week?

User: I think I could try attending a club meeting—I saw a flyer for a sports club that sounds interesting.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step! Engaging in a shared activity not only allows you to meet people but also gives you a common ground to connect on. What do you think you might do to prepare for that meeting so you feel more at ease?

User: I might practice what I could say to introduce myself and keep in mind that everyone else is also looking to make friends.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Practicing what to say can help ease your nerves, and framing it as a shared experience can lessen the pressure. How do you feel about this plan overall?

User: I feel a bit excited but also nervous. It’s a mix of emotions, I guess.

Consultant: That’s completely normal! It’s good to feel excited about the possibility of meeting new friends while also being aware of the nerves. What can you do if those anxious feelings start to rise before the event?

User: I could try some deep breathing exercises or remind myself that it’s just a friendly gathering.

Consultant: That's a wonderful approach. Deep breathing can be soothing, and reminding yourself that it’s about making connections can shift your focus away from fear. How often do you think you can practice this deep breathing technique, even in daily situations?

User: I think I can try to do it regularly, maybe even a few times a day to prepare myself mentally.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, and it can definitely help with anxiety management. Remember, every little step counts. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on what you’ve learned and how you can apply it. What do you think your biggest takeaway is?

User: I think it’s recognizing my negative thoughts and understanding that I can take actionable steps to change how I feel about my situation.

Consultant: Absolutely, that’s a powerful takeaway! You've made great strides today. As you prepare for the club meeting, remember you have the ability to challenge those negative thoughts and take steps toward creating positive interactions. How do you feel about your readiness for what’s ahead?

User: I feel slightly more confident, but I know I still have some self-doubt. I hope I can keep this momentum going.

Consultant: It’s natural to have some lingering doubts, but your willingness to engage is already a significant step forward. Keep reminding yourself of the tools and strategies we discussed. If you face challenges, we can always review them together in our next session. Thank you for sharing today, Liu!

User: Thank you for helping me. I’m looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today's session. I want to start by checking in with you. How have you been feeling lately, especially with the new academic requirements?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite anxious. The new course selection system is really different from what I'm used to, and I find myself questioning my academic abilities a lot. It’s overwhelming.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure and self-doubt. Let’s explore that further. Can you share what specific thoughts come to mind when you question your abilities?

User: I keep thinking that maybe I’m not as smart as I thought. I worry that I won't keep up with my classmates, and that makes me feel really stressed.

Consultant: I can understand how these thoughts can lead to anxiety. It’s important to recognize those feelings. When you think you're not as smart as others, how does that impact your emotions or actions?

User: I become really hesitant to participate in class or join study groups. I just feel like I shouldn’t be there, like I’m not good enough.

Consultant: That hesitation is a common response when feeling uncertain. Let’s try to challenge that belief a bit. How much evidence do you have for the thought that you're not good enough? Can we consider some counterpoints?

User: Well, I guess I've done well in my classes before. I do my assignments on time, and my teachers have given me positive feedback in the past. 

Consultant: Those are all valid points! It sounds like you have a history of success. Would you say these positive experiences could suggest that you are capable of meeting the new challenges?

User: Yeah, I suppose thinking about my past successes does help a bit. But I still can't shake off that anxiety.

Consultant: That anxiety is understandable given the changes you're facing. Let’s think about setting some small, achievable goals for yourself regarding adapting to these new courses. What’s a small step you might take this week?

User: Maybe I could try to attend at least one study group? Just to see how it feels.

Consultant: That sounds like a great goal! Attending a study group could help you connect with others and regain some confidence. How will you prepare for that?

User: I think I could review the material beforehand. Just to feel a bit more prepared.

Consultant: Preparation is a solid plan! Additionally, how might you remind yourself of your strengths when you feel anxious about attending that group?

User: I could write down some of the accomplishments I’ve had. That might help boost my confidence when I start feeling doubt.

Consultant: That's an excellent strategy! Reflecting on your accomplishments can reinforce a more positive mindset. How do you feel about using those reminders in moments of doubt?

User: It might help me not to get too caught up in my worries. I could use that to remind myself that I’ve done well before.

Consultant: Exactly. You have the tools to support yourself. As we move forward, what do you think would be the next step you’d like to focus on after the study group?

User: If the study group goes well, I think I might want to try participating more in class discussions. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Engaging in class discussions can further build your confidence. How do you think you'll feel if you achieve that?

User: I guess it would make me feel a lot better to contribute. It’s just that first step that feels daunting.

Consultant: That first step can be challenging, but remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. If you feel comfortable, could you share how you might remind yourself to take that step when the anxiety arises?

User: I could tell myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that everyone is learning together. 

Consultant: Absolutely, that mindset can be very liberating. Mistakes are a part of the learning process. How does that perspective shift make you feel?

User: It feels less scary thinking about it that way. I might actually try to raise my hand if I feel ready.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful shift in perspective! Now, let’s talk about the feelings of loneliness you mentioned last time. How are you feeling about social connections at this point?

User: I still feel a bit lonely, especially when I see others forming groups. I think being part of a group might help.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re recognizing the importance of connection. Starting with the study group is a perfect way to build that sense of belonging. Have you thought about other ways to connect with peers?

User: Maybe I could join a club. I’ve always been interested in art, so I might check out the art club.

Consultant: Joining a club is an excellent idea! It’s a great way to meet people with similar interests. How do you think joining the art club might affect your feelings of loneliness?

User: I think it would help a lot, actually. I would be around people who share a passion, and it might make it easier to connect with them.

Consultant: That sounds promising! Sharing interests with others can definitely ease feelings of isolation. As we wrap up today, I’d love to hear how you’re feeling about the steps we've discussed.

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I have a plan to try the study group and explore the art club. I think I can do this!

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! You’ve made some significant strides today in recognizing your strengths and planning for connection. Remember, it’s about taking one step at a time. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed again, you can always revisit these strategies. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello Liu! It's great to see you today. Before we get started, I want to check in on how you’ve been feeling since our last session. What has been on your mind recently?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite lonely lately. Since I've adjusted my schedule, I haven't been participating in group activities much, and it’s affecting my studies. I guess I just feel a bit lost.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you’re experiencing a sense of isolation and perhaps some anxiety about keeping up with your studies. Can you tell me a bit more about how not participating in those activities has impacted your feelings or your studying?

User: Well, it feels like I'm missing out on a lot. I used to enjoy working in groups, but now I just feel disconnected, and it’s hard to concentrate on my work. I'm worried that my grades might drop because I’m not as engaged.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. You care a lot about your studies and the connections you have with others. Can you share what thoughts go through your mind when you think about joining group activities again? 

User: I often think that maybe they don't need me, or that I won't fit in. Sometimes I wonder if they would even notice if I wasn't there.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really tough to deal with. It seems like you’re feeling uncertain about your place in those groups. Let’s reflect on those thoughts—do you think there's any evidence that supports them? 

User: I guess not really. I mean, I've had friends in the past, and it went well. But my mind just jumps to the negative before I even try.

Consultant: That’s a common pattern, where our minds can quickly lean toward negative conclusions. You mentioned feeling like you wouldn’t fit in—what would you think if a friend said they felt the same way about joining a group? 

User: I would probably tell them to give it a shot anyway, that it’s worth trying. 

Consultant: Exactly! You would encourage them because you see their potential and value. What if we applied that same perspective to your situation? How would it feel to challenge those negative thoughts?

User: It might help to think of it that way. I guess I could remind myself of my past experiences where I've connected with others.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! Maybe we could create a plan to help gradually ease back into those group settings. What are some small steps you might be comfortable with to engage more socially this week?

User: I could try reaching out to a few classmates and see if they want to study together, I think that could work.

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! You are taking an active step and seeking connection. How does it make you feel to think about reaching out to them?

User: Honestly, a bit nervous. But also a little excited, I think it could be beneficial.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous, but it's wonderful to hear that you're also feeling some excitement! Sometimes those nerves can mean that something positive is happening. How about setting a specific time to reach out to them? 

User: Maybe I could message a couple of them tomorrow. 

Consultant: Perfect! Setting that intention is a good idea. After you reach out, let’s discuss how it went in our next session. It will be a chance to reflect on your experience and how you felt about it.

User: Sure! I like that plan. 

Consultant: Great! Also, if you find that connecting with them goes well, think about how you might continue building those connections moving forward. How do you feel about that idea?

User: I think it would be good to keep cultivating those relationships. 

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s all about taking small steps in the direction of building those social ties. Do you want to brainstorm any activities you could suggest for your group, once you reconnect?

User: That sounds useful. Maybe I could suggest a group study session or some casual hangout to help break the ice.

Consultant: Excellent suggestions! Social events like study sessions or hangouts can help ease the pressure of forming connections. How confident do you feel about proposing those ideas when the time comes?

User: I think I could manage that. Knowing I have a plan makes it easier.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Having a plan certainly helps reduce anxiety. Remember, it’s also okay to start small and see how it goes. As we wrap up today, is there anything else you’d like to explore before our next session?

User: I think we've covered a lot. I feel more optimistic about trying these new steps. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Reflecting on what we've discussed today, what do you think is your biggest takeaway?

User: I believe it's about challenging my negative thoughts and taking small actions to build my social connections.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! Remember, it's a process, and taking those steps can lead to meaningful changes. You’re doing great, Liu. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and am looking forward to sharing how it goes. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m excited for you too. Take care, and see you in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you today. Before we dive into our session, how have you been feeling since our last talk?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit uncertain. I tried to join an interest club, but I didn't connect with the members as I'd hoped. It left me questioning my social skills.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're feeling disappointed about your attempts to connect with others in the club. That’s understandable. Let's explore this further—what specific thoughts or feelings come to mind when you reflect on that experience?

User: I keep thinking maybe I'm just not good at making friends. It makes me feel embarrassed and a bit isolated.

Consultant: Those feelings of embarrassment and isolation can be really tough to handle. It’s helpful that you’re acknowledging them. Can you share more about what you were thinking in those moments when you felt you weren’t connecting with others?

User: I thought everyone else was so friendly and engaged, and I felt like an outsider, like I didn’t belong there. 

Consultant: That must have been hard for you. It sounds like you felt quite disconnected. Do you think there are any specific negative thoughts linked to those feelings of being an outsider?

User: I guess I thought, "If they don’t talk to me, it means they don’t like me." That's pretty discouraging.

Consultant: That's a common thought pattern. It seems you're interpreting their silence as a rejection. Let’s challenge that thought—do you have any evidence that supports or contradicts this belief?

User: Well, I don’t really know them well, and they might just be shy too. But I often jump to the conclusion that it’s all about me.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re able to see that perspective! Sometimes, our minds can lead us to assume that we are the cause of others' behavior without considering other possibilities. How would you feel if you were to approach the situation as if the other members might just be shy?

User: I think I’d feel a little more at ease. It would make me less hard on myself.

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing that they might be feeling similar can help create a more compassionate viewpoint towards yourself. What if you tried to engage with them again, keeping that perspective in mind?

User: That could help. I might approach someone during casual moments instead of waiting for group discussions.

Consultant: That's a proactive approach! Also, have you thought about setting small social goals? For instance, aim for starting a conversation with one person in the next meeting.

User: That sounds manageable. Just talking to one person feels less intimidating than trying to join a group conversation.

Consultant: Absolutely! Small steps can lead to bigger changes. And if you face some awkward moments, that’s perfectly normal. What strategy can we create to help you cope if things don’t go as planned? 

User: I could remind myself that it's okay to be awkward, and not every interaction has to be perfect.

Consultant: Exactly, that's a healthy mindset to adopt! How about we practice that thought together? Whenever you feel anxious about an interaction, what could you say to yourself to ease that tension?

User: Maybe I could say, "It's okay to be myself, and this is a learning experience."

Consultant: I love that! It’s a positive and realistic affirmation. Transitioning from self-doubt to self-acceptance is a big step. How do you feel about trying this affirmation before your next club meeting? 

User: I feel more hopeful. I can see how this might help me approach the situation differently.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Another practical way to build confidence is through role-playing potential conversations. Would you like to practice a situation you might encounter in the club?

User: Sure, that might make me feel more prepared!

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you approach someone during a break. How would you initiate that conversation? 

User: Maybe I could say, “Hey, I’m Liu. I’m new to this club and wanted to see how everyone’s finding it so far?”

Consultant: That’s a perfect opener! It’s friendly and invites a response. If the conversation flows, how might you continue it?

User: I could ask what they’re interested in within the club—like their favorite activities or experiences.

Consultant: Exactly! Asking questions is a great way to keep a conversation going. Preparing these kinds of dialogues can definitely ease your anxiety. 

User: Yes, I feel less afraid of stumbling over words now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Increasing your comfort in social situations will come with practice. By the next time we meet, maybe you can share how your interactions went.

User: I’ll definitely try to keep practicing and have that positive mindset!

Consultant: It sounds like you’re on the right path, Liu! Before we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ve gained. What do you think will be your biggest takeaway from this session?

User: I think recognizing my negative thoughts and having a plan for how to manage them has been really helpful.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight! Remember to be gentle with yourself and reflect on your progress. You're more capable than you realize. 

User: Thank you, I appreciate that! I look forward to trying these strategies.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I believe in your ability to grow and thrive in social situations. If you ever feel overwhelmed, remember you’re welcome to come back anytime. 

User: I will. Thank you for your support! 

Consultant: It’s been a pleasure working with you today, Liu! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I’m glad to see you again. Last time, we talked about your successful presentation and how that made you feel more confident. How have you been since then?

User: Hi! I've felt a bit more confident about participating in activities, but I still get anxious when facing new social situations. It’s frustrating because I want to keep that positive momentum going.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that your confidence has increased! It’s completely normal to feel anxious in new social situations, especially when you want to maintain that positive experience. Can you share a specific situation where you felt anxious recently?

User: I attended a club meeting this week. I was excited at first, but once I got there, I felt really out of place and nervous about speaking up.

Consultant: That sounds challenging! Feeling out of place can certainly heighten anxiety. What thoughts were going through your mind at the time that made you feel out of place?

User: I kept thinking that everyone was more outgoing than me, and I worried that I wouldn’t contribute anything valuable to the conversation.

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like you were comparing yourself to others and feeling that pressure. It's common to think negatively in these moments. Can we explore how these thoughts affected your feelings during the meeting?

User: Well, those thoughts made me feel really self-conscious, and instead of joining in, I just stayed quiet. I didn't want to embarrass myself.

Consultant: That makes sense. Staying quiet often feels like a safer choice when facing anxiety. But let's consider if there's any evidence to support those negative thoughts. Do you think everyone in the meeting was indeed more outgoing than you?

User: Maybe not everyone… I have seen some members struggle to speak up too. But I just can’t shake the feeling that I don’t fit in.

Consultant: It’s insightful that you recognize others also face similar struggles. This suggests that your concerns may not be entirely accurate. If one of your friends were in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has different strengths, and it’s okay not to always be the center of attention.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you have an understanding of self-acceptance and the diversity of strengths. How can we apply that perspective to your own feelings of not fitting in?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s okay to contribute in my own way, even if it’s not loud or flashy.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization! Let’s develop a plan. When you feel anxious about speaking next time, could you take a deep breath, remind yourself of this, and perhaps prepare a few points you’d like to share?

User: That sounds like a good idea! I could even write them down before the meeting.

Consultant: Writing them down can be very helpful. It prepares you and may reduce some of the anxiety. Let’s talk about how you can gradually expose yourself to more social situations. Can you think of a low-pressure gathering you could join soon?

User: There’s a casual coffee meet-up of the club members next week. It seems friendly, so I think I could try that.

Consultant: That’s a great choice! It’s less formal, and you can approach it with a lighter mindset. How would you like to prepare for this meet-up?

User: I could set a goal to talk to at least one person for a few minutes and focus on listening more than talking.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! Focusing on listening can help reduce the pressure you place on yourself to contribute extensively. What do you think you might feel or think when you successfully engage in conversation?

User: I think I’d feel proud of myself for stepping out of my comfort zone. It might also help me feel more connected to others.

Consultant: Exactly! That sense of connection and accomplishment will reinforce your positive experiences. Let’s also talk about how you can reflect on these interactions afterward. What can you do to remind yourself of the success you’ve had?

User: I could keep a journal about these experiences, noting what went well and how I felt afterward.

Consultant: That’s a perfect strategy! Journaling can help you track your progress and celebrate the small wins. Before we finish today, let’s briefly summarize what you plan to work on for the next week.

User: I’ll attend the coffee meet-up, set a goal to engage with one person, and keep a journal of my experiences and feelings.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Liu! You’re taking proactive steps to reinforce your confidence and social skills. I'm proud of you! Remember, it’s a process, and you’re doing great. 

User: Thank you! I feel more optimistic about trying these strategies. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Keep in mind the tools we discussed, and feel free to reach out if you need any support. I’m confident you’re going to do well.

User: I appreciate your help! I’m looking forward to our next session. 

Consultant: Me too! We can reflect on your experiences and continue building upon your progress. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good actually. I successfully organized a small study group and got to know some classmates better. It’s been a nice change.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made some great strides in your social interactions. How has this impacted your overall confidence?

User: My confidence has definitely improved. I feel more assured in conversations, and I actually enjoy being around people now.

Consultant: That's a significant improvement! It's great to see you enjoying social interactions. Can you share more about how you've managed to establish these new connections?

User: I made an effort to reach out and invite people for group studies. At first, I was nervous, but everyone seemed interested and it all just clicked.

Consultant: It takes courage to reach out like that, and it's fantastic that you took that initiative. How do you feel when you’re in these study group settings?

User: It feels quite rewarding. I appreciate the support, and I think they value my input, which boosts my self-esteem even more.

Consultant: That sense of appreciation is really important for social connections. What strategies do you think you can employ to maintain and expand these relationships moving forward?

User: I think I can push myself to organize more group activities and maybe even suggest hanging out outside of study sessions. 

Consultant: Those are some proactive steps! How do you think expanding these activities will affect your confidence and social skills?

User: I believe it will help me feel even more comfortable. Each time I step outside my comfort zone, I feel more capable of handling social interactions.

Consultant: Absolutely! Each small step contributes to your overall growth. What else are you hoping to achieve socially in the near future?

User: I’d like to become better at forming deeper connections, not just casual acquaintances. It seems meaningful to have friends I can really talk to.

Consultant: Deepening connections can indeed lead to more fulfilling relationships. What do you think are the qualities you would look for in these deeper friendships?

User: I want friends who are supportive and understanding. It’s important to me to be able to share my thoughts and feelings openly.

Consultant: Those qualities are key to healthy relationships. How might you approach finding people who share those qualities?

User: I might start by being more open about my own thoughts and feelings in conversations, to see who responds positively.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Sharing your own experiences can invite others to open up as well. Do you have any specific situations in mind where you'd like to practice this openness?

User: Maybe during our next study session. I could share my challenges with certain subjects and see how others relate.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! It can foster a supportive environment. How do you feel about attempting that?

User: I feel a bit anxious but also excited. I think it will help not just me, but my classmates too.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel anxious about being open, but it can create stronger bonds. What’s a small step you could take before that session to prepare yourself?

User: I could jot down a few things I want to share ahead of time. It would help me feel less nervous.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Preparing ahead can definitely help ease anxiety. Are there any other social skills you’re interested in developing further?

User: Yes, I’d like to be better at initiating conversations and keeping them flowing. Sometimes I struggle with what to say next.

Consultant: Initiating and maintaining conversations is a valuable skill. Practicing some topics in advance can help you feel more confident. What common interests do you think you could discuss with your classmates?

User: Music and movies are always safe topics. Many of them talk about new releases, so I could join those discussions.

Consultant: Great choice! Those topics tend to be engaging and relatable. How do you feel about approaching those conversations in your next interactions?

User: I feel optimistic! I think I can contribute to those topics and connect better with my classmates.

Consultant: That optimism is a wonderful mindset to have. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize your progress and future goals. You’ve successfully expanded your social circle and have plans for deeper connections, correct?

User: Yes, exactly! I feel proud of what I’ve accomplished so far.

Consultant: You should be proud! You've made significant progress. Moving forward, remember to be open, share your thoughts, and engage in activities to foster these connections. Do you have any final thoughts for today?

User: Just that I’m looking forward to trying out these strategies. Thank you for guiding me through this!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Liu! I believe you’re on a fantastic path. Remember that I’m here to support you whenever you need it. Take care until we meet again!

User: Thanks! I will. See you next time!
