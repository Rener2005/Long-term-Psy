Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you've come in for this session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty down actually. After that interview rejection, I've been questioning my abilities a lot. I can't shake the feeling of anxiety and uncertainty about my future.

Consultant: I understand it's been tough for you. It sounds like the rejection has really shaken your confidence. Can you share more about what thoughts or feelings come up for you when you think about that interview?

User: I keep thinking that I’m just not good enough. It makes me anxious about future interviews. I feel like I won’t be able to get a job after graduation. 

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite heavy for you, making you feel anxious about what's ahead. Let’s explore those feelings a bit more. What specific thoughts about yourself come up when you think about your abilities?

User: I think things like, "I’ll never get hired" or "Everyone else is better than me." It feels really discouraging.

Consultant: I hear you. Those thoughts can be really overwhelming. Let’s take a moment to challenge those beliefs. What evidence do you have to support the idea that you won't get hired? 

User: Well, I didn’t get that job, so it feels like proof. I guess I’m just not qualified. 

Consultant: That’s understandable. It can feel like one setback means more failures are on the way. But one interview doesn't define your worth or abilities. Have you considered any other experiences that demonstrate your capabilities?

User: I’ve had good grades in my courses, and I've completed practical projects at school. But those don’t seem to count as much in the real world.

Consultant: It’s great to acknowledge your academic success and practical experiences. Those are significant accomplishments! How might you view your situation if you were thinking of a friend instead of yourself? 

User: If it were my friend, I’d probably tell them that one rejection doesn’t mean they aren't qualified and that they should keep trying.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s often easier to be compassionate towards others than ourselves. Let’s work on applying that same kindness to you. How would you change the narrative you tell yourself about being “not good enough”?

User: I guess I could say that rejections are part of the process and that I still have something to offer. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent shift in perspective! Recognizing that setbacks are common can help ease the pressure. What’s one small step you could take moving forward to reinforce that new perspective?

User: Maybe I could practice for more interviews or find feedback from previous ones to improve? 

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing for interviews sounds like a constructive step. It could help build confidence. What feelings do you think that might bring up for you?

User: It might make me feel a little more prepared and less anxious. 

Consultant: That’s a positive realization! Preparation can definitely help in reducing anxiety. How about we discuss some techniques to manage anxiety before your next interview? 

User: I would like that. I often feel paralyzed by fear. 

Consultant: A common response! One effective technique is deep breathing. It helps calm your nervous system. Would you like to try a quick breathing exercise together now?

User: Sure, I’d be open to that!

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in... hold it... and now gently breathe out. Let's do this a few times together. How does that feel?

User: It feels a bit better. I already feel a little calmer. 

Consultant: Excellent! Practicing this regularly can create a sense of calm in high-pressure moments. How do you feel about incorporating this into your routine?

User: I think that could really help me. I want to give it a try. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful choice! Remember, it’s about taking one step at a time. We can also set realistic goals for your job search. What’s a manageable goal you’d like to set for the next week?

User: I could aim to research job openings and see if I can prepare for an actual interview this time. 

Consultant: Perfect! Researching and preparing is a great way to regain control. It will help build your confidence as well. What emotions do you think might surface as you work on this goal?

User: I can see some excitement bubbling up, but I’m still a bit scared too.

Consultant: That makes total sense! A mix of excitement and fear is entirely normal. As you advance, remember to celebrate small progress along the way. How do you think you can celebrate these achievements?

User: I could reward myself by doing something fun or treating myself to a nice meal.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely idea! Celebrating your efforts will reinforce your positive steps. As we wrap up today’s session, what’s one key takeaway you want to hold onto?

User: I want to remember that rejections don’t define me and to keep practicing for interviews. 

Consultant: That's a powerful takeaway, Li! Embracing that mindset can truly transform your experience. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed again, don’t hesitate to reach out. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel a bit lighter now. Thanks for helping me see things differently.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You've made valuable progress today. Remember, it’s okay to feel anxious, but you're capable of managing it. Looking forward to seeing how you do in the next session!

Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you're here for our session today. To start, I’d like to understand how you’ve been feeling as we get closer to graduation. What’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious about job hunting. With graduation approaching, I just can't shake the feeling of pressure. I feel useless after being rejected in a recent interview, and now I'm not sure what to do next.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing intense pressure about your future, especially after the rejection. I want you to know that it’s completely normal to feel this way during this transition. Can you describe what specific thoughts are running through your mind related to this anxiety?

User: I often think that if I can’t find a job soon, it means I’m not good enough. I feel like I'm failing, and seeing my classmates moving forward just makes it worse for me.

Consultant: I see how those thoughts are weighing heavily on you. You’re comparing yourself to others and feeling inadequate as a result. Let’s take a moment to explore that belief. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you are not good enough?

User: Well, I didn’t do well in my last interview, and it feels like I'm not getting any callbacks for other jobs. It just confirms that I'm not capable.

Consultant: It’s understandable that those experiences feel discouraging. However, let’s consider this: Is it possible that those rejections do not define your worth or your potential? What would you say to a friend if they were in a similar situation, feeling down about their abilities after some setbacks?

User: I would tell them that it happens to everyone, and it doesn’t mean they aren’t good enough. I guess I have to remember that for myself too.

Consultant: That’s a great reflection. It’s important to apply that same compassion to yourself. Can we explore how you might shift your mindset? Perhaps focusing on your strengths and past successes could be helpful. Do you remember any accomplishments or positive experiences from your studies or other areas of your life that made you proud?

User: There was a time when I did well on a project last semester, and my teacher praised my work. It felt really good. But that feels so far away now.

Consultant: That was a significant achievement! It shows you are capable and have strengths. Let’s try to hold onto that feeling and build from it. How about we set some small, achievable goals for your job search? This could help you regain a sense of control and progress.

User: I think that could help. I just need some guidance on where to start because it all feels overwhelming.

Consultant: Absolutely, we can break this down together. First, let’s identify one aspect of job hunting that feels manageable. Maybe it’s updating your resume or researching companies you’re interested in. What do you feel comfortable starting with?

User: I could try updating my resume. I haven’t done that in a while.

Consultant: That’s a perfect place to start! How about we set a timeline for that? When do you think you could have a draft ready for us to review together?

User: I can probably have it ready by the end of the week. I’ll work on it.

Consultant: That sounds great, Li! Setting a timeline helps create a path forward. Along the way, I encourage you to note any positive feedback you receive, even if it’s just a small compliment from someone. It can be uplifting and reinforce your confidence as you prepare for interviews.

User: I will try to remember to do that. It’s just hard to keep that in mind when rejection feels so prominent.

Consultant: I understand. Rejection can overshadow the positives, but practicing awareness of your successes is crucial. Can you commit to noticing any positive feedback for even one week?

User: Yes, I’ll challenge myself to do that.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic commitment! It’s about those small wins adding up over time. As you work through this process, remember that it’s not just about the outcome, but also about the steps you are taking. Each step counts. 

User: Thank you. I really appreciate your encouragement. 

Consultant: You’re welcome, Li! It’s important to recognize that you’re making progress. Now, as we talk about your job search, how do you feel about facing potential interviews again? 

User: I feel nervous just thinking about it. The thought of another rejection is scary.

Consultant: That’s completely valid. Facing potential rejection can be intimidating. Let’s try a small visual exercise—imagine yourself in an interview where you’re calm, confident, and answering questions well. What would that look like for you?

User: I can see myself smiling, answering questions clearly, and feeling more relaxed.

Consultant: That’s a powerful visualization! It’s a reminder of your ability to perform well. We can explore techniques to help you manage anxiety before and during interviews, so it doesn’t drown out your strengths. Are you open to that?

User: Yes, I would like that. 

Consultant: Great! One approach we could consider is practicing deep breathing techniques to help calm those nerves. Do you practice any relaxation methods currently?

User: Not really, I just feel overwhelmed when I think about everything.

Consultant: I understand. Let’s try to introduce a simple method. Would you be willing to practice a few deep breaths with me now? It can help you feel more grounded.

User: Sure, I can do that.

Consultant: Okay, let’s take a moment. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold for a moment, then exhale gently through your mouth for a count of six. Ready? We can do this together.

User: *after practicing* That actually did help a little. I feel slightly calmer.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Li! That’s a great tool you can use whenever you feel overwhelmed. This will serve as an anchor to help you stay calm during interviews or stressful situations. 

User: I hope so. I guess I need to start integrating these practices into my routine.

Consultant: Exactly! Consistency will help embed these techniques into your daily life. And remember, it’s perfectly okay to seek support when things feel tough. You’ve already taken a positive step by coming here today. 

User: Thank you. I feel like I can approach things differently now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! As we wrap up today's session, let’s summarize our plan moving forward. You’ll work on updating your resume, practice noticing positive feedback, and implement deep breathing techniques. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I’ll do my best.

Consultant: I believe in you, Li! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. And remember, it’s okay to have ups and downs along the way. You’re not alone in this journey.

User: Thank you for all your help. I really appreciate it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and I’ll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hi there! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, not great. I've been quite anxious about my job opportunities. There are so many paths I could take, and I just don't know which one is right for me. It's overwhelming.

Consultant: I understand that feeling of being overwhelmed can be really tough. It sounds like the uncertainty is causing you a lot of stress. Can you share more about what specific thoughts or worries come to your mind when you think about these job opportunities?

User: Sure. I often think about how if I choose the wrong job, I’ll be wasting my time and that I might end up unhappy. Sometimes I feel like I’m not good enough for any of these positions because of my recent performance.

Consultant: It sounds like you're dealing with some really heavy thoughts about your self-worth and job choices. When you mention feeling "not good enough," what emotions does that bring up for you?

User: I feel frustrated and anxious. It’s like this voice in my head tells me I’ll fail, and it makes me doubt myself even more.

Consultant: That inner voice can be quite powerful and can really affect how you feel. What do you think are the biggest fears you have regarding failure in this job-hunting process?

User: I'm scared of getting rejected again, especially after failing the last interview. I worry that people will think I’m not capable or that I wouldn't fit in.

Consultant: It's completely normal to fear rejection, especially after a negative experience. But let’s try to look at evidence—what can we say about your abilities and your past successes that may contradict this fear of not being capable?

User: Well, I did manage to pass my courses even when things were tough, and I have some skills I’ve developed in school. But I guess I just don’t feel confident about applying them in a work environment.

Consultant: It’s great that you’ve recognized those achievements! Your ability to pass your courses shows that you have resilience and skills. What if we shift our focus a bit? Instead of thinking of what might go wrong in a job, how could we frame your skills and experiences positively when considering your options?

User: I suppose I could think of my skills in a more positive light, like seeing the learning process as part of my journey rather than just focusing on the outcome.

Consultant: Exactly! That shift can help reduce anxiety and allow for a more constructive reflection on your experiences. Now, can you think of specific strengths you’ve developed through your studies or activities that you can bring into a job?

User: I suppose I’m good at teamwork and learning quickly. I’ve worked on group projects that went well, and I’m also adaptable to new situations.

Consultant: Those are fantastic qualities to have! Adaptability and teamwork are highly valued in many roles. Given those strengths, would you be open to exploring job opportunities that could allow you to utilize these skills?

User: Yes, I would be open to that. I just need to remind myself of my strengths when I feel anxious.

Consultant: That's a solid plan. How about we create some practical strategies to remind yourself of these strengths when you're preparing for interviews? 

User: I'm thinking maybe I could write them down and review them before each interview.

Consultant: Writing them down is a great idea! You could even practice saying them out loud or visualizing yourself succeeding in those roles. Would that approach resonate with you?

User: Yes, I think it would help me feel more prepared and less anxious.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let's also discuss any upcoming interviews. How are you feeling about them right now?

User: I’m feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety. I want to do well, but the pressure feels heavy.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel that way with something important ahead. Let’s think together about some techniques you can use to cope with that anxiety right before an interview.

User: Maybe some breathing exercises? I’ve heard those can help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Deep breathing exercises can be very effective in calming nerves. Would you like to try a simple breathing technique we can practice together?

User: Yes, I’d love that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s try this: Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold it for a count of four, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of four. We can do this a few times together. 

User: Okay, let’s do it. 

Consultant: Let's begin together... (Conduct breathing exercise). How do you feel after practicing that?

User: I feel a bit calmer. I think I could use this before my interviews.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re already building some tools to manage your anxiety. Remember, each small step counts towards feeling more prepared.

User: Thank you. I can see that now. I really want to focus on these strategies moving forward.

Consultant: That commitment is key! As we wrap up today, let's summarize your takeaways. You’ve identified your strengths, planned to write them down, and practiced a breathing technique. How does it feel to leave the session today with these new insights?

User: It feels hopeful. I’m still anxious, but I think I have more ways to handle it.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! Trust in your abilities and remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process. If you ever need support again, don't hesitate to reach out. 

User: I really appreciate your help. I’ll do my best with this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in you, and I look forward to hearing about your progress. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Well, I'm still quite anxious about the upcoming interview. It’s really bothering me, and I can’t seem to focus on preparing.

Consultant: I completely understand. It sounds like the anticipation of the interview is weighing heavily on your mind. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts or feelings come up for you when you think about the interview?

User: I keep thinking that I might not be good enough, and that I’ll probably mess it up. It's frustrating because I want to perform well, but these thoughts just keep creeping in.

Consultant: It's tough when those negative thoughts take hold, especially with something as important as a job interview. Let's explore these thoughts a bit more. When you say you might not be good enough, what evidence comes to mind that supports this belief?

User: I mean, I’ve had some interviews in the past where I didn’t feel like I did well. Plus, I know my classmates have had better experiences than I have.

Consultant: It’s natural to compare ourselves to others, but it can often lead to feelings of inadequacy. What if we looked at this situation a little differently? If a friend were to tell you they felt the same way, how would you encourage them to think about their abilities?

User: I guess I would tell them to focus on their strengths and remind them that everyone has off days. Maybe I should try to do that too.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective! Focusing on your strengths can help shift your mindset. Can you identify some strengths or skills that you possess that could be beneficial in an interview setting?

User: I’ve always been good at problem-solving and I can communicate my ideas well once I get comfortable. 

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Those are solid strengths. Now, let’s address the physical sensations you’re experiencing, like the cold hands and headaches. Relaxation techniques can be very helpful in managing these symptoms. Would you be open to trying some simple breathing exercises together?

User: Yes, I think that could help. I’ve heard about breathing exercises before, but I’ve never really practiced them.

Consultant: No problem! Let’s give it a go. I’ll guide you through a simple technique. Sit comfortably and take a deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs completely. Hold it for a moment... and now slowly exhale through your mouth. Let’s do this a few times together.

User: Okay, I’m trying. Deep breath in... and out. 

Consultant: Good! How do you feel after a few rounds of that?

User: It feels a bit calming. I can definitely feel the tension easing up a little.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Regular practice of these techniques can really help reduce anxiety over time. Let’s incorporate this into your daily routine, especially leading up to the interview. What do you think?

User: That sounds like a good plan. I’ll practice daily and see how it goes.

Consultant: Excellent! Now, let’s simulate a part of the interview. I’ll ask you a common interview question, and you can practice responding. This can help build your confidence. Ready?

User: Sure, let’s do it!

Consultant: Great! Here’s a question: “Can you tell me about a time when you faced a significant challenge and how you dealt with it?”

User: Hmm, I think I can talk about a project I worked on last semester. There were a lot of problems, but I tried to coordinate with my team to figure it out...

Consultant: That’s a good start! You mentioned problem-solving and teamwork—those are valuable skills in any setting. Would you like to elaborate on how you managed communication with your team during that challenge?

User: Yeah, I set up regular meetings, and it really helped us stay on track. I also encouraged everyone to share their ideas, which made us more united.

Consultant: Excellent! You're showing leadership qualities. Are there other experiences you believe you could highlight in the interview that demonstrate your skills?

User: I guess I could also mention my volunteer work. I learned a lot about organizing events, which involved a lot of planning.

Consultant: That's fantastic! Highlighting various experiences can give your interviewers a well-rounded view of your capabilities. How do you feel about sharing these stories now compared to when we first started?

User: I feel a bit more confident now. It’s nice to have a few examples ready to go.

Consultant: That’s a significant step forward! As we near the end of our session, let’s summarize what we’ve worked on today. You’ve identified your strengths, begun practicing relaxation techniques, and have prepared some examples for your interview. 

User: Yes, that sounds right. I feel more prepared than before.

Consultant: Wonderful! Before we finish up, let’s discuss how you can maintain this progress. What strategies can you use to stay calm and confident leading up to the interview?

User: I’ll keep practicing the breathing exercises, and I’ll also remember to focus on my strengths, not just on past failures.

Consultant: Those are great strategies, Li! I believe you have the tools to handle this situation. If you encounter more worries, just remember to reach out or practice what we’ve discussed. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate this session. It has helped a lot.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, you’re not alone in this, and I’m here to support you. If you need anything, don’t hesitate to return. Good luck with your interview!

User: I will. Thanks again for your help!

Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm really glad to see you again. It sounds like you've gone through quite a journey recently with your interview experience. How are you feeling about everything right now?

User: Hi. I feel a bit relieved after the interview. It was stressful, but I learned a lot about myself and what I need to do moving forward. However, I still feel some anxiety about my future.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling some relief and that you found value in the experience. Anxiety about the future is something many people face. Can you tell me more about what specific aspects of your future are causing you worry?

User: Mostly, I'm worried about my career path. I'm unsure if I can find a job that will make a difference, especially given my recent performance issues. Sometimes I think I'm just not good enough.

Consultant: That feeling of not being good enough can be really tough to deal with. It might help to explore the accomplishments you've had, like the interview you just went through. What aspects of that experience made you feel good about yourself?

User: I felt accomplished for just completing the interview. I had worked hard to prepare, and I managed to answer questions I thought I wouldn't! I also felt proud that I faced my fears about the whole process.

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement, Li! Recognizing the hard work and courage you displayed is important. What do you think helped you prepare and succeed in answering the questions during the interview?

User: I think my preparation was key. I researched the company thoroughly and practiced my answers. That made me feel more confident when I was there.

Consultant: It sounds like preparation played a crucial role in your success. How can you utilize the strategies you learned from this experience in your future endeavors? 

User: I guess I could focus more on preparing for future interviews or opportunities. If I approach things with the same preparation and confidence, I might find success again.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a positive mindset. It sounds like you’re beginning to understand the importance of preparation. Can we discuss some specific steps you might take to continue this growth? 

User: Sure! I think I could set aside more time to practice interviews or work on my skills related to my career interests, maybe even get some feedback from others.

Consultant: Those sound like solid strategies. Seeking feedback is a powerful way to improve. How do you feel about connecting with others for support? 

User: I tend to keep to myself, but I realize I might need to reach out more to my classmates or teachers for guidance.

Consultant: That’s an insightful realization, Li. Building a supportive network can be very beneficial. How do you think you could start reaching out?

User: Maybe I could join some study groups or attend workshops. That would help me connect with others who are on similar paths.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Engaging in group activities can enhance your learning and boost confidence. How do you feel about these plans moving forward? 

User: I feel more hopeful about it. It seems manageable, and I can start with small steps.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Taking small, achievable steps can lead to significant improvements. Reflecting on your interview, what do you think is one of the most vital lessons you've learned?

User: I think the biggest lesson is that preparation really matters, and it can empower me to confront my challenges. 

Consultant: That's a powerful takeaway! How might you remind yourself of this lesson when anxiety starts to creep in again?

User: Maybe I could create a checklist or note for myself about what I need to prepare before facing any opportunity.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical approach! Having a visual reminder can reinforce your confidence. As we approach the end of our session, how do you feel about the progress you've made in our discussions today? 

User: I feel more confident, and I'm recognizing my strengths. It’s refreshing to talk about positive aspects and plans rather than just my worries.

Consultant: I’m really pleased to hear that, Li! Today we’ve focused on your achievements and how to leverage them for your future. What can you take away from our conversation to maintain this positive momentum? 

User: I think I’ll focus on preparation and reaching out for support. I feel like there are more avenues I can explore that might help me overall.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan, Li! Remember, you have learned valuable lessons, and it’s essential to keep reflecting on what you can do moving forward. For now, is there any final thought or question you have before we conclude?

User: I just want to say thank you. This has been really helpful in sorting out my thoughts and feelings.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad we could have this conversation. Remember, it's okay to seek help again when you need it. I’m confident you have the tools to manage your feelings. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Li! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello. I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I've started sharing my job-seeking experiences with classmates, and it feels good to help them. But sometimes, I still feel anxious and wonder if I'm really making progress.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling better and finding fulfillment in helping others! It sounds like you're beginning to regain some confidence. Can you share more about the experiences you had while helping your classmates and how that impacted your feelings?

User: Sure! When I shared what I learned from my job interviews, the feedback I got was really positive. It made me feel valuable, like I could actually contribute something. But I still worry that I won’t find a job that suits me.

Consultant: It's wonderful that you received positive feedback and that helping others gave you a sense of value. However, it's understandable to have concerns about your future. Can we explore what specifically worries you about finding a job? 

User: I think I'm just scared of more rejection. I've been feeling so anxious about my abilities lately, and I keep questioning if I'm good enough.

Consultant: That fear of rejection can be really overwhelming. Let's try to break that down. When you think about not being good enough, what evidence do you have that supports this thought? Can you recall any positive feedback or achievements that suggest otherwise?

User: Well, helping my classmates did feel good, and a few teachers have complimented my work before. But when it comes to interviews, I feel like I failed.

Consultant: It sounds like you have some positive experiences to draw from, even if they feel overshadowed by your interview experiences. How do you think you could reframe those interview experiences to see them from a different perspective?

User: I guess I could view them as learning opportunities rather than failures. I can focus on what I can improve for next time instead of just feeling defeated.

Consultant: That's a fantastic realization, Li! Viewing them as learning experiences can really help shift how you feel about the situation. What specific improvements can you imagine working on for your next opportunity?

User: Maybe practicing my answers more and trying to stay calm during the interviews. I could even ask a friend to help me with mock interviews.

Consultant: Those sound like practical strategies that could help you feel more prepared and confident. How do you think implementing these changes will affect your anxiety leading up to the next interview?

User: I think practicing could help a lot! If I feel ready, I might be less anxious. And it will help me feel more competent.

Consultant: Absolutely! Feeling more prepared can significantly reduce anxiety. As we move forward, how can you remind yourself of your strengths and accomplishments when you start feeling anxious about interviews again?

User: I could keep a journal of my achievements and positive feedback. That way, I can look back at it whenever I need a boost.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea, Li! Keeping a record of your accomplishments will serve as a great reminder of your abilities and growth. How are you feeling about your overall progress today?

User: I feel more hopeful. I think focusing on my strengths and preparing will help me feel more in control. 

Consultant: It's great to hear you feeling hopeful! Remember, it’s normal to have ups and downs. What steps can you take to maintain this positive mindset going forward?

User: I could set small goals for myself, like reaching out to more classmates for support and keeping up with my journal. 

Consultant: Those are excellent plans, and they’ll help create a supportive environment for your growth! As we wrap up today’s session, what do you think has been your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think it's realizing that I have strengths to build on and that I could be a lot kinder to myself in this process.

Consultant: That’s such an important insight, Li. Self-compassion can make a big difference in your journey. I want to encourage you to keep nurturing that mindset. Remember, you're capable, and you are making progress. If you face challenges, you can always come back and talk. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and encouragement. It feels good to know I have some strategies in place.

Consultant: You're welcome, Li! I believe in your ability to navigate these challenges. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress when we meet again!

User: Talk to you later!
