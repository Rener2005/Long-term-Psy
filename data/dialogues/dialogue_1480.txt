Consultant: Hello, Xiaojing! Thank you for coming in today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I feel like I'm just going through the motions. Everything seems pointless, and I still struggle with my self-harm. I know it’s not right, but it’s the only thing that helps me cope when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: I can see you're feeling quite overwhelmed and stuck in this cycle of self-harm. It's important that you have a space to express these feelings. Can you tell me more about what triggers those overwhelming moments for you?

User: Mostly, it happens when I feel really alone or when there's a lot of pressure from schoolwork. My parents argue a lot, and it makes me feel like I can't escape. I don't have many friends either, so I often feel isolated.

Consultant: It sounds like the environment and pressure you're dealing with really contribute to how you're feeling. The feeling of isolation can be particularly tough. What do you wish would change in these situations to help you feel less overwhelmed?

User: I just want to feel like I matter, like I'm doing something right. I want to be able to focus on my studies without all this anxiety piling up.

Consultant: I hear you. It’s crucial to feel valued and to have a sense of accomplishment, especially in your studies. Let's explore some techniques that may help you manage those feelings of anxiety better. Have you tried any coping strategies besides self-harm when you feel overwhelmed?

User: Not really. I sometimes just hide in my room or listen to music, but it doesn’t really help. The feelings always come back.

Consultant: It’s understandable that hiding or distracting yourself can only provide temporary relief. What if we started exploring some healthier coping strategies together? For instance, you might find journaling or practicing mindfulness techniques useful. What do you think about trying some of these approaches?

User: I’ve heard of mindfulness but never really tried it. I don’t know if it will work for me.

Consultant: That's completely okay! Mindfulness is about paying attention to your present moment without judgment. It can be a helpful tool to ground yourself when you’re feeling overwhelmed. Would you be willing to give it a try, even just for a few minutes a day?

User: I guess I can try. But what if I can't focus?

Consultant: If you feel your mind is wandering, that's normal! The key is to gently bring your focus back to your breathing or whatever you're observing. It's a practice, which means it might take time to get used to it. What kind of activities would you feel comfortable incorporating mindfulness into?

User: Maybe I could try it while I’m listening to music or even during study breaks. That might work.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Using music as a part of your mindfulness practice can be very soothing. It’s all about finding what feels right for you. We can also work on identifying those specific thoughts that come up when you feel the urge to self-harm. Would you be open to that?

User: Yeah, I think so. I really don't want to keep doing this to myself.

Consultant: That’s a strong step forward, Xiaojing! Let’s talk through some of those thoughts together. The next time you feel anxious or the urge arises, try to notice what you’re thinking at that moment. What do you usually tell yourself?

User: I usually feel like I’m worthless and nothing will ever get better. Those thoughts are really hard to shake off.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be incredibly heavy, and it's understandable to feel trapped by them. Let's challenge some of those beliefs together. Can we look for evidence that contradicts the idea that you're worthless? Have there been any moments, no matter how small, when you felt valued or accomplished?

User: Well, I did help a classmate understand a math problem last week, and they thanked me. That felt nice.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful example! Helping someone and receiving gratitude reflects your value and how you can positively impact others. Let's keep building on these moments. As we work through this together, remember that progress may take time. What would you like to focus on in our next session as we continue this work? 

User: I’d like to learn more about how to cope with my feelings when they get really overwhelming again.

Consultant: Absolutely, we can focus on more coping strategies and techniques for emotional regulation. You’re doing a great job opening up about your feelings, and that alone is a significant step. I’m here to support you through this process. 

User: Thank you. It feels nice to have someone to talk to.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaojing. It’s my pleasure to be here for you. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey, and it’s completely okay to reach out for help. Let’s check in on your progress with mindfulness and those cognitive challenges next time. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good to me.

Consultant: Great! I look forward to our next session. Keep practicing those strategies, and I believe you’ll start to notice some changes. Take care, and I'll see you soon!

User: Thanks! See you.

Consultant: Hi Xiaojing! I'm glad you're here for our session today. I'm here to support you as you navigate through your feelings. Can you tell me how you've been feeling lately, especially with your upcoming exams?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite overwhelmed, to be honest. The pressure from exams is really getting to me. I tried using the emotional regulation techniques I've learned, but when I'm stressed out, it feels like nothing works and I end up resorting to self-harm again.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's normal to feel overwhelmed in times of stress, especially when exams are approaching. Can you share what specific situations tend to trigger this stress for you?

User: Mostly, it's when I sit down to study and I realize how much material I have to cover. I feel like I'll never get through it and my mind just goes blank.

Consultant: It sounds like the pressure of your study material is leading to feelings of hopelessness. When you sit down to study, what thoughts run through your mind? 

User: I often think that I won't be able to do well on the exams, and that I'm just not capable enough. Those thoughts make me feel even worse and sometimes I just give up.

Consultant: I understand. Those negative thoughts can be really overwhelming and can lead to a cycle of anxiety. Let's explore those thoughts together. How much evidence do you think there is to support the idea that you are not capable enough? 

User: I guess there's some evidence, like my grades recently haven't been great. But I also know that I can do well if I study hard.

Consultant: That's a crucial insight! It sounds like there's another side to your ability—evidence that shows you can succeed when you put in effort. Can we try to replace that negative thought with something more balanced? 

User: Maybe I can think, "I can do this if I prepare." That feels a bit better.

Consultant: That's a great start! Focusing on preparation is much healthier. How do you feel about using this kind of thought when you start feeling overwhelmed?

User: I think it could help. I just need to remember to switch those thoughts when I start feeling bad about myself.

Consultant: Exactly, practice makes progress. Let's come up with a few strategies for those moments when you feel the stress rising—activities or thoughts you can use as substitutes for self-harm. What do you think might help?

User: Maybe I could take short breaks when I feel overwhelmed or try stepping outside to clear my mind.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Taking breaks and getting fresh air can really help reduce stress. Would you be willing to create a study schedule that includes those breaks?

User: Yes, I think that would help keep me on track and prevent me from feeling too overwhelmed.

Consultant: Fantastic! Remember, it's not just about studying; it’s about taking care of your mental health too. As you move forward, let’s keep practicing these thought changes and breaks. How do you feel about that?

User: I feel hopeful that it might work. I really want to improve my situation.

Consultant: That's a wonderful attitude, Xiaojing! Remember, progress takes time. Feeling hopeful and committed is a great first step. In terms of self-acceptance, how have you been feeling about your value lately?

User: Honestly, I feel pretty worthless at times. Especially when I see others doing better in school or making friends.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s easy to compare ourselves to others, but it often leads to negative feelings. Let's challenge that thought—can you think of moments when you've succeeded, big or small?

User: I think I’ve done well in a few subjects, and I can be a good friend when I try.

Consultant: Those are valuable reflections! Acknowledging your strengths can help shift your perspective. In moments of social rejection or comparison, what could you remind yourself?

User: I could remind myself that I have my own strengths and that I’m trying my best.

Consultant: Absolutely! You're making great progress already. Let's practice reinforcing that self-acceptance. It’s okay to feel down sometimes, but it's also important to recognize your worth. Does that resonate with you?

User: Yes, I feel a bit encouraged. It’s nice to hear that my efforts matter.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear you're feeling encouraged! It's crucial to remember that self-acceptance is a journey. As we move forward, how about we work on actionable steps to reinforce your self-worth?

User: I’d like that. Maybe writing down my achievements could help.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Keeping a record of your achievements can help you stay aware of your strengths. We'll integrate that into our sessions. How are you feeling about everything we've discussed today?

User: I feel more aware of how to handle my emotions, and I’m a bit more hopeful about improving.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiaojing. Remember, the path to change takes practice and patience, but each step counts. Let’s continue to build this awareness together. For our next session, I’d love for you to jot down those achievements and any moments of self-reflection.

User: I will! Thank you for helping me see things differently.

Consultant: It’s my pleasure! I'm really proud of the progress you're making. Remember, you can always reach out if you’re feeling overwhelmed. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaojing! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty low. I tried to join a club at school, but my classmates were really cold towards me. I felt so rejected and it just reminded me of how isolated I am.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling down after that experience. Rejection can be very painful, especially when you're trying to connect with others. Can you share more about how that made you feel about yourself?

User: I just felt like I wasn’t good enough. It made me doubt my worth again. I thought maybe I could make some friends, but it didn't work out, and now I feel even more alone.

Consultant: I hear you. It's hard to face that kind of situation when you're hoping for something positive. You mentioned feeling like you weren't good enough—what specific thoughts went through your mind when you felt rejected?

User: I kept thinking that no one wants to be my friend because there's something wrong with me. I felt so invisible, like I'm not worth anyone’s time.

Consultant: It's common to have those kinds of thoughts in situations like this, but they can be quite harsh. Let's try to challenge that thinking a bit. Are there any moments when you've felt valued or appreciated by others?

User: Sometimes my teachers compliment my work, and my parents used to praise me, but that doesn’t feel like enough. It feels like they have to say nice things because they don’t want to hurt my feelings.

Consultant: It seems like you have received positive feedback before, yet you're struggling to hold on to that sense of worth. What if we reframed those compliments? Perhaps they reflect your true abilities and qualities rather than being forced niceties. How does that resonate with you?

User: I see your point. Maybe I should try to believe those compliments more. But it’s just hard when I face rejection so often.

Consultant: Absolutely, it's difficult to maintain that belief in yourself amidst constant adversity. Would it help to remind yourself of those positive experiences and strengths when facing rejection?

User: It might, but I just feel like I’m stuck in this loop of negative thoughts. It’s exhausting.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel stuck, especially when those thoughts keep coming back. One technique we can explore is to keep a positive thought journal. Each time you receive a compliment or have a positive interaction, write it down. Over time, this can help you build a more balanced self-view. Would you be willing to try that?

User: I think I could try! It sounds like a good idea. I’ll write down the good things.

Consultant: Great! That’s a step in the right direction. In addition to this, we can also work on practicing self-acceptance. What are some things you like about yourself, even if they feel small?

User: I like that I am creative and can draw well. Sometimes, it makes me happy just to sketch. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Your creativity is a valuable part of who you are. Remembering these strengths, especially during tough times, is important. Can we brainstorm ways to incorporate more of your drawing into your daily routine for enjoyment?

User: Sure! I could spend some time each day just drawing what I feel or what I see outside.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Engaging in activities you enjoy can be very therapeutic. How do you feel about using art as a way to express and manage your emotions?

User: I think it can help, but I also get frustrated when things don’t turn out the way I want. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel frustrated when you have high expectations for your art. We can work on adjusting those expectations—perhaps focusing on the process of creating rather than the end result. What do you think?

User: That could be helpful. It’s good to just enjoy the moment instead of stressing about the outcome.

Consultant: Absolutely! Shifting your focus to the joy of creating can relieve some pressure. Let’s also touch on coping with rejection. If you're in a situation where you face coldness from peers again, what might you tell yourself to manage your feelings?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it doesn't define my worth. There are people who appreciate me, like my teachers.

Consultant: Perfect! That’s an excellent perspective to have. You deserve to feel valued despite negative interactions. Setting healthy boundaries with those feelings is key. How are you feeling about these strategies moving forward?

User: I feel a little hopeful. It’s good to know I can work on my thoughts and feelings actively.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear you say that! Progress sometimes comes in small steps, and it’s perfectly okay. The fact that you're willing to try new strategies shows your strength. Before we end today's session, do you feel more prepared to handle similar situations in the future?

User: Yes, I do. I feel like I have some tools to help me cope better whenever I feel rejected.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Just remember that it’s a journey, and it’s okay to have ups and downs along the way. You clearly have a lot of inner strength. I look forward to seeing how these strategies work for you in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaojing! Take care, and I'll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaojing! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I got some praise during a class activity, and it felt nice to be acknowledged, but I still feel uncertain about fitting in with my classmates.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear about the praise you received! It sounds like it gave you a bit of joy and recognition. Let's explore that feeling of uncertainty a bit more—what specifically makes you feel unsure about fitting in?

User: I guess I worry that I won't be able to connect with others or that they won't really want to be friends with me. Sometimes, I think about how awkward I can be in social situations.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those worries, especially when you're trying to connect with others. What were your thoughts when you received that praise? Did it change your feelings about how others see you?

User: It made me feel like maybe I have something to offer. But then I worry it's just a one-time thing, and they won’t think of me in that way again.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It sounds like you’re grappling with some self-doubt after that positive experience. Let’s talk about those thoughts—are there any particular beliefs that pop up when you think about your social interactions?

User: I often think that I'm not interesting enough or that I'll say something wrong and embarrass myself. 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite challenging. Let’s try to challenge those ideas. What evidence do you have that you’re not interesting, or that you might embarrass yourself in social situations?

User: I guess I don’t have strong evidence. It's more of a feeling, like I just don’t belong.

Consultant: Feeling like you don’t belong can be really tough. However, you just shared how you received praise in front of your classmates, which suggests that there are people who see value in you. How might you reframe that thought of not belonging based on this experience?

User: Maybe I could think that I have moments where I fit in, and that it's okay to feel out of place sometimes. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Recognizing that fitting in can have ups and downs is a positive step. What other activities or interactions do you think could help reinforce this feeling of belonging?

User: I think participating in more group activities might help. I just haven’t felt motivated or confident enough to join.

Consultant: Joining group activities sounds like a promising idea! How about we brainstorm some easy steps to help you feel more comfortable getting involved? What is one small activity that you might feel up for trying in the near future?

User: Maybe I could join a study group for an upcoming project. It feels less intimidating since it’s focused on a task.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan, Xiaojing! Focusing on a task can certainly ease some of that pressure. How do you think you might feel after taking that step?

User: I think it would feel good to be part of a group, even if it’s just for studying. I hope it helps me feel less alone.

Consultant: Absolutely! Being part of a study group could help you connect with others in a meaningful way. How about we set a goal to reflect on that experience afterward? We could think about what went well and any feelings that arise.

User: I like that idea. It’ll give me a chance to see if I feel differently after participating.

Consultant: Excellent! And remember, it's all about progress. Every small step counts. If you ever feel anxious about it, we can talk about ways to ease that anxiety before you go. 

User: Thank you. It really helps to think that there are ways to handle my anxiety about social situations.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Just remember, it's perfectly okay to feel a bit anxious. The important part is how you choose to respond to it. Are there any specific anxiety management techniques you’d like to explore more before stepping into that study group?

User: Maybe just some breathing exercises would help. I’ve heard they can keep me calm.

Consultant: Breathing exercises are a fantastic tool for managing anxiety! We could practice a simple one together right now. Would you like to try that?

User: Yes, that sounds good!

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment. Close your eyes if you feel comfortable and take a deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs. Hold it for a few seconds… and now breathe out slowly through your mouth. How does that feel?

User: It feels nice, actually. I feel a bit more relaxed.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Practicing these techniques regularly can really help you feel more grounded in those social situations. How do you feel about trying this before your study group?

User: I think I can definitely do that! Thank you for the suggestion.

Consultant: You're welcome! Remember, it's all about finding what works best for you. As we wrap up today, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I think I’ll focus more on my strengths and try to be involved with others. It’s okay to feel anxious, and I can work through it.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, Xiaojing. I’m proud of the progress you’re making. Keep in mind it’s okay to embrace those feelings. I believe you’ll do great exploring those new connections, and I look forward to hearing all about it in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about everything. See you next time!

Consultant: Take care, Xiaojing. I’m excited to hear how your week goes!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaojing! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I'm excited about my new friendship at school. It's nice to share some good moments with someone.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear that you're experiencing positive connections. Can you tell me more about this new friendship and how it has impacted your feelings?

User: Well, we talk during lunch and sometimes study together. I feel less lonely, and it's nice to have someone to hang out with. But sometimes I still struggle with my emotions.

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel mixed emotions, especially when opening up to new friendships. What specific struggles have you been facing with your emotions lately?

User: Sometimes I still feel really down, and I have the urge to self-harm. Even though things are better, those thoughts don’t completely go away.

Consultant: I'm very sorry to hear that you're still experiencing those urges. It’s important to acknowledge both your progress and the challenges you’re facing. Have you found anything that helps you when those thoughts come up?

User: When I feel overwhelmed, I often just go back to self-harming. It feels like it’s the only way to cope sometimes, especially when I'm stressed.

Consultant: I can understand why you might think that, considering how difficult it can be. However, it's crucial to explore healthier coping strategies. What do you think might help you when those feelings arise instead of self-harming?

User: I don’t really know. I guess I could try talking to my new friend or maybe even writing in my journal. 

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Talking to your friend could provide support, and journaling can be a great outlet for expressing your feelings. How do you feel about trying these strategies when you face those difficult moments?

User: I think I can try. I just hope I can remember to do it in the moment.

Consultant: That's a valid concern. Let’s think about ways to remind yourself to use these strategies. Would having a physical reminder or a note help you, perhaps even on your phone?

User: Maybe setting an alarm on my phone to remind me to check in with myself would work. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Using reminders can help you stay focused and encourage you to reach out for support. Let's talk about some steps you can take to gradually increase your social interactions. How are you feeling about that?

User: I'm a bit nervous, but also excited. I want to keep building on this friendship and maybe talk to more people.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous, but you’re also showing a lot of courage. What small steps could you take to engage with others more, besides talking to your friend?

User: Maybe I could join a club or a group activity at school. I’ve always wanted to try drama or art class.

Consultant: Joining a club sounds like a wonderful idea! It can be a great way to meet new people with similar interests. Can you think of any clubs that might be starting up soon that you could join?

User: I heard there’s an art club meeting this Friday. I think I might give it a try!

Consultant: That's exciting! Stepping into the art club could be a great opportunity for both socializing and exploring your creative side. How do you feel about going to the meeting?

User: I feel a mix of excitement and a bit of fear. But I think once I’m there, it’ll be fine.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! It’s normal to feel fear, but focusing on excitement can help ease that worry. What can you do to prepare for the meeting this week?

User: I could maybe plan what to say if someone talks to me. Also, I could think of some questions to ask.

Consultant: Preparing some conversation starters is a great strategy! It can help you feel more confident and comfortable. Do you want to brainstorm a few questions or topics together?

User: Yeah, that would help! Maybe I could ask them what kind of art they like or if they’ve done any projects recently.

Consultant: Those are fantastic questions! They can encourage a conversation and help you connect on shared interests. As you prepare for the meeting, how are you feeling about your progress overall?

User: I feel proud of myself, actually. I’ve been working on my social skills, and I hope to keep improving. 

Consultant: Be proud! You're making admirable strides in your social skills and emotional management. How about we set some short-term goals for the next week, focusing on meeting new people and using your coping strategies?

User: That sounds good! I want to try to join the art club and use my journal whenever I feel upset.

Consultant: Those are wonderful goals, Xiaojing! As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed. You've come far, and it’s important to keep building on your achievements. Is there anything else you want to address before our next session?

User: I just hope I can keep going and not revert to my old ways.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to have that concern. Remember that progress is a journey, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. You've got this! If you ever feel overwhelmed, don't hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you, I really appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaojing! I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaojing! I'm really glad to see you today. We will take some time to reflect on the progress you've made with your emotions and family communication. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I feel somehow better, and my parents and I have had some decent conversations lately. I think the family atmosphere is a bit improved.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive change! It’s great to hear that communication with your parents is improving. Can you tell me a bit about what specific conversations stood out to you?

User: Well, during the last parent-teacher meeting, I shared some of the improvements I've made. I think they were surprised and seemed more interested in talking with me since then.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Sharing your progress in front of them must have felt empowering, and it seems to have sparked their interest. How did that make you feel about your relationship with them?

User: It made me feel hopeful, but I am still scared they might go back to being indifferent again.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to have concerns about reverting to previous patterns. It sounds like you are aware of the possibility but also recognizing progress. What do you think will help maintain this positive momentum in your relationship with them?

User: Well, I think I need to keep the communication going. Maybe I should actively share my thoughts and feelings more often.

Consultant: That's a fantastic strategy! Keeping open lines of communication is key. How do you feel about expressing your thoughts and emotions with them?

User: It feels a bit scary sometimes, but I also know it's essential for our relationship.

Consultant: It's natural to feel nervous about being open, especially if there’s a history of conflict. Recognizing that it’s important is a significant step. What are some small ways you could practice sharing your feelings more openly?

User: I could start by telling them about my day-to-day experiences and not wait for them to ask.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Starting with everyday experiences can ease you into more profound conversations. Also, regarding your emotional progress, how do you feel about your coping strategies now?

User: I’ve been trying to use healthier methods to cope, but I still sometimes feel the urge to hurt myself when things get overwhelming.

Consultant: It’s good to acknowledge that urge. The fact that you're aware of it means you're making progress. What have you found helps you the most when those overwhelming feelings arise?

User: Talking to a friend sometimes helps, but there's still a part of me that feels like self-harm is easier.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way—self-harm can seem like an immediate relief. However, it’s important to consider the longer-term effects. Can we explore some alternative coping methods together?

User: Sure, I’m open to that.

Consultant: How about we start with grounding techniques? These methods can help you stay connected to the here and now, which may distract you from those overwhelming feelings. Would you like to try an example now?

User: Yes, I’d like that.

Consultant: Great! One simple technique is to focus on your surroundings. Look around and notice five things you see, four things you can touch, three things you hear, two things you smell, and one thing you taste. Can we go through this together?

User: Okay, I can see a pen, a notebook, my phone, a plant, and a window.

Consultant: Excellent observations! Now, what can you touch?

User: I can touch the desk, my chair, my notebook, and my water bottle.

Consultant: Great! And what do you hear?

User: I can hear some noise from outside, my fan, and the clicking of my keyboard.

Consultant: Wonderful! Now, can you identify something you can smell?

User: I guess I can smell my scented candle.

Consultant: Perfect! Lastly, what’s something you can taste?

User: I still have some water in my mouth.

Consultant: You did really well with that exercise! How do you feel after focusing on those things around you?

User: I feel a bit calmer, actually.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Grounding exercises can be very effective. How do you think you could remind yourself to use this technique when you start feeling overwhelmed?

User: I could write it down somewhere visible, like my desk.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Having a reminder can prompt you to use it in those moments. As we start to wrap up, what have you learned today that you’d like to carry forward?

User: I think keeping communication open and trying grounding exercises can really help me cope better.

Consultant: Absolutely! Noting your progress and recognizing effective strategies is a significant step. As we finish today, what are some other supports you might need moving forward?

User: I think continuing to talk to you or maybe even finding a support group could help.

Consultant: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. Staying connected and supported is so important. Remember, you’ve made great strides, and you should be proud of yourself. If you ever need guidance or just someone to talk to, I’m here. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, the door is always open for you. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to our next session!
