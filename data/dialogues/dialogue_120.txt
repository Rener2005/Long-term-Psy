Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. I want to talk about how you're feeling lately, especially regarding school and home. Can you share more about what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really upset about school. I got in trouble for not turning in my homework again, and my teacher was really harsh about it. I just feel like nobody understands me.

Consultant: That sounds really frustrating, especially when you're trying your best and still feel criticized. Can you tell me more about what happened with your homework and how it made you feel?

User: Well, I was just so distracted by watching videos on my phone. I know I should do my work, but I just can't help it. Then I get into trouble, and my parents don't listen to me when I try to explain.

Consultant: It seems like your phone is a big distraction for you, and it's affecting your homework. I'm hearing that there's a feeling of being misunderstood when you try to talk to your parents. What do you wish they would say or do instead?

User: I just want them to understand how hard it is for me. They always just yell at me without asking what I really think. It feels like they only care if I do well in school.

Consultant: I can sense that you're really craving support and understanding from your parents. It must feel lonely when your feelings aren’t acknowledged. Can you think of a time when you felt your parents listened to you? 

User: Not really. It's usually just them giving me lectures. I feel like they don't really see me for who I am, just what I do wrong.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling like you’re not being seen fully. Besides your homework struggles, are there any specific moments with your parents where you felt like they didn't understand you?

User: There have been a few. They just always seem so busy with work, and when they're home, they yell if I don’t do my work right away.

Consultant: I hear that your father is often busy and that his response can sometimes be harsh. It can be hard when busy parents seem disconnected from your daily challenges. How does that affect your mood or feelings at home?

User: It makes me feel really anxious and stressed. I just want to relax and not worry, but that never happens. I don't know how to talk to them without getting in trouble.

Consultant: It sounds really overwhelming to manage your feelings and the pressure at home. Often, our emotions can feel tangled in tough situations. What are some of the things that bring you joy or help you relax when things get tough?

User: I like watching funny videos and playing games. But then I get too into it and lose track of time, and that gets me in trouble too.

Consultant: Finding joy in activities like videos and games is great, but I can see how they might pull your focus away from your responsibilities. Have you thought about how you could balance your time between schoolwork and your favorite activities?

User: I guess I should probably set a timer or something. But I don’t know if that would actually help.

Consultant: Setting a timer could be a useful tool! It gives you a structured way to enjoy your videos while also ensuring you have time for homework. Would you be willing to try that this week and see how it feels?

User: Yeah, I could give it a try. But what if I still don’t want to do my work afterward?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It’s really common to want to avoid work after fun activities. We could explore some small rewards for when you complete your homework—like some extra video time afterwards. How does that sound?

User: That sounds okay. I think that might help me actually do my work.

Consultant: Great! We can break things into smaller, manageable sections together. You mentioned conflicts with classmates as well. Can you share what happens during those conflicts?

User: I usually just get so mad when people make fun of me or when they don’t include me in stuff. Then it ends up in a fight.

Consultant: Anger can be a tough emotion to deal with, especially when you feel excluded. It's understandable to react strongly in those moments. Have you thought about some different ways to respond when those situations occur?

User: Not really. I just kind of react without thinking.

Consultant: That’s completely normal. What if we brainstorm some calm responses you could use next time you feel left out? Something that allows you to express your feelings without escalating the situation. 

User: Like what? 

Consultant: For instance, you could say something like, "I feel hurt when I'm not included," which expresses your emotion without getting defensive. Would giving that a shot seem possible?

User: Yeah, I can try that, too. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s all about practice and finding what feels right for you. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you’ve learned about your feelings and conflicts at home and school?

User: I guess I’ve learned that it's okay to want to be heard. I need to try talking to my parents about how I feel instead of just yelling back.

Consultant: Absolutely, communicating your feelings is crucial, and you deserve to be understood. As you return home, remember it’s a process. You can take small steps toward improving those relationships. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel a bit better. I think I can really try some of these things.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Just remember, change takes time, and it’s fine to go at your own pace. If you want to share how things go next time, I’m here for you. Thank you for opening up today, and I look forward to hearing how you progress next time!

Consultant: Hello, I'm glad to see you today. I understand that you've been going through some challenging times with your family recently. Can you share with me what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. Yeah, I really feel like my parents don't understand me at all. Just the other day, my dad yelled at me during an argument with my mom. I felt so unfairly treated, and I got really angry.

Consultant: It sounds like you felt misunderstood and angry during that situation. Can you tell me more about what specifically made you feel that way?

User: I don't know, I just feel like whenever there's a problem, they always blame me for everything. It’s like they don’t even care about my feelings or what I think.

Consultant: That must be really hard for you. Feeling blamed can make anyone feel unloved and frustrated. What do you wish could change in the way your family interacts with each other?

User: I just want them to listen to me and maybe try to understand my side of things before jumping to conclusions. I wish we could talk without fighting all the time.

Consultant: That's a really valid wish. Communication is so important. Have you ever tried to express this desire to your parents, or do you think they would respond well?

User: I don't think they'd really listen. It feels like every time I try to tell them how I feel, they just get madder or ignore me.

Consultant: That sounds really frustrating. It looks like you've been trying to reach out but feel dismissed instead. What would it feel like for you to have a calm conversation with them about your feelings?

User: I think it would feel great, but I’m scared they won't take me seriously. What if they just laugh it off?

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those fears, especially if past experiences didn’t go well. What if we thought about some ways to approach this that might help you feel more confident?

User: I guess I could try writing them a letter. That way, they could read it and think about it before reacting.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Writing can be a powerful way to express your thoughts without immediate reactions. What would you want to include in that letter to help them understand your perspective?

User: I’d want to explain that I feel lonely and that I want to be heard. I’d also mention that I don’t like fighting and that it hurts our family.

Consultant: Those are very important points, and framing it like that can help them see your feelings. How do you think your parents might respond if they read that?

User: Maybe they would think more about how I feel. I really hope it makes them realize I just want a better relationship with them.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re really motivated to improve your family dynamics, and that’s a strong step forward. Speaking of relationships, how do you feel about the arguments you have with your classmates?

User: That’s another thing. I fight a lot at school, too. Sometimes, I just get so frustrated, and I don’t know how to handle it.

Consultant: It seems like you’re feeling a lot of frustration in different areas of your life right now. What do you think triggers those fights with your classmates?

User: A lot of times, it’s over silly things, but when people annoy me, I can’t control my anger. I feel like I need to defend myself.

Consultant: Defending yourself is a natural reaction when you feel upset. Have you thought about some strategies to manage that anger before it leads to fights?

User: Not really. I just end up yelling or punching. I feel guilty afterward, but in the moment, I just can't stop myself.

Consultant: It’s common to feel out of control when anger rises. What if we explored some techniques you could use to calm down before reacting?

User: I guess I could try counting to ten or stepping away for a bit. But I’m worried it won’t work.

Consultant: Those are great starting points! They can help create a pause so you can think before reacting. What might be a good way to remind yourself to use those techniques when you start to feel angry?

User: Maybe I could write it down somewhere and put it in my backpack or something. 

Consultant: That sounds like a practical approach! Having a reminder can really help. You’re working on both your family and social relationships—both can improve with conscious effort and communication.

User: That makes sense. I feel like I really want to change, but sometimes it feels overwhelming.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel overwhelmed when trying to make changes. Progress is often gradual, and small steps can lead to significant improvements over time. What would you say is the first small step you're willing to take after our session today?

User: I think I’ll start by writing that letter to my parents and trying to remember to stay calm when I feel angry.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful next steps. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. How can I support you in feeling more confident about these changes?

User: Just talking about it helps. I think I need to keep coming back to work on this stuff.

Consultant: Absolutely! I’m here to support you through this journey. It’s great that you’re open to continuing our work together. Before we wrap up, what is one key takeaway you have from today’s session?

User: I feel like I need to communicate better and take small actions to improve things. It gives me hope.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway, and I’m glad to hear it! Every little step counts. I’m looking forward to our next session to see how you're doing. Remember, you are not alone in this.

User: Thank you. I appreciate your help!

Consultant: You’re welcome! Take care, and see you next time!

Consultant: Hi there! I'm really glad you could join me today. How have you been feeling lately with everything going on in your life?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty overwhelmed. I tried to reduce my time on the phone, but I just can't seem to stop watching videos. It's really frustrating, and now I feel bad about it.

Consultant: It sounds like you're in a tough spot right now, feeling frustrated and guilty about being unable to control your phone usage. Can you tell me more about what that experience has been like for you?

User: Well, I keep telling myself to stop, but then I just get sucked into watching video after video. My parents are always arguing with me about it, and they don’t understand why I can’t just do my homework.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a lot of pressure coming from your parents, and it can make things even trickier when you’re feeling this way. How do you feel when they bring this up? 

User: I feel really annoyed and defensive. I know they're right, but it just makes me want to do it more. It's like I can’t help myself.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way. It sounds like it's creating a cycle of frustration for you. What do you think you would like to achieve from our time together today?

User: I want to find a way to cut down on my phone time and feel more in control. I’m just tired of fighting with my parents and feeling guilty all the time.

Consultant: It’s great that you want to take control. Let’s start by exploring what you think might be stopping you from cutting down on your phone time. Can you share some of those thoughts with me? 

User: Sometimes I think, “Just one more video,” and then I end up watching for hours. I also feel like my friends are always online, and I don’t want to miss out on anything they're doing.

Consultant: Those thoughts make a lot of sense. The idea of missing out can be really powerful. How does that “one more video” thought make you feel when you actually watch for hours?

User: It makes me feel guilty and lazy once I realize how much time has passed. I start to worry about my homework and my parents getting mad.

Consultant: It sounds like this leads to a lot of inner conflict for you—wanting to enjoy your time but also worrying about disappointing your parents and yourself. What do you think you could tell yourself instead when you have the urge to watch another video?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that I can watch them later, but I need to prioritize my homework first. 

Consultant: That sounds like a healthier thought to challenge yourself with. It can be really helpful to set up structured times for both studying and for enjoyable activities like watching videos. Would you be open to creating a simple plan together?

User: Yeah, I think that could help. I need something to stick to because I just keep losing track of time.

Consultant: Absolutely, let's think about how you would like to structure your time. What is your homework schedule like, and how much time do you typically spend on your phone?

User: I usually have a few hours of homework, but the rest of the evening is just for videos. I really don’t want to give up my videos completely, though.

Consultant: That's understandable! How about we set a certain time for homework and then a limited time for videos afterward? This way, you can still enjoy watching them without feeling guilty.

User: That sounds fair. Maybe I could do homework for two hours and then watch videos for one hour?

Consultant: That’s a great start! What could help you stick to that plan when it’s time to switch from homework to videos?

User: I guess setting a timer could help, so when the time’s up, I know it’s time to stop.

Consultant: Using a timer is an excellent idea! It can create a clear boundary. And how about when the timer goes off? What can you do to remind yourself to stay on track?

User: I could keep telling myself my homework needs to come first. I just need to focus on that.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Focusing on your priorities can help. What might you tell your friends if they ask why you’re not available at certain times?

User: I could say I’m busy with homework and I'll catch up with them after. It’s fine, but I worry they’ll think I’m boring.

Consultant: It’s natural to worry about what your friends might think, but true friends will understand your need to focus on school. How do you think they would respond to you prioritizing your homework?

User: I think they’d get it. They all have homework too. Maybe I just need to remind myself it’s okay to take a break from them too.

Consultant: That’s a very mature perspective! Balancing school and social time is important. What steps can you take to implement this plan this week?

User: I guess I can start with the timer and homework schedule. I’ll tell my friends about it too and see how they react.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, and sharing it with your friends can provide some accountability. As we wrap up today, how are you feeling about this action plan?

User: I feel more hopeful. It seems manageable, and I like that I have a plan now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! This is a great first step towards feeling more in control. Remember, it takes time to adjust to new habits, so be patient with yourself. Would you like to share what you're looking forward to achieving next time we meet?

User: I’m excited to see if I can really stick to the schedule and maybe even have more energy for my homework.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! I'm looking forward to hearing how it goes. Take care, and remember, it's okay to reach out if you need support along the way!
###################
Consultant: Hello, little A! I'm glad you could join me today. I understand you’ve been feeling some excitement about your relationships with your classmates while also having some worries about fitting in. Can you share more about what you’ve been experiencing?

User: Hi! Yes, I recently participated in a class activity, and it was actually really fun working with my classmates. But I'm still worried they might not want to include me in future activities. It makes me anxious.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you enjoyed the activity! That sounds like a positive experience. However, it’s completely normal to feel anxious about being accepted. What specific thoughts or feelings do you have when you think about future interactions with your classmates?

User: I keep thinking, what if they don’t want me around? What if I mess things up again like I have in the past? It feels overwhelming.

Consultant: I see how those thoughts can create a lot of anxiety for you. It seems like you might be feeling a bit trapped by the fear of past conflicts. Can you tell me more about a recent conflict or a situation that didn’t go well and how it affected you?

User: Last week, I got into an argument with a friend during a game, and it ended up in a fight. My parents got called to school, and I felt so embarrassed. I really didn’t want to disappoint them.

Consultant: That sounds like a very tough situation for you. Feeling embarrassed and disappointing your parents must be quite heavy. It looks like those experiences are contributing to your worries about fitting in. What do you think might help you communicate differently in similar situations moving forward?

User: I guess I could try to stay calm and not let my emotions take over. But sometimes it’s hard, especially when I feel like I’m being treated unfairly.

Consultant: Staying calm can be quite challenging, especially in the heat of the moment. Would you like to discuss some strategies for managing those emotions and improving your communication when conflicts arise with your friends?

User: Yes, I would like that. I want to handle things differently this time.

Consultant: One approach could be to practice expressing how you feel without blaming others. For instance, instead of saying “You did this to me,” you might say, “I felt hurt when this happened.” How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds okay. I think I could try that. But what if it doesn’t work out?

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry about that. Remember, effective communication takes practice. If things don’t go as planned, it’s an opportunity to learn and try again. How do you feel about the idea of experimenting with this in your next interaction?

User: I feel a bit more confident about it. I really want to try, but what if I mess up again?

Consultant: It’s perfectly okay to feel that way. If you do find yourself in a challenging situation again, you could think of it as just one experience rather than a failure. Additionally, we can prepare a few phrases together that you could use. Would you like to work on that?

User: Yes! Having some phrases might help me feel more ready.

Consultant: Let's start with some simple ones. For instance, you could say, “I need a moment,” when you feel overwhelmed, or “Can we talk about this?” if a disagreement arises. How do those sound to you?

User: Those sound really helpful. I think I could remember to use them.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! As you practice these ways of communicating, you might notice a shift in how your classmates respond. It’s also important to celebrate your small successes, even when things don’t go perfectly. How do you think you can reward yourself for trying these new strategies?

User: Maybe if I manage to communicate better, I could treat myself to playing my favorite game on my phone.

Consultant: That sounds like a great reward! It’s always nice to acknowledge your efforts. As we’re wrapping things up today, how are you feeling about the relationships with your classmates now?

User: I feel a bit better. I think I can work on things and hopefully be friends with them.

Consultant: That’s a positive outlook! Remember, communication is a skill that you can build over time. As for your relationship with your parents, do you feel comfortable discussing how they could support you as you make these changes?

User: I think I could try talking to them about it. I’m sure they want me to be happy.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing your feelings and intentions with them might help build understanding. Let's also think about how you can maintain that happiness in your efforts. Any thoughts on that?

User: I could keep reminding myself that it’s okay to make mistakes, and I’ll keep working on it.

Consultant: Exactly, small steps lead to big changes over time. It's been great exploring these strategies with you today, and I believe you’re on a positive path. Would you like to set an intention for what you want to achieve before our next session?

User: I want to be more open in group activities and try my best to communicate without letting my emotions get in the way.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences and progress in our next session. Remember, it’s all part of learning and growing. 

User: Thank you! I feel more ready now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, little A! I’m glad you feel that way. Keep practicing, and I’m here to support you whenever you need it. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, little A! I'm really happy to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello! I feel much better about my family. We’ve been having dinner together more often, and it seems to help. I’m still struggling with schoolwork, though.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear about the improvement in your family relationship! Sharing meals can really strengthen bonds. Let’s talk about schoolwork then. What specific challenges are you experiencing?

User: I just find it hard to focus and I often don’t finish my homework. Instead, I end up watching videos on my phone.

Consultant: It's understandable that distractions can make it difficult to concentrate on schoolwork. When you think about doing your homework, how do you feel? 

User: I feel overwhelmed, like I won't be able to do it well. So sometimes I just avoid it and watch videos instead.

Consultant: That’s a common feeling, feeling overwhelmed can definitely lead to avoidance. Can you share more about what thoughts come to your mind when you think about your homework?

User: I often think it's going to be too hard and that I’ll just mess it up. And I worry my parents will be disappointed in me.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like there’s a lot of pressure on you from those thoughts. Let’s explore this—what evidence do you have that suggests you might mess it up?

User: Well, sometimes I do get things wrong, and my teachers get upset. It just feels like I can never catch up.

Consultant: I see. So you’ve had some tough moments that have contributed to how you’re feeling. But let’s think about this: if a friend were in your shoes, what would you say to encourage them?

User: I would probably tell them to keep trying and not to worry so much about what others think.

Consultant: That’s a really kind perspective! It sounds like you have the ability to be supportive to others. What if you could apply that same kindness to yourself? How might it change how you approach your studies?

User: Maybe I could try to remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes, and that I can always improve?

Consultant: Absolutely! Allowing room for mistakes means you give yourself the space to learn and improve. Let’s also consider setting small, achievable goals for your studying. What’s one small step you could take to start working on this?

User: I guess I could start with just 10 minutes of homework, then watch a quick video as a reward.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Bite-sized chunks can make studying feel much more manageable. How do you think setting that goal might help with your feelings towards homework?

User: It might make it less scary, and I can feel accomplished by completing at least a little bit.

Consultant: Exactly! Achieving even small goals can boost your confidence. Now, let’s think about your feelings when you complete an assignment, how do you feel afterward?

User: I usually feel relieved, like I’ve done something good! But then I get nervous about the next one.

Consultant: That relief is a great feeling! What if you acknowledged that feeling and used it to motivate you for the next task? 

User: That makes sense. I can remind myself that it feels good to finish and I can do it again.

Consultant: Exactly! Celebrate those small wins! Let's also talk about how you can communicate with your parents about your studies. Would you feel comfortable discussing your homework challenges with them?

User: I think I could, especially since they’ve been better lately. I could explain I’m trying to improve.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Open communication can strengthen your support system at home. How do you think they would respond?

User: I think they would understand and might even help me with my homework.

Consultant: That sounds encouraging! Having their support can greatly relieve some pressure. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve worked on. You’re setting small study goals, recognizing the importance of being kind to yourself, and you’re planning to communicate with your parents. 

User: Yes, that sounds right! I feel more hopeful about everything.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, little A! Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. Keep practicing those strategies, and if challenges arise, you can always reach out for support. You’ve made great progress. 

User: Thank you! I feel more motivated to try.

Consultant: It’s been a pleasure working with you. Remember, you've got the tools now to keep moving forward. If you ever want to talk again, I’m here for you. Have a great day!

User: Thank you! I will, goodbye!
