Consultant: Hello, Jing! Welcome back to our session. I'm here to support you in exploring your feelings about university life. How have you been since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I've been okay, I guess. But honestly, I still feel out of place at university. It's hard for me to connect with my classmates and dorm mates. I often find myself missing high school, where I felt more at home.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of loneliness and nostalgia for your high school days. That feeling of not belonging can be tough. Can you share more about what's been going on in your mind when you're in social situations at university?

User: I often feel anxious when I try to talk to others. I worry they won’t want to talk to me or that I’ll say something wrong. It just makes me want to avoid the situation altogether.

Consultant: I can see how that anxiety would make it difficult to engage with others. It’s common to worry about how we're perceived. What specific thoughts come to mind when you think about talking to someone?

User: I often think, “They probably won't find me interesting,” or “I will embarrass myself.” It’s like a loop of negative thoughts that just keeps going.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite discouraging. You mentioned they create a loop; how do they affect your feelings in those moments?

User: They make me feel more anxious and even a bit depressed. It's like I just freeze up and don’t know what to say.

Consultant: That freezing feeling can be overwhelming. Let’s examine those thoughts. How much evidence do you think supports the belief that they won’t find you interesting? Could there be other explanations for their reactions?

User: I guess I don’t really know. I just automatically think that way. But sometimes, I do catch them smiling or laughing, so maybe they’re not as uninterested as I think.

Consultant: That's an important realization! It seems like there might be some evidence contradicting those negative thoughts. If a friend were in your position, what advice do you think you would offer them?

User: I would probably tell them to just be themselves and that not everyone will judge them. They should just give it a try.

Consultant: Exactly! And you deserve to give yourself that same advice. What do you think might happen if you aimed to approach someone with that mindset instead of focusing on the negatives?

User: Maybe it would be easier to talk to them without the pressure of trying to be perfect. I should just try to relax and be myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a great approach! How about we discuss a few small steps you could take to practice this mindset in social situations? 

User: I think that would help. What kind of steps do you suggest?

Consultant: Start small—perhaps you could initiate a casual conversation with someone in your class or dorm about a shared topic, like a recent assignment or a movie. What do you think about trying that?

User: That sounds manageable. I can talk about classes or something light. I should probably give it a shot next week.

Consultant: That’s a good plan! Remember, it's just a conversation. If you feel anxious, try to remind yourself of those positive thoughts we discussed. If things don’t go perfectly, that’s okay too. 

User: Yeah, I tend to think it has to go perfectly, and that adds to my stress. I’ll keep that in mind.

Consultant: It’s all part of the learning process. Celebrating small victories can really boost your confidence. How do you feel about integrating this approach into your week ahead?

User: I feel a bit hopeful about it. It seems like a good idea to just focus on small steps instead of overwhelming myself.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! This kind of gradual exposure can build your confidence over time. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?

User: Not really. I just want to see how this goes for now and maybe talk more about social stuff next time.

Consultant: That sounds perfectly fine, Jing. I’m here to support you through this journey. Remember, every little step counts, and I look forward to hearing how it goes for you.

User: Thanks! I appreciate that. I'll work on it and see you next time!

Consultant: You're welcome! Take care, and I’m excited to hear about your progress.

Consultant: Hello, Jun! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been trying to join some club activities at school, but I still feel quite uneasy when it comes to talking to others. I really doubt my ability to fit in.

Consultant: It sounds like you're making efforts to socialize, but you're facing challenges with your confidence in communication. Can you share more about what specific situations make you feel uneasy?

User: Well, when I try to join conversations, I often feel like I don’t know what to say, and then I worry that others are judging me. It makes me want to retreat.

Consultant: I understand that feeling. The fear of judgment can be really overwhelming. Let's explore the thoughts you have in those moments. What goes through your mind when you find yourself in a social situation?

User: I often think things like, "They won't like me," or "What if I say something stupid?" It definitely makes me more anxious.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite negative and self-critical. It's understandable that they would increase your anxiety. Let’s try to identify how those thoughts make you feel. What emotions arise when you think those things?

User: I usually feel embarrassed and a bit sad. It’s frustrating because I want to connect with others, but I end up feeling isolated.

Consultant: That sounds quite tough. It's common to feel isolated when you're struggling with communication. Let's try to challenge those negative thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports those beliefs about not being liked or saying something stupid?

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence. It's just that I've had some awkward moments in the past that linger in my mind.

Consultant: It's interesting that those past experiences influence your current feelings. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about those awkward moments? 

User: I would probably say that it’s okay to feel awkward sometimes and that everyone has those moments.

Consultant: Exactly! Everyone has awkward moments, and they don’t define your value or your ability to connect with others. Given that perspective, how might you try approaching conversations differently?

User: Maybe I could just focus on being present and not worry so much about what others think. 

Consultant: That's a great insight! Being present can help reduce anxiety. Would you be willing to practice some small conversation starters for when you meet new people?

User: Yes, I would like that. What should I start with?

Consultant: We can brainstorm a few simple questions or comments that can help initiate conversations. How about starting with something light, like asking someone about their favorite club activity or class?

User: That sounds doable. I could definitely start with that.

Consultant: Fantastic! Another approach could be to share a bit about yourself in response. For example, if they mention a favorite activity, you could share your interest in it too. How do you feel about trying this out?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful! It seems achievable when I think of it that way.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It's important to remember that practice makes it easier. Would you be willing to set a goal for yourself for the next week regarding these conversation starters?

User: Sure! I can aim to start a conversation at least twice. 

Consultant: That’s a great goal, Jun! Starting small is key. After trying this, let’s reflect on how it felt next time. In addition to that, how can you remind yourself of your worth during these interactions?

User: Maybe I can keep telling myself that I am enough and it’s okay to be vulnerable.

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation! Reminding yourself of your worth can help reduce anxiety. As we wrap up, let's take a moment to reflect on the progress you’ve made today. What do you feel has been the most helpful part of our discussion?

User: I think recognizing that everyone struggles with communication and that I’m not alone in this has helped me a lot.

Consultant: Absolutely! You're not alone, and adjusting your mindset is a significant step. Before we end today, what are some strategies you plan to use moving forward to maintain this positive outlook as you practice?

User: I’ll try to remember that I am enough and practice focusing on enjoying the conversation rather than judging myself.

Consultant: That sounds excellent, Jun. You have made great strides today, and I believe you can manage these challenges. If you need any support, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Jin! I'm really glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been thinking a lot about my place in my new group at university. I used to feel confident at home, but now I'm unsure of my value among my peers.

Consultant: It sounds like you're grappling with feelings of self-doubt in this new environment. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts or experiences have triggered these feelings?

User: Well, during a recent group project, I received some feedback from my classmates. It made me reflect on how I contribute, and I'm starting to question if I'm as valuable as others.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Feedback can really influence how we view ourselves. What kinds of thoughts were running through your mind when you received that feedback?

User: I thought maybe I should just sit back and let others lead. It made me feel like I wasn't good enough to contribute effectively.

Consultant: Those thoughts must be quite heavy to carry. Can you pinpoint how those thoughts impacted your feelings and behaviors during the project?

User: They made me feel anxious and hesitant to share my ideas. I was really worried about not meeting their expectations.

Consultant: It’s tough when we feel pressure to perform. Have you had moments in the past where you felt confident and successful in group settings?

User: Actually, yes! Back in high school, I was part of a club, and my ideas were often well-received. I felt like my input mattered then.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It seems you have experiences that reflect your value and contributions. How can we draw on those experiences to help you feel more confident now?

User: I think recalling those positive moments might help. I just wish I could experience that kind of acceptance again.

Consultant: Absolutely, recalling those successful experiences can be very empowering. What if we brainstorm some positive affirmations or statements that reinforce your strengths and contributions, like what you experienced in high school?

User: That sounds like a good idea. Maybe I could remind myself that I have valuable experiences to share.

Consultant: Yes! Those reminders are important. Creating a list of affirmations might be a useful first step. Could you name a few strengths you believe you possess that could benefit your group?

User: I think I’m a good listener and I can think creatively. Those qualities helped me before.

Consultant: Great! Acknowledging those strengths is important. How could you use your listening skills to enhance your contributions in group discussions moving forward?

User: I could ask questions to better understand my peers and then offer creative suggestions based on their ideas.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful approach! It allows you to engage with others while sharing your strengths. How do you feel about trying this strategy in your next group project?

User: I'm feeling a bit more hopeful about it. I think I can definitely give it a try. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It’s admirable that you’re open to experimenting with new strategies. I’d encourage you to note your achievements, no matter how small, after each group interaction to reinforce those feelings of success.

User: I like that idea. Keeping track of my progress might help me see how I’m improving.

Consultant: Exactly! And remember, it’s a process. Building your confidence takes time. Is there anything else specific that’s on your mind about integrating into your new college life?

User: Sometimes, I feel overwhelmed by the social dynamics around me. It can be exhausting trying to figure everything out.

Consultant: I understand. Adjusting to a new social environment can indeed feel overwhelming. It might help if we explore some small steps you can take to ease that feeling. What activities or situations do you think could feel comfortable for you to engage in?

User: I think starting with smaller study groups could work. It’d be less pressure than larger gatherings.

Consultant: That’s a smart choice! Smaller groups can allow for more personal connections and help you build confidence. Would you like to set a goal to join such a group this week?

User: Yes, I will look for study groups that I can join. 

Consultant: That’s a proactive decision! Remember to focus on your strengths and the positive experiences we talked about. As our session comes to a close, what are your key takeaways from today?

User: I feel more aware of my strengths and how I can use them. I’m excited to give this a shot and see how I fare!

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! It sounds like you’re ready to embrace new opportunities with a renewed sense of confidence. If you ever find yourself needing support, remember that you can always reach out. I believe you have what it takes to thrive in this new environment.

User: Thank you. I really appreciate your guidance today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Jin! I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care and take those small steps forward!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jing! I'm really pleased to see you today. I remember from our last session that you participated in a volunteer activity, which made you feel positive about yourself. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! Yes, that volunteer experience was great. I felt like I was making a difference and taking on a leadership role, which was nice. However, I still feel a bit lost in this new environment.

Consultant: It sounds like you had a fulfilling experience leading that activity. It's entirely understandable to feel a bit lost in a new environment. What do you think contributed to those feelings of being lost?

User: I think it's just the change. Back home, I was more popular and had a solid friend group. Here, it's tough to form connections, even though I enjoyed volunteering.

Consultant: That makes sense. Transitioning to a new environment can be challenging, especially when you’ve had a strong support system before. Since you felt good about your leadership during the volunteer activity, how might you harness that positive energy to help you build connections here?

User: Maybe if I try to lead activities or join clubs, I could meet more people. It was exciting to feel valued.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Taking on leadership roles can help you meet people and initially break down feelings of loneliness. What specific activities or clubs are you interested in exploring?

User: I’ve thought about joining the student council or an environmental club since I care about those issues.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent options! Engaging in these activities can indeed enhance your self-esteem and foster connections. How do you feel about taking those initial steps to get involved?

User: I feel encouraged! However, I’m a bit anxious about meeting new people in a leadership role. What if they don't accept me?

Consultant: It's quite natural to feel anxious about being accepted, especially in new surroundings. Let's challenge that thought a bit—what evidence do you have that they wouldn't accept you?

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence—it’s just a fear. The last group I joined was very welcoming.

Consultant: That's a valuable realization! Sometimes our fears can exaggerate the situation. If you think back to your previous experience with that welcoming group, what did they do that made you feel accepted?

User: They listened and offered support, and we worked together toward a common goal.

Consultant: That’s an important insight! You already have proof that friendly environments exist. What if you approached your next group with that mindset, focusing on collaboration and support, similar to what you experienced before?

User: I could definitely try that. It might help me to be more open too.

Consultant: Exactly! Keeping an open mindset can facilitate connections. As you consider joining these groups, can you think of some specific steps you might take to prepare yourself emotionally or mentally?

User: I think I’ll remind myself of my past positive experiences and how they helped me feel confident. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Reflecting on positive experiences can significantly boost your confidence. Are there any positive affirmations or mantras you'd like to create to reinforce those feelings as you embark on this journey?

User: Maybe something like "I am capable, and my contributions matter." 

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation, Jing! Repeating it can help solidify your sense of worth in new groups. Now, looking at your recent volunteer experience, what specific feelings or realizations did you have that you want to emphasize going forward?

User: I realized that I can make a difference and feel good when I lead or support others.

Consultant: That’s a profound realization! It reinforces your value and capacity to contribute meaningfully. How can you integrate that understanding into your future endeavors in college?

User: I guess by being proactive and stepping forward in group settings, rather than waiting for things to happen.

Consultant: Absolutely! Being proactive can greatly enhance your college experience and social interactions. Now, before we wrap up, let's reflect on your journey. What insights or strategies do you take away from today’s conversation?

User: I feel more capable of facing new situations, and I have a plan to join activities that fit my interests. I also have my affirmation to keep me motivated.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You’ve shown great progress today, and your proactive attitude will help you continue moving forward. As we conclude our session, what would you like to focus on maintaining or improving before we meet again?

User: I want to continue to remind myself of my positive experiences and actively seek out new opportunities to connect and lead.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, Jing! Keeping a strong focus on your accomplishments and stepping out of your comfort zone will be beneficial. Remember, it's okay to feel nervous; the important thing is to keep trying. If you need support, I’ll always be here to help. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and feel more hopeful about the future.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad to hear that. You've got this, Jing. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jin! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more comfortable in my new environment. I’ve started participating more in the clubs and making friends, which is a relief. But sometimes I still feel a bit low.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more comfortable and engaging socially. Can you tell me more about the times you feel low? What triggers those feelings?

User: Well, sometimes when I'm alone in my dorm, I start to feel nostalgic about home. I miss my friends and family, which makes me feel a bit sad.

Consultant: That makes sense. Nostalgia can bring up strong emotions, especially when you're in a new place. How do you usually cope with those feelings when they arise?

User: I usually try to distract myself with music or watch some shows, but it doesn't always help. Sometimes I just feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed, especially during transitions. Let’s explore that feeling a bit more. When you're feeling overwhelmed, what specific thoughts cross your mind?

User: I often think about how I'll never truly feel at home here, and that makes me feel even worse. I guess I feel like I’m missing out on something back home.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Jin. It sounds like the thought of not feeling at home leads to a cycle of sadness. Let's examine that thought—what evidence do you have that you'll never feel at home here?

User: I don’t know... I guess it’s just how I feel. I want to feel more connected, but sometimes it feels impossible.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. However, you've already made progress by joining clubs and making new friends. How would you feel if you reframed that thought to consider the connections you are starting to build?

User: I guess that could help me see things differently. I’ve been hanging out with some friends from the club, and it’s been nice.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on the positive interactions you've had can help shift your mindset. What do you think would happen if you concentrated on those connections instead of what you might be missing?

User: I think it might make me feel better about being here. If I keep engaging with my friends, it might lessen the sadness.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Engaging with friends can give you a sense of belonging. What specific actions can you take to deepen those friendships or find new ones?

User: Maybe I could suggest more group activities or study sessions. That way, we’d spend more time together.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Initiating activities can foster stronger bonds. How confident do you feel about suggesting those ideas to your friends?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but excited too. I think they'll be open to it.

Consultant: That’s a positive outlook! Sometimes a little nervousness is normal when trying something new. Would you like to come up with a plan for how to suggest these activities?

User: Yes! Maybe I could start by texting them and asking if they’re interested in a study group this week.

Consultant: That's an excellent first step! Texting is a low-pressure way to reach out. What other ideas do you have for activities you could suggest?

User: How about a movie night or a coffee break after class? Those seem fun and casual.

Consultant: Both sound like enjoyable and relaxed ways to connect! Setting a date for those activities might help solidify your plans. Do you feel comfortable taking that next step?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. It's nice to have a plan.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that, Jin! As you begin to engage more, pay attention to how these experiences affect your mood. How do you think participating in these activities will impact your overall feelings?

User: I think it will make me feel less lonely and more connected to people. I’m a bit more hopeful about being here.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Recognizing the potential for connection is a significant step forward. Let's also think about any challenges you might face while reaching out; what could that look like for you?

User: I sometimes worry about being rejected or that they might not be interested, which holds me back.

Consultant: Those concerns are valid and common. However, it’s important to remember that everyone experiences some degree of apprehension when making new connections. How might you remind yourself that even if not everyone responds, it doesn’t reflect your worth?

User: I could tell myself that friendships take time to develop and not everyone will connect right away.

Consultant: Exactly! That perspective can alleviate some pressure and help you stay focused on those who do respond positively. Before we wrap up today, how do you feel about the steps you've discussed?

User: I feel more empowered and ready to try reaching out! It feels good to have a plan.

Consultant: I'm so pleased to hear that, Jin! Remember, these steps can help improve your connection to your new environment. In our next session, we can discuss how it went and what you learned from the experience. 

User: Sounds great! Thank you for your support.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress. Enjoy your time connecting with your friends!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jin! I'm glad to see you here today. How are you feeling about your recent experiences at university?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty good lately. I had some meaningful experiences toward the end of the semester that helped me grow personally. I feel more comfortable in my new environment now.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made significant progress in adapting to university life. Can you tell me more about those meaningful experiences and how they contributed to your growth?

User: Sure! I participated in some group projects and activities that pushed me out of my comfort zone. I was able to connect with other students and even take on some leadership roles, which felt really rewarding.

Consultant: It sounds like those activities allowed you to not only connect with others but also develop leadership skills. What impact do you think this growth has had on your feelings about being at university?

User: Honestly, it's made me feel more confident. I used to worry about fitting in and being accepted, but now I feel like I belong here. It’s a relief.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift! Feeling like you belong can really enhance your overall experience. How do you see this newfound confidence affecting your future goals in both academics and social life?

User: I think it motivates me to take on more challenges academically. I also want to build stronger friendships and engage more in campus activities. I feel equipped to do that now.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re feeling motivated! That's a positive outlook. What specific academic challenges are you considering taking on?

User: I’m thinking of joining a study group for my major next semester. I believe collaborating with others could help me deepen my understanding of the subject.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Joining a study group can provide both academic support and social interaction. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel excited but also a little anxious. I want to make sure I'm contributing and not holding others back.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a bit anxious about new challenges. Let’s explore that thought. What evidence do you have that suggests you might hold others back?

User: I guess I’ve just been worried about not being as knowledgeable as the others. Sometimes I second-guess my abilities.

Consultant: I understand. That thought can be quite limiting. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them? Would you encourage them to join despite their fears?

User: I would definitely encourage them! I would say it’s about learning together and that everyone has strengths and weaknesses.

Consultant: Exactly! That mindset is so important. Each person brings unique strengths to a group. How do you think you can remind yourself of this when those anxious thoughts arise?

User: I could make a list of my strengths and remind myself that I’ve already succeeded in connecting with others. Focusing on that might help!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Reflecting on your successes can really help combat negative thoughts. As you think forward, what other social activities or connections do you want to pursue?

User: I would like to join a club that interests me, maybe something related to my major or a hobby. I think making those connections will be valuable.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Finding clubs related to your interests can enhance both your academic and social life. What interests you the most about those clubs?

User: I think I’ll enjoy meeting like-minded people and engaging in discussions that can expand my perspective. Plus, it sounds fun!

Consultant: It does sound fun! Finding joy in these activities is essential for a healthy balance. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on your progress. What do you feel you have achieved through our time together?

User: I’ve gained clarity about my goals and feel more optimistic about my place here. I now have some strategies to tackle my anxiety and build my social life.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Jin! You’ve made significant strides. Remember to continuously remind yourself of your strengths as you move forward. If you encounter any challenges, we can always discuss them together. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! Thank you for your help. I feel ready to tackle both my studies and my social life.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! It’s been a pleasure working with you. You're doing incredibly well, and I believe you can manage your future challenges. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support again. Take care, Jin!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance and support throughout this process.
