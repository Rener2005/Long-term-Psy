Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I don't know... I feel really bad. After the incident in music class, it’s like I can't stop thinking about it. I think I'm crazy and no one wants to be my friend.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel overwhelmed after such an incident. Let's talk about those feelings. Can you describe what they are and how they affect you?

User: I feel really sad and alone. It's like whenever I think about school, my stomach hurts. I just don't know what to do with all this anger and sadness.

Consultant: It sounds really tough to carry these feelings around, especially when they affect you physically as well. Can you tell me more about what you think when you feel this way? What thoughts come to your mind?

User: I keep thinking that maybe I'm just a bad person, or that everyone at school thinks I’m a loser. It feels like I can't escape those thoughts no matter how hard I try.

Consultant: Those thoughts must be really painful. It sounds like you're being very hard on yourself. Is there any evidence that supports those thoughts, or are they more about how you feel right now?

User: I guess they’re just what I feel. I know I have friends sometimes, but it feels like when I mess up, they want to leave me.

Consultant: It's common to feel more alone when things go wrong. Let's explore what happened during the conflict in music class. Can you share what was going through your mind at that moment?

User: I remember feeling really angry and everything just exploded. I didn't mean to hit anyone. I wanted to scream because I felt ignored, but it all went wrong.

Consultant: It sounds like your feelings of frustration built up to a point where it became hard to control. Recognizing that can be the first step. How do you think you could have expressed your feelings differently in that moment?

User: I don’t know… maybe I could have talked to my teacher instead of just... pushing my friend.

Consultant: That's a really good insight! Talking to someone you trust, like a teacher, might have helped you express what you were feeling without the physical confrontation. What do you think holds you back from doing that?

User: Sometimes it feels like I’d just be a bother. Like, who would want to listen to me?

Consultant: I understand that fear. Many people struggle with feeling like a bother when they reach out for help. But reaching out can show courage and strength. Let's think together, what could help you feel more comfortable sharing your feelings next time?

User: Maybe if I take a deep breath and remind myself it’s okay to ask for help? 

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking a moment to breathe and remind yourself that it's okay to ask for support can be very helpful. It’s a great strategy to start building more confidence in expressing your feelings. How do you feel about trying that in the future?

User: I think I could try that. I hope it works, but what if I mess up again?

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel worried about that. Everyone makes mistakes. If it happens, we can think about it together, and you can learn from it. Would it help to remind yourself that mistakes are part of learning?

User: Yeah, I guess mistakes are okay. But what if my friends get mad at me again?

Consultant: It can be scary to think about your friends' reactions. But true friends will understand that everybody has tough moments. How do you think you might communicate with them if something happens again?

User: I could probably explain what I felt at that moment. Maybe they’d understand.

Consultant: That's a great plan! Being open about your feelings can help your friends see your perspective. Remember, sharing your thoughts can create understanding and boost your friendships. 

User: Okay, I’ll try to remember that.

Consultant: Wonderful! As we wrap up today, let’s think about one small step you can take before our next session to practice being more open about your feelings. What do you think you can do?

User: Maybe I can talk to my mom about how I feel before going back to school.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Your mom might provide a lot of support, and it could help you feel lighter. I’m proud of you for taking this step. 

User: Thanks. I really want to feel better.

Consultant: You’re already on the right path. I believe in you, and I’m here to support you. Let’s check in next time about how it went. If you need anything, remember, I’m just a session away.

User: Okay, I'll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello there, I'm glad you could join me today. I know you've been dealing with some new responsibilities lately. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling about being appointed as the co-host for the class activity?

User: Hi. Well, to be honest, I'm really scared. What if I mess up again? I’ve made mistakes before, and I don’t want everyone to laugh at me.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about taking on new tasks, especially when you've faced difficulties in the past. You mentioned feeling scared—what specific thoughts are running through your mind that make you feel this way?

User: I keep thinking about what could go wrong. I imagine saying something silly or forgetting my lines. I just feel like everyone is going to judge me.

Consultant: That sounds tough, feeling like everyone is watching you and might judge your performance. Can you identify any specific thoughts you have when these worries come up?

User: I often think to myself, "I'm not good enough," or "What if everyone sees how clumsy I can be?"

Consultant: Those thoughts must feel pretty heavy. Let’s take a moment to examine them together. How much evidence do you have to support those thoughts? Have there been times when you felt better about your abilities?

User: I guess I did okay when I presented in front of my class last month, but I still stumbled a bit. It just makes me feel like I can’t do anything right.

Consultant: It’s great that you noticed you did okay during your last presentation! It seems like you’re minimizing the success you had. What do you think might happen if you focused on the positive moments instead of the mistakes?

User: I guess I could feel a bit more confident. But it’s hard to shake off the fear of messing up.

Consultant: It is challenging, and I appreciate your honesty. Let’s try an exercise. Imagine a friend was in your position and shared those same thoughts with you. How would you approach them or what would you tell them to help reassure them?

User: I’d probably say it’s okay to make mistakes and that they can learn from them. I wouldn’t want them to feel so bad.

Consultant: Exactly! You would encourage them to be kind to themselves. So, could you try applying the same kindness to yourself? Would it help to remind yourself that mistakes are part of learning?

User: Maybe... I guess if I think about it that way, it might help a little bit.

Consultant: That's a step in the right direction! It’s important to recognize that everyone makes mistakes and that they are part of growth. How do you think your classmates would react if you made a mistake during the activity?

User: I think they would first be surprised, but they’re nice. They’d probably just laugh it off.

Consultant: It sounds like your classmates are supportive. What if, instead of focusing on what could go wrong, you think about ways you could engage with them positively during the activity?

User: I could try to make jokes or include them in the activity more. That might help!

Consultant: Absolutely! Involving your classmates could create a fun atmosphere and ease the pressure on you. Would you be open to practicing how you might host the activity, perhaps role-playing some parts?

User: Yeah, I think practicing would be good. It might help me feel less nervous about doing it for real.

Consultant: Great! Let’s practice a few segments together. You can start by introducing the activity as if it's happening in front of your classmates. What would you say first?

User: Umm, I would say something like, “Hey everyone, welcome to our class activity! I’m excited to be here, and I hope you are too!”

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! You sound enthusiastic and inviting. How does it feel to say that out loud?

User: It feels a bit better actually. I think if I really believe in what I’m saying, it can help.

Consultant: Yes, believing in what you’re saying can empower you! Let’s add a bit more to your introduction. Maybe you could also share what part you’re especially excited about?

User: Okay! I could say, “I’m really looking forward to seeing what you all think about our topic today!”

Consultant: That’s perfect! You're opening the floor for interaction. How do you feel about sharing this when the time comes?

User: I feel like I could do it. It makes me think it might actually be fun!

Consultant: It sounds like we're building some confidence here! As you move forward, keep reminding yourself of the positive outcomes and practice those encouraging thoughts. What do you think you can do if negative thoughts creep back in?

User: I guess I could take a deep breath and remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and focus on what’s fun about it.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Remember, it’s about participation and learning together. Before we finish today, let’s summarize what we’ve practiced. What do you think is the most important takeaway?

User: I think believing in myself and focusing on the positive could really change how I feel. And practicing makes it easier too.

Consultant: Exactly! I’m so proud of the progress you’re making. Remember, take each step with patience and self-kindness. You’ve got this! If you feel unsure, just come back to these practices. What are your thoughts on our time today?

User: I feel a lot better! Thank you for helping me see things differently. I think I can handle this now!

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You've already taken such important steps today. Just remember, if new challenges come up, you can always revisit these tools we discussed. Keep shining, and I look forward to hearing how the activity goes!
###################
Consultant: Hello, A! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, but I still get really upset when I hear my classmates talking behind my back. It makes me want to avoid them even more.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel hurt when you think others are talking about you. Let's explore that a bit. Can you tell me more about what you feel when you hear those comments?

User: I feel sad and embarrassed. It makes me think that they don’t like me, and I just want to hide.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, A. It’s normal to feel sad and embarrassed in those situations. Let’s think about your thoughts when this happens. What kind of thoughts go through your mind?

User: I think that I'm not good enough and that they’re laughing at me because I’m different.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite heavy to carry. Can you see how they affect your feelings? What do you experience when these thoughts come up?

User: I feel really anxious and want to avoid social situations altogether. I sometimes just stay quiet.

Consultant: Avoiding social situations can feel like a way to protect yourself, but it may also keep you feeling lonely. Have you noticed any moments when you felt more comfortable interacting with your classmates?

User: Well, during the school activity, I felt good when I was participating, but then I overheard the comments, and it all changed.

Consultant: It’s great that you felt good participating! Let’s focus on that positive experience. What can we take from that moment to help you the next time you hear negative comments?

User: I guess I should remember that I can enjoy myself even if others are talking. Maybe I shouldn’t take it so seriously?

Consultant: That sounds like a helpful perspective! It's empowering to recognize that your enjoyment comes from within, not from what others say. How can you reinforce this idea when you start feeling upset again?

User: I could remind myself that everyone has their own problems and not everyone is thinking about me all the time.

Consultant: Absolutely! That's a powerful reminder, A. How about we practice some strategies you can use in those moments, such as deep breathing or focusing on your own positive thoughts?

User: That could work. I could take a deep breath and think about what I enjoy instead of worrying about what they think.

Consultant: Perfect! Let's try that now. Close your eyes for a moment. Take a deep breath in... and out… Think about something that makes you happy. What comes to mind?

User: I love drawing! It makes me feel relaxed.

Consultant: Drawing is a wonderful way to express yourself! How might you incorporate that joy during difficult social times?

User: Maybe I could try drawing with my classmates more. That way, I can share something I love and feel connected.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Sharing your passion could help build friendships. What kind of drawing activities could you suggest to your classmates?

User: I could ask them to join me in a drawing game at recess or art club.

Consultant: That sounds fun and engaging! It can also be a great way to break the ice. How are you feeling about taking these steps?

User: I feel a bit excited, but also nervous. What if they still don’t respond well?

Consultant: It’s natural to feel nervous, but remember, you are building your confidence. Focus on enjoying the moment and creating connections. If negative comments come up, you can apply what we discussed. How does that sound?

User: It sounds good! I think I can do it.

Consultant: I believe in you, A! We’ll build on these skills together. Now, can you think of one small step to take towards this goal before our next session?

User: I’ll try to approach a few classmates during recess tomorrow and suggest the drawing game.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic step! Remember to be kind to yourself no matter the outcome. We'll talk about how it went next time. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You’ve made great progress today. Keep practicing, and remember, I'm here to support you. See you next time!

User: See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, I'm really glad to see you today! How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling pretty good. I made some new friends during a school activity, and it felt nice to connect with them. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It's great that you had a positive experience and made new friends. How has this new friendship affected how you view yourself socially?

User: I think I feel more confident now. I used to think I wasn't good at making friends, but now I realize I can actually connect with others.

Consultant: It's amazing how a positive experience can change our perspective! So, what specific aspects of making friends do you feel more confident about?

User: I feel like I'm better at talking to people now. During the activity, I actually led a game, and everyone seemed to enjoy it!

Consultant: Leading a game is a significant achievement! It shows that you can take initiative and have fun with others. How did that make you feel in that moment?

User: I felt really happy and proud of myself. It was nice to see everyone having fun!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic feeling. It’s important to acknowledge those moments of pride and happiness. How can we help you build on this experience to reinforce your social confidence even further?

User: Maybe I could try being more involved in other group activities. I want to keep meeting new people.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Engaging in more group activities can help you practice your social skills. Do you have any specific activities in mind that you're interested in?

User: There's a book club and some sports teams I’ve heard about. I think those could be fun.

Consultant: Both of those options sound excellent! Which one excites you the most, and why?

User: I think the book club sounds fun because I love reading. I could share my thoughts and meet people who like the same books.

Consultant: Sharing your thoughts in a book club is a wonderful way to connect with others over something you enjoy. How can you take the first step to join that club?

User: I guess I could ask my teacher about it or look for a sign-up sheet. 

Consultant: Those are great ideas! It sounds like taking that initiative will help you feel more connected. What would you say is one positive thought you can remind yourself of when you think about joining?

User: I can remind myself that I have interesting things to say and that it's okay to be myself.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remembering that your thoughts and contributions are valuable can help ease any nerves. Have you thought about how you might handle any anxious feelings if they arise when you join?

User: I haven't really thought about that, but maybe I could take deep breaths to calm myself down.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a fantastic technique! It allows you to center yourself in those moments. Would you like to practice a quick breathing exercise together now?

User: Sure, that would be helpful!

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in for four counts… 1, 2, 3, 4... and breathe out for four counts… 1, 2, 3, 4. How does that feel?

User: It feels nice and calming. I think I could use this when I'm nervous.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, you can use this technique anytime you feel anxious. As we work together, how else can I support you in solidifying your social confidence?

User: I think it would help if I could talk about any worries I have about social situations or making friends.

Consultant: Of course! Addressing worries is an important part of building confidence. Can you share any specific worries you have about making new friends or engaging in group activities?

User: I sometimes worry that I will say the wrong thing and embarrass myself.

Consultant: That's a very common concern, and it shows you care about how you're perceived. Let’s explore this fear. What evidence do you have that saying the wrong thing would lead to embarrassment?

User: I guess I don't have much evidence. It’s just a fear I have from past experiences.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way based on past experiences. Can you think of a time when you were worried but things turned out better than expected?

User: Yes, during the activity when I led the game! I was worried it would go badly, but everyone had fun.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a perfect example. It shows that sometimes our fears can be unfounded. How can you remind yourself of this positive experience when you feel the worry creeping in next time?

User: I could think back to how well it went and how everyone enjoyed it.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Keeping a mental note of that successful experience can really help push back against those worries. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the goals we’ve set regarding your social confidence?

User: I feel really motivated! I’m excited to explore new activities and keep making friends.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Remember, you're already taking significant steps toward your goals. In our next session, we can discuss how your experiences in the book club went. I believe in you and your capacity to grow.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and support. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Have a wonderful time exploring your new opportunities, and I look forward to hearing all about it next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello A! I'm so glad to see you today. It sounds like you've had a great experience with the school play. How are you feeling about it?

User: Hi! Yes, it was amazing! I felt so happy when my teacher praised me. I hadn't felt that good about myself in a long time.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Feeling appreciated can really boost our self-esteem. Can you tell me more about what you enjoyed about the performance?

User: I really liked being on stage and acting. I felt like I could be anyone I wanted to be, and it was so much fun!

Consultant: It sounds like the performance allowed you to express yourself in a way that felt freeing. How do you think this experience has affected your confidence in other areas of your life?

User: I think it has made me feel braver, like I want to try new things instead of being scared. But sometimes, I still worry about talking to other kids.

Consultant: It makes sense that you feel encouraged but still have some worries about social interactions. Let's explore that a bit more. What kind of situations make you feel anxious when interacting with your classmates?

User: I worry they won’t want to play with me or that I’ll say something silly. I’ve had some tough moments before.

Consultant: Those feelings are completely valid, especially if you’ve had difficult experiences. Can you remember a specific moment when you felt that way, and what thoughts came to your mind?

User: Once at lunch, I tried to join a group, but they were already talking about something, and I felt invisible and embarrassed. I thought they must think I’m weird.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable to feel that way, especially in that situation. Let's take a closer look at the thought, "They must think I’m weird." How true do you think that thought is? 

User: I guess it’s probably not true. Maybe they just didn’t notice me.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Often, we can be harsh on ourselves and exaggerate how others perceive us. What would you say to a friend if they felt that way about themselves?

User: I would tell them not to worry and that everyone has their moments. They’re not weird for just trying to fit in.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re providing encouragement to others, and you can do the same for yourself. How might you apply this kind of self-compassion when you’re feeling anxious in social situations?

User: I can try to remind myself it’s okay to be a little awkward and that it’s not the end of the world if I don’t fit in perfectly.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective, A. It sounds like you're beginning to challenge those negative thoughts. Would you be interested in keeping a success diary where you can record positive experiences, like the play, and work on reflection?

User: That sounds helpful! I can write about my feelings during the play and also small things in school that make me happy.

Consultant: Absolutely! Writing down those moments will help you see your growth over time. How often do you think you could commit to adding to your success diary?

User: Maybe every few days? Just to keep track of things.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Reflecting regularly will reinforce those positive feelings. How do you feel about sharing your diary entries with me next time?

User: I would like that. It would feel nice to talk about my experiences.

Consultant: I’m excited to read about your successes! As we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize what you’ve learned about yourself. You’ve recognized your ability to enjoy new experiences and the importance of being gentle with yourself in social interactions. 

User: Yes, I feel like I learned a lot. It’s nice to talk it out loud, too.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, A. As you continue your journey, remember that taking small steps and celebrating your successes will help reinforce your confidence. Do you feel hopeful about the next challenges you will face?

User: I really do! I feel like I can tackle them one at a time!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! You've made great progress so far. Remember, I’m always here to support you. I can’t wait to hear about your successes in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I feel better already. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care until we meet again, and keep believing in yourself, A.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really happy to see you again today. It sounds like you've made some positive changes recently. Can you tell me a bit about how you’ve been feeling and what’s been going well for you lately?

User: Hi! Yes, I actually feel really good. My grades have improved, and I've been getting along better with my classmates. Even my relationship with my mom has gotten better.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made significant progress in several areas of your life. What do you think contributed most to these improvements?

User: I think I’ve been trying harder to be nice to my classmates and to communicate better with my mom. It helps that I’m feeling more confident in school.

Consultant: It’s great to see how your efforts and newfound confidence have positively affected your relationships! Can you think back to when you started facing issues, and what steps you took to change things?

User: Well, I used to be really quiet and didn’t stand up for myself much. But I started to talk more in class and participate, which made me feel more included.

Consultant: That’s an effective strategy! Speaking up and participating can really help boost self-esteem and build connections with others. How do you feel about your ability to handle social situations now compared to before?

User: I feel much better! I’m less scared of talking to people and I am even making some new friends.

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress, A! Building friendships is so important. As you look to the future, are there any specific goals you want to set for yourself in terms of your social life or academics?

User: I’d like to keep making more friends and maybe join a school club. Academically, I want to maintain my good grades.

Consultant: Those are wonderful goals! Joining a club could be a great way to meet more people and develop new skills. What kind of clubs interest you?

User: I think I’d like to join the art club or the science club. I really enjoy both.

Consultant: Those sound like perfect choices for you! Engaging in activities you enjoy will also help you connect with others who share those passions. How can we strategize to help you stay on track with both your friendships and academics?

User: Maybe I could set aside specific times to study and then times for club meetings or hanging out with friends?

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Creating a balanced schedule can help you manage your time effectively. Are there any challenges you anticipate in sticking to this balance?

User: I worry that I might get too distracted when studying, especially if I have a lot on my mind about my friends or activities.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. We could explore some techniques to help you focus when it’s time to study. Would you be interested in trying out a few strategies together?

User: Yes, I’d like that! I think learning new methods would help.

Consultant: Great! One technique is to create a dedicated study space that's free from distractions. Have you ever tried that before?

User: Not really. I usually just study at the kitchen table, and there are often distractions there.

Consultant: Setting up a special spot just for studying can really help you focus better. We can also use timers to work for a set amount of time and then take short breaks. How does that sound?

User: That sounds really helpful! I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Awesome! And as you adjust to this new routine, remember to be kind to yourself. There will be days that are tougher than others, and that’s completely normal. How do you feel about that?

User: I think I can handle that. I’ve been trying to be more patient with myself.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset, A! Patience is key to growth. Before we finish our session today, let’s review what we’ve discussed about your goals and strategies for the future.

User: Okay! I want to keep improving my grades, make new friends, and join a club.

Consultant: Yes! And we’ve talked about creating a study schedule and finding a good study space. It sounds like you have a clear plan moving forward. Do you feel ready to take on these goals?

User: Yes, I feel really motivated now!

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Remember, you’ve made great progress and have the tools to continue growing. This is our last session for now, but I trust you’ll apply what you’ve learned. If you ever need support in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate all your help. I feel much more confident now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, A! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Keep up the great work, and take care of yourself!
