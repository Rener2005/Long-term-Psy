Consultant: Hello, Xiaodan! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling about everything that's been going on lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really lost and anxious. I thought I'd be okay after the breakup, but I keep getting these overwhelming feelings and can't shake them off. It's like a cloud hanging over me.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult, Xiaodan. Breakups can often leave us feeling heavy and uncertain. Can you tell me more about what thoughts or feelings come to you during those overwhelming moments?

User: I just feel so lonely. I keep thinking about what went wrong and how I should have done things differently. It’s like I can't see a way forward, and I feel really sad.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel sad and to question what happened. Often, our minds replay situations, and it can lead to a cycle of negative thinking. What specific thoughts do you find yourself repeating when you're feeling down?

User: I often think that I’m not good enough, that maybe I did something wrong that caused the breakup. I keep telling myself I should have been different.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy, and they often don't reflect the whole truth about you or the situation. Can you recall a specific time when those thoughts were particularly strong? What did it feel like for you in that moment?

User: Last week, I saw something on social media that reminded me of him. I felt like I couldn't breathe, and all those thoughts rushed back. It just made everything feel worse.

Consultant: It sounds like that moment was really triggering for you. When you saw that post, what was going through your mind at that time?

User: I thought about how happy he seemed without me, and I felt this intense wave of jealousy and sadness. I just couldn't stop thinking about it.

Consultant: Those feelings of jealousy and sadness can really take a toll on our emotional state. If a close friend were in your position, what do you think you would tell them about feeling this way?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to feel sad, but that they shouldn’t blame themselves entirely. I know it’s silly, but I can’t seem to apply that advice to myself.

Consultant: It’s not silly at all; it can be hard to offer ourselves the same kindness we extend to others. What if we tried to challenge those negative thoughts a bit? Can you think of any evidence that supports the idea that you’re not good enough?

User: Well, I guess there are times when I did well in school and had friends who liked me. So, maybe I’m not entirely worthless like I feel sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Recognizing your strengths and times you felt valued is important. What might be a more balanced way to think about yourself instead of telling yourself you aren’t good enough?

User: Maybe I could say I have areas to improve, but also things I’m good at. It's just hard when I feel down.

Consultant: Absolutely, acknowledging both aspects is crucial. It sounds like you want to find that balance. Can we explore together what activities might help lift your spirits and build that self-esteem?

User: I used to enjoy painting and chatting with friends. I haven’t done those in a while, though.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful ways to connect with yourself and others. How about planning a time this week to paint or reach out to a friend? It could be a small step toward feeling better.

User: That could help! I do miss creating art and talking to friends. It might be nice to reconnect with them.

Consultant: That sounds promising, Xiaodan! Taking that step could bring some joy back into your life. Let’s also consider how you might manage those overwhelming feelings when they hit. Have you ever tried any techniques to calm yourself?

User: Sometimes I try deep breathing, but I often forget to do it when I’m really upset.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be quite helpful! What if we set up a little reminder for you? You could use an app or even sticky notes in your room to help you remember to breathe when those feelings arise.

User: I like that idea! Having reminders could help me pause and take a moment.

Consultant: Great! It’s all about creating tools that support you. Let’s also think about what new goals you’d like to set for yourself in terms of your self-esteem and emotional recovery.

User: I think I want to feel more confident in social situations and not dwell so much on negative thoughts about myself.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal to set! We can work on strategies that help you gradually build your confidence and reduce those negative thought patterns. How does that sound?

User: It sounds good! I’m ready to give it a try.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiaodan! It’s all about small steps forward. Remember, it’s a process, and I’m here to support you throughout this journey. As we wrap up today, what’s one key takeaway you’ll remember from our conversation?

User: I think it’s important to recognize my strengths and remind myself that it’s okay to feel sad sometimes. I will try to practice that.

Consultant: That's an excellent takeaway! Recognizing your strengths is a powerful step toward improving your self-worth. I’m proud of you for being open today. Looking forward to our next session, where we can continue this work together!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaodan! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been a bit better, but I still find myself getting easily upset over small things. I want to understand more about how my past experiences are affecting me, especially regarding my recent breakup.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling a bit better, even if it's not a complete shift. It sounds like you're ready to explore how your past, especially the breakup, is influencing your emotions. Can you share more about what specific feelings or thoughts come up for you when you think about that?

User: When I think about the breakup, I often feel like I'm not good enough. I keep replaying moments in my head where I think I could have done something differently, which makes me really anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of negative self-talk, which can be really tough. Let's take a moment to explore these thoughts together. What are some of the specific thoughts that pop up when you feel like you're not good enough?

User: I often think that I'm just not worth it or that no one would want to be with me again. It feels really overwhelming, and I end up isolating myself.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly difficult to cope with. Those thoughts can create a cycle of feeling isolated and increase your anxiety. Can we examine how believable you think those thoughts are? What evidence do you have that supports or challenges this belief that you're not worth it?

User: I know logically that I have friends and I do well in school, but in those moments, it just feels so real. It’s like my mind tells me that those things don’t matter.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when emotions are running high. It's important to challenge those thoughts. If a friend were to express similar feelings to you, what would you say to them?

User: I think I would tell them that they're worth a lot and that they have people who care about them. But I can’t seem to apply that advice to myself.

Consultant: That’s a really empathetic perspective, and it shows that you do recognize your value. Let’s work on finding ways to apply that same kindness to yourself. How about we create a list of qualities and achievements you value in yourself?

User: That could help. I guess I need to remind myself of what I do well.

Consultant: Excellent! Let's start by noting down a few things—what is one quality or achievement that makes you proud of yourself?

User: I think I'm a good listener. My friends often come to me for support.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful quality to have! Being a good listener is invaluable in friendships. What else would you add to your list?

User: I also work hard in my studies. My grades have been decent despite everything.

Consultant: That’s impressive, especially considering the challenges you’re facing. Let's keep building this list. It's important to recognize these strengths regularly. How do you think you can incorporate affirmations about these qualities into your daily routine?

User: Maybe I can write them down and read them to myself every morning? To remind myself.

Consultant: Absolutely! Writing them down is a great strategy. You could place them somewhere visible so they serve as a daily reminder. How do you feel about that?

User: That sounds like a good plan. I'm a bit nervous about it, but I think it could help.

Consultant: Feeling nervous is totally normal when trying something new. Remember, it's a process. Would you like to explore other strategies that can help you feel more confident in social situations as well?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I often get anxious before talking to new people. 

Consultant: Let's discuss some small steps you can take. Have you considered practicing some conversation starters? It can feel easier to engage when you have a few prompts in mind.

User: I usually just freeze up and don’t know what to say. What kind of prompts would work?

Consultant: Simple questions can go a long way, like asking someone about their major or a hobby. Practice saying them out loud; it can help you feel more prepared. Would you like to try coming up with a few right now?

User: Sure! I could ask what they think of a certain subject in school or if they like any extracurricular activities.

Consultant: Those are great starters! You’re becoming more proactive about socializing. How does it feel to see yourself developing these conversational strategies?

User: It feels a bit empowering, I guess. I just hope I can actually do it when I’m in the moment.

Consultant: You'll have opportunities to practice, and that can help build your confidence over time. It’s okay to feel anxious; it's part of the journey. How do you think you can handle the anxiety when it arises in those moments?

User: I could remind myself that it's normal to be nervous, and I might even succeed in making a connection.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! It’s all about taking small steps. As we wrap up today, what would you say is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think I learned that I need to be kinder to myself and recognize my strengths. I also feel a bit more equipped to handle social situations.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization, Xiaodan. Remember, it's all about progress. You can continue to celebrate your strengths and use your new strategies. I'm here to support you whenever you need it. How are you feeling about our next steps?

User: I feel hopeful. I think I can work on these things until our next session.

Consultant: I believe in you, Xiaodan. You've got this! Don't hesitate to reach out if you need any support before our next meeting. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaodan! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to engage more with people, but I still feel really anxious, especially when talking to boys. It's tough for me to know how to start a conversation.

Consultant: I hear you; starting conversations can be quite challenging, especially when you feel anxious. Let’s talk about what specific thoughts or feelings come up for you when you think about talking to someone new.

User: I often think about how they might not like me or find me boring. That makes me super nervous, and I tend to back off.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling like you might be judged before even saying hello. Can you recall a specific moment recently where you felt this way? What thoughts went through your mind at that time?

User: Well, last week at a group study session, I wanted to ask a question, but I worried everyone would think I was being stupid. I kept quiet instead.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way in a group. When you held back, how did that make you feel afterwards?

User: I felt disappointed in myself. I wanted to be part of the discussion, but I let my fears hold me back.

Consultant: It’s so important that you recognize those feelings of disappointment. Let’s explore that fear a bit more. What evidence do you have that asking questions would make people think negatively of you?

User: I guess I don’t really have solid evidence. It’s just this strong feeling that makes me hesitate.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight! Sometimes, our feelings can create a narrative that isn’t based on reality. What do you think a friend might say if they were in your situation?

User: They would probably tell me to just speak up and that it’s okay to ask questions.

Consultant: Exactly! Sometimes, receiving support from our own perspectives can help shift our thinking. How about we practice a scenario where you might ask a question in a group? 

User: That sounds useful. I’m a little nervous, but I’d like to try.

Consultant: Let’s start simple. Imagine you’re in that group and you want to ask about the homework. What would you say? 

User: Um, I think I would say, "Can someone explain this problem to me?"

Consultant: That’s a great start! You can say that. How does saying it out loud make you feel?

User: It feels a little scary, but also kind of doable.

Consultant: That’s a positive step! Now, let’s think of ways to prepare for such moments. How could you remind yourself that it’s okay to speak up?

User: Maybe I can write down a few phrases before class to give me confidence, like "My questions are valid."

Consultant: I love that idea! Having positive affirmations can really boost your confidence. Would you be willing to try that in your next class?

User: Yes, I will give it a shot! It feels more manageable now.

Consultant: Wonderful! As you practice this, how about setting a small goal for yourself, like speaking up at least once in each group session?

User: That sounds good. Just once seems achievable without overwhelming myself.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Remember, it’s about gradual exposure and practice. If things don’t go perfectly, that’s okay too. You’re learning.

User: I really like that approach. I think I can handle it better now!

Consultant: Absolutely! Every step counts toward building up your confidence. How do you feel overall about facing social situations now, compared to before?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I still have some nerves, but it's not as paralyzing as before.

Consultant: That’s progress! Embracing those feelings can help you grow. Over the next week, let’s focus on building those social skills and recognizing your achievements, no matter how small.

User: Thanks! I will keep this in mind, and I’ll tell you how it goes next time.

Consultant: I can’t wait to hear about it. You’re doing an amazing job, Xiaodan! Just remember, it's all part of the journey. 

User: Thank you! I feel encouraged to keep trying. See you next time!

Consultant: See you, Xiaodan! Take care and keep practicing those skills.
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaodan! I'm really glad to see you today. Let's start by discussing how you've been feeling about your social activities lately. What has your experience been like?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite excited about the group activities I participated in. It's nice to meet new people, but I still feel a bit nervous sometimes.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear that you’re enjoying the group activities! It’s completely normal to feel nervous in new social situations. Can you share more about the positive experiences you've had with these activities?

User: Sure! During one of the events, I found myself laughing and connecting with others. It felt nice to share some fun moments. But then, I worry about whether they like me or if I fit in.

Consultant: It's great that you had a positive experience and enjoyed laughter with others—that's a huge step forward! Your concern about fitting in is common. What thoughts go through your mind when you feel uncertain about their perceptions?

User: I often think that I might say something awkward or that they won't want to talk to me again. It makes me hesitate to join in more.

Consultant: I can see how those thoughts could make you hesitate. Let's explore those worries—do you have any evidence that supports the idea that you might say something awkward or that they wouldn't want to talk to you again?

User: Not really, it's mostly my own fears. They seemed to enjoy my company at the event.

Consultant: That’s important to recognize! It sounds like they appreciated your company, which is a positive sign. How might you reframe that worry to something more supportive when you feel nervous in social settings?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that I contributed positively last time, and it’s okay to just be myself.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Focusing on the positive interactions you had can help you build confidence. Have you had any thoughts about how to continue engaging in these social activities moving forward? 

User: I think I might try to join more groups and focus on having fun rather than worrying so much about what others think.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Remember, the more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become. What specific steps can you take to help remind yourself to enjoy the moment next time you socialize?

User: I could set a small goal for myself, like initiating a conversation with someone new during the next activity. 

Consultant: Setting a goal to initiate conversation is a great strategy! It helps you focus on connection rather than anxiety. How do you feel about that goal?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. I think it could be a good challenge for me.

Consultant: That mix of nervousness and excitement is completely normal. It sounds like you’re ready to take on this challenge! How can you prepare yourself for that interaction to make it feel more comfortable?

User: I could practice a simple introduction and think of a few topics to discuss beforehand.

Consultant: Practicing an introduction and preparing topics is a smart strategy! It can help you feel more equipped. Is there anyone specific in the group you’d like to connect with more?

User: There’s a girl who seemed really nice, but I wasn’t sure how to approach her last time.

Consultant: It’s great that you have someone in mind! Could you think of a way to naturally start a conversation with her next time?

User: Maybe I could ask her about her interests since she mentioned some hobbies at the last event.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic opener! Asking about her interests shows you’re engaged and interested in getting to know her. How do you feel about using that approach?

User: I feel more confident about it now. It seems like a good way to start.

Consultant: It is! Confidence is key, and you’re building it nicely. As you prepare for your next group activity, what feelings or thoughts can you remind yourself of to maintain that confidence?

User: I think I’ll remind myself that everyone is there to have a good time and that it’s okay to be myself.

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation! Believing that you can be yourself will allow you to relax and enjoy the connections more. What other supportive thoughts could help you in those moments?

User: I could tell myself that I have the ability to make meaningful connections and that it’s just about enjoying the interaction.

Consultant: Exactly! Those affirmations will serve you well. As you progress, remember to celebrate every small success and be gentle with yourself during moments of uncertainty. How do you plan to celebrate your next achievement in socializing?

User: Maybe I’ll treat myself to something nice after the event, like going out for coffee.

Consultant: Treating yourself to something you enjoy is a lovely way to celebrate! It reinforces the positive experiences you’re creating. Do you feel you’re ready to take these steps into your next social situation?

User: Yes, I feel much more prepared and excited to try!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. As we wrap up our session today, what’s one key takeaway you want to remember from our conversation?

User: I need to focus on enjoying the moments and not let my worries hold me back.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway, Xiaodan! You’re making real strides in embracing social opportunities. I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Keep up the great work!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaodan! I'm really pleased to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling pretty good. Joining that seminar and meeting new people has been a refreshing experience for me. However, there’s still a part of me that feels a bit anxious about maintaining these new friendships.

Consultant: That’s great to hear that you’re enjoying your new connections! It’s completely normal to feel anxious about new relationships. Can you tell me more about what aspects of these friendships make you feel anxious?

User: I think I'm worried about whether I'll be able to keep the conversations flowing. Sometimes I fear that they might not find me interesting enough, which makes me hesitate to reach out to them.

Consultant: It sounds like you're concerned about how you come across to others. Let’s reflect on this—what evidence do you have that suggests they wouldn’t find you interesting?

User: Well, I don’t know... I guess I just feel that way because I often compare myself to others. They seem so confident and outgoing, while I still feel a bit shy.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those comparisons, but remember that everyone has their own unique qualities. If a friend were in your position, how would you reassure them about their social abilities?

User: I would probably tell them that they’re interesting just by being themselves and that it’s okay to not always have the perfect thing to say.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! You certainly deserve that same kindness and understanding. How can we apply that reassurance to your situation when you face those feelings of doubt?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it's okay not to be perfect and that my unique experiences might be of interest to others. 

Consultant: Yes, exactly! You have valuable experiences to share. Let’s think of a situation where you felt successful in socializing recently. What happened, and how did it make you feel?

User: Well, during the seminar, I ended up sharing my thoughts on one of the topics. People seemed engaged, and it felt good to contribute.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic example! Engaging in discussions is a great way to connect with others. How did that experience impact your confidence in social settings?

User: It made me feel a bit more confident. I realized that I do have something to contribute.

Consultant: That’s a key insight! Building on this confidence is important. Can we brainstorm some small strategies to help you maintain those connections and feel more at ease when reaching out to others?

User: Sure! Maybe I could try initiating a casual chat with them, like asking about their weekend plans or something.

Consultant: Absolutely! Initiating small conversations can be a great way to strengthen those connections. What might hold you back from reaching out with something like that?

User: I suppose I worry that they might be busy or not interested in talking to me.

Consultant: It’s valid to feel that way, but keep in mind that reaching out can also brighten someone else's day. How might you challenge those negative thoughts when they come up?

User: I guess I'll have to remind myself that it’s okay if they’re busy. I can always try again later, and at least I made the effort.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach! Effort counts, and each time you reach out, you're building your social skills. Are there specific times you think would work best for you to practice this?

User: Maybe I could send a message during the weekend when I think they might be more free.

Consultant: That sounds like a smart plan! Planning it out makes it feel less daunting. How do you feel about this strategy?

User: I feel more confident about it now! It's less scary when I break it down like this.

Consultant: That's the spirit! You’re creating a supportive environment for yourself. Let's talk about how you can celebrate your attempts, regardless of the outcomes.

User: I could treat myself to a little reward after I reach out, like a favorite snack or some time with a good book.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Celebrating your efforts will reinforce your positive behavior and self-esteem. Do you think there's anything else we can add to your plan?

User: I think focusing on what I enjoy about these interactions, rather than the pressure of needing to impress, could help me too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Shifting your focus to enjoyment instead of pressure will make socializing feel more natural and fulfilling. It sounds like you really have a solid plan moving forward!

User: Yes, I’m feeling excited about trying these things out. It really feels good to have a plan!

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a journey, and each step you take is valuable. As we wrap up today’s session, how do you feel overall about your progress and the direction you’re heading?

User: I feel like I’ve made a lot of progress in understanding myself and my feelings. I’m looking forward to building these friendships and my confidence even more.

Consultant: That’s amazing! You should be proud of all that you’ve accomplished. As you continue this journey, remember the strategies we discussed today. If you ever feel stuck, I’m here to help. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I feel much more hopeful now!

Consultant: You're very welcome! Keep reflecting on your strengths, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need to talk again. Take care, Xiaodan!

User: Bye!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Dan! I'm glad to see you again for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good actually. After successfully organizing the activity with my new friends, I gained a lot of confidence. It made me realize that I can achieve things on my own.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It's great that you've recognized your capabilities. This accomplishment must have brought you a sense of satisfaction. Can you tell me more about how that experience has influenced your feelings about yourself?

User: Definitely! I used to doubt myself a lot, but now I feel more positive about my skills. It's like a weight has been lifted, and I want to keep pushing myself to do more.

Consultant: That’s an empowering realization, Xiao Dan. It seems you're feeling more motivated to explore your potential. As we reflect on your progress, what specific achievements from this experience stand out to you?

User: I think the fact that I managed everything on my own was a big deal for me. I took the initiative, planned everything properly, and it turned out well. That really gave me a boost of self-esteem.

Consultant: It sounds like you took on a significant leadership role in that activity, which is a huge step forward. How do you see this experience translating into your future endeavors or goals?

User: I want to keep taking on more responsibilities, maybe even organize more events or activities. I feel like I could even apply for some student leadership roles.

Consultant: That’s an exciting prospect! Setting such goals can help maintain your momentum. What challenges do you think you might face as you pursue these new opportunities?

User: I’m a bit worried that old doubts might creep back in. You know, what if I can’t handle it or people don’t think I’m capable?

Consultant: It's entirely normal to have those concerns, especially when stepping into new roles. Let’s explore those thoughts together. Can you describe what thoughts come to your mind when you think about taking on more responsibility?

User: I often think, “What if I fail?” or “What if others judge me for not being good enough?” It really makes me hesitate.

Consultant: I can see how those thoughts might hold you back. They seem to reflect a common cognitive distortion, like jumping to conclusions. What evidence do you have that supports these fears? And is there also evidence that contradicts them?

User: I mean, I guess my success with the last activity shows I can do it. But sometimes it feels like it was just luck.

Consultant: That’s a good point. While luck can happen, your success also indicates your hard work and ability to plan and execute. If a friend was in your position, what would you tell them about their capabilities?

User: I would tell them they are capable and should trust in their skills, just like they did before. Maybe I should listen to my own advice!

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Trusting in your abilities is crucial. Let’s try a small experiment: how about you set a small goal for yourself in the coming week, something that pushes you but is also achievable? 

User: I think I can try organizing a small study group with my classmates. That seems manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Organizing a study group can help reinforce your leadership skills and connect you with others. How might you prepare for that?

User: I’ll need to plan the topics, choose a date, and invite people. I’ll make sure to communicate clearly about what we’ll cover.

Consultant: Excellent approach! Being prepared can help ease your anxiety. As you set this goal, what strategies can you use if self-doubt begins to arise during the process?

User: I could remind myself of my past success and also talk to a friend for support if I feel unsure.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies, Xiao Dan. It’s important to lean on your support system. As we wrap up our session today, what do you think is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I feel more confident in my abilities and realize I have the tools to face my fears. Setting those small goals will really help me stay focused.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! You’ve made significant progress, and I believe you can maintain this positive trajectory. Remember, it’s normal to feel uncertain at times, but acknowledging your strengths is key. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. You’re doing great work. Take care until we meet again!
