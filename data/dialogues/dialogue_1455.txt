Consultant: Hello, Xiao Xuan! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. It's been tough. I still feel really angry and sad about things at home, especially with my stepmother. I just feel like I don't belong anywhere.

Consultant: I can see that you're struggling with feelings of anger and sadness regarding your situation. Let's talk more about those emotions. Can you share with me what specifically has been bothering you lately?

User: Well, I had a fight with a classmate recently. It was over something silly, and I just lost control. Afterward, I felt really lonely and misunderstood.

Consultant: It sounds like that was a really difficult experience for you. Losing control in that moment must have felt overwhelming. How did you feel afterward, when you were alone with those thoughts?

User: I felt ashamed and angry with myself. I don't want to act like that again, but it just happens sometimes. 

Consultant: Feeling ashamed can be really heavy. It's understandable you want to manage your anger better. Do you have an idea about what triggers that anger for you, or what thoughts come to your mind during those moments?

User: I think it mostly happens when I'm feeling frustrated, or when someone doesn't understand me. It just builds up, especially when I think about my life at home.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. It seems that your home life has some strong effects on how you feel and behave. Can you describe what thoughts run through your mind when those frustrations build up?

User: I often think that nobody cares about me. Like when my stepmother yells at me, I feel like I'm just a burden. 

Consultant: It sounds really tough to feel like a burden. Those thoughts can amplify your feelings of anger and sadness. What do you think might happen if we tried to challenge those thoughts a bit? 

User: I'm not sure. I guess I never really thought about it differently. 

Consultant: That's okay! It can be hard to see things differently when you’re in the middle of those feelings. What if we tried to think of some alternative thoughts? For example, can you think of a time when someone showed they cared about you?

User: Well, my grandma sometimes supports me when I talk to her. She listens.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It's encouraging that you have someone who listens and supports you. What might a thought look like if you were to remind yourself of that support when you feel the way you do at home?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that I’m not alone, and that someone cares about me. 

Consultant: That’s a strong thought! Reminding yourself of the support from your grandma can help to soften that feeling of being a burden. What are some steps you could take when you feel anger boiling up, so you can manage it better?

User: I think I could go for a walk or talk to my grandma when I feel really upset.

Consultant: Those are really healthy options! Taking a walk can help you cool down. Talking to your grandma could provide that comfort and connection you need. How do you feel about trying those strategies the next time you feel angry?

User: I feel a bit hopeful. Maybe it could work. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re starting to see some potential ways to manage your anger. Remember, it’s a process, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. 

User: Thanks. It's just hard to remember all this in the moment, you know?

Consultant: Absolutely, it can be challenging. How about we brainstorm a few reminders or notes that could help you in those moments? Something simple you could keep with you?

User: Yeah, that might help. Like a note that says, "You are not alone," or "Breathe before reacting."

Consultant: Those are strong reminders! Keeping them visible could reinforce those healthier thoughts when things get tough. What do you think, would that feel manageable for you?

User: Yes, it seems doable. I can try to write something down and keep it in my bag.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! It’s all about building those small habits. As we close today's session, let’s review what you’ve learned and how you might apply it moving forward.

User: I learned that I can try to challenge my thoughts instead of just letting them take over. And I have some tools now to help me manage my anger.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re recognizing the importance of your thoughts and the impact they have on your feelings and actions. Going forward, is there something specific you want to focus on before our next session?

User: I want to practice using my note and see if I can talk to my grandma when I feel angry. 

Consultant: That’s a perfect goal! I believe in your ability to make these changes. If you ever feel stuck, just remember that it’s okay to seek support. I look forward to hearing how it goes next time we meet!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're welcome, Xiao Xuan! take care of yourself, we’ll talk again soon!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoxuan! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I still feel pretty marginalized, especially at home. My stepmother keeps treating me harshly, and after that incident at school where the teacher scolded me, I felt really upset. It seems like everyone is against me.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiaoxuan. It seems like you're experiencing a lot of frustration and misunderstanding from both your family and school. Can we start by talking about what exactly happened at school? What were some of the thoughts running through your mind at that moment?

User: I felt so humiliated when the teacher criticized me in front of everyone. I just wanted to disappear. I thought, "Why do they always pick on me?" 

Consultant: It's understandable that you felt humiliated, especially when it seems like you’re being singled out. When you had those thoughts of being picked on, how did they make you feel inside?

User: I felt angry and alone. It was like nobody understands me. I wanted to shout back or just run away.

Consultant: Those feelings of anger and loneliness can be overwhelming. You mentioned wanting to shout back or run away. How have you been managing those feelings since then?

User: Most of the time, I just bottle it up inside, but sometimes I snap at my little brother or feel like I could explode.

Consultant: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load of emotions, and it's spilling over at times. Let’s explore this together. Can you think of any physical signs in your body that indicate you’re getting angry? What happens in those moments before you feel like you might snap?

User: I usually feel this tightness in my chest and my hands get really hot. I also have this urge to clench my fists.

Consultant: Those physical signs are really important to recognize. They can be clues that help you become aware of your emotions before they escalate. When you notice those feelings of tightness or heat, what do you think you could do to calm yourself down?

User: I guess I could breathe deeply or try to think of something else, but it’s hard to remember to do that when I'm really angry.

Consultant: It makes sense; it can be difficult to remember techniques like deep breathing in the heat of the moment. What if we practiced this together? How about we try a simple breathing exercise right now?

User: Sure, I can try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four... and now slowly breathe out through your mouth for a count of four. How did that feel?

User: It helped a little. I felt my body relax a bit.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Remember, practicing this can help you create a moment of pause before you react in anger. In addition, when you feel that tightness or heat, what positive thoughts could you replace those "nobody understands me" thoughts with?

User: Maybe I could think, "I'm doing my best," or "I deserve to be treated kindly."

Consultant: Those are powerful affirmations, Xiaoxuan! Replacing negative thoughts with more supportive ones can change how you feel. When you're at home and feeling misunderstood, how might you put those affirmations into practice?

User: I can try to remind myself of my worth when my stepmom says something hurtful. I could also talk to my dad about how I feel, maybe he'll help.

Consultant: That's a great step forward! Talking to your dad about your feelings could help him understand your perspective better and possibly facilitate a better environment at home. What do you think? 

User: Yeah, that could be helpful. I’ll think about how to approach him.

Consultant: Excellent! As we look ahead, remember to pay attention to those physical signals of anger. And when you recognize those feelings, practice breathing and remind yourself of your worth. Do you have any worries about trying this?

User: I worry that I’ll forget and just get angry instead.

Consultant: That’s completely natural. Change takes time and practice. Perhaps keeping a reminder, like a note or a symbol that reminds you to breathe and affirm yourself, might help. What do you think about that idea?

User: That sounds helpful. I could stick a note on my desk.

Consultant: Perfect! Having that visible reminder can really assist you in building new habits. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you've learned about managing your anger and feelings of isolation?

User: I learned that I can recognize my feelings earlier and have ways to deal with them. I hope to have a better conversation with my dad.

Consultant: That's an impressive insight, Xiaoxuan! You've made progress today in understanding your emotions better. Remember, it's okay to seek help when needed. We can continue to build on this in our future sessions. 

User: Thank you, I appreciate it. I'm looking forward to seeing how things improve.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, take it one step at a time. I believe in your ability to create a positive change in your life. I'll see you next time!

User: See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoxuan! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I guess I've been okay, but I still feel really isolated at home. I just don't know how to talk to my stepmother. It's frustrating.

Consultant: I can imagine that feeling isolated can be quite difficult, especially within your family. Can you share a little more about what's been going on between you and your stepmother?

User: Well, she often gets angry for small things, and I feel like I can't do anything right. It's like I'm always walking on eggshells around her.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling like you have to be cautious all the time. What kind of thoughts go through your mind when she gets upset?

User: I think maybe she doesn't like me, or that I'm just not good enough. It makes me feel really sad.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel sad when you think someone doesn’t appreciate you. Let’s try to unpack that a bit. When you think she doesn't like you, how does that change your behavior around her?

User: I usually just try to avoid her when I can. I don't want to make things worse, so I keep to myself a lot.

Consultant: Avoiding situations can seem like a safe choice. But I wonder, what do you think might happen if you tried to talk to her instead?

User: I’m not sure. I'm worried it might just make her more angry, or she won't listen to me at all.

Consultant: That fear is completely valid; it’s tough to confront someone when you're unsure of their reaction. Have you had any positive experiences with her that you can remember?

User: Sometimes she helps me with my homework, and she’s nice then. But it feels like those moments are rare.

Consultant: It's great that you have those moments of connection, even if they feel infrequent. Let’s think about those times when she was nice—what was different about those interactions?

User: I think it was just a quieter time, without any stress. Maybe she was just being more patient.

Consultant: Patience is a key factor in our interactions. Maybe we can explore finding a calmer moment to express how you feel. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds okay, but I don’t know what to say to her.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel unsure about what to say. We can work on some phrases together to express your feelings. How would you feel about telling her how her reactions make you feel?

User: I think I could try that, but what if she gets mad again?

Consultant: It is a possibility, but remember that your feelings are valid, and it’s important to express them. You could also reassure her that you’re sharing because you want to understand each other better. Would that make you feel more comfortable?

User: I guess that could help. I just really want things to be better with her.

Consultant: A desire for improvement is a great starting point. Let’s practice how you could begin that conversation. What do you think about saying something like, “Can we talk? I feel sad when things get tense between us”?

User: That sounds good! I could try that.

Consultant: Awesome! Practicing what you’ll say can make you feel more confident. Is there anything else you’d like to share about how you're feeling in your home right now?

User: I just wish my dad would notice how hard it is, too. I feel like he doesn’t see what’s going on.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re looking for support from your dad, which is completely understandable. Have you ever thought about talking to him about how you’ve been feeling?

User: I haven’t really. I’m not sure how he’d react. 

Consultant: That’s fair. We can take it step by step. Just like with your stepmother, expressing your feelings can also help him understand what you’re going through. What if you practiced a similar approach?

User: I might give it a try. It just feels complicated.

Consultant: Complexity often comes with emotions and family dynamics. What’s one thing you could do to prepare for that conversation with your dad?

User: I could write down my feelings so I don’t forget what I want to say.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Writing can help clarify your thoughts and make it easier to communicate. How do you feel about the idea of sharing your feelings with your dad and stepmother now?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Like maybe it’s not impossible to talk to them.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift! Remember, taking these steps is about sharing your experience. As we discussed, you have the power to influence the dynamics in your home. 

User: Yeah, I guess if I try, it might help. I’m just still nervous.

Consultant: Feeling nervous is entirely normal! It shows that you care about these relationships. One step at a time, and I’m here to support you through it. How about we also think of a fun activity you can do to relax a bit in between these conversations?

User: That could be nice. I used to like drawing.

Consultant: Drawing sounds like a wonderful way to express yourself and manage emotions. Would you like to set aside some time for that this week?

User: Yes, that would be great!

Consultant: Fantastic! Engaging in something you enjoy can really help balance the feelings of stress. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. We can continue to explore these feelings further in our next session.

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaoxuan! I'm proud of you for taking these steps. See you next time!

Consultant: Hi, welcome to today's session! I'm glad you're here. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit unsure about my social skills. It's like I want to connect with others, especially in the new activity group at school, but I also feel out of place sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing some mixed feelings about social situations. You want to make connections, yet it feels challenging. What specific moments in the activity group have made you feel this way?

User: Sometimes, when everyone is talking and laughing, I feel like I just don't fit in. It's awkward for me, and I worry that they might not want me around.

Consultant: I hear you. Feeling out of place in a social setting can be really tough. Can you recall any specific thoughts that race through your mind during those moments? What do you tell yourself?

User: I often think that no one wants to talk to me or that I'll embarrass myself. It makes me want to just stay quiet or leave.

Consultant: Those thoughts can feel overwhelming. It seems like you're worried about how others perceive you. What emotions do you notice when these thoughts arise?

User: I feel anxious and sometimes a bit sad. I wish I could be more confident and just join in without worrying so much.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way. You want to be confident and enjoy your time with the group. Let's explore this together. If a friend were feeling like you do in that situation, what advice do you think you would give them?

User: I’d probably tell them to just be themselves and that it's okay to feel nervous. Everyone probably feels like that sometimes.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s a great insight. If you can extend that same kindness and understanding to yourself, it might help reduce the pressure you feel. What are some small steps you think you could take to join in more during the group activities?

User: Maybe I could start by contributing a little something in conversations, like sharing an idea or just saying hi to someone.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Starting small can make it easier. What feelings do you think might arise when you take that first step, like saying hi?

User: I think I might feel nervous, but also a little excited if they respond well.

Consultant: It's natural to feel nervous! That excitement is great to recognize. Sometimes, it helps to rehearse the scenario in your mind. How about we think of a few friendly ways to say hi or introduce yourself to someone?

User: Um, I could say, "Hi, I’m Xiao Xuan. What do you think about this project?" That sounds simple enough.

Consultant: Yes! That sounds perfect. Practicing this could give you a boost in confidence. And remember, any response can be a positive experience. What do you think would help you stay connected to this moment, especially if it feels challenging?

User: I think if I remind myself that everyone else might also be a bit nervous, it would help. And knowing it’s okay to just try is comforting.

Consultant: That's a great perspective! Understanding that everyone has similar worries can ease your anxiety. How would you feel about setting a small goal for this week, like practicing your introduction with someone in the group?

User: I’d like that! I’ll try to say hi to at least one person in the group this week.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful goal. Celebrating small victories is key to building confidence. How do you plan to reflect on this experience after you try it?

User: I think I’ll write down how it went and see what I felt. Maybe I can see if things turned out better than I expected!

Consultant: Excellent approach! Reflecting can help validate your efforts and identify improvements. As we progress, we can explore how those experiences impact your feelings about socializing. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful about talking to others now. It's good to have a plan!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about progress and giving yourself grace. Before our next session, try to focus on the positives and share your thoughts with me when we meet again.

User: I will! I'm looking forward to sharing my experiences.

Consultant: I'm excited to hear about your progress! Stay focused on your goals, and remember that each step counts. See you next time!

User: Thank you for your help today! See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Xuan! I'm really glad to see you today. Last time we spoke, you mentioned feeling more integrated with your classmates after the group project. How has that been going for you?

User: Hi! Yeah, I feel a bit better. My classmates appreciated our work, which made me feel a bit more confident. But at home, things are still a bit tough with my stepmother. 

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing a mix of feelings. It's great to hear about the positive experience with your classmates, but I can see that there are still challenges at home. Can you tell me more about how you felt after receiving the appreciation from your peers?

User: It felt really nice! I thought maybe I could be liked more by my friends, but then I go home and it's like everything falls apart. My stepmother is really strict, and it just makes me feel bad again.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It’s encouraging to know that your confidence is growing, but it can be disheartening when you face negativity at home. How do you usually cope when you feel bad after interactions with your stepmother?

User: I mostly just try to ignore it. Sometimes I talk to my grandma, but it doesn’t always help much. I wish things were different.

Consultant: It's good that you have your grandma to talk to, even if it's not always enough. Ignoring feelings can be tough in the long run. Let’s shift our focus back to that positive experience with your classmates. Can we identify what specific things you did during the group project that contributed to that appreciation?

User: I think I contributed some good ideas, and I helped organize our work. Everyone seemed to value that, and it felt nice to be recognized.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! It sounds like your efforts really played a key role in the group's success. Recognizing your contributions can definitely boost your self-esteem. How do you think you could apply this positive experience to future group activities or social situations?

User: I guess I could try to be more involved. Maybe I shouldn't hold back my ideas next time. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic insight! Being more involved and sharing your ideas could lead to more positive experiences. Would you be interested in setting some specific goals for how you can engage in future group activities at school?

User: Sure! I want to participate more and maybe ask if we can work together again. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Collaborating with classmates again could help reinforce those positive feelings. Would you like to set a timeline for these goals or perhaps a way to track your progress?

User: I could try to speak up within the next week in class. Maybe I could also set a reminder so I don’t forget.

Consultant: A week is a reasonable timeline! Setting reminders could really help keep you motivated. Additionally, what do you think will help you stay positive about these efforts when challenges arise, like at home?

User: I might remind myself how I felt after the project. It’s hard, but I think thinking about that could help.

Consultant: That’s a wise strategy. Remembering those positive moments can serve as a strong motivator. Let’s think about any potential obstacles you might face if you try to engage more, especially regarding your home situation. How do you think you might cope with those?

User: I guess if things get tough, I could talk to my friends about it. Or maybe I can just focus on the good moments at school.

Consultant: Talking to friends is a great way to process feelings, and focusing on good moments can really help. A strong support system at school can be a protective factor against any negativity at home. Is there anything else we can explore today about your experiences or anything on your mind?

User: I still worry about my stepmother getting angry if I don’t do things perfectly. I don’t want to let anyone down. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those worries, especially when facing strict expectations. Let’s challenge that thought a bit. What evidence do you have that you would let anyone down if things don’t go perfectly?

User: I guess I don’t really have any solid proof, but it just feels like it. 

Consultant: Feelings can be powerful, but they don’t always reflect reality. It can be helpful to recognize when those thoughts are not based on facts. If a friend felt the same way, what would you say to them?

User: I’d probably tell them that nobody is perfect and that it’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: Exactly! It might be useful to speak to yourself with that same kindness. Using self-compassion can really shift your mindset. It seems like you’ve made some great progress today. How do you feel about the goals we’ve set?

User: I feel good! I like the idea of talking to friends and trying to be more open in class.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It feels like you’re starting to build a positive sense of self. Remember that it’s a journey, and it’s okay to take small steps. As we wrap up today’s session, what are your main takeaways?

User: I want to focus on the positives, remind myself about the project, and talk to friends when I feel bad. 

Consultant: Those are excellent takeaways! Remember, recognizing the positives in yourself and seeking support can help you navigate through tough situations. I’m confident that you’ll continue to build on your progress. If you ever need more support, please feel free to return. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate it and will try to keep this in mind.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Xuan! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Goodbye for now!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Xuan! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better. My relationship with my dad has improved, and my teacher noticed I've been more stable in class. But I'm still struggling a little with my stepmother's harshness.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that things are improving with your dad and that your teacher has noticed your stability. That must feel rewarding. Could you share more about how your relationship with your stepmother has been affecting you?

User: Well, she can be really strict and often yells at me. I feel bad about myself sometimes when she does that. It makes me anxious to be around her.

Consultant: It sounds challenging to deal with her strictness, and it's normal to feel anxious in a situation like that. How do you usually handle your feelings when she yells at you?

User: I try to stay quiet and not react too much. I think if I ignore her, it might be better. But inside, I still feel upset.

Consultant: That's a thoughtful approach to keep calm in the moment. However, it's understandable that those feelings still linger. Let's explore what goes through your mind when she yells at you. Do you have specific thoughts that come up?

User: Yes, I think things like, "I’m not good enough," or "I’ll never please her." Those thoughts make me feel really sad.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy and can really impact how you feel about yourself. It's important to recognize that these thoughts aren't always true. Can we try to challenge some of those beliefs together? For instance, what evidence do you have that supports the idea that you’re not good enough?

User: I guess I don’t have real evidence. I mean, I do okay in school, but her comments make me doubt myself.

Consultant: That’s a great realization, Xiao Xuan. It’s important to separate feelings from facts. What if we considered the idea that your worth isn’t defined by her comments? How would that change your feelings?

User: I think it would help a lot. If I could feel that I am enough just as I am, it would make things easier.

Consultant: Absolutely, believing in your own worth can significantly reduce that anxiety. Let's find ways to reinforce that belief. Are there moments where you feel proud of yourself or successful, even in small ways?

User: Yes! I feel good when I help my little brother with homework or when I do well on a test. I like those moments.

Consultant: Those are wonderful examples! It sounds like you have strengths and accomplishments to celebrate. How might you remind yourself of those moments when you're feeling down?

User: Maybe I can make a list of things I've done well and look at it when I feel bad. That could help me remember that I’m doing okay.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! A list could serve as a concrete reminder of your strengths. How can we ensure you keep this practice going in the future?

User: I can stick the list on my wall or in my notebook, so I see it often. 

Consultant: That's a great plan. Visual reminders can be very powerful. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the progress you’ve made in our sessions and with your emotions lately?

User: I feel really good. I can see that I am improving. Thinking about my strengths helps a lot.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear you’re feeling that way! It's been a pleasure to support you in recognizing your progress. Before we finish, what strategies do you think you can use if you encounter difficulties with your stepmother in the future?

User: I think I’ll try to stay calm, remember my list, and remind myself that I’m enough. Maybe I can talk to my dad about how I feel too.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies, Xiao Xuan. It’s essential to have a support system and tools ready when you need them. Remember, you’ve made great strides, and I believe you can manage your feelings moving forward. If you ever need more help, don’t hesitate to come back.

User: Thank you so much! I’ve learned a lot and feel more confident now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of you for all the work you’ve done. Best of luck with everything, and take care!

User: Bye!
