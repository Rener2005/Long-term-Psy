Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you could make it to our session today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi, I guess I've been okay, but I often feel sad and kind of lonely. My dad is really busy with work, and I don't get to see him much. I just feel ignored sometimes.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you really miss your dad and feel a bit left out because he’s not around often. Can you tell me more about how that makes you feel?

User: Yeah, I feel really down. I used to talk to him more, but now most of our conversations are just over the phone. Sometimes, I feel like he doesn't care about me.

Consultant: It seems like you’re feeling a sense of sadness and maybe even some abandonment. Those feelings can be really tough to deal with, especially when someone you love is busy. What do you think about that?

User: It makes me feel like I’m not important. And since my parents divorced, I don’t have anyone to talk to about what I’m going through. I miss how things used to be.

Consultant: That’s understandable, A. It’s hard when things change and people you care about aren't as available. It’s okay to feel that way. Let's explore more—how do you express these feelings when they come up?

User: I don’t really talk about them. I just keep it to myself. Sometimes I cry, but I don’t want anyone to see me.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, A. Keeping those feelings inside can be heavy. What would it feel like to share those feelings with someone even just a little bit?

User: I don't know... I guess it could help, but I’m scared of being judged, or like they won’t understand me.

Consultant: That fear is very real, and it’s common to worry about how others might react. How about we think of a small way you could express your feelings? Maybe through drawing or writing?

User: I like drawing. I could try that, but I'm not sure it will help.

Consultant: Drawing can be a great outlet for emotions. It might help you express what you’re feeling without having to use words. What if I suggested you draw a picture about how you feel when your dad is away?

User: That sounds okay. I might try that. 

Consultant: Wonderful! And remember, there's no right or wrong way to express yourself. Once you’ve drawn it, we can talk about it together if you want. How would that feel for you?

User: I think that could help. I just hope it doesn’t make me feel worse.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel a mix of emotions. One step at a time, we can work through it together. What do you think makes you feel a bit happier, even on tough days?

User: Sometimes I like playing with my siblings, but I also feel kind of overwhelmed when they need so much attention.

Consultant: Balancing your feelings with those of your siblings can be challenging. Maybe we can think of some time you can spend doing something nice with them, while also giving yourself a moment to feel okay. Does that make sense?

User: Yeah, I think I’d like that. 

Consultant: Great! Let's brainstorm together. What’s one activity you enjoy that you could do with them? 

User: I like baking cookies. 

Consultant: Baking cookies is a lovely idea! It sounds fun and can bring everyone together. Perhaps you could plan a baking day with your siblings? It might be nice to have some quality time with them.

User: That could work. I could use a little break.

Consultant: Exactly, and it can also be a way to create happy memories while working through your emotions. How do you think you'll feel when you spend that time with them?

User: I think it could make me feel a little lighter and help me take my mind off things.

Consultant: That's a beautiful insight! Finding ways to lighten your mood is important. As we move forward, what steps can you take this week to express yourself or your feelings, even just a little?

User: I’ll try to draw my feelings and maybe plan the cookie baking. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, A. I’m proud of you for wanting to take those steps. Remember, you’re not alone in this, and it’s okay to reach out for support. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel a little better, like I actually have a plan. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’ve come up with some great strategies today. Remember, it’s okay to feel what you feel and to express it in ways that feel comfortable for you. 

User: Thank you, I appreciate it. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, A! I enjoyed talking with you today. Let’s keep building on this in our next session, alright? 

User: Okay, see you next time! 

Consultant: See you then! Take care, A.
###################
Consultant: Hello, my dear! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I guess I still feel pretty nervous about talking to others. I joined a club at school to try and make friends, but I barely spoke the whole time.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience was quite challenging for you. Can you share more about what made you feel nervous during the club activities?

User: Well, I just felt like everyone was looking at me, and I didn’t know what to say. I kept thinking that they wouldn't want to talk to me anyway.

Consultant: That must have been really tough. It's common to feel that way in social situations. What kind of thoughts were going through your mind when you felt like they wouldn’t want to talk to you?

User: I thought that maybe I’m not interesting or funny like them. I just felt so small and out of place.

Consultant: I see. Those thoughts can be really overwhelming. Let’s try to explore them together. Can you think of any times in the past when others enjoyed talking to you or liked your company?

User: Well, sometimes my sister’s friends talk to me when they come over. They say I’m funny sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a great example! So, it seems like there are situations where people enjoy your company. How does it feel to remember that?

User: It makes me feel a little better, but I still feel worried about new people.

Consultant: That’s totally understandable. Meeting new people can feel intimidating. Let’s take a look at those worries. What do you think could happen if you tried to start a conversation with someone new?

User: I guess they could like me, but what if they think I’m weird?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. But what if they actually enjoyed talking to you? It would be great to make a new friend, right? We could think of some ways to make it easier to start conversations. Would you like that?

User: Yes, I’d like that!

Consultant: Wonderful! How about we practice a few simple conversation starters together? For example, asking someone about their favorite hobby or what they like to do after school. What do you think?

User: That sounds good. I think I can try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine a situation where you’re at your club. If you see someone who seems friendly, you could say something like, "Hi! What did you think of today's activity?" Can you picture yourself doing that?

User: I can imagine it. It sounds a bit less scary to think about.

Consultant: That’s a positive step! Remember, every small interaction counts. How about you think of a few other questions you can ask the next time you see a new person?

User: Okay, I’ll try to think of a couple. But what if I forget them when I’m there?

Consultant: That’s a great question! It might help to write them down in a small notebook you can carry. Having a little cheat sheet can ease your mind. How do you feel about that idea?

User: That might help. I’d feel more ready to talk to someone.

Consultant: Absolutely! Being prepared can give you more confidence. How about also practicing saying those questions out loud? Sometimes hearing ourselves can reduce anxiety too.

User: I can try that. Talking out loud sounds a bit silly but helpful.

Consultant: Definitely! It might feel funny at first, but it’s a good way to prepare. Remember, everyone feels a bit nervous sometimes. You’re not alone in this.

User: Thanks! It helps to know that others feel like this too.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Let’s review what we've discussed today. You’ll write down some conversation starters, practice them out loud, and try to use them in your club, right?

User: Yes, I’ll do that.

Consultant: Excellent! I’m proud of you for taking these steps. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel a little more hopeful about talking to people. I think I can do it with some practice!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic outlook! Remember, it’s all about progress. If you practice regularly, it will get easier. We can continue to work on this in our next session too.

User: I’m looking forward to it! Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in you, and I’m here to support you. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, A! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling recently? 

User: Hi. I guess I'm okay, but I still feel a bit anxious when I think about talking to other kids. 

Consultant: It sounds like talking to other kids still feels a bit overwhelming for you. Can you tell me more about what makes you anxious when you think about those situations?

User: Well, last week, a classmate invited me to join a fun activity, but I just felt too scared and said no. I don't know why it's so hard for me to connect with them.

Consultant: It makes sense that you would feel scared after turning down that invitation. It's a big step to accept an invitation, and rejecting it can leave you feeling uncertain. What was going through your mind when you decided not to go?

User: I just thought I wouldn't fit in or that they wouldn't really want me there. 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really powerful, can't they? It seems like you were worried about not fitting in. How did thinking that way make you feel in the moment?

User: I felt really lonely and sad because I wanted to go, but the fear held me back.

Consultant: It’s really understandable to feel sad about missing out on something you wanted to do. Let’s try to explore these thoughts a bit more. Is there any evidence you have that suggests you wouldn’t fit in with those kids?

User: I guess I don’t really know them well, but I just thought they wouldn't like me. 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, especially when you’re not familiar with them. But sometimes, we might assume that things will go a certain way without having the full picture. If a friend told you they felt the same way, what advice would you give them?

User: I’d probably tell them to go and see what happens, to at least try it out.

Consultant: That's really good advice! It seems like you believe trying can lead to new experiences. How might you feel if you did take that step and went to an event with them?

User: I think I’d feel proud of myself for trying, even if it’s scary.

Consultant: Feeling proud of yourself is a great goal! Let’s think about smaller steps leading up to that. What if you started by talking to one person in your class, just to practice?

User: I think I could try talking to someone, but it’s still kind of scary.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel scared about taking new steps. What's one small thing you could say or ask someone to test the waters? 

User: Maybe I could just ask someone about homework or something.

Consultant: That sounds perfect—a casual opportunity to connect! What do you think might happen if you ask someone about homework this week? 

User: Maybe they’d help me and it wouldn't be as scary as I think. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Sometimes, those interactions are much less daunting than we imagine. How would it feel for you if this conversation went well?

User: I’d feel relieved and maybe even a bit happier.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Relief and happiness are great feelings to aim for. Let’s talk about how you could handle it if it doesn’t go as planned. How could you remind yourself to stay positive?

User: I could tell myself that it's just one conversation, and I can always try again later.

Consultant: That's an excellent way to think! It’s really important to stay gentle with yourself. How do you feel about trying our plan for engaging with others this week?

User: I think I can try to talk to one person and see what happens.

Consultant: I’m really proud of you for considering this step, A! Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. How about we check in on how this goes in our next session? 

User: Yes, I’d like that. 

Consultant: Great! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experience. Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous, and I'm here to support you. Keep practicing those positive thoughts! 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit better about it now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m really glad to hear that. Just remember, each small step can lead to bigger changes in how you connect with others. I'll see you next time!

User: See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you again, and I appreciate you coming in today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit nervous, especially after that family gathering. I tried to share some things about my life at school, but it didn't go as smoothly as I hoped.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel nervous about sharing your experiences, especially in front of your family. Can you tell me more about what happened at the gathering? What did you want to share?

User: I wanted to tell them about my friends and the cool projects we're doing in school. But when I started talking, I felt like they weren't really listening, so I stopped.

Consultant: That sounds really disappointing. It can be hard to open up when it feels like people aren’t paying attention. How did that make you feel when you stopped sharing?

User: I felt embarrassed and a bit sad because I wanted them to know me better. It seemed like they were more interested in other things.

Consultant: It's tough to feel overlooked, especially when you’re trying to connect. It's great that you made the effort to share, though. What do you think might help you feel more confident to share next time?

User: Maybe if I practice a bit more before I talk to them, I wouldn’t get so nervous. But I still worry that they won’t care.

Consultant: Practicing sounds like a solid plan! It might help you feel prepared. And remember, not every response will be exactly what we expect. What if we explored some of those thoughts—like the worry that they won’t care—together?

User: Okay, I guess I just feel like they have their own lives and problems. Sometimes I think they’re just humoring me.

Consultant: That’s a common feeling, to think others might not be genuinely interested. Can you recall a time when someone showed interest in what you had to share?

User: Well, my friend at school listened to me talk about my art project last week, and she even asked questions! It felt nice.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It shows that sharing can lead to positive exchanges. How might you apply that experience to your family interactions?

User: Maybe I should focus on finding one or two things that I’m really excited to share, kind of like how I did with my friend.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Focusing on what excites you can help draw others in. Would you like to brainstorm some topics you could share with your family next time?

User: Yes! I think I could talk about my art project and maybe a funny story from school.

Consultant: Those sound like great topics! How do you think you could approach sharing them during your next family gathering?

User: Maybe I could bring some of my artwork with me and start by saying, "Look what I did!" That might get them interested.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful approach! Visuals often capture attention. How do you feel about discussing your art with your family now that you have this plan?

User: I feel a little better. I think it could be fun to show them, especially since I worked hard on it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear you’re feeling a bit more positive about it! Let’s also think about how you can handle it if they don’t respond as you’d hope. What could you tell yourself in that moment?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s okay if they aren’t interested. At least I tried, and it’s my artwork that matters.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reminding yourself of the effort you've made is important. It reflects your creativity and pride in your work. How are you feeling about this plan overall?

User: I'm feeling more confident. I think practicing sharing will help, and I also feel proud of my art.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful shift in your thinking! It sounds like you’ve developed a lot of insight today. As we wrap up, what do you think you'll take away from our conversation?

User: I’ll take away that sharing is important, and it’s okay if everyone doesn't react the way I want. I need to focus on what I enjoy sharing.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic takeaway! Remember, each time you share, you're building confidence. I believe in your ability to connect with your family. If you need support, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help; it makes me feel more hopeful. I’ll keep working on this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made today. Keep me posted on how it goes, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, little A! I'm really glad to see you today. How are you feeling after your recent acknowledgment from the teacher?

User: Hi! I feel really happy! The teacher said I did well, and when I told my grandma, she was proud of me too. It made me feel good!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like receiving that recognition has really boosted your spirits. How did it feel to share that news with your grandma?

User: It felt nice. She smiled at me and said I should keep working hard. I liked that she was happy.

Consultant: Sharing your accomplishment with someone you care about can be such a positive experience. How do you think this recognition affects your thoughts about studying and communicating with others?

User: I think it makes me want to study more and tell more people about my work. Maybe I can be better at talking to my classmates too.

Consultant: That's a great insight! It's amazing how feeling recognized can motivate you. What kind of things do you think you could share with your classmates to help improve your conversations with them?

User: Maybe I could tell them about what I learned in class or ask them what they think about things. I’m just a little scared sometimes.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a bit scared when starting conversations. We can work on finding ways to feel more confident. Can you think of a situation where you might try to start a conversation with a classmate soon?

User: Well, there's a group project coming up, so I might need to talk with them about it.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! Working together on a project can help you connect. How do you feel about discussing your ideas with them?

User: I want to share my ideas, but I worry they won't like them.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. What if we try to challenge that thought? Can you think of any evidence showing that your ideas might be valuable?

User: Well, the teacher said my last project was good. Maybe they might like my ideas too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember, the teacher recognized your hard work. That’s a confirmation of your abilities. How can you remind yourself of this when you're feeling unsure?

User: I could picture the teacher telling me that again or maybe talk to grandma about it.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Visualizing positive feedback can help strengthen your confidence. How do you usually feel when you think about your ideas before sharing them?

User: I sometimes feel nervous and think they are silly.

Consultant: It’s common to have those thoughts. We can work to replace those negative thoughts with more balanced ones. What might be a more realistic thought you could tell yourself before sharing?

User: Maybe I could say, “My ideas are good enough to share, and it’s okay if they're different.”

Consultant: That's a fantastic thought! Reinforcing that type of positive thinking can help you feel more confident. How might you practice this before your next group project?

User: I could practice in front of the mirror or tell myself that before school.

Consultant: Great! Practicing can make a huge difference. Let’s also talk about your feelings when you share your ideas. How do you think those feelings might change if you remind yourself of your worth before speaking up?

User: I think I might feel less scared and more excited to talk.

Consultant: Yes, excitement can replace anxiety once you reinforce that positive mindset. How do you plan to approach your classmates during the project discussions?

User: I think I’ll start by asking them what they think first, then share my ideas.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach! Starting with their thoughts shows you're interested in collaborating. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel a little more brave now. I think I can do it!

Consultant: That's the spirit! I'm proud of your progress today. Let’s keep working on these steps to build that confidence. What will be your next goal after the project?

User: I want to keep talking to more friends at school and join a club!

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! Joining a club will offer many opportunities for interaction. How can we break this goal down into smaller steps to make it feel more achievable?

User: I can start by talking to a few classmates about their clubs and see if I want to join one.

Consultant: Perfect! Gathering information is a great way to ease into it. Let’s summarize your progress—what strategies have you learned to help with sharing and communication?

User: I learned to remind myself my ideas are good enough, practice talking, and listen to others first.

Consultant: Exactly! Those are powerful tools. You’re doing wonderfully. As we wrap up today, what are you most proud of achieving during our sessions?

User: I’m proud that I’m feeling happier and more ready to talk to people!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization! Remember, you have the skills and strengths to continue growing. Whenever you feel unsure, just remind yourself of your successes. I'm excited to see how you continue your journey.
###################
Consultant: Hello, little A! I'm really glad you came in today. I'm looking forward to catching up on your progress. How have you been feeling about your social interactions and studies lately?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling much better! I’ve made some friends and I even joined a study group, which has been fun. I feel like I’m improving.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It seems you’ve made a lot of progress in connecting with your classmates. What do you think has contributed to these positive changes?

User: I think being part of the study group helped. We work together, and I feel less alone now. I feel more confident when I talk to them.

Consultant: It's great to hear that the study group has had such a positive impact on you. Confidence is so important in social situations. Can you tell me more about how you felt before joining the group?

User: Before, I felt really shy and scared to talk to anyone. I used to just sit there quietly. It was hard to even raise my hand in class.

Consultant: I can imagine how challenging that must have been for you. It’s impressive that you’ve overcome those feelings and are actively participating now. How did you make the decision to join the study group?

User: I saw some of my classmates studying together during lunch, and they seemed to be having so much fun. I decided to ask if I could join, and they were really nice about it!

Consultant: That’s fantastic initiative, little A! Reaching out to others can be a bold step, especially when you’re feeling shy. How has it felt for you to interact with your classmates since joining the group?

User: It feels nice! I actually enjoy our conversations, and it’s not as scary as I thought. Sometimes we even laugh together.

Consultant: Sharing laughter and having fun with friends can build strong connections. What strategies do you think helped you feel more comfortable in this social setting?

User: I think just being myself helped. I tried to listen more and ask questions. When I found common interests, it made it easier to talk.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Listening and finding common ground are key in building friendships. What would you say are some of your accomplishments during this time?

User: I think making new friends and starting to talk more in class are my biggest accomplishments. I also find studying a bit easier now.

Consultant: Those are significant achievements, little A! They reflect your hard work and determination. As we look ahead, what long-term goals would you like to set for your social life and studies to sustain this progress?

User: I want to keep building friendships and maybe lead a study group one day. I also want to get better grades!

Consultant: Those are fantastic goals! Leading a study group sounds ambitious and a great way to solidify your knowledge and boost your confidence. What steps do you think you can take to achieve these goals?

User: Maybe I can ask my teacher if I can help organize a study session. I could also keep practicing talking with friends more.

Consultant: Asking your teacher for help is a great start! It can reinforce your leadership skills. How do you feel about practicing conversations with your friends? 

User: I think it’s exciting! I’m a bit nervous, but I want to try it anyway.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel a bit nervous about practicing. It shows that you're stepping outside your comfort zone. How do you usually calm those nerves?

User: I try to take deep breaths and remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes. Everyone makes them, right?

Consultant: Absolutely! Mistakes are a natural part of learning and can help us grow. Using deep breaths is a great technique to stay calm. Are there any other strategies you’d like to incorporate?

User: Maybe I could also write down my thoughts before talking. It might help me feel ready.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Preparing your thoughts can help boost your confidence. As we wrap up today's session, let’s reflect on how you can apply the strategies we discussed moving forward.

User: I’ll focus on practicing conversations, continue building friendships, and prepare for discussions. 

Consultant: You’ve got a solid plan in place, little A. It’s been amazing to see your growth and progress. I believe you can achieve your goals, and you’ve developed some great strategies to help you along the way. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. It makes me feel more confident.

Consultant: You're very welcome. I'm proud of you and the effort you've put in. Remember, you can always come back if you need any more support. Good luck with everything, and keep up the great work!

User: I will! Thank you so much. Goodbye!

Consultant: Goodbye, little A! Take care and keep shining!
