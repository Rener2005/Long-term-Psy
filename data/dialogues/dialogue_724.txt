Consultant: Hello Liu! I’m really glad you came in today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I guess I’ve still been feeling pretty low. I just feel like I don’t belong here at university, and sometimes the thought of dropping out crosses my mind. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough. The feeling of not belonging can be quite overwhelming, especially in a new environment. Can you tell me more about what’s been making you feel this way?

User: I think it’s mostly about my classmates. They seem to get along so well, and I feel awkward when I try to talk to them. I end up worrying about how I look and what I say, which makes things worse.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel anxious when meeting new people, especially if you feel judged. What kind of thoughts come to your mind when you're in these social situations?

User: I keep thinking that they’re looking at me and judging me. Sometimes I just feel like I’m not good enough or that they won’t want to be friends with someone like me.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are really weighing you down. Let’s explore them further. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that they are judging you negatively?

User: I don’t know. It’s more of a feeling I get. Maybe it’s just that I feel out of place, and I assume others can see that too.

Consultant: It can be easy to feel that way in new social settings. It might help to ask yourself, if a friend were in the same situation, what would you tell them about their feelings? 

User: I would probably tell them that they’re overthinking it and that people are usually focused on themselves. But I just can’t help feeling insecure.

Consultant: That’s a great insight. It sounds like you know what others should think, but it’s hard to apply that to yourself. How about we try to identify some evidence that suggests you are doing well in those situations? 

User: Hmm, I guess I have had a few positive interactions, like when a classmate smiled at me or joined in on a conversation I was having. 

Consultant: Exactly! Those moments are important to acknowledge. They show you that connection is possible. What do you think would happen if you started looking for these positive interactions more actively?

User: Maybe I'd feel a bit more hopeful? But I’m still scared of rejection and just being awkward. 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, and it takes time to build confidence. We can work on small steps you can take to gradually put yourself out there more. What’s one small action you think you could try this week? 

User: I could try joining a study group. It feels less intimidating since it’s about studying and not just socializing. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Joining a study group can help you connect with others over a shared goal. Let’s also think about how you can remind yourself of your strengths when you feel that anxiety creeping up. 

User: I like that idea, maybe I can write about it in a journal. 

Consultant: Journaling can be a powerful tool. It allows you to reflect on your thoughts and track your progress. What would you want to write down first? 

User: I think I’d like to write down times when I felt included or proud of my contributions. 

Consultant: That’s a great start! By focusing on your achievements and positive interactions, you’ll be reinforcing a more balanced view of your social experiences. 

User: Yeah, I hope that will help me feel less isolated. 

Consultant: It's certainly a step in the right direction. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. How do you feel about the steps we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel a bit lighter, actually. It’s nice to have a plan and be able to put things into perspective. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we continue to work together, we’ll keep building on these strategies. Do you feel ready to try them out this week?

User: Yes, I definitely want to give it a shot. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Liu! We’ll check in on your progress next time. Remember, it’s okay to take small steps. You’re not alone in this journey. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes. Take care until next time!

Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling even more isolated. The comments about my accent really got to me, and I find it hard to motivate myself to join any group activities now.

Consultant: I hear you, Liu. It sounds really tough to feel that way, especially when you're trying to adjust to a new environment. Can you tell me more about how these comments made you feel?

User: They made me super self-conscious. I just feel like I don’t fit in here, and it's not just about schoolwork; it’s about being around people too.

Consultant: Feeling like you don't fit in can be very overwhelming. It’s understandable to feel more withdrawn when facing such pressures. What do you think it would look like for you to feel more accepted by your peers?

User: I guess it would feel like being part of the group, like I can speak up and share my ideas without worrying about being judged. 

Consultant: That’s a positive goal, feeling included and being able to express your thoughts. Have you had any small interactions lately where you felt a bit more comfortable, even if just for a moment?

User: Not really. I’ve avoided a lot of interactions. I just sit quiet in class, and I feel like everyone is looking at me sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like those feelings of anxiety make it really hard to engage. What if we tried to break this down? Can you recall a specific moment in class where you felt particularly pressured to speak up?

User: There was a group discussion last week, and I had some ideas, but I just froze. I kept telling myself, "They're going to laugh at you."

Consultant: That’s very insightful. It seems like those thoughts were quite powerful, making you freeze. Could you explore the evidence behind that belief? What made you think they would laugh at you?

User: Honestly, I just thought about how they reacted to my accent before. It felt worse in that moment because I thought they wouldn’t take me seriously.

Consultant: It’s understandable to connect your accent to their past reactions. But is it possible that they might not be as judgmental as you fear? How might you approach a friend if they were in your position?

User: I would probably tell them to just be themselves and not worry about what others think. It’s easier to say that than to believe it for myself, though.

Consultant: That's a very compassionate perspective to have for others. Now let’s consider applying that same kindness to yourself. What if you tried that advice in your own situation? 

User: I guess I could try telling myself that it’s okay to be different and that my ideas still matter.

Consultant: Yes, that's a great starting point! I think we can also practice some small social situations where you can gradually express your thoughts, like small group discussions. How does that sound?

User: I’m a bit nervous about it, but I think it might help.

Consultant: Feeling nervous is completely normal, and it's a part of the growth process. We could set small, achievable goals for these discussions. Would you be open to that?

User: Yes, I would. Maybe just practicing what I want to say could help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing can definitely increase your confidence. Let's think of a few scenarios where you feel comfortable starting small. What do you think you could say?

User: Maybe just introducing myself and asking someone about their weekend could be a good start.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea, a simple yet effective way to engage. How about setting a goal to try that out this week?

User: I can try to do that. Just saying hi and asking a question feels manageable.

Consultant: Yes, it’s very manageable, and it’s a huge step forward! After you try it, we can discuss how it went in our next session. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection.

User: Thanks, I appreciate that. It helps to know I can take it one step at a time.

Consultant: You're welcome, Liu. It's wonderful to see you being open to trying these steps. Remember, I’m here to support you through this journey, and I believe you can do it.

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Let’s work together to maintain that hope and build on it. We’ll recap your progress and any feelings that come up in our next session. 

User: Sounds good. I’ll see you then! 

Consultant: Looking forward to it, Liu. Take care and remember to be kind to yourself this week.

Consultant: Hello Liu, I'm glad to see you again. Last time, we talked about your feelings of anxiety in your new environment. How are you feeling today?

User: Hi. Honestly, I'm still feeling a bit out of place. I thought it might get better, but during our group project, I felt ignored again. It makes me wonder if I should just give up.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of discomfort in these group settings. Can you tell me more about how it's been for you when trying to share your thoughts with your classmates?

User: Well, every time I try to speak up, it feels like they don't really listen. I get really anxious, and sometimes I just stop talking because I feel like my opinions don’t matter.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when your contributions seem to be overlooked. Let’s explore that a bit more. What kind of thoughts go through your mind when you attempt to share your ideas but feel ignored?

User: I think things like “Maybe I’m not smart enough” or “They probably won’t care what I say.” It makes me feel even more anxious and discouraged.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy to carry. It sounds like they are impacting your confidence. I’d like to work with you to challenge those thoughts. Can you think of any evidence that might contradict them? For example, have there been times when your input was appreciated or valued?

User: Hmm... I remember once my idea helped us solve a problem. Some of my classmates said it was a good suggestion, but I just brushed it off. 

Consultant: That’s a great example! It's important to hold onto those moments when your voice was appreciated. Let’s try to create a more balanced perspective. What would you say to a friend who felt like their ideas weren't valued?

User: I would tell them that their thoughts are important and that they should keep trying to contribute, even if others seem indifferent.

Consultant: Exactly! You see the value in encouraging others. Now, how might you apply that same encouragement to yourself? 

User: I guess I should remind myself that it’s okay to keep trying and that my thoughts are valid.

Consultant: That's a powerful realization, Liu. We all face challenges in expressing ourselves, but it’s essential to practice and build that confidence. Let’s shift our focus. How do you feel about role-playing a group discussion? It might help you practice expressing your ideas in a safe environment.

User: That could be helpful. I'm a bit nervous, but I think I can manage.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel nervous. We can start small, and remember, this is just practice. Let’s imagine a scenario where you're contributing to a group discussion about a topic you’re passionate about. How would you start the conversation?

User: I might say something like, “I think we should consider…” 

Consultant: Nice start! Let’s try to build on that. What specific point would you want to make?

User: Maybe I would suggest using a different approach to our project, something that could stand out more.

Consultant: Fantastic! That’s a proactive contribution. If you were to say that in real life, how do you think your group members would react?

User: I hope they’d be open to it... but I guess part of me worries they won’t support my idea.

Consultant: That fear is understandable, but by expressing your idea, you’re taking an important step. Remember, if you communicate it clearly, you're providing them a chance to understand and engage with your perspective. Would you feel comfortable delivering that suggestion right now?

User: Okay, I can try. “I think we should consider using a different approach to make our project stand out.” 

Consultant: That’s excellent, Liu! You delivered your suggestion clearly. How does it feel to say that out loud?

User: It actually feels good, even if I’m still nervous about how they’d respond.

Consultant: It’s great to hear you feel positive about expressing yourself. Let's talk about how to prepare for potential challenges. If they respond in a way that isn’t supportive, how can you handle that? 

User: I suppose I could ask them why they feel that way or if they have other suggestions to improve the idea.

Consultant: That’s a constructive approach! Encouraging dialogue can open up further discussion and show them you value their opinions too. It’s all about creating a dialogue. 

User: I see that… I think I could try doing that next time.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s remind ourselves that it’s a gradual process. Each time you engage, you’ll build greater confidence. How do you feel after our conversation today?

User: I feel a little more hopeful now and less inclined to give up. I think I can try again with a fresh mindset.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Liu. Remember, progress may take time, but you’re taking essential steps towards self-expression and confidence. Keep practicing, and don’t hesitate to reach out for support if you need it.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I’ll keep working on it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’re making. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Remember, you are capable of much more than you think!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been trying to participate more in campus activities, and I spoke up for the first time in a group. But I can’t shake off the worry that I might be criticized. 

Consultant: That sounds like a significant step forward for you! Speaking up is a brave move, even if it comes with some anxiety. Can you tell me more about how that felt for you? 

User: It felt a bit exhilarating at first, but then I started to worry if what I said was good enough. I keep thinking about any possible negative feedback. 

Consultant: It’s entirely normal to feel that way after stepping out of your comfort zone. Let’s explore this worry. What specific thoughts went through your mind when you were about to speak? 

User: I thought, "What if no one agrees with me?" or "What if I say something stupid?" 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite intense. Let’s assess how realistic those fears might be. What evidence do you have that supports those thoughts? 

User: Honestly, I guess there’s no strong evidence. Most people were polite. 

Consultant: That's insightful! It seems like your fears might not be fully grounded in reality. If a friend had those thoughts, what would you tell them? 

User: I’d probably tell them not to worry and that everyone makes mistakes. 

Consultant: Exactly! You're already showing compassion towards others. Now let’s try applying that same kindness to yourself. What would it look like if you treated yourself with the same understanding? 

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it’s okay not to be perfect. 

Consultant: That's a great start! As you continue engaging socially, try to replace those critical thoughts with more compassionate ones. What would be a positive affirmation you could use before speaking in a group? 

User: Maybe, “I have valuable thoughts to share, and it's okay if they're not perfect”? 

Consultant: I love that! That affirmation acknowledges your worth and allows for imperfection. How do you feel about using that in your next social situation? 

User: I feel it's a good idea, but I still worry it might not work as I hope. 

Consultant: It’s totally normal to have some doubt. Remember, it’s about practice and gradually shifting your mindset. Would it help to consider small social scenarios to practice this affirmation? 

User: Yes, I can think of some small group discussions where I can try it out. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Start small, and each experience will build your confidence. How do you think practicing this will influence your emotions in those situations? 

User: Maybe I won’t feel as anxious and can focus more on the conversation instead of worrying. 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Can you also think of a moment in the past where you felt confident or happy in a social setting? What was different then? 

User: I remember feeling relaxed when discussing a favorite book with friends. It felt natural. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic reference point! What do you think made that conversation feel so relaxed for you? 

User: I was excited about the topic, and everyone was engaged. 

Consultant: Engaging in topics you’re passionate about can be a great way to feel at ease. How can you incorporate your interests in future social interactions? 

User: I could bring up things I love, like books or movies. It might make it easier to connect with others. 

Consultant: Yes! Connecting over shared interests can lower that anxiety barrier. As we wrap up today, how are you feeling about applying these strategies in your social life? 

User: I feel a bit more confident actually. I think I can try to be kinder to myself and focus on what excites me. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It's all about taking those small steps. Remember, it’s okay to feel uncertain, but engaging positively can help. Would you like to summarize what you’ve learned today? 

User: I learned that I should challenge my negative thoughts and remind myself that perfection is not necessary. Focusing on my interests can help me connect more easily with others. 

Consultant: Perfect summary! You’re starting to embrace the uncertainty while recognizing your strengths. Remember to practice those affirmations. I'm looking forward to hearing how it goes. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel more hopeful about things now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep nurturing that hope, and I’ll see you next time to discuss your progress. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to see you today. I remember from our last session that you’ve been working on your social interactions and feeling a bit more joy from them. How are you feeling about your social life since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I feel a bit better, actually. I’ve been trying to engage more with my peers and it feels good. But I still have moments when I question if I really belong here. Sometimes it’s overwhelming.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve made some positive strides in connecting with others, which is great to hear! However, I understand that feelings of uncertainty can still creep in. Can you share more about what moments or situations specifically trigger these feelings of not belonging?

User: Well, sometimes when I’m with my new friends, I feel like maybe they’re judging me or that I’m not as interesting as they are. I start second-guessing everything I say or do.

Consultant: That’s very understandable, Liu. Social situations can bring out a lot of self-doubt. You mentioned feeling judged—what kind of thoughts do you have when you feel this way? 

User: I think things like "They won't want to hang out with me anymore" or "I’m being awkward right now." It makes me want to withdraw a bit.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really challenging to sit with, especially when they push you to withdraw instead of engaging. Let’s explore those thoughts for a moment: how do you think these thoughts affect your feelings and behavior in social situations?

User: They definitely make me more anxious and less willing to speak up. I sometimes just nod along rather than participate in conversations, which makes me feel even more isolated.

Consultant: That makes sense. It sounds like your thoughts are creating a cycle that leads to withdrawal, which reinforces your feelings of isolation. What if we tried to challenge some of those thoughts? For example, what evidence do you have that supports the idea that your friends are judging you?

User: I guess I don’t have direct evidence. It’s more about how I interpret their reactions. For example, if someone doesn’t respond immediately, I think they’re not interested in what I’m saying.

Consultant: That’s a common cognitive distortion called "mind reading," where we assume we know what others are thinking of us without actual evidence. If a friend of yours thought like that, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably say they’re overthinking it and that their friends are probably just busy or distracted.

Consultant: Exactly! So, what if you could apply that same perspective to your own thoughts? Would it be possible to remind yourself that your friends might not be judging you as harshly as you think?

User: Yes, I think that could help. I should try to step back and see it more objectively. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Let’s also think about how you can gradually expose yourself to those moments of uncertainty in social situations. Are there any specific scenarios where you could practice engaging more openly, even if it feels a little uncomfortable?

User: Maybe when we hang out as a group, I could try to share a funny story or ask a question about their interests instead of just listening.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Sharing a story or asking questions can encourage more interaction and help you feel more connected. How might you feel if you tried that out?

User: I’d feel a bit nervous, but also excited! If it goes well, it could boost my confidence.

Consultant: Absolutely! And remember, it’s okay to feel nervous—that's a natural response to stepping out of your comfort zone. Keep track of those positive interactions as they occur; they can serve as reminders that you are doing well socially. 

User: Yes, I’ll keep a journal of these positive experiences. I think that could really help me.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Journaling can reinforce your progress and help you focus on the positive aspects of your interactions. Can you think of a specific social gathering coming up where you might apply these strategies?

User: There’s a study group meeting next week. I’ll try to participate more actively.

Consultant: Great! That’s a perfect opportunity. How can you remind yourself to stay present and challenge any negative thoughts that might come up during the meeting?

User: Maybe I can write down a few affirmations or reminders to look at before the meeting. Something like "I belong here" or "My thoughts matter."

Consultant: I love that idea! Having those affirmations can act as a powerful reminder of your worth in those moments. How do you feel about all the strategies we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel more empowered and hopeful than before. I really want to try these out and see how it goes.

Consultant: I'm thrilled to hear that, Liu! You’ve made significant progress, and it’s clear that you’re ready to take these steps. Let’s recap what we’ve covered and establish how you can continue reflecting on your experiences until our next session.

User: Sure! I’ll journal my experiences and try to engage more actively in my upcoming study group. I’ll also use the affirmations we talked about.

Consultant: Perfect! And remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Celebrate each step you take. I’m looking forward to hearing about how it went during our next session. You’re doing so well.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your support and guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Liu! It’s truly a pleasure to work with you. Take care, and I’ll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! It's great to see you again. I’d like to start by checking in on how you’ve been feeling since our last session. What’s been going on in your life?

User: Hi! I’ve actually been feeling a lot better. I’ve settled into university life more than I expected, and I’m finding my way in the student organization I joined.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made some significant progress. Can you share more about how being part of the student organization has impacted your experience?

User: Being in the organization has really helped me connect with others. I feel more active and included, and I’ve made some friends, which I hadn’t expected.

Consultant: Making friends and feeling included can have such a positive effect on one’s emotional well-being. How do you feel when you’re spending time with them now?

User: I feel relaxed and genuinely happy. It’s nice not to feel so isolated anymore. I sometimes even forget the worries I had when I first came here.

Consultant: That sounds like a relief! It’s important to note these feelings. Can you remember any specific moments that made you feel particularly good during these interactions?

User: Yes, there was a moment during our last meeting when we all shared our backgrounds. It made me realize we have a lot in common. I felt accepted.

Consultant: Acceptance is key to feeling a sense of belonging. What strategies do you think have helped you foster these connections with your peers?

User: I’ve tried to be more open and participate actively. I listen more and share things about myself when appropriate. That has created trust.

Consultant: Being open and engaging actively in conversations is a great strategy. It can build trust and deepen connections. Is there anything that you are still struggling with regarding social interactions?

User: Sometimes, I still second-guess my thoughts or whether I belong here, but it’s much less frequent now.

Consultant: It’s normal to have lingering doubts, especially in new environments. When those thoughts pop up, how do you usually respond to them?

User: I remind myself of the moments when I felt included and try to dismiss those doubts. It sounds reasonable when I say it out loud.

Consultant: That’s a good strategy—using positive experiences as a reminder can be helpful. You might also want to consider what evidence supports the idea that you don’t belong, and reflect on that. How would you feel about trying that?

User: I think that could help. It would make me more aware of my thoughts and challenge them logically.

Consultant: Absolutely! Challenging negative thoughts with evidence is a crucial skill. Moving forward, let’s also discuss what you envision for yourself in the future. What are your aspirations in your studies or social life at university?

User: I want to stay involved in the student organization while improving my grades. I hope to build even deeper friendships and maybe take on a leadership role.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! Balancing involvement and academics can be challenging, but having such ambitions is a solid step. How can you ensure you manage your time to support both pursuits?

User: I think I will create a schedule that clearly outlines my academic commitments and social activities. This way, I can prioritize both.

Consultant: Planning your time is a great way to maintain balance! How might you adapt your schedule if you find yourself feeling overwhelmed again?

User: If I feel overwhelmed, I would reduce my social activities temporarily and focus on my studies. It’s the same approach I used when adjusting to university.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical approach. It’s essential to know your limits and make adjustments as needed. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on your progress. What do you believe has been your most significant achievement since starting this journey?

User: I think my biggest achievement is overcoming my feelings of isolation and building connections. I’ve grown so much, and I feel more confident in social situations.

Consultant: That’s a significant milestone, and you should be proud of it! How do you plan to maintain this positivity and connection moving forward?

User: I’ll keep being active in my organization and make sure I also reach out to friends regularly. It’s about balance.

Consultant: Balancing these aspects is indeed vital for your well-being. As we conclude our sessions, remember that these skills you’ve developed can be applied in many areas of your life. You’ve made fantastic strides, Liu, and you’ve built a solid foundation for your future. If you ever feel the need for support again, I’m here for you.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your guidance. I feel more equipped now to navigate university life.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, you have the tools to maintain this progress, and I wish you all the best in your studies and social life. Take care, Liu!
