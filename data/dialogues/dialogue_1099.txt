Consultant: Hello, Wang! Welcome to today's session. I'm here to help you explore your feelings and thoughts. How have you been doing lately? 

User: Hi there. I've been feeling pretty tense. I keep recalling past interactions with classmates, and it makes me anxious. I struggle with this feeling of regret and self-blame, especially when I think about my lack of social skills.

Consultant: It sounds like those memories are creating a lot of pressure for you. Can you share a bit more about what specific situations trigger these feelings?

User: Well, I remember a time when I tried to connect with my classmates but ended up feeling awkward and embarrassed. I replay those moments in my mind, thinking about how I could have acted differently.

Consultant: I understand. It must be tough to relive those experiences and feel that way about them. What thoughts come to your mind when you think about those awkward moments?

User: I often think that I’m not good enough at socializing, that I’ll always mess things up. It’s like this cycle of negative thoughts that I can’t escape.

Consultant: That sounds very painful, Wang. It seems that your thoughts about social situations are quite harsh. Let's explore these thoughts a bit further. Do you think these beliefs about yourself are based on evidence or are they more of an assumption?

User: I guess they are just assumptions. I mean, my past interactions haven’t been great, but it doesn’t mean every situation will be the same.

Consultant: That's an important insight. Recognizing that those thoughts may not be entirely factual can be a big step. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them to think or feel about those social moments?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to be imperfect and that everyone has awkward moments. They shouldn't be so hard on themselves.

Consultant: Exactly! You're showing a lot of empathy towards others. Now, let’s try applying that same understanding to yourself. What alternative thoughts could you consider when you find yourself feeling anxious about social situations?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes, and that everyone feels awkward sometimes. I shouldn’t take it so personally.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful alternative perspective! It’s essential to challenge those harsh judgments. How do you think adopting these more compassionate beliefs about yourself could change your experience in social contexts?

User: I think it could make me feel a bit more relaxed and open to interacting with others instead of fearing judgment.

Consultant: That's a great realization! Relaxing your mindset will likely help reduce that tension. Have you noticed any situations lately where you've had the chance to practice this new thinking?

User: Not really, to be honest. I’ve mostly avoided social gatherings because I feel so anxious.

Consultant: Avoidance is common when feeling anxious, but it often reinforces those fears. Let's think about how we might gradually face these situations together. What small step could you take to engage socially without feeling overwhelmed?

User: Maybe I could start by joining a study group. It feels safer if we’re all focused on schoolwork.

Consultant: Joining a study group sounds like an excellent starting point! It gives you a purpose and a shared interest. What do you think might be your biggest challenge in that kind of setting?

User: I think I might struggle with initiating conversations or contributing to group discussions. 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It might help to prepare a few topics or questions in advance. Would practicing those with me help you feel more confident?

User: Yes, I’d like that. Knowing I have some questions to rely on would ease my anxiety.

Consultant: Great! Let's brainstorm a few conversation starters and topics related to your studies. How about we start with some common subjects in your field? 

User: Sure! I could talk about recent projects or research topics we are studying. 

Consultant: Perfect! Those topics will make it easier to connect with your peers. How do you feel now about taking this step into the study group?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Writing down the topics might help me during those interactions.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s all about creating a supportive framework for yourself. As you prepare, keep in mind that it's okay to take things slowly. You don’t have to get everything right all at once.

User: That makes sense. I guess it’s more about the experience than perfection.

Consultant: Absolutely, focusing on the experience will allow you to learn and grow from it. Remember, progress takes time. What strategies can you use if you find yourself slipping back into negative thoughts before or during these social interactions?

User: I could remind myself of our discussion and challenge those negative thoughts with the more compassionate ones we talked about.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Practicing these strategies consistently will help reinforce your new belief system. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the progress we’ve made?

User: I feel more equipped to handle social situations and a bit less afraid. Though I know it will take time.

Consultant: You’ve made great progress today, Wang. Recognizing those feelings and developing coping strategies will be crucial. Next time, we can continue to explore these strategies and any new challenges you encounter. Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time.

User: Thank you. I appreciate your support! 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to our next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you've come in for this session today. Last time we talked about how you're feeling anxious around women and struggling with some compulsive behaviors. Can you share how you've been feeling since then?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling a bit better, but I still get really nervous when I’m in classes with female classmates. I worry that they might misunderstand my expressions and think I’m upset, which makes me feel even more anxious.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like the fear of being misunderstood is creating a cycle of anxiety for you. Can you tell me more about what thoughts cross your mind when you start feeling nervous in class?

User: I just keep thinking that they’ll notice if I look anxious, and then they’ll judge me. This can make it hard for me to focus on the lecture.

Consultant: That sounds challenging. Let’s look at those thoughts together. What evidence do you have that your classmates are actually judging you based on your expression?

User: Well, I can't say for sure. It's just a feeling I have, and it gets worse when I'm already anxious.

Consultant: That's an important insight. It seems like your feelings are influencing your thoughts, leading to more anxiety. What if we try to distinguish between what you're feeling and the reality of the situation? How realistic do you think it is that they are actually judging you?

User: I guess it’s probably less likely than I imagine. I just have this fear that they will think I’m weird or something.

Consultant: It makes sense that you would feel that way, especially if you're already anxious. But what if we challenge that idea a bit? Could it be possible that many people are focused on their own thoughts instead of paying attention to how you look?

User: That’s true. I think a lot of us are probably just focusing on our own problems. 

Consultant: Exactly! Many people are caught up in their own experiences. Let’s also explore what might happen if you let go of that tension. What would it feel like if you didn’t worry about your expression so much?

User: I think I would feel more relaxed. Maybe I could even participate more in class discussions without worrying.

Consultant: That's a great realization! By easing that worry, you might actually find that you can connect better with others. Are there specific situations where you can practice this mindset shift?

User: Maybe during group projects? I usually partner with some female classmates and feel really anxious during those times.

Consultant: That’s a good opportunity! How about we create a plan for those situations? You could try reminding yourself of the reality that most people are busy with their own thoughts. What do you think?

User: That sounds helpful. Maybe I could come up with a simple phrase to remind myself.

Consultant: That's a great idea! A phrase can serve as a quick reminder to shift your thinking. What could that phrase be?

User: Maybe something like, "They’re likely focused on their own work."

Consultant: I like that! It’s a positive and realistic reminder. Would you be willing to use that phrase during your next group project?

User: Yes, I’ll definitely try to remember it.

Consultant: Fantastic! Before we wrap up today, let's reflect on your progress. You've recognized that your beliefs about being judged are tied to your anxiety and that practicing a new perspective could help. How do you feel about the steps we've discussed today?

User: I feel more hopeful, but I’m still a bit anxious about actually putting them into practice.

Consultant: That’s completely normal. It’s a process, and it might take time to adjust. Remember, practicing small steps will help build your confidence. Do you have any strategies in mind for maintaining those feelings of hope moving forward?

User: I think just reminding myself to be patient and that it’s okay to feel anxious while I work through this.

Consultant: That’s very wise. Acknowledging your feelings while working through them is a healthy approach. As we conclude, remember that you can return anytime if you need support. You've made significant strides, and I believe you can manage this. 

User: Thank you. I appreciate your help. I feel like I have some tools to work with now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m glad you feel that way. Best of luck, and remember to be kind to yourself as you continue your journey.

Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad you’re here today. I understand you've been feeling quite anxious about your expressions and how they affect your social interactions. Can you share a bit more about your feelings lately?

User: Hi! Yes, I’ve been really worried about how I appear to others, especially during a recent group meeting with my advisor. I felt overwhelmed, and it made me self-conscious about my expressions.

Consultant: It sounds like that meeting was quite stressful for you. You’re focusing on how your expressions might be perceived, which contributed to your feelings of anxiety. Can you tell me what thoughts were running through your mind during that meeting?

User: I kept thinking that everyone was judging me, and that I needed to look composed, but the more I tried, the more nervous I felt. It felt like I was trapped in my own head.

Consultant: That sounds very challenging. It’s understandable to feel trapped when you’re worried about others' perceptions. I’d like to explore those thoughts further—what specific thoughts did you have about being judged?

User: I thought things like "What if they think I’m silly or that I don’t belong in that group?" I worried so much about not meeting their expectations.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite intense. Would you say they made the situation feel even more overwhelming for you? 

User: Definitely. The worry just spiraled and made me feel like I couldn’t focus on what was really being said in the meeting.

Consultant: It makes sense that this fear would create a barrier to listening and participating. Have you noticed how this thought process affects your mood or behavior in other social situations?

User: Yes, in other settings, like when I meet new people or even during classes, I often feel really anxious and withdraw because I’m afraid of being judged.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like the fear of judgment is significantly impacting your interactions. Let’s take a step back and challenge those thoughts. Do you think there is evidence that supports the idea that others are judging you harshly?

User: Well, I guess there isn't. I mean, it’s really just my own fear talking. Sometimes, I even see others looking worried about their own performance, too.

Consultant: That’s an insightful observation, Wang! Many people feel unsure in social situations. If a friend was in your shoes, what advice would you give them about not feeling judged?

User: I’d probably tell them not to worry so much about others’ opinions and just be themselves. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s easier to encourage others than to follow that advice ourselves. What if we practiced giving yourself the same advice? 

User: I think that could help me, but I still feel different in social settings. 

Consultant: Feeling different is common, especially in settings where you feel scrutinized. Would you be open to trying some techniques to manage those feelings and slowly face social situations? 

User: Yes, I think I need specific strategies to help me through. 

Consultant: Great! One approach is to gradually expose yourself to those social situations while also focusing on your breathing and relaxation techniques. Would you like to explore some relaxation exercises together?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful! 

Consultant: Wonderful, let’s start with a simple deep-breathing exercise. When you feel anxious, inhaling deeply through your nose, holding it for a few seconds, and then exhaling slowly through your mouth can be quite calming. Would you be willing to practice this now?

User: Sure, I’ll give it a try. 

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s take a deep breath together. Inhale… hold… and exhale slowly. Great job! How did that feel?

User: It actually felt a bit calming. I could feel my heart rate slow down.

Consultant: That’s excellent to hear! Practicing this regularly can help anchor you during anxious moments. Can you see yourself using this technique in a social setting?

User: I could try, especially before I speak in a meeting it might help settle my nerves.

Consultant: Absolutely! You can use it whenever you notice your anxiety increasing. Let’s also discuss the importance of cognitive restructuring, which is about changing negative thinking patterns. How do you feel about identifying those thoughts in real-time as they come up?

User: I think it would be useful. Recognizing those negative thoughts might help me to not feel as overwhelmed.

Consultant: Yes! The more you become aware of those thoughts, the more you can challenge and replace them with more balanced perspectives. Can you practice this during your next social interaction?

User: I can definitely try. It feels a bit daunting, but I see how it could help.

Consultant: Taking small, manageable steps is key! Remember that it's about progress, not perfection. What strategies do you think could support you in implementing these changes?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal to jot down my thoughts and practice breathing before social events.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Journaling can help you manage your thoughts and reflect on your progress. Also, approaching social interactions with a plan will empower you. You’ve made significant insights today, Wang. 

User: Thanks! I feel more hopeful and like I have tools to manage my anxiety now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let’s recap what we discussed: the breathing exercises, recognizing and challenging negative thoughts, and using a journal. How do you feel about those strategies?

User: I feel good about them. I think they can really help me.

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember, it’s okay to seek support when needed. This journey takes time, so be patient with yourself. I'm proud of the progress you've made today. 

User: Thank you so much for your help today. I’m looking forward to practicing these new strategies.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Wang! I believe in your ability to navigate these challenges. If you want to discuss more in the future or need a refresher, don’t hesitate to come back. Until next time, take care!

User: Thank you! I appreciate it and will definitely keep in touch.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. Last time, we discussed relaxation techniques and their effects on regulating your expressions. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi. I've been trying to implement those relaxation techniques, and I think they really helped me a bit. I felt less pressure during the recent group activities. However, I still struggle with expressing myself naturally.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've started to feel some relief with those techniques. You mentioned that you still find it challenging to express yourself naturally. Can you tell me more about what situations make you feel this way?

User: It usually happens during group discussions. I often feel my expression doesn't match my thoughts, and I get anxious about it. I just wish I could communicate more comfortably.

Consultant: That sounds frustrating. It seems like there's a disconnect between how you feel inside and how it comes across to others. Let's explore this further—what thoughts run through your mind when you begin to feel anxious in those situations?

User: I often think that people are judging me or that I'm not articulating my ideas well enough. It makes me second-guess myself, which only increases my anxiety.

Consultant: That kind of thinking can be really overwhelming. You mentioned feeling judged—what evidence do you have that people are actually judging you in those moments?

User: I guess I don't have solid evidence. It's mostly just a feeling. I often assume people are watching and waiting for me to mess up.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially in a group setting. We often project our fears onto how we think others perceive us. What would you say to a friend who expressed similar fears about being judged?

User: I would probably tell them that people are busy with their own thoughts and likely not focused on them as much as they think.

Consultant: That's a wise perspective! If you were to apply that same reasoning to yourself, how might it change the way you approach those discussions?

User: I suppose I could try to remind myself that it's unlikely people are scrutinizing me. Maybe focusing on my ideas rather than my expressions would help.

Consultant: That sounds like a productive approach! Let's think about practical strategies—what small steps could you take in your next group discussion to focus more on your ideas?

User: Maybe I could prepare some points in advance and practice saying them out loud. That way, I'd feel more confident sharing.

Consultant: Preparing in advance is a great strategy. It can help alleviate some anxiety since you'll have a clearer idea of what you want to express. How about incorporating a relaxation technique right before the discussion to help calm your nerves?

User: Yes, that definitely sounds helpful. I can do some deep breathing or visualization of a successful discussion to ease my anxiety.

Consultant: Absolutely! Visualization can be a powerful tool to set a positive tone before entering stressful situations. How do you feel about trying that next time?

User: I’m feeling optimistic about this. It seems more manageable than I thought.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it might take some practice to feel comfortable. How do you plan to measure your progress in these discussions moving forward?

User: I think I could keep a journal where I note how I felt before and after each discussion, and whether I used the techniques we talked about.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Journaling can help you reflect on your experiences and recognize patterns. It will also reinforce the positive changes you're making. What else do you think could help you further?

User: I suppose discussing scenarios where I feel particularly anxious could help. It might give me more clarity on how to handle them.

Consultant: That's a wise suggestion. Identifying specific scenarios is crucial. Let's take a moment to outline one of these scenarios—what would be a situation that makes you particularly anxious?

User: A big group presentation in class is usually very stressful for me. I worry a lot about how I'll come across to everyone.

Consultant: Presentations can indeed be nerve-wracking. In that context, what automatic thoughts pop up for you?

User: I think about how I might forget what I want to say, or that I’ll look awkward in front of everyone.

Consultant: Those are common worries. Reflecting back on our previous discussions, what alternative thoughts could counter those automatic ones?

User: I could remind myself that I have prepared well and that everyone is there to learn, not to judge me.

Consultant: Exactly! Reinforcing that preparation and focusing on the audience's purpose can help shift your mindset. Would you like to practice reframing one of those negative thoughts now?

User: Sure! Let’s take "I'll look awkward." I could reframe it as “I might feel a bit nervous, but that’s normal, and it doesn’t define my whole presentation.”

Consultant: That's a fantastic reframe! It's so important to acknowledge those feelings without letting them take over your experience. Are there any final thoughts or feelings you’d like to express about everything we've discussed?

User: I'm starting to feel more encouraged. I think with practice, I can approach these situations better.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You're making significant progress. Remember, you're capable of adapting and learning new strategies. How will you carry these insights into your next week?

User: I plan to practice my points and visualize a successful interaction, along with some relaxation techniques. I feel ready to try!

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Keep that momentum going. As we conclude our session today, let's recap your advancements and the techniques you'll be using going forward. You've gained valuable tools and insights, and I'm confident you'll continue to build on them in the future.

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your support and guidance. 

Consultant: It was my pleasure. I'm proud of the progress you've made. Remember, you can always reach out if you need further assistance. Take care of yourself!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm really glad to see you for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last discussion about participating in group discussions?

User: Hi! I think I've been doing okay. I’ve been trying to engage more in discussions, and I notice some improvement, although I still feel a bit uncomfortable at times.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're noticing some improvement! Can you share a specific experience where you felt more comfortable engaging in the discussion?

User: Last week, during a project meeting, I spoke up about my ideas. My palms were sweaty, but I did it. It felt good, but afterwards, I worried if I spoke too much or if people found my ideas silly.

Consultant: It sounds like you took a significant step by sharing your thoughts, despite feeling anxious about it. What do you think made you worry about how your ideas were received?

User: I guess I’m always worried about not meeting expectations. I really want to contribute, but I fear being judged for what I say.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable, Wang. It’s common to fear judgment, especially in group settings. How do you think this fear has affected your willingness to share?

User: I think it holds me back a bit. Sometimes, I feel like staying quiet is easier than risking embarrassment.

Consultant: That makes sense. Avoiding risk can feel safer, but it can also prevent you from expressing yourself. How do you feel about trying to reframe those thoughts? For instance, what if you considered that sharing your ideas could actually contribute positively to the group?

User: I suppose that could help. It’s just... hard to push those negative thoughts aside in the moment.

Consultant: I get that. Let's work on some strategies together to address those thoughts when they arise. Would you like to practice a role-play where you share ideas in a group discussion scenario?

User: Yes, I think that could be useful! 

Consultant: Great! Imagine we’re in a meeting, and you need to present a new idea. Go ahead and start whenever you're ready.

User: Okay, um... "I have an idea for our project that could help us reach our goals more effectively." 

Consultant: Nice start! How did it feel to express that idea?

User: A bit nerve-wracking, honestly! But also exciting to say it out loud.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mix of feelings! Let’s use that phrase, "I have an idea," as a starting point. How can we turn this practice into a more comfortable experience for you?

User: Maybe by reminding myself that it’s okay if not everyone agrees with me. Not everyone has to think my ideas are the best.

Consultant: Yes! That’s an excellent perspective to adopt. This can help lower the pressure you feel and encourage you to share more freely. Would you like to continue this practice with a different scenario?

User: Definitely! Let’s try another one, maybe a more casual setting.

Consultant: Sure! This time, let’s imagine you’re at a social gathering with classmates. You overhear a discussion about a subject you’re knowledgeable about. How would you respond?

User: I might say something like, "I know a bit about that topic; can I add my thoughts?"

Consultant: That sounds perfect! And how do you feel about that approach?

User: It sounds less formal and more relaxed. I like it!

Consultant: Fantastic! Practicing these scenarios will make it easier for you to use these skills in real life. As you feel more comfortable, what do you think will help you maintain this positive momentum?

User: I think keeping a journal about my experiences could help, tracking what worked and what didn’t.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Reflecting on your experiences can reinforce your progress and adjust strategies as needed. How confident do you feel about implementing this in your daily interactions?

User: I feel a bit more confident, actually. I believe I can start small and gradually challenge myself more.

Consultant: Absolutely, that's the way to do it! Small steps lead to big changes over time. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize some of the highlights and what you want to focus on moving forward.

User: Well, I want to practice sharing ideas and keeping a journal. Plus, I really want to remind myself it’s okay not to be perfect.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals, Wang! Remember, you’re already making progress, and I believe you can continue to grow in these areas. What do you think might be a new challenge or goal you’d like to set for the next session?

User: Maybe I can try sharing my thoughts in a smaller group and see how that feels?

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful challenge! I’m excited to hear how it goes. You’ve made significant strides today, and I’m here to support you in your journey. Remember, it's all about taking those steps at your own pace.

User: Thanks! I feel much better after our talk today. I appreciate you guiding me through this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Wang! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. I look forward to our next session and hearing about all your new experiences. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! It's great to see you again. I hope you're doing well today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've actually been doing quite well. My anxiety levels have decreased a lot, and I feel more confident interacting with my classmates.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some significant progress. What specific changes or experiences have contributed to this newfound confidence?

User: I think I've started to believe in myself more. I managed to participate in a group discussion without feeling overwhelmed, which is something I used to really struggle with.

Consultant: That's an impressive achievement, Wang! It seems like you've been able to face situations that you previously found challenging. How did that experience feel for you?

User: It felt empowering! I realized that I could contribute valuable insights and that my classmates actually listened to me, which was encouraging.

Consultant: It's fantastic to know that your contributions were recognized and appreciated. How do you think you can build on this positive experience moving forward?

User: I want to keep participating in group activities and maybe even take the lead on some projects. I feel like that would help me grow even more.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Taking on leadership roles can really help you enhance your skills and confidence. Have you thought about any specific projects you’d like to lead?

User: There’s a project coming up in my class, and I was considering volunteering to lead the research part. But part of me is still a bit hesitant.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel a bit hesitant, especially when stepping into a leadership role. What do you think is holding you back, or what worries might you have?

User: I'm worried about not being able to manage the team effectively or that my ideas won’t be good enough.

Consultant: Those are valid concerns, Wang. Let’s explore these thoughts. What evidence do you have that suggests you won’t manage the team well or that your ideas may not be good enough?

User: I guess I haven’t actually tried leading anything like this before. But I often compare myself to others who seem more confident.

Consultant: Comparisons can be challenging and often lead us to overlook our strengths. What strengths can you draw upon that might help you in this situation?

User: I tend to be organized and detail-oriented, and I think I communicate well in small groups. Maybe I could use those skills.

Consultant: Those are excellent strengths to leverage! Being organized can help with managing the team and ensuring everyone is on the same page. How might you incorporate these skills into leading the project?

User: I could set clear goals for the team and have regular check-ins to make sure everyone is aligned. That might help keep things organized.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach, Wang! Having clear goals and regular communication can foster a supportive environment. How does it feel to think about using your skills in this way?

User: It feels good, actually. I’m starting to see that I can do this. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s important to recognize your capability. Moving forward, how can you help yourself stay focused on your strengths rather than just comparing yourself to others?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal to remind myself of my achievements and positive feedback I receive from others.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Reflecting on your accomplishments can really help reinforce your confidence. Is there anything specific you’d like to set as a goal for yourself in the upcoming weeks?

User: I’d like to commit to volunteering for that project and also to keep my journal updated regularly.

Consultant: Those are meaningful goals, Wang! They align well with your desire to grow and engage more. How do you feel about these goals being achievable for you?

User: They feel achievable. I'm excited to take this step and see how it goes!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset to have! Before we conclude today, let’s take a moment to reflect on your progress. What do you believe has been your biggest accomplishment since we began our sessions?

User: I think my biggest accomplishment has been building confidence in myself and my ability to connect with others.

Consultant: That’s a significant step forward, Wang! As you continue to embrace these connections and experiences, remember that it's okay to feel nervous. You’re doing wonderfully well, and you have the tools to navigate any challenges.

User: Thank you. That really reassures me, and I appreciate your support throughout this process.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It's been great to work with you and witness your growth. If you ever feel the need for further support or guidance, please don't hesitate to reach out. Best of luck with your project and journaling!

User: Thank you, I will definitely keep that in mind! I feel like I can manage things on my own now.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! I’m confident that you have the skills and insight needed to continue your progress. This session concludes our formal meetings, but remember, support is always just a call away. Take care, Wang!

User: Thank you, take care too!
