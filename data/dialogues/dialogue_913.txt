Consultant: Hello Jun! I'm really glad you're here today. Before we start, I’d like to hear about how you’ve been feeling lately, especially concerning your studies and any physical symptoms you’ve been experiencing.

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious about school. I've had more stomach pain and nausea, especially before bed and when I wake up. I also feel really nervous when we talk about exams or school reports.

Consultant: That sounds quite distressing, Jun. It seems like your anxiety is manifesting physically in the form of stomach pain and nausea, especially in relation to school and exams. Can you tell me more about what's going on in your mind during those moments?

User: I don't know... I just start thinking that if I don’t do well in my exams, I'm going to disappoint everyone and end up in a bad situation. That thought just makes me feel worse.

Consultant: I understand. The pressure to perform well can be overwhelming. It seems that when you think about disappointing others, it intensifies your anxiety. How does that thought make you feel physically in those moments?

User: My stomach just drops, and I feel sick. Sometimes, I feel like I can't breathe properly, and I just want to escape the situation.

Consultant: It sounds like that fear of disappointing others is really affecting both your emotions and your body. When you think about these exams, what sort of automatic thoughts run through your mind? Can you identify any specific ones?

User: I keep thinking, "What if I fail?" or "I won't be able to handle it." Those thoughts just spiral, and I feel worse and worse.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite intense. It's important to recognize how powerful these automatic thoughts can be. Can you reflect on how realistic these thoughts are? What evidence do you have to support them?

User: Well, I guess I haven't actually failed yet, but it feels like if I don't do everything perfectly, I will.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Jun. It sounds like you might be engaging in some all-or-nothing thinking. What if we explored other possible outcomes? What could happen if you don’t perform as perfectly as you hope?

User: Maybe it wouldn't be the end of the world? I could still try again... 

Consultant: Absolutely! It's very likely that even if things don't go perfectly, there are still ways to move forward. How do you feel about the idea of allowing yourself to not be perfect in these situations?

User: It does sound a bit relieving, but I still struggle with the fear of failure.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Facing that fear can be challenging. Would you be open to exploring some small steps or strategies to help you manage this anxiety instead of avoiding it?

User: Yeah, I think I need some help figuring that out.

Consultant: How about we start with some actions that might make you feel more in control? For example, planning a study schedule could help break things down into manageable parts and reduce that overwhelming feeling.

User: That might help, but I still get physically sick when I think about studying for exams.

Consultant: I see. It might also be useful to practice relaxation techniques when you start feeling anxious. Breathing exercises or mindfulness could help you calm your body in those moments. Would you like to try that together?

User: Sure, I’d be willing to try anything that might help.

Consultant: Let's try a simple breathing exercise. Close your eyes for a moment if you're comfortable. I want you to take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then slowly breathe out through your mouth. Let’s do this a few times together.

User: Okay, I can do that. *breathes deeply* 

Consultant: Excellent job, Jun. How do you feel after doing that?

User: I feel a little calmer... but I still dread the exams.

Consultant: It's great that you're feeling a bit calmer! It’s okay to feel that dread. Learning to manage it will take time. Remember, it’s a process. What if we set some short-term goals to gradually face that fear?

User: Like what?

Consultant: We can start by setting a goal of studying for a short period, say 20 minutes, and then rewarding yourself with a break. Over time, you can gradually increase your study time. How does that sound?

User: I think I can try that. Maybe I won't feel so overwhelmed.

Consultant: Exactly! Breaking it down into smaller steps can help reduce that feeling of being overwhelmed. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection.

User: I like that idea. I guess if I'm making progress, it won't feel as scary.

Consultant: That's the spirit! Also, how do you think you could be more compassionate towards yourself during this process? 

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it’s normal to feel anxious and that I'm not the only one struggling with this.

Consultant: Yes! Recognizing that anxiety is a common experience can be very helpful. Would you like to think of some affirmations or positive statements you could tell yourself when those negative thoughts arise?

User: I could try saying, "It's okay to feel anxious. I can handle it."

Consultant: That’s a fantastic affirmation, Jun! It validates your feelings while reinforcing your strength. How do you think that could shift your perspective during exam periods?

User: I think it might make me a bit more confident. It feels better to remind myself that it's okay to feel this way.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember, you're learning to navigate these feelings rather than letting them control you. As we work towards our next session, keep practicing those breathing techniques and affirmations. How are you feeling about today’s progress?

User: I feel like I have a plan now, and that gives me a little hope. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s perfectly okay to take small steps and seek support when needed. Let’s keep building on this momentum in our next session. 

User: Yes, thank you! I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: You're welcome, Jun! Take care, and I believe in your ability to manage this! See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Jun! It's great to see you again. I remember we discussed your feelings of anxiety related to exams in our last session. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I've been feeling more anxious, especially after hearing about the new exam schedule. The thought of discussing exam results makes me nauseous again, just like before.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like the new exam schedule has intensified your anxiety, leading to those uncomfortable physical symptoms. Can you tell me a bit more about what thoughts go through your mind when you think about the exams?

User: I keep thinking that if I don’t do well, everyone will judge me. I feel like I’m letting myself down and that I won't be able to handle the pressure.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite distressing. It seems like you're really concerned about how others perceive you, which adds to your anxiety. What feelings do you experience when these thoughts come up?

User: I feel scared and ashamed. I just don't want to disappoint anyone, especially my family and teachers. I wish I could be more like my classmates who seem so confident.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when comparing yourself to your peers. Let's explore something together. When you think about potentially disappointing others, how does that affect your self-view?

User: I feel worthless and like I'm not good enough. It makes me doubt my abilities entirely.

Consultant: It’s concerning that you’re feeling worthless. Let's take a moment to challenge these thoughts. Is there any evidence that supports the idea that you are not good enough? Can we think of some instances where you performed well?

User: I guess I have done well in some subjects, but that doesn't feel like enough, especially now.

Consultant: It’s a good start that you can recognize your successes. Remember, doing well in certain subjects is an achievement itself. What do you think are some alternative thoughts you could have when you feel pressured about exams?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that my worth isn’t tied to my grades. That sounds right, but it’s hard to believe that in the moment.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, Jun. It’s certainly challenging to reshape those deep-rooted beliefs. Let’s experiment with practicing some affirmations that reinforce this new perspective. What might you say to yourself before an exam to calm your mind?

User: Perhaps, “I am capable, and my effort is what truly matters”? 

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Repeating affirmations like that can help shift your mindset. Can we also talk about your physical symptoms? You mentioned feeling nauseous—what coping strategies could help you feel more at ease before the exams?

User: I think if I could do some breathing exercises or even take a short walk, I might feel better.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Breathing exercises can help relieve immediate anxiety, and walking can be a good way to clear your mind. When would you like to incorporate these techniques into your routine?

User: I could try doing them the night before the exam and even on the morning of the exam.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Creating that space for yourself is essential. As we move forward, how do you feel about trying to accept your emotions, whatever they may be, rather than judging them?

User: I think that's a good idea. I usually get hard on myself for feeling anxious. Accepting it might ease some of that pressure.

Consultant: Acceptance is a powerful tool! It can help alleviate some of the distress associated with your feelings. We should practice acknowledging your emotions in a gentle way. What do you think about that?

User: I’d like to try that. Dismissing how I feel doesn’t help, and I want to be kinder to myself.

Consultant: That's a great approach! Remember, recognizing your feelings doesn’t make them more significant; it just makes you more aware. Are there any specific situations or thoughts coming up where you think acceptance would benefit you?

User: I often feel anxious before tests when I hear others talking about their preparation. Maybe I could remind myself that it’s okay to feel nervous, just as they do.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing that everyone experiences anxiety can help normalize your feelings. It’s part of the human experience. How do you think that perspective might change how you approach your exams?

User: I guess it might make me feel less isolated. I could focus on preparing instead of worrying so much about what others think.

Consultant: Exactly! Shifting that focus back to your preparation can create a more empowering mindset. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize some of the strategies we discussed. What will be your key takeaways from our session?

User: I will remind myself that my worth isn't tied to my grades, practice affirmations, and try some relaxation techniques like breathing and walking. I want to be kinder to myself and accept my emotions.

Consultant: Those are excellent takeaways! You’re making significant progress. I encourage you to practice these strategies and share your experiences in our next session. Remember, I’m here to support you whenever you need.

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more in control of my feelings now. I’ll try to implement these changes. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Jun! It's about taking one step at a time. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care and don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes up!

User: I will! Thanks again. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello Jun! I'm glad you're here for today’s session. Last time, we discussed self-acceptance and finding ways to support yourself emotionally. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling more aware of my emotions, but I still struggle with self-blame. I think it got worseafter the school sports day because I felt guilty for not participating. 

Consultant: It sounds like you’re still experiencing feelings of guilt, especially regarding the sports day. Can you share more about how that day affected you physically and emotionally?

User: Well, I had this stomach pain while watching the events, and I felt really anxious about not being part of it. It’s like my body was reacting to my feelings. 

Consultant: I see. Your stomach pain seems to be connected to the anxiety and self-blame you’re feeling. What thoughts were going through your mind at that moment?

User: I kept thinking that I should have done better, that I should have been more active or at least supported my friends. 

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite heavy. They sound like they add a lot of pressure on you. How did that make you feel about yourself?

User: It made me feel like I was a failure for not participating. I really wanted to enjoy the event, but my focus was on my guilt. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way when comparing yourself to others. Let’s explore that thought a bit—what evidence do you have to support the idea that not participating makes you a failure?

User: I don’t know, maybe it’s just that everyone expects you to be part of school activities, and if you don’t, you let them down. 

Consultant: That’s a common belief, but let’s challenge it. If a friend felt the same way, what might you say to them to help them see it differently?

User: I guess I’d tell them it's alright not to participate and that they shouldn’t be too hard on themselves. 

Consultant: Exactly, you would show compassion to a friend. Why not extend that same compassion to yourself? It’s okay to have different strengths and ways to contribute.

User: That makes sense. I often forget to be kind to myself. 

Consultant: It’s a common challenge, Jun. Let’s practice some positive self-talk. What’s a supportive statement you could tell yourself when you feel guilty about not participating?

User: Maybe I could say that it’s okay to prioritize my health and that I can support my friends in other ways.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Emphasizing your well-being is important. How do you think practicing this kind of self-talk could help reduce your stomach pain next time?

User: I think if I remind myself it’s okay, I won’t be as stressed, which could help my stomach feel better. 

Consultant: Exactly! By nurturing that supportive dialogue, you can help manage your physical reactions. Can we also explore some activities that would help you feel more engaged without overwhelming yourself?

User: Sure! Maybe just cheering for my classmates or participating in something less intense could help.

Consultant: That sounds excellent! Involving yourself at a comfortable level can boost your confidence. Let’s discuss how you can gradually become more involved in activities that feel right for you.

User: I’d like to try cheering on my friends and maybe planning to participate in something small next time.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! Remember, taking small steps is key. How do you feel about potentially setting a goal for the next sports event?

User: I feel more motivated to do something small, like supporting others, rather than pushing myself too hard.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset! Balancing participation and self-care is essential. Let's also think about how you can manage any anxiety you might feel leading up to exams. 

User: I often worry about not doing well. I want to learn how to handle that anxiety better.

Consultant: Absolutely, managing exam anxiety is important. How do you currently cope with that stress when it arises?

User: I usually just try to study harder, but I end up more anxious when I feel unprepared.

Consultant: It’s common to think that more studying will fix anxiety, but that can sometimes backfire. Let’s brainstorm some alternative strategies to feel more at ease before exams.

User: Maybe I could take short breaks during studying or practice some relaxation techniques?

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Taking breaks and practicing relaxation can significantly help calm your mind. Would you like to set a specific relaxation technique to try before your next study session?

User: I’d like to try breathing exercises. They seem simple but effective.

Consultant: Perfect choice! Breathing exercises can be very grounding. Let’s finish our session by summarizing what you’d like to take away from today.

User: I want to be kinder to myself about my participation and learn relaxation techniques for studying.

Consultant: That sounds very achievable, Jun. Remember, this is a journey, and it’s okay to go at your own pace. I’m proud of the progress you’ve made today. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful and ready to try these new strategies.

Consultant: You’re welcome! It’s been great working together. Remember, you can always come back if you need support. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. 

User: I will! Thanks again for all your help!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jun! It's great to see you today. I understand you've been exploring some books on managing exam anxiety. How have you been feeling about those readings?

User: Hi! Yes, I found a lot of useful information in that book. However, I still feel quite anxious, especially when I think about the upcoming exams. It's like my mind just goes blank.

Consultant: It sounds like you've gained some insights from the book, but anxiety is still a significant challenge for you. Let's dive a little deeper—what specific thoughts or feelings come up for you when you think about the exams?

User: I often think that if I don't do well, it will disappoint my parents and my teachers. I feel overwhelmed by the pressure to perform.

Consultant: I can understand how that kind of pressure would make you feel anxious. It seems like there’s a strong connection between your self-expectations and your anxiety. Where do you think these thoughts about disappointing others come from?

User: I guess I've always been a bit of a perfectionist. I don't want to let anyone down, and it drives me to work harder, but it also makes everything feel heavier.

Consultant: Perfectionism can indeed be a double-edged sword. It motivates you to excel but can also create significant stress. When you notice yourself having these perfectionist thoughts, what do you typically feel emotionally?

User: I feel a mix of anxiety and sadness. Sometimes I just want to give up because the pressure feels too much, but then I also feel guilty for thinking that way.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Jun. It’s understandable to feel trapped between wanting to succeed and feeling overwhelmed. Let's try to identify those automatic thoughts together. Can you recall any specific thoughts that run through your mind when you're feeling anxious about exams?

User: I often think, "What if I fail?" or "I can't mess this up." Those thoughts seem to just pop up, and then I can't focus.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound like they create a lot of pressure. What do you think these thoughts make you feel physically and emotionally in those moments?

User: I get a knot in my stomach, and I feel really restless. It's like my body is reacting to my thoughts, and I just can't settle down.

Consultant: That physical response makes sense given the intensity of those thoughts. Now, let’s explore how we can reframe these thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts these negative predictions about failing?

User: Well, I’ve done okay in previous exams, and my teachers say I’m capable. But it’s hard to remember that in the moment of anxiety.

Consultant: It's great to hear you've had successes before, and that feedback can often help us challenge those anxious thoughts. What if you considered a different mindset, like viewing the exam as an opportunity to demonstrate what you know rather than a test of your worth?

User: That perspective does sound a bit more comforting. I need to remind myself that I’m learning and that exams are just one part of it all.

Consultant: Exactly! Shifting the focus can help reduce the pressure. Now, let’s think about some practical techniques you can use to manage your anxiety before and during exams. How about we practice some deep breathing techniques together?

User: I think that could really help! I’ve read about deep breathing but haven’t tried it yet.

Consultant: That’s perfectly fine. Let’s take a moment now. Sit comfortably, and let’s try a simple breathing exercise. Inhale deeply for four counts... Hold for four... and exhale slowly for six counts. How does that feel?

User: That felt nice! I can feel my body starting to relax a bit.

Consultant: Wonderful! Deep breathing can help signal your body to calm down. It’s a technique you can use before and even during your exams. Besides deep breathing, have you thought about incorporating mindfulness exercises to help manage your thoughts?

User: I haven’t really tried mindfulness. I’m not sure how it works, but I’m open to learning about it.

Consultant: Mindfulness is about being present and aware of your thoughts and feelings without judgment. It can help you detach from anxious thoughts and reduce their impact. Would you like to explore some simple mindfulness techniques together?

User: Yes, that sounds good! I’d like to know more about how to practice that.

Consultant: Great! One effective mindfulness technique is to focus on your senses. For example, when you feel anxious, take a moment to observe your surroundings. What do you see, hear, and feel? This can help ground you in the present. How about we try that now for a minute?

User: Okay. I see the green plants in the room and hear the sound of the clock ticking. It’s actually kind of calming.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Jun! Noticing your surroundings can indeed create a sense of calm. This practice can be particularly useful during exams when you feel overwhelmed. How do you feel about starting to incorporate these techniques in your daily routine leading up to the exams?

User: I feel like I can give it a try. It makes me feel like I have some control over my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a positive outlook! Gradually incorporating these techniques can empower you to manage your anxiety more effectively. Before we conclude our session, let’s recap what we’ve discussed today. What are the main takeaways for you?

User: I’ve learned some deep breathing and mindfulness techniques, and I feel more equipped to handle my exam anxiety. Understanding my thoughts better has also helped me feel less alone in this.

Consultant: You’ve made significant progress today, and it’s wonderful to hear you feel less isolated. Remember, these techniques will take practice, and it’s okay to seek support when needed. As we wrap up today, what plans do you have to maintain this newfound understanding and keep your anxiety in check?

User: I’ll try to practice the breathing exercises daily and focus on staying present. I’ll also keep reading that book for more tips. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Jun. It’s important to reinforce what you’ve learned. Remember, I'm here to support you. If you need anything, feel free to reach out. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to our next session, and remember, you’re not alone in this journey. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jun! I'm glad to see you today. It's great to hear that you've found some support through the mental health lecture. How are you feeling about things lately?

User: Hi! I'm feeling a bit better than before. Learning that others are experiencing similar challenges has made me feel less alone, and I don't blame myself as much now.

Consultant: That's a positive shift, Jun. It sounds like the lecture helped you realize you're not the only one facing these issues, which can be comforting. What specifically do you think contributed to this change in how you view your situation?

User: I think hearing others share their stories helped me. I realized that it's okay to struggle sometimes and that there are people who understand.

Consultant: Absolutely, it's important to know you're not alone in your experiences. Now that you have a better understanding of your emotions, what kind of support would you like to build within your network, perhaps at school or among your friends?

User: I want to feel more comfortable talking to my classmates about what I'm going through. Maybe join some group activities? 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Engaging in group activities can really help strengthen your connections. Have you thought about any specific activities or clubs you might be interested in joining?

User: I've thought about joining the art club. I love drawing, and it might help me meet new people.

Consultant: The art club sounds like a fantastic opportunity, especially since it's something you enjoy. How do you think being part of the art club might help you feel less stressed?

User: I think it would be relaxing, and I could express myself better through art. Plus, I would get to know more people who enjoy the same thing.

Consultant: Exactly! Creative outlets can be incredibly helpful in managing stress. When you're in the art club, how do you feel about sharing your thoughts and feelings with others in a group setting?

User: I guess it would be a bit intimidating at first, but if we're all there to share and support each other, it might not be so bad.

Consultant: That apprehension is completely normal, Jun. It's also wonderful to recognize that a supportive environment can ease those fears. What strategies can you think of to help you open up in that group?

User: Maybe I could start by sharing something small about my art or asking others about their work. It could break the ice.

Consultant: That's an excellent strategy! Starting with something light or asking questions can create a friendly atmosphere for everyone. Would you feel comfortable trying that out when you join the club?

User: Yes, I think I can do that!

Consultant: Great! It's crucial to have a plan in place. Besides joining the art club, how do you envision maintaining your emotional well-being as you engage with others?

User: I guess I can remind myself that it's okay to feel nervous and that practicing these conversations can help me get better over time.

Consultant: Absolutely! Self-compassion is vital. Reminding yourself that it's a process can significantly reduce pressure. Do you have any other support systems besides your peers that you feel would help you?

User: I talk to my parents sometimes. They don't fully understand what I'm going through, but they try to help.

Consultant: It's good that you have that connection with your parents. While they may not completely understand, their willingness to help is valuable. How about discussing joining the art club with them? They could offer support as you take this step.

User: That’s a good idea! I could tell them how excited I am about it.

Consultant: That enthusiasm can really help them understand. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you've gained from our conversation regarding building your support network?

User: I feel more confident about joining the art club and talking to my classmates. I really believe this will help me.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Jun! You’ve made significant steps towards enhancing your social support. As you move forward, remember to keep checking in with yourself about these feelings and priorities. Would you like to schedule another session to discuss how it's going?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful! 

Consultant: Wonderful! I'm here to support you, and together we can ensure your progress continues. If anything comes up before our next meeting, feel free to reach out. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jun! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I feel like I have a better understanding of my feelings now. I still have some worries, though, especially about keeping my mentality stable.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling more confident and have a better understanding of your emotions. Let's delve a bit deeper—what specific worries are you facing right now regarding your mentality?

User: I think I'm worried about maintaining the progress I've made. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed by school and my emotions again.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. It's normal to feel concerned about maintaining your progress after experiencing a positive change. What things or situations at school are contributing to that feeling of being overwhelmed?

User: I think group projects and the pressure to keep up with my friends make me anxious. I don't want to let them down, but it often adds pressure on me to perform better.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when you care about your friends and the group work. Could you share how this pressure has affected your emotional state during these activities?

User: When I feel pressured, I start to doubt myself a lot. I feel like I'm not good enough, and that makes me anxious about participating.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Jun. It sounds like self-doubt is having a significant impact on your participation. When these thoughts arise, what do you usually tell yourself in those moments?

User: I often think that I won't be able to contribute anything valuable to the group. It makes me want to just avoid participating altogether.

Consultant: Avoiding participation sounds like a way to cope with those feelings. Let’s explore this. Can you identify any specific evidence that would support or challenge the belief that you’re not valuable to your group?

User: Sometimes, I really do have good ideas, but I just freeze when it's my turn to speak. I guess there have been moments when friends appreciated my input, but those memories feel overshadowed by my doubt.

Consultant: Acknowledging those moments when your ideas were valued can be quite empowering. What would it look like for you to remind yourself of those successes instead of focusing on the fear? 

User: I suppose I could try to remind myself about what I’ve contributed in the past. It might help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step. Would you be open to setting a small goal for your next group project, like sharing at least one idea or input? 

User: Yes, I think I could start with that! It feels manageable to aim for one contribution.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach, Jun! As we move forward, let’s also discuss techniques to help you when anxiety hits. Are you open to exploring some relaxation or coping strategies together?

User: Absolutely! I think some strategies would help to calm my nerves in those moments of pressure.

Consultant: Great! We can look into breathing techniques or mindfulness exercises that can help ground you during stressful instances. Have you ever tried any breathing exercises before?

User: Not really. I’ve heard about them but never practiced them myself.

Consultant: No worries! We can start with a simple one. It involves taking deep breaths—breathe in through your nose for four counts, hold for four counts, and then breathe out slowly through your mouth for four counts. Want to give it a try together?

User: Sure! I’d love to try that out right now.

Consultant: Let's do it. Ready? Breathe in through your nose... one, two, three, four. Now hold... one, two, three, four. And breathe out through your mouth... one, two, three, four. Great job, Jun! How do you feel after that?

User: I feel a bit more relaxed. It really helps to focus on my breathing!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Regular practice can assist you in managing anxiety effectively. We can also establish a routine for incorporating this practice into your day. What do you think?

User: That sounds good to me! I can try to do this before school or when I feel anxious.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Doing it before school can set a calmer tone for your day. As we start wrapping up our session today, let’s summarize what we’ve worked on. How would you describe the progress you’ve made?

User: I’ve learned to better understand my self-doubt and how to handle it. I have some strategies in place now, like reminding myself of my past contributions and practicing breathing.

Consultant: That’s a significant recognition of progress, Jun! You've gained tools that can help maintain your mental well-being. Looking ahead, what challenges do you foresee that we might still need to address?

User: I think the challenges are mainly related to managing anxious moments during group activities. I want to feel confident in sharing my thoughts.

Consultant: It’s insightful to recognize that. Tackling those anxious moments will be key. Remember, you have techniques like brainstorming past successes and practicing breathing exercises to support you. 

User: Yes, I’ll keep those in mind. Thank you for discussing all of this with me!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Jun! These strides you’ve made are wonderful to see. If you ever feel the need for further support, don’t hesitate to reach out. I believe in your ability to manage these challenges. 

User: Thank you! I believe it too. I feel ready to keep moving forward.

Consultant: That's the spirit! I'm excited for your continued journey. Take care, and see you next time!
