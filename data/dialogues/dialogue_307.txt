Consultant: Hi, Mr. Li! I'm glad you're back today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello. Honestly, I'm still feeling quite anxious about my work, especially with this new project. I have to collaborate more, and it feels overwhelming.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like the increased collaboration requirement is really contributing to your anxiety. Can you tell me more about what specific situations at work have been causing you to feel overwhelmed?

User: Yes, during meetings, I often feel like I'm not being heard. I hesitate to speak up because I worry my ideas won't be valued.

Consultant: That must be really frustrating for you. It seems that your concern about being heard is impacting your confidence. When you think about speaking in those meetings, what thoughts come to your mind?

User: I often think that my colleagues might dismiss my ideas or that I might embarrass myself if I say something wrong.

Consultant: Those thoughts certainly sound challenging. It's common to have such fears, but let's explore them. What evidence do you have that your colleagues would dismiss your ideas?

User: I guess I don't have any solid evidence; it's more of a gut feeling. It just feels that way when I'm in the moment.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. Often, our emotions can lead us to believe things that might not be true. If a friend were in your position, what advice would you give them about those thoughts?

User: I suppose I would tell them to trust themselves and that it's okay to share their ideas.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! You acknowledge that it's important to trust oneself. How about we try to apply that same logic to your situation? What could change if you started to trust in your ideas?

User: Maybe I would feel less anxious about sharing them and more willing to participate in discussions.

Consultant: Exactly! By recognizing that feeling less anxious is possible, you can slowly work on changing the way you approach these meetings. Would it help to practice some strategies for boosting your confidence when it comes to sharing your thoughts?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful. I think I need to work on my self-talk and how I perceive my contributions.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! Positive self-talk can significantly impact your confidence. Let's begin with a simple exercise. Can you think of a previous time when you successfully shared an idea at work? What were the details?

User: There was a project I worked on last year, and my suggestion was implemented. It went well, and that felt good.

Consultant: Fantastic! What good qualities did you demonstrate at that time which contributed to your success in that meeting?

User: I was well-prepared and confident about my idea. Plus, I expressed it clearly.

Consultant: Those are key strengths! By focusing on your preparation and clear communication, you can cultivate a mindset that supports your confidence. How can you remind yourself of these strengths before your next meeting?

User: I could write them down and maybe remind myself to prepare thoroughly for each meeting.

Consultant: That's a practical and effective approach! Preparing and reflecting on your past successes can help reinforce your confidence. What else could you do to prepare for your upcoming meetings?

User: I might practice what I want to say or even role-play with a friend to get used to sharing my ideas.

Consultant: Role-playing is an excellent strategy! It can lessen the anxiety of unexpected reactions from colleagues. Do you have someone in mind who would be supportive for this practice?

User: Yes, I can ask a close colleague who is understanding and often gives good feedback.

Consultant: That sounds like a supportive plan. As you practice, pay attention to any shifts in your anxiety and confidence levels. Let's also discuss some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing, to help when you start feeling anxious before meetings. 

User: Deep breathing sounds like a good idea. I sometimes forget to take a moment to calm myself down during stressful situations.

Consultant: Absolutely! Just taking a few deep breaths can ground you and help clear your mind. Would you like to try a quick breathing exercise together now?

User: Sure, that could help!

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a moment, then slowly exhale through your mouth. Let’s do that a few times to release any tension you might be feeling. How does that feel?

User: I feel a bit lighter already. It’s nice to take a moment for myself.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Incorporating this into your routine before meetings can make a difference. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what strategies you plan to implement before your next meeting.

User: I’ll focus on preparation, remind myself of my past successes, practice with my colleague, and use deep breathing to stay calm.

Consultant: That’s a solid strategy! Reflecting on your progress and reinforcing those positive thoughts can make a big difference. Remember, it's about taking small steps. If you feel ready, how will you track your feelings after your next few meetings?

User: I can keep a journal to jot down my feelings before and after each meeting. That might help me see my improvement over time.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Journaling can help you identify patterns in your feelings and reinforce your confidence as you notice your progress. Don't hesitate to reach out if you encounter challenges. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate all the guidance. It gives me hope to keep working on my communication skills.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, it takes time and practice. You're making progress by taking these steps. I look forward to hearing how everything unfolds in our next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hi, Mr. Li! I'm glad to see you again. How have things been for you since our last session?

User: Hello! Honestly, I've been feeling a bit better but still anxious. I've been trying out the techniques we discussed, but it’s a challenge to apply them consistently in meetings.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're making an effort! Change can indeed feel challenging, especially in high-pressure situations like meetings. Can you share a specific meeting experience where you tried to use these techniques?

User: Yes, there was a meeting last week where I attempted to share an idea. I practiced deep breathing beforehand, but when I spoke up, I felt like I was stumbling over my words.

Consultant: It sounds like you took a positive step by using deep breathing. It’s completely normal to feel nervous when speaking in front of others, especially if you're still adjusting. What thoughts were running through your mind in that moment?

User: I kept thinking that everyone was judging me and that I wouldn’t be able to express my thoughts clearly.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really overwhelming. It's easy to feel judged by others in those moments. Let’s explore this a bit: what evidence do you have that they were judging you negatively?

User: I don’t have solid evidence, but it feels like they weren't engaged with what I was saying. 

Consultant: Feeling that way is certainly understandable. Sometimes our perception of others’ reactions can be influenced by our anxiety. If a friend were in your shoes, what might you suggest they consider about the situation?

User: I would probably tell them that it's likely others are focused on their own thoughts and may not be paying as much attention as they think.

Consultant: That's a wise perspective! Recognizing that others may be preoccupied can help lessen that pressure. How might this shift in thinking affect your willingness to share your ideas in future meetings?

User: I guess it could help me focus less on their reactions and more on what I want to share.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on your contributions rather than external validation can empower you. Let’s talk about ways to prepare for future meetings. What’s one specific action you can take to feel more confident before sharing your thoughts?

User: I think I should try writing down key points I want to discuss beforehand. That might help me stay organized.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Having those key points can give you a roadmap for what you want to convey. What else can you incorporate into your prep routine to boost your confidence?

User: I could practice my points out loud. I think hearing myself say them might help me feel more assured.

Consultant: Great idea! Practicing out loud can familiarize you with your content and reduce anxiety. Additionally, practicing with a supportive colleague, as you mentioned before, could also be beneficial. How did your colleague’s feedback go when you practiced with them?

User: They were really encouraging and pointed out that my ideas were good. It lifted my spirits a bit.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Positive reinforcement from a colleague can make a significant difference. Let’s also continue discussing your self-talk. How can you shift any negative thoughts you experience before or during meetings into more positive affirmations?

User: I can remind myself that my ideas are valid and that everyone has moments of uncertainty.

Consultant: That’s a strong affirmation! Acknowledging that everyone has challenges helps normalize the experience. Would you like to develop a few specific affirmations you could use?

User: Yes, I think that would help. Maybe something like "My contributions are valuable" or "It's okay to be nervous; I can still express my ideas."

Consultant: Those are excellent affirmations! Repeating them before meetings can help ground you in your capabilities. How do you feel about using a journal to track your experiences and affirmations leading up to your meetings?

User: That sounds like a good idea. I think it would help me reflect on my progress and any shifts in my mindset.

Consultant: Absolutely! Journaling can help you track patterns in your feelings and reinforce positive changes. As we prepare to wrap up today, what steps will you take before your next meeting to implement what we've discussed?

User: I’ll write down key points, practice them out loud, and use the affirmations we created. Plus, I’ll continue journaling about the experience.

Consultant: That’s a thoughtful plan! Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s okay to have ups and downs. Reflect on your progress, and be gentle with yourself. How do you feel about this plan moving forward?

User: I feel hopeful! Implementing these strategies makes me feel more empowered to face meetings.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Empowerment is key. Remember, you’re building skills over time. I look forward to hearing about how it goes in our next session. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hi, Mr. Li! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hello! I've been trying to implement the strategies we discussed. However, I still feel quite anxious before meetings, especially when I need to share my thoughts.

Consultant: It’s good to know you're working on applying those strategies. Anxiety can be tough to manage, especially in such situations. Can you tell me about a recent meeting where you felt anxious?

User: Sure, in a meeting last week, I prepared key points and practiced them. But when it was my turn to speak, I felt my heart racing, and I almost forgot what I wanted to say.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you put in a lot of effort preparing, but the anxiety still took over in the moment. What thoughts crossed your mind while you were speaking?

User: I couldn’t shake the thought that everyone was focusing on my nervousness rather than what I was saying. I kept thinking they were judging me.

Consultant: That's a common fear. But let’s take a moment to examine that thought. What evidence do you have that your colleagues were judging you negatively?

User: I don't have any clear proof; it was just a feeling. They seemed a bit distracted at times.

Consultant: Understandably, it can feel that way when you’re anxious. Often, our worries can lead us to misinterpret others' behavior. If someone you care about felt this way, what advice would you give them?

User: I would tell them that people often have their own worries and are not as focused on others as we think.

Consultant: Exactly! By recognizing that others might be preoccupied, it can lessen the pressure you feel. How might that realization impact your confidence in future meetings?

User: It could make it easier for me to concentrate on sharing my ideas rather than worrying about what others think.

Consultant: That's the spirit! Now, let’s discuss your preparation for future meetings. What specific steps can you take to feel more confident before speaking?

User: I think I should focus on rehearsing my key points more thoroughly, maybe practice out loud more often.

Consultant: That's a solid plan! Practicing out loud not only helps with memory but also comforts you with your material. Have you considered combining it with affirmations or positive self-talk?

User: I haven't, but that sounds beneficial. I could remind myself that it's okay to be nervous and that my ideas are valid.

Consultant: Absolutely! Constructing affirmations can help reinforce your self-belief. Would you like to create a few together right now?

User: Yes, I’d like that! Maybe something like, "My ideas contribute meaningfully," or "It's alright to feel nervous."

Consultant: Those are excellent affirmations! Tell yourself these before meetings. How do you think journaling could help you track your experiences leading up to your meetings?

User: Journaling could help me reflect on my thoughts and feelings, tracking what works and what doesn't.

Consultant: Definitely! Reflecting on your experiences can reinforce positive changes you've made. As we wrap up today, what steps do you plan to take before your next meeting?

User: I’ll rehearse my key points, use positive affirmations, and commit to journaling about my feelings afterward.

Consultant: That sounds like a comprehensive plan! It'll be important to monitor your feelings and progress. How do you feel about this approach moving forward?

User: I feel optimistic! Using these strategies gives me a sense of control over my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Empowering yourself is a big step. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care in the meantime!

Consultant: Hi, Mr. Li! It's great to see you again. How have things been for you since our last session?

User: Hello! I've been continuing to apply the strategies we discussed, but I still face challenges. Lately, I’ve felt overwhelmed going into meetings.

Consultant: It’s good to hear you’re still working on those strategies, even if it’s tough at times. Can you share an example of a recent meeting that felt overwhelming?

User: Yes, in a meeting last week, I was prepared, but when it was my turn to speak, I felt a wave of anxiety crash over me. I stumbled through my presentation, and it made me feel bad afterward.

Consultant: It sounds like that was a really difficult experience for you. It’s understandable to feel anxious when you have so much riding on it. What specific thoughts were running through your mind during that moment?

User: I was worried that everyone was judging me for my performance. I thought about how I was stumbling over my words.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts were very distracting. Let’s explore that a bit deeper: how much evidence do you have that they were actually judging you negatively?

User: I can’t say for sure; it was more of a feeling. Some colleagues were looking at their notes, so it felt like they weren’t interested.

Consultant: It’s common to doubt ourselves based on such feelings. However, people can be distracted for various reasons and it may not always reflect their view of you. What would you tell a friend who worries about similar judgments?

User: I’d probably tell them that their thoughts might not reflect reality and that people are often focusing on their own issues rather than judging others.

Consultant: That’s a very supportive perspective! Recognizing that others might be focused on their own worries can indeed help lessen that anxiety. How might that shift in perception empower you in future meetings?

User: It might help me focus more on sharing my ideas rather than worrying about their reactions.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on your contributions can be very empowering. Let’s think about practical steps to prepare for your next meeting. What’s one approach you could implement to feel more confident?

User: I should probably practice my key points more thoroughly, even role-play them if I can.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Role-playing can simulate the meeting environment and make you feel more comfortable. Have you thought about how to visually remind yourself of your value and ideas before the meetings?

User: I could create a small note with positive affirmations and stick it where I can see it before speaking.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Positive affirmations can really help ground you. Would you like to develop some affirmations together that resonate with you?

User: Yes! Maybe something like, "I have valuable contributions to make," or "It’s okay to be nervous; I can still express my thoughts."

Consultant: Those affirmations are fantastic! Using them regularly can help build your self-confidence. How do you feel about journaling your experiences and using those affirmations as a part of your preparation routine?

User: I think journaling would be helpful for reflection. It could help me see my progress and what feelings come up for me.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflecting on your experiences can greatly reinforce the positive changes you're working towards. As we prepare to wrap up, what concrete steps do you plan to take before your next meeting?

User: I'll practice my key points, use positive affirmations, and write in my journal afterward about how things went.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Monitoring your feelings and tracking your progress will be key. How do you feel about this approach moving forward?

User: I feel hopeful! Implementing these strategies gives me a sense of control, and I believe I can improve.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Your sense of empowerment is essential. I'm looking forward to hearing how everything unfolds in our next session. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hi, Mr. Li! It's good to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hello! I've been trying to implement the strategies we talked about, but I still struggle with anxiety in meetings. It feels like I take two steps forward and then one step back.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Change takes time, and it’s normal to experience ups and downs along the way. Can you share a specific situation from a recent meeting where you felt that anxiety?

User: Sure, there was a meeting last week where I felt prepared, but when it was my turn to speak, I blanked. I couldn't remember my main points, and it was really frustrating.

Consultant: It sounds like that was a challenging experience for you. It’s common to feel that way under pressure. What thoughts went through your mind at that moment when you were struggling to remember?

User: I kept thinking that I was failing and that everyone was disappointed in me. It made me feel really inadequate.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very harsh. It's important to recognize that anxiety can create a distorted view of the situation. How much evidence do you have that your colleagues were disappointed?

User: Honestly, I don't have any concrete evidence. It just felt like I was losing their attention.

Consultant: It’s often the case that our perceptions can mislead us, especially when we're anxious. If a friend shared similar concerns, what advice would you have given them?

User: I would tell them it’s okay to have bad moments and that people are generally more understanding than we think.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective! Recognizing that people are often more forgiving can help lighten the burden of your thoughts. How could that perspective influence your approach in future meetings?

User: I think if I remember that, I could focus more on sharing my ideas instead of worrying about their reactions.

Consultant: Absolutely! Shifting your focus to your contributions rather than others' perceptions can significantly reduce anxiety. What strategies do you think you can put in place to prepare better for your upcoming meetings?

User: I could try rehearsing more thoroughly and maybe even visualizing myself doing well.

Consultant: Visualization is a powerful tool! It can help create a sense of familiarity and comfort. Have you also thought about incorporating positive self-talk into your preparation?

User: I haven't really focused on that, but it might be beneficial. What would you recommend?

Consultant: How about we create a few affirmations you can repeat to yourself? For example, "I am prepared and capable," or "I have valuable ideas to share." How do those sound to you?
