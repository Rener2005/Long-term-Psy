Consultant: Hello Zhang! I'm glad you're here for today's session. Before we begin, I want to check in on how you've been feeling lately. Can you share what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty overwhelmed, especially after that presentation in class last week. I was so anxious that I couldn't even speak properly, and it really shook my confidence. Now I'm worried about my ability to perform academically.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience had a significant impact on you. It's understandable to feel anxious and doubt yourself after something like that. Can you tell me more about that moment? What thoughts were running through your mind when you were up there?

User: I just kept thinking that everyone was judging me, and I felt like I was going to fail. I was so nervous that my mind went blank, and I stumbled over my words. It was so embarrassing.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult. It seems like the thought of being judged and the fear of failing really heightened your anxiety. When that happens, what emotions do you usually experience?

User: I usually feel a mix of fear and shame. After that incident, I started to believe that I’m not cut out for public speaking or even for my courses. It’s been hard to shake off those feelings.

Consultant: I can see why you would feel that way. It's common for a negative experience to lead to harsh self-judgment. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit. You mentioned feeling like you’re not cut out for public speaking. What evidence do you have that supports this belief?

User: Well, I did poorly during my presentation, and I can’t seem to recall any positive experiences. I think if I can’t do it well once, I won't be able to do it again.

Consultant: It’s understandable to focus on that one experience, but let’s take a closer look. Have there been any situations where you felt you communicated well, even informally with friends or during class discussions?

User: Hmm… I guess there were times when I helped my friends with group projects, and they seemed to appreciate my input. But those situations feel different—there's less pressure.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Those group interactions show that you do have the capability to communicate effectively. Let’s challenge the thought that you can't speak well in front of others. What alternative thought could you consider that might be more balanced?

User: Maybe I could think that while I struggled in that presentation, it doesn’t define my overall ability. I did okay in less pressured situations.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a more balanced perspective. It's important to recognize that one challenging experience doesn’t define your abilities. Let's talk about how we can gradually face this fear of public speaking. What small steps do you think you could take that might help you feel more comfortable?

User: Perhaps I could start practicing in front of a mirror or with a close friend. That might help me build my confidence before I have to present again.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Practicing in a more comfortable setting can help you start to regain confidence. How about setting a specific time to practice this week? 

User: I could try to practice twice before the next class. I think that would help.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. As you practice, pay attention to any negative thoughts that arise and try to challenge them, just like we talked about. How do you think you might feel after these practice sessions?

User: Hopefully, I’ll feel less anxious and more prepared. But I’m still worried about the actual presentation.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. However, remember that practice can help reduce anxiety. What if we also create a plan for how to manage your nerves during the presentation? 

User: Yes, that might help. I’d like to have strategies in place.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can think about techniques like deep breathing or positive affirmations. What strategy resonates with you the most when you consider how to calm your nerves?

User: Deep breathing sounds effective. I’ve heard it helps in managing anxiety.

Consultant: Great choice! Deep breathing can really help center your thoughts and decrease anxiety. Would you like to try a breathing exercise together right now?

User: Sure, that would be helpful.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s take a moment. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Let’s repeat that a few times... Now, how does that feel?

User: I feel a bit more relaxed. I can see how this could help during a presentation.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Practicing this technique before your next presentation could be beneficial. As we wrap up today’s session, what are the key takeaways you'd like to focus on until we meet again?

User: I want to practice deep breathing and try my mock presentations. I’ll also work on challenging my negative thoughts.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan, Zhang. I'm confident you'll make progress. Remember, each step you take is part of your journey. If you start to feel overwhelmed, remind yourself of the skills we discussed. 

User: Thank you, I appreciate your support. I'll try my best.

Consultant: You're doing great, and I believe in you! This was a productive session. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything before our next meeting. Have confidence in your abilities, and I'll see you then!

User: Thank you, I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious about my studies. Recently, I failed several courses in my mid-term exams, which has made me question my academic abilities a lot. I don’t feel competent to handle my classes, and it's stressing me out.

Consultant: I can see how that would be very overwhelming for you. It sounds like there’s a lot of pressure weighing on you right now. What specifically about these failures has made you doubt your skills?

User: I just feel like I’m not smart enough compared to my classmates. They seem to understand everything so easily, while I struggle to keep up. It makes me anxious and really question my future.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when it seems like everyone else is doing better. I'm here to help you work through these thoughts. What would it look like for you to feel more confident in your studies?

User: I guess if I can believe that I could actually pass my courses and maybe even enjoy studying again, that would be a big improvement for me.

Consultant: That’s a great insight. It sounds like finding a way to enjoy studying again is crucial for you. Let’s explore some positive beliefs you can develop about your abilities. What are some thoughts you have when you think about your study habits?

User: I often think, "I’ll never understand this," or "I'm a failure." Those thoughts just make it harder to even get started on my assignments.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very discouraging. Let's break those down. Could we challenge those beliefs and see if they are truly accurate? For example, what's the evidence that you can't understand the material?

User: Well, I guess there were times I managed to get decent grades before, but after these failures, it just feels different. 

Consultant: That is a valuable point. You have succeeded before, and that shows you do have the capability. How about we start reframing those negative thoughts? Instead of saying "I’ll never understand this," could we reword it to something more balanced, like, "With effort and the right strategies, I can improve"?

User: I could try that, but it feels hard to believe sometimes.

Consultant: That’s completely normal! It can take time to shift long-held thoughts. Maybe we can use some small goals to help you build confidence. What is one small step you could take in your studies this week?

User: I think starting with reviewing my notes for one subject might help. It feels manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect start! And how do you think you would feel after completing that task?

User: I might feel a little proud of myself, and it might give me the motivation to keep going.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on those small wins can help build your confidence. Remember to celebrate each achievement, no matter how small. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds useful. I guess I’ve been too focused on what I haven't done rather than acknowledging what I can do.

Consultant: That's a breakthrough! All your efforts count. Let’s also think about your social interactions. You mentioned earlier feeling drained when interacting with others. How does that play into your current challenges?

User: I feel anxious about talking to people, especially when I think they might judge me because of my studies.

Consultant: That’s a common concern, but I want you to know that most people are focused on their challenges as well. What if we explore ways to increase your comfort in social settings? Could it help ease some of your anxiety?

User: Yes, I think that could help. It's just scary to think about being rejected.

Consultant: Let's take that fear of rejection and confront it together. What if you approached a conversation with someone with the idea that it’s just a chance to get to know them better, rather than a test of your worth?

User: That sounds nice, but I'm not sure I could do it yet.

Consultant: That's okay. It’s important to go at your own pace. How about trying low-pressure social situations first? Like chatting with a classmate about an assignment?

User: I could try that. It feels less intimidating than a casual get-together.

Consultant: Great! This approach allows you to dip your toes in without overwhelming yourself. Building confidence in social situations can take time as well. How would you feel after trying that out next week?

User: I think it could help. Even if it feels uncomfortable, I might feel more capable after.

Consultant: Exactly! And remember, it’s okay to feel uneasy. Growth often comes from stepping outside of our comfort zones. We can review how this goes in our next session and continue to build from there.

User: That sounds good. I appreciate your support. I feel a little more hopeful.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Building hope is a crucial part of overcoming these challenges. As we move forward, keep in mind the strengths you already have and the steps you're taking. What are some other goals you’d like to work on beyond next week?

User: I would like to gradually join a study group. Maybe that would help with my studies and social skills.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Study groups can be very beneficial for both learning and connecting with others. Let's plan to incorporate that into our discussions in the future. For now, remember to take it one step at a time and celebrate your progression.

User: Thank you. I’ll focus on my notes and see how that goes.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Zhang! I believe in your ability to make positive changes. Remember, I’m here for you whenever you need support. We’ll touch base on these goals in our next session.

User: Sounds great! I’m looking forward to it.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! It's great to have you here for our session. How have you been feeling since our last talk?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit anxious. I'm trying to get better at social situations, but I’m still struggling. I really want to improve my interaction with others, but I still feel like I don’t belong.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really eager to enhance your social interactions, yet you're facing some challenges. Can you tell me a bit more about a specific situation where you felt this way recently?

User: Sure. During a recent campus event, I tried to join a group, but I felt really out of place. They seemed to know each other well, and I just stood there, not knowing what to say. I felt invisible and isolated.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. Feeling isolated in a group can be very uncomfortable, especially when you’re trying to connect. What were some thoughts running through your mind during that experience?

User: I just kept thinking that they wouldn’t want to talk to me or that I would make a fool of myself if I tried to join in. It felt like I was just reinforcing my own fears about socializing.

Consultant: I hear you. Those thoughts can be very powerful and can make you withdraw even more. Can we explore how those thoughts made you feel at that moment and maybe begin to challenge them?

User: Yeah, they made me feel really anxious and even sad. I wanted to connect, but the fear of rejection stopped me.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Let’s try to separate those thoughts from reality. What evidence do you have that they wouldn’t want to talk to you? Could there be alternative explanations for their behavior?

User: Maybe they were just focused on each other or didn't notice me? I guess I was jumping to conclusions.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s common to jump to conclusions in social situations. If a friend was in your shoes, what would you tell them about those thoughts?

User: I would tell them to not assume the worst and that it’s okay to take a chance and say hi. 

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective! It shows that you already have the ability to reframe those thoughts. How would it feel for you to try that approach next time?

User: I think it would help, but I still feel nervous about it.

Consultant: Nerves are completely normal! Let's think of small steps you can take to practice reaching out to others. What’s one easy social situation you can think of where you could start small?

User: Maybe I could try to initiate a conversation with a classmate before or after a class? That feels less intimidating.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect starting point! What might you say to initiate that conversation?

User: I could ask them about the class or share my thoughts on the last lecture. 

Consultant: Great idea! It’s a neutral topic and can lead to a more enjoyable exchange. How do you feel about setting that as a goal for this week?

User: I feel a bit nervous about it, but I think I could try it. I really want to improve!

Consultant: That's a brave step, Zhang! It’s wonderful to hear your determination. If things don't go as planned, how might you remind yourself to maintain a positive mindset?

User: I guess I could tell myself that not every interaction has to go perfectly and that everyone feels awkward sometimes. 

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a healthy perspective. Remember to be kind to yourself, regardless of the outcome. How will you keep track of these experiences and your thoughts afterward?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal to note what happened and how I felt about it. I think that might help!

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Journaling can help you reflect and identify patterns in your thoughts and feelings. Would you like to set a few reminders to check in with yourself after your conversations?

User: Yes, I can do that! It sounds like a good way to stay accountable.

Consultant: Perfect! Accountability can be very motivating. How would you feel if we checked in on your progress during our next session?

User: I would appreciate that! It might help me stay focused and not give up.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! We can celebrate your successes together, no matter how small. As we wrap up today, what do you think will be your biggest challenge in the next week regarding social interactions?

User: I think it will be overcoming the initial anxiety before starting a conversation. 

Consultant: Acknowledge that feeling, but remind yourself of the strategies we discussed. You've got this, Zhang! Keep your focus on taking that first step. How are you feeling now about your ability to navigate social situations?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful! I still have my doubts, but I feel like I'm ready to try. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Hope is a powerful ally. Remember, it’s completely normal to have fluctuations in confidence, and it’s about progress, not perfection. Before we finish, let’s recap the main takeaways from today’s session.

User: Okay! I’ll try to start conversations with classmates, keep a journal about my experiences, and remember that it’s okay if things don’t go perfectly.

Consultant: Exactly! Those are solid strategies. I believe in your ability to navigate this journey. If you encounter setbacks, just remember that’s part of the learning process. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care, Zhang!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been trying to work on my confidence after that experience in the interest group. It still stings a bit when I think about it. 

Consultant: It's understandable that you're still feeling the impact of that experience. It can be difficult to handle criticism, especially when you're trying to put yourself out there. Can you share more about what specifically has been bothering you?

User: I just feel like I messed up. I thought I would fit in, but it seems like I didn't make a good impression. Now I hesitate to join other activities.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience has made you question not only your ability to connect with others but also your self-worth. How do you usually respond to such feelings of disappointment?

User: I tend to dwell on it. I replay what happened in my mind and it makes me feel worse, like I can't do anything right.

Consultant: That’s a common reaction. Our minds often focus on the negatives. I'm curious, what thoughts come up for you when you're replaying that moment?

User: I think things like "I always mess things up" or "I'm not good enough to be part of the group."

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really discouraging. Let's take a moment to analyze them. How true do you think those thoughts really are, and what evidence do you have to support or contest them?

User: Well, it's hard to say. I mean, I do have some friends who appreciate me, but those negative thoughts feel overwhelming in the moment.

Consultant: It’s good that you can recognize that some people appreciate you. That’s important evidence against the negative thoughts. If a friend were feeling this way, what would you tell them?

User: I would tell them that everyone has setbacks and that it doesn’t define who they are.

Consultant: Exactly! You would offer them compassion and perspective. Now, how can you apply that same kindness to yourself when you face criticism or setbacks?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s okay to fail sometimes and that it doesn’t mean I’m not good enough.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Incorporating self-compassion can be very helpful. Let's work on some positive self-dialogue. Can you think of a positive affirmation you could tell yourself when you start feeling that way?

User: Maybe something like "I’m doing my best and that’s enough"?

Consultant: That's a wonderful affirmation! It acknowledges your efforts while being gentle with yourself. How might you use that affirmation in situations where you feel judged or criticized?

User: I could repeat it to myself when I start feeling anxious about meeting new people or in group settings.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan. Remember, affirmations take practice. You might start feeling awkward at first, but the more you practice, the more natural it will become. How do you feel about trying this out?

User: I think I can give it a shot. I just hope it helps me feel less anxious.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious when trying something new. It’s part of building resilience. We can also plan small activities to help ease you back into social situations. What do you think?

User: That sounds good! Maybe I could attend another event but just observe first?

Consultant: Observing sounds like a great first step. It allows you to ease into social situations without pressure. How about setting a specific event to attend this week?

User: There’s a small meetup next Friday that I could go to.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s set that as a goal. Alongside that, practice your positive affirmation before the meetup. Would you feel comfortable checking in about your experience afterward?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I want to stay accountable.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Accountability can be very motivating. After the meetup, we can talk about how it went and how you felt. How does that sound?

User: That sounds really helpful. I felt a bit hesitant, but I think I can manage that.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Facing social situations can feel daunting, but taking small steps ultimately leads to more confidence. What else might you want to focus on as you go through this process?

User: I guess I worry about what if it doesn’t go well again. I don’t want to feel that disappointment.

Consultant: It’s natural to have those worries, but remember it’s a learning process. Every experience, whether good or bad, helps you grow. How can you remind yourself that it’s okay to have setbacks?

User: I can think of it as part of the journey and not the endpoint, like a lesson learned.

Consultant: Absolutely! Viewing setbacks as lessons rather than failures can shift your perspective. Let's explore how you can reinforce that mindset as you prepare for the meetup.

User: I could write down what I learned from past experiences, good or bad, to reflect on.

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Reflecting can provide insight and help reinforce your growth. We can review what you write in our next session. What do you think?

User: I like that plan. It feels like I’m actively working on things.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re taking proactive steps toward building resilience and confidence. As we continue, remember that you’re not alone in this journey. I’m here to support you.

User: Thank you. I really appreciate your guidance. It feels good to have a plan.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your experience next time. Remember to be kind to yourself as you navigate these challenges.

User: I will. I'm feeling a bit more hopeful now. Thank you!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let’s keep building on that hope together. Looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad to see you for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better about my studies, especially since I received a good grade in one of my main subjects. But I still have doubts about my future and what I want to do.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step forward, but I can sense there's still uncertainty regarding your future. Let’s explore that further. What aspects about your future are causing you the most worry?

User: I’m worried about choosing the right career path. I feel like I don't have a clear plan, and I'm concerned about what happens after graduation.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel anxious about the future, especially regarding your career. Can you share what kind of careers or fields interest you, even if you’re not sure about them?

User: I’m interested in marketing and maybe some part of psychology, but I’m not sure if I’d be good at either. Sometimes I think about going into something safe and stable instead.

Consultant: It’s great that you have identified some areas of interest. How do those interests align with what you enjoy doing or your strengths? Let’s take a moment to identify what you feel you excel at.

User: I think I'm creative and I enjoy writing. I like developing ideas and thinking of new ways to present them. But I always doubt my abilities.

Consultant: Creativity and the ability to present ideas are valuable skills in marketing and psychology. Can we challenge the doubts you have about your abilities? What evidence do you have that might support a more positive view of your skills?

User: I guess I have done well on assignments that involve creativity, but I still feel like I might fail in a real job situation.

Consultant: It’s natural to have concerns about real-world applications. Let’s think about those assignments where you succeeded. What specific feedback have you received that highlights your strengths?

User: I received positive feedback for my presentation skills, and my professors often say I have good ideas. But I still can’t shake off the insecurity.

Consultant: That’s wonderful feedback! It seems you have received validation for your skills. Would it help to create a plan that builds on these strengths and gradually confronts your fears around future career choices?

User: Yes, I think a plan could help. But I’m not sure where to start.

Consultant: We can start by setting small, achievable goals that align with your interests and strengths. What if we outlined some steps, like researching careers in marketing or psychology, and perhaps talking to someone in those fields?

User: I like that idea. Researching sounds manageable. What if I reach out to someone and they don't think I'm good enough?

Consultant: That’s a common fear, but remember, reaching out is a way to learn and grow. Most people are willing to help. If a conversation does not go as you hoped, what could you take away from the experience instead?

User: I suppose any feedback could help me improve. I’d have to look at it as a learning experience.

Consultant: Absolutely! Every interaction is a chance to learn and develop resilience. Let’s also establish a few short-term goals—perhaps drafting a list of questions you might want to ask someone in the field?

User: That sounds doable. I can write down my questions and start researching the fields as well.

Consultant: Perfect! Taking these steps can build up your confidence. As we aim for clarity in your career plans, how do you feel about committing to this research this week?

User: I feel more motivated and less anxious about it now. I’ll definitely give it a try.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. How about we check in next week to discuss your findings and any thoughts that come up?

User: Yes, that sounds good. I feel like I have a clearer direction now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It sounds like you’re more equipped to handle these feelings regarding your future. As we wrap up, what do you think will be your biggest takeaway from our session today?

User: I think understanding that I have strengths to build on and taking steps to clarify my career path are my key takeaways.

Consultant: Wonderful insights! I’m excited for you as you explore these new avenues. Remember, it’s okay to feel uncertain; the important part is taking action. I'll see you next time to review your progress.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and support. I'm looking forward to our next meeting.
###################
Consultant: Hello Zhang! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling more stable emotionally. Spending time with my family during the break really helped me feel supported. I also feel more at ease when engaging with others.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some significant progress in terms of emotional stability and social interactions. What specific changes have you noticed in your social behavior or academic life since our last meeting?

User: I've started to initiate conversations with my classmates more, and I feel less anxious about participating in group discussions. Academically, I've managed to stick to my study schedule better, too.

Consultant: It's great that you've been able to connect more with your classmates and adhere to your study schedule. Can you share what helped you to feel more comfortable in initiating those conversations?

User: I think it was partly the support from my family and also practicing some strategies we discussed last time, like focusing on positive outcomes instead of worrying about judgment.

Consultant: That sounds like a really effective approach! Shifting your focus to positive outcomes can definitely ease anxiety. Can you tell me about a specific moment when you felt particularly proud of initiating a conversation or participating in a group discussion?

User: There was this study group session where I suggested a topic for discussion. Initially, I was nervous, but once I started talking, I felt really good about it. My classmates were engaged, and it felt rewarding.

Consultant: That’s an excellent achievement, Zhang! You took the initiative, and it led to a positive experience. How did that make you feel afterwards?

User: I felt relieved and happy. It was nice to be part of the group and not feel like I was just observing.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear you felt that way! It truly seems like you’re moving in the right direction socially. Do you think this experience has changed your outlook on future interactions with others?

User: Yes, definitely. I’m starting to think that interactions can be enjoyable rather than stressful, which is a big shift for me.

Consultant: That's a significant insight! Recognizing that interactions can be enjoyable can encourage you to seek out more social opportunities. Are there any areas where you still feel hesitant or anxious?

User: I do feel a bit anxious about speaking in larger groups, like during lectures or presentations. I worry that I might get nervous and forget what I want to say.

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel that way about larger groups. Let's explore this concern further. What thoughts come to mind when you think about speaking in front of a larger audience?

User: I often think that I'll mess up or that everyone will be judging me. That thought makes me too scared to participate.

Consultant: I see. Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. Can we take a moment to question the validity of those beliefs? What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts those thoughts?

User: Well, I guess I haven't actually messed up in the smaller group discussions, and my classmates have been supportive. I just tend to focus on the worst-case scenario.

Consultant: That's a great realization, Zhang! It seems like you've successfully engaged in smaller groups without issues. What would you say to a friend who expressed the same fears about presenting?

User: I would tell them to focus on the positive feedback they received and that everyone makes mistakes. It's okay to be imperfect.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate way to approach it. Applying that same kindness to yourself could be very helpful. How about we brainstorm some small steps you could take to build your confidence for larger groups?

User: That sounds good! Maybe I could start by sharing my thoughts in smaller classes before moving to larger ones.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Gradually increasing your exposure will help acclimate you to larger audiences. How do you feel about setting a goal to contribute in your next lecture?

User: I feel more motivated to do that! I need to remind myself that my voice matters.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember, your contributions are valuable, and many people will appreciate your input. As we wrap up today’s session, do you feel you have the tools to manage this fear moving forward?

User: Yes, I feel much more equipped now. I have strategies to cope with my anxiety and the reassurance that I can take things one step at a time.

Consultant: I'm really proud of the progress you made today, Zhang. It’s clear you’re on a positive path. As we continue, remember to celebrate these small victories. What would you like to focus on in our next session?

User: I’d like to further develop my confidence in larger groups and maybe explore some stress management techniques.

Consultant: Sounds like a solid plan! We can definitely work on that together. Looking forward to our next session. You're doing so well, and I'll be here to support you whenever you need it.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and guidance. I'm looking forward to our next talk as well.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care until then, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything before our next meeting. Goodbye for now!

User: Goodbye!
