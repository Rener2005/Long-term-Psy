Consultant: Hello! Welcome to our session today. Before we dive in, I’d like to get a sense of how you’ve been feeling recently. Can you share what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really tense and anxious, especially after attending that senior experience sharing session. Hearing about how difficult it is to find a good job if you don't do well in exams really worried me.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience has had a significant impact on your feelings about the future and your academic performance. What specifically about those comments made you feel anxious?

User: I keep thinking that if I don’t get good grades, I won’t be able to find a decent job, and my parents will be disappointed in me. It's just overwhelming.

Consultant: I can see how those thoughts would create a lot of pressure for you—wanting to meet your parents' expectations while worrying about your grades. Let's explore this a bit more. What thoughts go through your mind when you consider your grades and future job prospects?

User: I dread the idea of failing again. I don’t want to let my parents down. Sometimes I think that if I don’t succeed, I’ll just be stuck in a low-paying job forever.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It seems like you're feeling trapped by these expectations and fears. When you think about your future like that, what emotions do you experience?

User: I feel panic and fear. It's like I can’t breathe sometimes, and I just want to escape from it all.

Consultant: Those feelings of panic can be really overwhelming. Let’s take a moment to pinpoint some of the thoughts that fuel those feelings. When you're in that panicky state, what thoughts or images most often come to your mind?

User: I think about all my failed exams and how my peers will judge me. I feel like everyone else has it together, and I'm just falling behind.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re comparing your situation to your peers and feeling a sense of inadequacy. Can you think of any specific instances where this comparison has affected your mood or confidence?

User: Yes, after I heard about that student who struggles to find a job, I couldn’t stop thinking that maybe I would end up like that too. I've become so scared of failing.

Consultant: That’s understandable. The fear of not measuring up can be very daunting. Let's challenge that thought for a moment: Is there evidence that supports this fear, or have you had experiences where you succeeded despite your worries?

User: I guess I did well in my previous exams before college. But now, it feels like everything has changed, and I can’t keep up.

Consultant: It’s great that you acknowledge your successes in the past. What do you think has changed that makes you feel differently about yourself now?

User: I think the expectations are higher, and I don’t study as hard anymore. I also feel like I should have everything figured out already, but I don’t.

Consultant: That’s a very real feeling—expecting yourself to meet high standards even when circumstances are difficult. Maybe we can look at ways to help ease that pressure. What activities could you integrate into your study routine that might help you feel more accomplished and less anxious?

User: I could try breaking down my study material into smaller chunks. But sometimes, even that feels overwhelming.

Consultant: Breaking things down is a wonderful strategy. Let’s take it a step further. How about setting small, achievable goals each study session? This way, you can celebrate those little victories without feeling swamped by the larger picture.

User: That sounds doable. I just worry I won't be able to stick to it.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to have those worries, but remember, it’s about creating a manageable routine. If you were to approach it as a friend would, what would you advise yourself to do?

User: I think I would tell myself to be patient and just try my best. It's okay to take baby steps.

Consultant: Exactly! Allowing yourself that grace to progress at your own pace is vital. How would you feel about creating a weekly study schedule that includes these smaller goals?

User: That could help me organize my time better and not feel so chaotic about studying.

Consultant: Wonderful! I encourage you to give it a try. As you develop this routine, let’s also plan to check in regularly about your feelings and any adjustments you need to make. Remember, it’s a journey.

User: Okay, I can do that. I still feel anxious, but having a plan helps a little.

Consultant: It's completely okay to still feel anxious. The goal here is to make those feelings manageable. What other strategies can we explore to help you during times of high stress?

User: Maybe practicing mindfulness or relaxation techniques could help. I’ve heard they’re useful but I haven’t tried them.

Consultant: Mindfulness and relaxation techniques can indeed be very beneficial. Would you be open to incorporating some brief mindfulness exercises to help lessen your anxiety when you study?

User: Yes, that sounds good. I’d like to try anything to feel less anxious.

Consultant: Fantastic! We can start with simple deep-breathing exercises or even short meditation sessions to help center your thoughts. How do you feel about trying that in the next week?

User: I can definitely give that a shot. I appreciate you suggesting these strategies.

Consultant: I’m glad you’re feeling hopeful! Before we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed. What key strategies are you planning to implement moving forward?

User: I’ll create a study schedule, break down tasks, and practice mindfulness techniques. I’m going to remind myself to take things slow.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! It’s important to be gentle with yourself as you navigate these changes. I believe you have the strength to handle this. Just remember, small steps lead to progress.

User: Thank you. I feel a little lighter after talking about everything.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m glad to hear that. Remember, you’re not alone on this journey. If anxiety comes creeping back or you feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: I will. Thanks for your support and understanding today.

Consultant: It’s my pleasure! I look forward to hearing how everything goes in our next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad you're here today. Before we begin, I’d like to understand how you've been feeling recently. Can you share what’s been happening in your life?  

User: Hi! I've been feeling really anxious and self-conscious lately, especially when I'm around my classmates. I think it’s because I’m worried about my exam results and what they might think of me.  

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you’ve been struggling with social anxiety and fear of judgment from your classmates. Let's talk about what that feels like for you when you're in those situations.  

User: Well, whenever we discuss exams or grades, I tend to just avoid talking about it. I feel embarrassed because I didn't do well in my mid-terms, and I'm afraid they might think less of me.  

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It seems like avoiding those conversations might help you feel less anxious in the moment, but it also increases your social pressure. What emotions come up for you when you think about those conversations?  

User: I feel a sense of shame and frustration. I keep questioning myself—like, “Why can’t I just perform better?” It makes me feel inadequate compared to others.  

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, Wang. Those thoughts can be quite heavy. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come up when you feel that pressure or anxiety about your performance?  

User: Yes! I often think, “If I don’t do well, nobody will want to be friends with me,” or “I’ll never get a good job.”  

Consultant: It sounds like you’re making some strong assumptions about how your performance might affect your friendships and future. Can we take a moment to look at the evidence behind those thoughts? How likely is it that your friends truly base their opinions on your grades?  

User: I guess I haven’t really thought about it that way. They’re my friends, and I believe they care more about who I am rather than my grades.  

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Sometimes, our minds convince us of worst-case scenarios that may not be true. What would it be like to challenge those thoughts? For instance, what if you considered that your self-worth isn’t tied to your academic performance?  

User: That makes sense. I’d like to believe that my value is not just based on my grades. But it’s hard to let go of that fear.  

Consultant: It’s quite normal to find it difficult. Just remember that changing how we think takes time. Could we perhaps create an alternative thought you can remind yourself of when those fears arise?  

User: Maybe I could say, “I’m doing my best, and my friends appreciate me for who I am.”  

Consultant: That’s a wonderful adjustment! When facing those anxious thoughts, that reminder could help you ground yourself. How do you feel about trying to practice that thought in your social interactions?  

User: I think I can try that. It seems like it might help ease my anxiety.  

Consultant: Great! Let's also brainstorm some strategies to help you prepare for those conversations about exams. What activities help you feel confident or relaxed?  

User: I enjoy reading and sometimes writing in my journal. It helps me process my thoughts.  

Consultant: Those are fantastic outlets! We can incorporate that. How about writing down your achievements, no matter how small, each week in your journal? This can help reinforce positive thinking about yourself.  

User: I like that idea! I often overlook my progress, so this might help me remember the good things I’ve done.  

Consultant: Absolutely! Celebrating small wins can build your confidence. Let’s also role-play a conversation where you discuss exams with friends while using your new thought. Are you comfortable trying that?  

User: Yes, I think that could be helpful!  

Consultant: Great! Picture a situation where your classmates are discussing grades. Let’s dive in—what would you say?  

User: I’d start by saying, “I had a tough time with the exams, but I’m focusing on improving.”  

Consultant: That’s a strong start! By opening up about your experience, you’re also inviting understanding from your friends. How might they respond?  

User: They might share their own struggles, and we could support each other.  

Consultant: Exactly! You’re creating a space for connection rather than isolation. How does that possibility feel to you?  

User: It makes me feel a bit lighter! I see that we’re all in this together.  

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Building connections can reduce your anxiety about exams and foster support among peers. Let’s wrap up today’s session. What are some key takeaways that you feel empowered to practice moving forward?  

User: I’ll start challenging my negative thoughts, practice my new thought, and write down my progress in my journal.  

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. I believe you can do this, and I'm here for you if you need more support.  

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today.  

Consultant: You're very welcome, Wang! I'm glad you feel supported. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang. I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! Honestly, I've been feeling very overwhelmed. My focus is really poor, and with finals coming up, I can’t shake off this feeling of anxiety. It’s been difficult to sit down and study.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling a lot of pressure, especially with your finals approaching. Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to study?

User: Sure. When I sit at my desk, I just keep thinking about how unprepared I am. My mind wanders, and I can't concentrate on anything. I also feel a sense of dread about my grades because I've already struggled this semester.

Consultant: I can imagine how that would be really frustrating for you. It seems like your worries about your grades are making it difficult to focus on your studies. If you could picture an ideal state where you feel more balanced and focused, what would that look like for you?

User: I guess I would feel calmer, able to organize my thoughts clearly, and actually make progress in my study sessions. Right now, it just feels like I’m stuck.

Consultant: That’s a great clarification. Feeling calm and making progress are positive goals. Let’s discuss some specific strategies that might help improve your focus. Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that lead to distractions when you study?

User: Sometimes, I get distracted by my phone or feel hungry, which makes me want to take a break. Other times, I just feel overwhelmed by the amount of material I need to cover.

Consultant: Those distractions are very common, especially with so much on your plate. One approach we can try is to break your study material into smaller, manageable chunks. Would you be open to creating a study schedule that outlines what you'll focus on during each session?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful. But I’m worried about sticking to it. What if I can’t stay focused even with a plan?

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those worries at the beginning. One method we could use is the Pomodoro Technique, where you study for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. This can help maintain your focus without feeling overwhelmed. Would you be interested in trying this technique?

User: I think I could try that. The idea of short breaks sounds good. Sometimes I just need a little reset.

Consultant: Absolutely! During those 5-minute breaks, you could stretch or take deep breaths to recharge. How do you feel about setting a specific study goal for this week using the Pomodoro Technique?

User: That could work. I guess I could aim to study at least 2 hours a day and test the Pomodoro method. I really hope this helps.

Consultant: That’s a great plan, Wang. Setting a clear goal can help take away some of that anxiety. Remember, it’s okay if things don’t go perfectly; the aim is to make progress. After trying this technique, we can review how it went next time. How does that sound?

User: It sounds good. I feel a bit relieved just talking about it and having a plan. But what if I feel anxious during those study sessions?

Consultant: If you feel anxiety creeping in, it can be helpful to pause and check in with yourself. Ask, "What am I feeling right now? What thoughts are causing this anxiety?" Often, just acknowledging those feelings can be beneficial. Would you like to practice that now as a quick exercise?

User: Yes, I’d be willing to try that. It might help me to actually recognize what I’m feeling in the moment.

Consultant: Great! Let’s say you sit down to study and start feeling anxious. Take a moment to pause. What thoughts might be going through your mind at that point?

User: I’d probably think something like, "I’ll never finish this," or "I’m going to fail." 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite intense. If a friend were in your shoes, facing those same thoughts, what would you advise them to do?

User: I’d probably tell them to take a break and remember that it's okay to struggle sometimes. But when it comes to myself, I find it hard to follow that advice.

Consultant: That’s a common experience. It’s often easier to support others than ourselves. Perhaps, when those thoughts come up, you can remind yourself to treat yourself with the same kindness you would offer a friend. Would that be something you could try?

User: Yes, I like that idea. It feels more comforting than being hard on myself all the time. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Self-compassion can be a powerful tool. As we work towards your goals, we can explore more strategies to help you manage that anxiety about studying. Is there anything else on your mind that you’d like to discuss today? 

User: I think I'm good for now. My main concern is just making it through the finals and figuring out what to do after graduation.

Consultant: That's completely understandable. We can certainly work on strategies for managing your anxiety about finals as well as starting to think about your career options. In our next session, we can shift some focus toward your interests and aspirations post-graduation. How does that sound?

User: That sounds perfect! I appreciate your help and understanding. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Wang. It's been a pleasure working with you today. Let's check in on your progress with the study techniques and talk more about your future in our next session. Remember, you're not alone in this journey, and we can tackle it together.

User: Thank you! I feel a little more hopeful already. Looking forward to our next chat. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Take care, Wang, and I hope you have a productive week ahead.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad to see you for our session today. How are you feeling as we begin?

User: Hi. I've been thinking a lot about my future and career after attending that lecture on career planning. It made me feel a bit more hopeful, but I still have a lot of uncertainty.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling a bit more hopeful. Career planning can indeed bring up many thoughts and emotions. Can you share with me what specifically stood out to you during the lecture?

User: The speaker emphasized how important it is to align your career with your interests and skills. It got me to reflect a bit on what I really enjoy and what I'm good at, but I'm still unsure about how to make that connection.

Consultant: That sounds like a meaningful insight. Recognizing your interests and skills is a crucial step. As we talk today, let's explore what those interests are and how they might relate to your desired career path. What are some things you enjoy doing, either academically or personally?

User: Well, I really enjoy reading and analyzing literature. I also like writing, but I’m not sure how that translates into a career. It all feels a bit overwhelming.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when considering how your passions can turn into a career. Let’s break it down. Writing and literature open up various career options. Have you thought about careers that might incorporate those skills?

User: I’ve considered publishing or maybe working in education, but I worry about job stability and whether I can actually find a job in those fields.

Consultant: It's natural to have those worries, especially given the job market concerns. Let's take a moment to assess the strengths you bring to those fields. What skills do you believe you possess that would make you a good fit for a career in publishing or education?

User: I think I’m pretty detail-oriented and have a good grasp of literary analysis. I also enjoy helping others understand literature, so teaching could be rewarding in that sense.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strengths! Detail-oriented and analytical skills are highly valued in both publishing and education. It sounds like you have a foundation to build upon. Would it help to explore potential pathways or opportunities related to those fields?

User: Yes, that could help. I just don’t know where to even start looking.

Consultant: A good starting point could be researching internships or volunteer opportunities related to both publishing and teaching. These experiences can provide practical insight and connections while easing some anxiety about entering the job market. How does that sound to you?

User: That makes sense. I think getting some experience would really help me feel more confident.

Consultant: Absolutely! Gaining experience can indeed be a significant confidence booster. You can also make connections and learn more about the day-to-day realities of those jobs. What do you think you could do this week to begin your research?

User: Maybe I could look up internships available at local publishing houses or see if there are tutoring opportunities at nearby schools. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Taking small steps can make a big difference in how you feel about your future. Do you think you could set a goal to explore at least one of those options by our next session?

User: I can do that! I'll aim to find at least one opportunity to apply for. I think it will help me feel more in control of my situation.

Consultant: That's a fantastic goal, Wang! Taking control is an empowering step towards overcoming your uncertainties. How do you feel about the progress you're making in addressing your fears about future job prospects?

User: I feel more motivated now. Talking about it helps me organize my thoughts, and I’m excited to see what I can find.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Engaging in this exploration can indeed help clarify your goals and reduce anxiety. Are there any other aspects regarding your career that you’d like to discuss today?

User: I guess I’m also worried about the pressure to succeed right after graduation. 

Consultant: That pressure is valid and common among many students. It can often lead to anxiety. Let’s talk about realistic expectations for yourself as you transition after graduation. What do you feel is a reasonable timeline for finding a job after you graduate?

User: I think I’d like to have a job lined up within a few months, but I sometimes worry if that’s too ambitious.

Consultant: A few months is a fair goal, but it’s also good to remain flexible. Careers don’t always follow a strict timeline, and sometimes it takes time to find the right fit. Would you find it helpful to create a plan for your job search that includes networking, skill-building, and self-care?

User: Yes, I think that sounds very helpful! Balancing all of it seems important, especially since I know I need to take care of my mental health.

Consultant: Absolutely! Prioritizing your mental health is key to thriving through this transition. We can work together to design that plan. Perhaps we can include specific timeframes for networking, skills development, and also scheduling regular self-care moments. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I need to ensure I’m not overwhelmed with everything.

Consultant: Perfect! Little by little, you can build your pathway while ensuring you take care of yourself. As we wrap up today, what is one thing you feel proud of achieving in this session?

User: I feel proud that I’m willing to take that first step in finding an internship. It's a relief to share my thoughts with you.

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement! Taking that first step is often the hardest part, but you've done it. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Remember, you’re capable of managing the challenges ahead. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I feel more at ease now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Wang! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. Keep that motivation high, and I look forward to our next session together. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad you're here for today's session. I notice you’ve been feeling more comfortable in social situations lately. Can you share some of your recent experiences?

User: Hi! Yes, I’ve joined a couple of clubs at school, and it’s been really nice. I feel more confident when interacting with others. But there are still moments when I get anxious about my studies and the upcoming exams.

Consultant: It sounds like you've made some positive strides in your social life, which is great to hear! On the other hand, it's understandable that academic stress is still lingering. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that come to mind when you think about your studies and exams?

User: Well, every time I sit down to study, I feel this pressure to perform well. I keep thinking about how I struggled in my last exams and what that means for my future. I worry that I might not find a good job if I don’t do well.

Consultant: It seems that this fear about your future is weighing heavily on you. Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. What kind of feelings do those thoughts bring up for you when you think about your performance?

User: I feel anxious and sometimes even a bit hopeless. It’s hard to focus on studying because I get distracted by these worries. It feels like I’m in a cycle of negative thinking.

Consultant: That can be a tough cycle to break, and you’re not alone in feeling this way. Let’s take a moment to explore those thoughts you mentioned. When you think about not performing well in exams, do you notice if they are extreme or perhaps not entirely realistic?

User: Definitely! I tend to think that if I don’t do well in my exams, I’ll be a failure, and then I won’t be able to find a good job. But I know deep down that it’s not the end of the world if I don’t get perfect grades.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight, Wang. Recognizing that your thoughts may not always reflect reality is an important step. If a friend were in your situation, how would you advise them to view their exam performance?

User: I would probably tell them that grades don’t define their worth and that there are always other opportunities in life. I would encourage them to focus on what they can do now instead of stressing over the past.

Consultant: That’s a wise approach! Let’s try to apply that same perspective to your own situation. What if you were to reframe your worries about exams into something more manageable? How could you shift your focus from fear to action?

User: I guess I could make a structured study plan and focus on preparing one step at a time, rather than thinking about the whole exam as a huge threat.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Breaking things down into smaller parts can help reduce that overwhelming feeling. What steps do you think you could take to create that study plan?

User: I could set aside specific times for each subject and include short breaks in between. Maybe I could also find a study buddy to stay motivated and focused.

Consultant: Great ideas! Having a study buddy can add a layer of accountability and support, which is really beneficial. How does this approach make you feel about your upcoming exams?

User: I feel a little less anxious when I think about studying this way. It seems more doable now. I think focusing on socializing and maintaining those connections will help too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Balancing social activities with your study plan can help you maintain your well-being. As you engage with others and build your support system, how do you think that will impact your academic pressures?

User: I think it will help reduce my stress because I won’t feel so isolated. Having someone to talk to about both studies and social activities feels really comforting.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization, Wang. Maintaining those social connections can provide emotional support when things get challenging. As we prepare for our next steps, can you think of specific social activities that you could engage in to keep that balance?

User: I want to attend more club meetings and maybe organize some study groups with friends. It would be nice to have that mix of both study and social time.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic way to combine academic support with social interaction. Let’s also look back at our progress today. What do you feel has been your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think I’ve realized that I can change my perspective on studying and grades. And it’s important to keep building those social connections for support. 

Consultant: That’s a significant insight! Remember, you have the tools to adjust your thinking and maintain those connections. As we wrap up today's session, what strategies will you take with you to help manage your anxiety in the upcoming weeks?

User: I’ll focus on creating a structured study plan, keep engaging with my clubs, and remind myself that my worth isn’t defined by my grades. 

Consultant: Those are empowering strategies, Wang. It sounds like you're on the right track. I believe you’ll find a balance that works for you. If you find yourself needing support, don’t hesitate to reach out. You've made excellent progress, and I'm proud of you. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful now. I appreciate your help!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I’m glad we could meet today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel like I’ve regained some confidence. I’ve been able to adjust my study routine a bit, but I still worry about my exams coming up.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’ve regained some confidence and found a rhythm in your studies. Let's explore those worries about the upcoming exams. What specifically are you feeling anxious about?

User: I guess I'm worried that I’ll fail again, especially since I didn’t do well on my last mid-term. I feel like everyone around me is doing better.

Consultant: That sounds challenging, feeling a bit behind compared to others. What thoughts come to your mind when you think about not doing well on the exams?

User: I keep thinking that if I don’t succeed, I won’t be able to find a good job after graduation. It really stresses me out.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It sounds like the pressure to succeed is really weighing on you. Let’s take a moment to reflect—do you think this thought of not finding a good job if you don’t do well holds any evidence or might it be a bit extreme?

User: I suppose it's extreme. I mean, I know it’s not the end of the world if I don’t do perfectly, but it just feels that way sometimes.

Consultant: It’s good that you can recognize that. If a friend were in your position, what advice would you give them about these thoughts?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on what they can control and to try their best, rather than worry about the worst outcomes.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on what you can control is a healthy perspective. Now that we’re discussing strategies, what are some actions you can take to help you focus better and alleviate some of this anxiety about exams?

User: I think making a study schedule could help. Also, maybe taking breaks when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Structuring your study sessions with breaks can greatly improve retention and reduce stress. How can you ensure that you stick to this schedule?

User: I could set reminders on my phone or ask a friend to check in on me.

Consultant: Fantastic! Having reminders and support from friends can keep you motivated. Is there anything else you think might help you cope with stress as the exams approach?

User: Maybe practicing some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing. I’ve heard that can help.

Consultant: Yes! Deep breathing is an excellent technique. Would you like to practice some techniques together now?

User: Sure, I’d like that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment. Breathe in slowly through your nose for a count of four… hold it for a moment… and now breathe out through your mouth for a count of four. How do you feel after that?

User: I feel a bit more relaxed, actually. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Incorporating techniques like this into your study routine can be really beneficial. As we approach the end of our session, let’s summarize the strategies we’ve discussed today. What do you think your main takeaways are?

User: I think I’ll focus on my study schedule, take breaks, and practice deep breathing when I feel anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, it’s important to be kind to yourself during this challenging time. You’ve come a long way. How confident do you feel about implementing these strategies for your upcoming exams?

User: I feel more confident now that I have a plan. Thank you!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I believe in your ability to manage your emotions and prepare for your exams. As we conclude today’s session, remember to utilize these strategies, and if you need further support, feel free to reach out. You’re not alone in this.

User: I appreciate that. I’ll definitely keep in touch if I need anything. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Wang. Take care, and best of luck with your studies. You’ve got this!
