Consultant: Hello, Zhang! It's great to see you today. I understand that you've been feeling very anxious about speaking in public since you started your university experience. Can you tell me more about how this makes you feel?

User: Hi! Yes, I really struggle when I have to speak in front of others. I've been feeling extremely tense and worried that I will mess up and get criticized by my classmates and teachers. It's like I've lost confidence in my abilities to communicate.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, especially since you're in a new environment with more visibility. It’s understandable to feel this way. Let's explore your thoughts during those moments. What are some thoughts that come to your mind just before you have to speak?

User: I often think about how everyone will judge me if I make a mistake. It feels like all eyes are on me, and I can't shake off the fear of embarrassing myself.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel pressure in those situations. Judging by your thoughts, it seems like a lot is at stake for you. Can you identify how those thoughts affect your emotions before and during your speeches?

User: Yes, when I think like that, I feel really anxious and my heart races. Sometimes, I just want to avoid speaking altogether, but I know that's not a solution.

Consultant: It sounds like avoidance might seem like a temporary relief, but it also contributes to your fears. You mentioned that your heart races—could you describe what other physical sensations accompany this anxiety?

User: I also feel a tightness in my chest and my palms get sweaty. It’s almost like my body is preparing for something bad to happen.

Consultant: Those physical sensations are common responses to anxiety and can make the situation feel even more daunting. What if we worked on recognizing these sensations as just your body's way of reacting to stress, rather than a sign that something terrible is going to happen?

User: That sounds interesting, but I still find it hard to believe that I won't embarrass myself.

Consultant: Let’s challenge that belief together. Can you think of a time when you spoke in public and the outcome wasn’t as bad as you feared? What happened then?

User: There was a time in high school when I had to present a project. I thought I'd mess up, but in the end, my classmates actually seemed engaged, and I got some positive feedback.

Consultant: That’s a valuable experience to reflect on! It shows that your fears aren’t always accurate. What if we used that memory as a starting point to form a more positive belief about your public speaking abilities?

User: I guess that would help. But what if I still feel nervous next time?

Consultant: That’s completely normal! Feeling nervous doesn’t have to stop you from speaking. We can also practice relaxation techniques together to help manage those feelings. Would you be open to trying some of those?

User: Yes, I would be willing to try some relaxation techniques. 

Consultant: Great! One effective technique is deep breathing. You can practice inhaling deeply through your nose for a count of four, holding it for a count of four, and then exhaling slowly for a count of four. Would you like to give that a shot now?

User: Okay, I’ll try that. 

Consultant: How did that feel for you? 

User: I felt a little calmer after just a few breaths. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Practicing this technique regularly can help reduce tension. We can also work on gradual exposure. How would you feel about starting with smaller groups to practice speaking?

User: Starting small sounds more manageable for me. I feel less pressure in smaller settings.

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s set a goal for you to speak in front of a small group of friends or classmates about something you enjoy. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds doable. I think talking about a topic I love will make it easier.

Consultant: I’m glad you feel that way! After practicing, we can discuss how it went and how you felt during the experience. This will help us gradually build your confidence.

User: I’m a bit nervous, but I feel excited about the idea of trying this.

Consultant: It’s normal to have mixed feelings, but taking this step is important for your growth. Remember, every experience is a chance to learn. Let’s review your progress after your first attempt, okay?

User: Yes, that sounds good. 

Consultant: Perfect! It’s been great working together on these strategies, Zhang. Just remember that it’s a process. If you ever feel stuck or overwhelmed, I’m here to help you through it. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm confident that with practice and the right mindset, you’ll improve. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time we meet. 

User: Me too, I’ll try my best!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Until next time, take care and practice those breathing techniques.

User: I will. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today’s session. I want to start by understanding how you've been feeling since we last spoke. Can you tell me about any recent experiences that have been on your mind?

User: Hi. I’ve been really anxious, especially after the group presentation in class. I felt like I couldn’t express myself properly and ended up stumbling over my words. It was so embarrassing, and now I'm doubting my ability to speak in front of others.

Consultant: I can see that this experience has left you feeling quite defeated and anxious, especially regarding your public speaking abilities. What specifically about that experience made you doubt yourself?

User: I just felt so pressured. I thought I prepared well, but when it was my turn, my mind went blank, and I kept losing my train of thought. I’m worried I’ll mess up again next time.

Consultant: That sounds really frustrating. It's understandable to feel anxious after a negative experience like that. Let’s explore what was going through your mind during that presentation. Can you recall any specific thoughts that came to you at that moment?

User: I remember thinking, “Everyone is judging me,” and “What if I embarrass myself again?” Those thoughts made me even more nervous.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite powerful in influencing your feelings of anxiety. Recognizing that you felt everyone was judging you is important. Do you think there’s any evidence to support that everyone was actually judging you in that moment?

User: I don’t know, maybe not everyone was judging me… but it felt that way. I just got so caught up in my fears.

Consultant: It’s common to get caught up in those feelings; they can feel all-consuming. What if you reframed those thoughts? For example, instead of thinking, “Everyone is judging me,” could we consider a more balanced perspective, like “Some people might be focused on their own presentations”? 

User: That's a good point. I guess I didn’t think of it that way. Everyone has their own worries, right?

Consultant: Exactly! Shifting your focus to the fact that everyone has their own challenges can help ease that pressure. Now, how about we think together about how to build your confidence for the next presentation? What steps do you think would help?

User: Maybe I could practice more in front of friends or family. That might help me get used to speaking in front of people.

Consultant: Practicing in front of supportive people is a fantastic idea! It could help you familiarize yourself with speaking out loud and build your confidence. What kind of situations can you set up to practice?

User: I could ask some friends to help me rehearse my next presentation, or even just talk about topics I’m comfortable with to get used to speaking.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Rehearsing with friends can definitely make you feel less anxious when it’s your turn to present. How do you feel about setting up that kind of practice soon?

User: I think I can do that. It might actually relieve some of my anxiety if I can get in some practice beforehand.

Consultant: Absolutely! Building that familiarity will help you feel more at ease. Let's also think about ways to manage your anxiety just before and during your presentation. What do you currently do when you feel anxious?

User: Usually, I just try to breathe slowly, but it’s hard to stay calm when I’m nervous.

Consultant: Breathing slowly is a great start. We can also explore other techniques, like positive affirmations or visualization. Have you ever tried visualizing yourself succeeding before you speak?

User: No, I haven't tried that. I usually just focus on my fear.

Consultant: Visualizing success can be a powerful tool. Imagine yourself confidently giving your presentation, feeling calm and composed. How do you think that might affect your anxiety levels going into your next presentation?

User: It sounds like it could really help to think positively for a change instead of just worrying. 

Consultant: It certainly can! Preparing mentally can create a more positive mindset. We can incorporate these visualizations into your practice sessions. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good. I’ll give it a try. 

Consultant: Great! As we work on this, it's important to acknowledge any progress you make, no matter how small. Can you think of one step you’ve taken recently that reflects your efforts in handling this situation?

User: Well, I did talk to my friends about how I’ve been feeling. Just sharing that felt like a relief.

Consultant: That's a wonderful step! Acknowledging your feelings and sharing them with others is a big move towards building your support network. How do you feel after taking that step?

User: I feel a bit lighter, honestly. Talking about it made me realize I wasn’t alone in feeling this way.

Consultant: That’s so important! Connection with others can greatly alleviate feelings of isolation. Moving forward, let’s set some clear goals for your upcoming presentation. What’s one specific goal you’d like to achieve?

User: I’d like to make it through my presentation without feeling completely panicked and maybe even enjoy it a little.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic goal! Enjoying the process is key. As you prepare, remember to celebrate your progression and be gentle with yourself. We can review your strategies in our next session. How are you feeling about the progress we’ve made today?

User: I actually feel more hopeful than when we started. I have some concrete steps to work on now!

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’re taking important steps toward overcoming your fears, and I believe in your ability to improve with practice. Remember, I’m here to support you along the way.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to our next session to hear about your progress. Just take it one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything before then. 

User: I will. Thanks again!

Consultant: Until next time, take care and keep practicing those strategies!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been practicing my speeches more, and it feels like my anxiety has lessened a bit, but I still struggle a lot when facing a real audience.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you’ve been practicing! While your anxiety seems to have decreased, it sounds like facing a real audience still feels challenging. Can you describe what specifically makes you feel anxious in those situations?

User: I think it's mostly the fear of being judged. I worry that I will forget my words or that I won’t express myself clearly.

Consultant: That fear of judgment is very common, especially in public speaking. Let's explore that feeling a little more. When you think about forgetting your words, what thoughts come to your mind at that moment?

User: I usually think that everyone will notice my mistakes and that they'll think I'm incompetent. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough to deal with. It’s important to recognize how these thoughts affect your feelings. How do you feel emotionally when you focus on that fear of being judged?

User: I feel embarrassed and anxious, like I want to just disappear. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Can we take a moment to challenge those thoughts? What evidence do you have that people will judge you harshly if you make a mistake?

User: I guess I don’t have any solid evidence. I just assume that people will react negatively.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! Sometimes, our assumptions can be more powerful than reality. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about the possibility of making mistakes?

User: I would probably say that everyone makes mistakes and that it's okay. It doesn’t define their abilities.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about the bigger picture. Everyone has off moments, and it doesn’t mean they are incompetent. Let’s talk about how we can reframe that thought. What if you viewed mistakes as learning opportunities?

User: I think that sounds more positive, but it's tough to adopt that mindset in the moment.

Consultant: It certainly can be challenging! One strategy we can work on is using mindfulness techniques. When you feel that anxiety rising, you can practice deep breathing to center yourself. Would you be open to trying some breathing exercises together now?

User: Sure, I’m open to that. 

Consultant: Great! Let's take a deep breath in for a count of four... hold it for four... and now exhale for a count of four. How does that make you feel?

User: It feels calming, but I still worry about what might happen during an actual speech.

Consultant: That’s completely normal. We can't predict the future, but we can prepare ourselves to handle those feelings. Would you like to set a small goal for your next practice, perhaps including an unexpected element that might occur?

User: Yes, maybe I could ask a friend to challenge me with random questions while I practice. That might simulate an audience interaction.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Doing that will help you get more comfortable with unpredictability. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited to see how I handle it. 

Consultant: That’s a great attitude! Feeling a mix of emotions is part of the process. Remember, each small step you take builds your confidence. How would you like me to support you when it comes to handling those unexpected moments?

User: Maybe you could help me think of some strategies to respond to unexpected questions or interruptions during my speech.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can work together on some practice responses to common questions. Let's also remember to celebrate your progress along the way. How have you noticed your responses changing each time?

User: I think I've started to be more self-aware during my practice, which helps me stay focused rather than completely panicking.

Consultant: That’s a significant improvement! Self-awareness is key in managing anxiety. Let’s keep building on that. Perhaps next week we can review your progress with that exercise with your friend, and we can refine our strategies together.

User: That sounds good! I'm looking forward to it.

Consultant: I'm looking forward to it as well! As we wrap up our session today, what’s one takeaway you want to remember for next time?

User: I want to remember that mistakes are okay and that I can deal with unexpected things as they come.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway, Zhang! Remember, you’re doing great work in building your confidence and skills. Keep practicing, and we’ll continue moving forward together. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here anytime you need. Have a great week, and I’ll see you in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you for today's session. I want to start by acknowledging your recent experience with the debate competition. How are you feeling about it now?

User: Hi! Thank you. I feel a bit proud for completing my speech, but I’m still grappling with the anxiety that comes before speaking in public. It's a mixed bag of emotions.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel both pride and anxiety after such an experience. Let’s discuss how you felt before and after the debate. What were some of the thoughts racing through your mind when you initially felt anxious?

User: I kept thinking that I would mess up or that everyone would judge me harshly. It was overwhelming. But after speaking, my team cheered me on, which felt reassuring.

Consultant: It sounds like those judgments created a lot of pressure. During the debate, were there any particular thoughts that helped you push through that anxiety and complete your speech?

User: I tried to remind myself that I had prepared well and that it was okay to make mistakes. It helped a bit, but I still felt really nervous.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy—focusing on preparation can really help ease anxiety. Can you recall what specific thoughts or affirmations were most helpful for you during your speech?

User: I kept telling myself, "You've practiced this. Just do your best." Also, thinking about my teammates waiting for my turn helped me stay focused.

Consultant: Those positive affirmations are valuable tools. Let's take a moment to examine any negative thoughts you may have had during that time. Were there any cognitive distortions, like catastrophizing or all-or-nothing thinking, that you noticed?

User: Yes, definitely! I felt like if I didn’t perform perfectly, it would ruin everything, which is kind of an extreme way to think about it. 

Consultant: It’s insightful that you recognize that thought. Challenging that belief might be beneficial for your growth. What evidence do you think you have that supports a more balanced view, where it’s okay not to be perfect?

User: Well, I did complete my speech, and my teammates praised me afterward. They reminded me that what matters most is trying my best and learning from each experience.

Consultant: That’s a more constructive perspective! If a friend was feeling as you did before the speech, what advice would you give them?

User: I would tell them to focus on the effort rather than the outcome and that everyone makes mistakes. It’s the experience that counts.

Consultant: That’s wonderful advice! It shows that you understand the importance of self-compassion. Now let’s talk about how we can reinforce these positive feelings and minimize the anxiety for future speaking opportunities. What are some small goals you could set for yourself?

User: Maybe I could practice speaking in front of a small group of friends next time or even try doing a short presentation in one of my classes.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent goals! They gradually expose you to speaking in public with supportive people around you. How might you feel after accomplishing these small speaking engagements?

User: I think it would help build my confidence more. Plus, having positive experiences could reduce the anxiety over time, right?

Consultant: Exactly! Positive experiences can create a strong foundation for your confidence. After each engagement, how about taking a moment to reflect on what went well, no matter how small?

User: I like that idea! It would help me see my progress and reinforce my efforts.

Consultant: That’s great! Celebrating those small victories can have a big impact on your self-esteem. As we approach the end of our session, can you summarize what you feel are the most important takeaways from our discussion?

User: I’ve realized that it's okay to feel anxious, and that focusing on preparation and effort helps. Also, setting small goals will help me grow my confidence and improve my skills gradually.

Consultant: You've made fantastic insights today! As you move forward, remember to celebrate every achievement, and be kind to yourself in the process. Are you feeling optimistic about tackling future speaking opportunities?

User: Yes, I am! I feel more equipped and motivated to face my fears. Thank you for your support!

Consultant: I'm delighted to hear that! Remember, maintaining a positive mindset and celebrating your progress will be key. This concludes our session, but if you have any further concerns or need support in the future, feel free to reach out.

User: Thank you! I appreciate the encouragement and guidance. I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad you're here today. It sounds like you've made some significant progress with your public speaking. How are you feeling about it lately?

User: Hi! I feel pretty satisfied with how I managed to express myself during the class presentation. It was nerve-wracking at first, but I enjoyed it in the end. Now I'm actually looking forward to more speaking opportunities.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It seems like you've experienced a shift in your feelings towards public speaking. Can you tell me more about what made you feel more comfortable during your presentation?

User: I think as I started speaking, I realized I was connecting with my classmates. Their reactions helped me relax, and I stopped worrying so much about my anxiety.

Consultant: It's great that you found that connection! It sounds like engaging with your audience helped ease your anxiety. How do you think you could use that experience to prepare for future speaking opportunities?

User: I suppose I could remind myself of that connection and how it felt to be in the moment. Perhaps rehearsing in front of friends would help too.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Rehearsing with friends could provide you with a supportive environment. How do you feel about practicing your speech in front of others again?

User: I think it would be good. I just need to remind myself not to focus too much on the idea of being perfect.

Consultant: Absolutely, focusing on connection over perfection can shift your experience. Can you describe how you can practice positive self-talk before facing a speaking situation?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that I can learn from them. Positive affirmations like "I can do this" might help as well.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Positive affirmations can build your confidence. What specific affirmations do you think you'll use?

User: I might use "I've prepared well, and I'm capable of engaging my audience" or something similar.

Consultant: Those affirmations are very encouraging! Let’s think of potential scenarios where you might feel anxious again—like being in a larger group. How do you envision handling that situation with your new strategies?

User: If I'm in a larger group, I think I could use a grounding technique, like deep breathing, to calm myself. Then, I could focus on my affirmations to prepare mentally.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a fantastic way to manage anxiety! Would you like to practice that technique together right now?

User: Sure! That sounds helpful.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in together… and now slowly breathe out. How does that feel?

User: It feels relaxing, actually. I can see how this would help before speaking.

Consultant: Absolutely! Incorporating breath work can help clear your mind. As you prepare for your next speaking opportunity, how will you integrate these techniques into your practice session?

User: I think I’ll start with some deep breaths, say my affirmations, and then dive into my practice. It sounds manageable!

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. It’s fantastic to see your confidence growing. Have you thought about any specific speaking opportunities you'd like to pursue next?

User: I’m considering volunteering for another class presentation or perhaps even participating in a debate club. 

Consultant: Those are exciting prospects! Participating in a debate club could be a great way to further develop your skills. How do you feel about the idea of joining a debate club?

User: I feel a bit intimidated, but I'm also curious to see how I would handle it.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel a mix of excitement and anxiety about new challenges. What would you need to feel more prepared for that potential new adventure?

User: I think having some preparation material and perhaps support from friends would help me feel ready.

Consultant: Preparation and support can definitely bolster your confidence. Who do you think could be your best supporters in this journey?

User: My classmates who are supportive, and I could always rely on my friends as well.

Consultant: That sounds like a strong support system. Do you feel ready to reach out to them for encouragement as you take on these new challenges?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. It feels good to know I have a support system.

Consultant: That’s an excellent realization! Having supportive people around you can make a significant difference. Looking forward, how do you plan to continue reinforcing your progress with public speaking?

User: I’ll keep practicing, using my techniques, and seeking feedback after each opportunity to improve.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! Reflecting on your experiences and feedback can enhance your growth. As we wrap up today, what are your main takeaways from our session?

User: I’ve learned the importance of positive self-talk, grounding techniques, and the value of support from friends. I feel more prepared for future challenges.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You've made impressive strides, and I'm confident you'll continue to grow. Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s okay to take it step by step. If you ever need to talk again, I’ll be here to support you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance. I’ll definitely reach out if I need to.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhang! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! It's great to see you again. I'm looking forward to our session today. How have you been feeling about your recent progress in public speaking?

User: Hi! I've been feeling more confident lately. I actually enjoyed being selected as the representative for our new project. It’s a big step for me, but I still feel a bit nervous sometimes.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're making significant strides in your confidence. What aspects of being chosen as a representative excited you the most?

User: I think it was mainly the recognition from my classmates. I didn't expect to be put in that position, so it made me feel validated. But I also worry about how I’ll perform during the actual presentation.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a mix of excitement and concern in this situation. Let’s explore your worries a bit more—what specific thoughts come to mind when you think about the upcoming presentation?

User: I keep thinking that I might forget what to say or not be clear enough. Sometimes, I even imagine classmates judging me if I stumble over my words.

Consultant: I understand those thoughts can be really unsettling. It's important to recognize how valid they feel to you. When you think about forgetting your lines or being judged, how does that make you feel emotionally?

User: It makes me feel anxious and a bit defeated, like maybe I’m not good enough for this role. 

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Zhang. It’s tough when our mind generates these negative thoughts. Let’s try to challenge those worries together. Can you think of any evidence that supports or contradicts those worries?

User: Well, during our practice sessions, I did really well and received positive feedback from my peers. It was a surprise to me, actually, but it felt good.

Consultant: That’s an excellent point! You have a record of performing well in practice. Perhaps there’s a possibility that the actual presentation could go similarly well? 

User: Yes, I can see that. But what if the actual environment is different, and I freeze up?

Consultant: It's understandable to worry about different situations. Let's consider what you could do to prepare yourself for that. What strategies have helped you succeed during your practice sessions?

User: I usually take deep breaths before speaking, and that seems to help calm my nerves. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic technique! Breathing exercises can be very effective. How about we brainstorm some additional techniques you can use during the presentation to further support yourself and build your confidence?

User: Sure! Maybe I could visualize my success beforehand or even memorize small key points to stay on track.

Consultant: Great ideas! Visualizing success can help reinforce a positive mindset. Memorizing key points is also useful to minimize anxiety. Have you thought about practicing your presentation in front of a friendly audience to build further confidence?

User: I haven’t yet, but I think that could help a lot! Practicing in front of friends might ease my nerves.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing with supportive peers can create a more relaxed environment. How do you feel about setting a date to do that before the actual presentation?

User: That sounds like a good plan! I’d feel more prepared with that extra practice.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let’s also ensure you consider the positive feedback and progress you’ve made, rather than focusing solely on potential pitfalls. Moving forward, how can you remind yourself of your achievements when feeling anxious?

User: I could keep a journal detailing my progress and the feedback I’ve received. That might help remind me of how far I’ve come.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Reflecting on your successes can bolster your confidence. As we summarize our session, what would you say is your biggest takeaway today?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is that I have skills and techniques to manage my anxiety, and that I can prepare myself to feel more comfortable with upcoming opportunities.

Consultant: Exactly! You've cultivated valuable skills already, and it's inspiring to see your growth. Moving forward, remember to celebrate your successes, big or small. How do you plan to continue practicing and utilizing what you've learned?

User: I want to start practicing with friends and keep a journal to track my progress. I think those will really help build my confidence.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan, Zhang! I have no doubt you’ll keep progressing. If challenges arise, remember the techniques and strategies we discussed. This will be our last session for now, but if you ever feel the need for support in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate all your guidance. It has truly helped me.

Consultant: You're very welcome! You've worked hard, and I'm proud of your achievements. Take care, and I wish you all the best in your upcoming presentation. Remember, you’ve got this!
