Consultant: Hello there! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed. My mom is really upset about my recent test scores, and it's hard not to think about it when I'm in class. 

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like your mom's reactions are weighing heavily on you, especially when you try to focus in class. Can you tell me more about what you feel when you think about her disappointment?

User: I just feel really sad and confused. I try to pay attention, but I keep worrying about how she's going to react next. 

Consultant: That sounds tough. Worrying about her reaction can certainly distract you from your studies. What do you think is the main thing that pulls your attention away during class?

User: Sometimes it's just thoughts about my mom's expectations. Other times, I get distracted by my classmates or things outside the window. 

Consultant: It seems like there are a few different things competing for your attention. Let's focus on your thoughts about your mom for a moment. What kinds of thoughts come to mind regarding her expectations during class?

User: I think about how she wants me to get good grades and how disappointed she'll be if I don't. It makes me nervous. 

Consultant: It's understandable to feel nervous when you have those thoughts. Can we explore how those thoughts impact your feelings during class? 

User: When I think about her being disappointed, I feel more anxious and then I can't concentrate on what the teacher is saying. 

Consultant: So, it seems like those thoughts are contributing to your anxiety and affecting your focus. Have you noticed any specific moments in class when this happens the most?

User: I usually feel this way during tests or when the teacher is asking questions. I worry I'll be called on and not know the answer. 

Consultant: That makes sense. Test time and participation can be particularly stressful. How do you usually prepare for tests? 

User: I try to study, but I get really distracted and then don’t feel ready. 

Consultant: It’s common to feel that way when distractions come into play. What if we worked on some strategies to help you prepare and stay focused? 

User: I would like that. I really want to do better and not let my mom down. 

Consultant: That's a great intention! We can create a plan together that allows you to manage distractions and study effectively. Would you like to share what usually helps you concentrate best while studying?

User: I like when it’s quiet, and I can have everything I need in front of me. 

Consultant: Creating a quiet study environment sounds like a strong strategy. Maybe we can also set small goals for each study session to help keep you focused. How does that sound? 

User: That sounds good. I think setting small goals would help me feel less overwhelmed. 

Consultant: Wonderful! We can start by choosing a specific topic to focus on for your next study session. What subject do you think you’d like to begin with?

User: I want to improve in math because that’s what my mom cares about the most. 

Consultant: Focusing on math is a great idea. How about we set a goal to review a specific topic each time you study? 

User: Yes, I can try that! Maybe I can also keep track of my progress, so I can show my mom I've been working hard.

Consultant: Keeping track of your progress sounds very motivating! This way, you can also show your mom how much effort you’re putting in, which may help reduce your anxiety about her reactions. 

User: I hope so. But I still feel a little unsure about whether I can improve. 

Consultant: It’s okay to feel unsure, especially when you’re working towards a goal. What do you think might help you feel more confident in your abilities?

User: I guess if I can see improvements in my grades, I might feel better about myself. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Seeing progress can really boost your confidence. Remember, it's a process, and every small improvement counts. 

User: That's true. I’ve just been feeling so pressured to be perfect all the time. 

Consultant: Perfection can be a heavy burden to carry. It's important to remember that learning is a journey, and mistakes are part of it. What if we try to reframe the way you view mistakes? 

User: I think I can try to see them as opportunities to learn rather than failures. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! Embracing mistakes can help you to feel less pressure and more willing to try. 

User: Yeah, I feel a little better thinking about it that way. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we work together, keep in mind that you’re developing new skills and strategies to face challenges. 

User: I will keep that in mind. Thank you for your help. 

Consultant: Of course! It's great to see your progress today. Let’s recap what we discussed and the steps we’ll take moving forward. 

User: Okay, that sounds good. 

Consultant: We’re focusing on setting small study goals, creating a quiet space for studying, tracking your progress, and shifting your perspective on mistakes. Sound good to you?

User: Yes, that sounds really helpful.  

Consultant: I’m confident you can develop your skills. Remember, I'm here to support you whenever you need. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel more hopeful now. 

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! You can do this, and I believe in you. If you face any challenges, just remind yourself of the strategies we discussed. You’ve got this!

Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling really stressed. My mother keeps saying I need to focus more in class, and it makes me doubt myself. 

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like your mother's comments have been weighing heavily on you, and you're starting to question your abilities. Can you tell me more about how that makes you feel?

User: It makes me anxious. I feel like no matter how hard I try, it’s just never enough. I really want to improve my focus, but I’m scared I won’t be able to.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel anxious when you’re under pressure. Wanting to improve is a good goal. Let's break this down together. What would improvement in focus look like for you?

User: I guess I’d like to be able to pay attention in class without getting distracted. And maybe finish my homework on time without my mom yelling at me.

Consultant: That sounds like a reasonable goal. You’re looking for less distraction and a smoother homework process. Let's take a moment to think about any specific situations where you notice yourself getting distracted. Can you recall a recent time?

User: Well, during lectures, I often find myself daydreaming. I don’t mean to, but my thoughts just drift away.

Consultant: Daydreaming can happen to many people. It's like your mind is looking for a break. When you notice this happening, what thoughts go through your mind that might be contributing to this distraction?

User: I often think that I’m never going to understand the lesson anyway, so why bother paying attention?

Consultant: That’s an important thought to recognize. You’re worried about understanding, which can lead to avoiding the lesson altogether. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them to keep trying and that it’s okay to ask for help.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective! You clearly have some understanding of how to encourage others. Let's apply that kindness to yourself. What if you rephrased your thought to something encouraging, like “I can take it step by step”?

User: That sounds better! It feels less overwhelming to say it that way.

Consultant: Exactly! Taking it step by step can make things feel more manageable. Can we try to practice using that kind of supportive self-talk when you start to feel anxious about your classes?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. It feels a bit more hopeful!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Li! Now, let’s step into some practical strategies. Are there activities you enjoy that help you feel more focused or engaged?

User: I like drawing, but sometimes I lose focus on that too if I don't know what to draw.

Consultant: Drawing can be a great escape! What if we established some scheduled drawing times? That could help you have a refreshing break yet still practice focusing for short periods. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I’d like to try that. 

Consultant: Great! Let's set a small goal for your drawing sessions. Would a 15-minute drawing break after 30 minutes of homework work? 

User: I think that might be manageable! 

Consultant: Perfect! And how about something else? During your classes, if you notice yourself starting to drift, what’s one action you could take to help bring your attention back?

User: Maybe I could doodle in my notebook while listening? 

Consultant: Doodling sounds like a fun way to stay engaged while listening! It could actually help keep your focus on the lesson. Would you be willing to try that next time?

User: Yes, I will definitely try that!

Consultant: I’m proud of you for being open to new methods! Over time, it’s important to notice any improvements, no matter how small. What strategies can you think of to remind yourself to stay positive about your progress?

User: I could keep a small journal of my feelings and any better moments during classes.

Consultant: A journal sounds like a wonderful idea! Writing down your thoughts can provide you with insight and motivate you as you track your growth. When would you like to start this journaling practice?

User: I could start it tonight. It feels exciting!

Consultant: That's the spirit! Remember to celebrate those small wins too. As we wrap up today, what is one key takeaway you'd like to hold on to from our session?

User: That it's okay to take things one step at a time, and to be kinder to myself.

Consultant: Absolutely, Li! That’s such a powerful realization. Remember, you can always return to this conversation whenever you need to. I’m here to support you. Looking forward to hearing how your week goes! 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more confident now. 

Consultant: You're most welcome! I'm glad to hear that. Take care, and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Li! I’m really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! Well, I've been feeling a bit nervous. I still think about what happened in class when I didn’t finish the task and my classmates laughed at me. It makes me not want to go back sometimes.

Consultant: I can imagine how that experience could be really tough for you. It’s understandable to feel anxious after being teased. What do you think would help you feel more confident in those situations?

User: I just wish I could focus more and not worry so much about what my classmates think. Maybe if I could be more confident, it wouldn't bother me as much.

Consultant: Finding a way to feel confident and less affected by others' opinions is a great goal. Let's explore how we can work on that together. Can you think of a time when you felt confident in class or around your friends?

User: Um, I felt good when I did a painting in art class. Everyone seemed to really like it, and I was proud of it.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! It sounds like your painting gave you a lot of joy and confidence. How about we think about how we can use that feeling when working on your focus in other subjects?

User: I like that idea. I just wish I could keep that feeling every time I study or do tasks.

Consultant: We can definitely work on harnessing that positive feeling! How about we think of some strategies to help you focus during your study times? What do you enjoy about painting that could inspire your studying?

User: When I paint, I can get lost in what I’m doing. I forget about everything else. I wish I could feel like that with my homework!

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Getting “lost” in an activity is like being in a flow state. We can try to bring that mindset into your homework. Maybe we can incorporate some creative elements into your study routine?

User: That sounds interesting! Like what?

Consultant: For instance, you could illustrate your homework topics or use colors to highlight important points. This could make studying more engaging and help you stay focused. What do you think about that idea?

User: I would love to try that! It sounds more fun than just writing everything down.

Consultant: Fantastic! Let’s also imagine how you might respond the next time someone says something that bothers you in class. Can you think of a way to practice being confident, just like you felt with your painting?

User: Maybe I could just remember that I did well with my painting and tell myself that I can do well in other things too.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Reminding yourself of your strengths is very powerful. You can practice saying positive affirmations, like “I am capable” or “I can focus.” How do you feel about trying that?

User: I think that could help! I’ll try saying those things to myself.

Consultant: Great! Also, let’s think about the social aspect—how do you feel about talking to a friend about what happened in class? Maybe they could also share their thoughts and support you.

User: I’m not sure. What if they make fun of me too?

Consultant: It’s normal to feel worried about that, but if it’s a good friend, they might understand and want to support you. What if you shared your feelings with them, and they can reassure you?

User: That could work. I might feel scared, but I just need to let them know how I feel.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing feelings is a brave step. It helps build connections and may even make you feel less alone. Let’s also not forget about incorporating some mindfulness techniques to help you stay focused in your studies. 

User: Mindfulness? What’s that?

Consultant: Mindfulness is about being present and fully engaged in the moment. When you're studying, it can mean taking a few deep breaths and focusing on what you're doing instead of worrying about distractions. Would you like to practice a short mindfulness exercise together?

User: Yes, I’d like to try that!

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s take a moment to close our eyes. Take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then slowly breathe out through your mouth. Picture yourself painting something, just like you did in art class. How does that feel?

User: I feel more relaxed just thinking about painting!

Consultant: That’s fantastic! You can use that visualization technique anytime you're feeling stressed or distracted. Remember the feelings of calmness you get from painting. How can that help you with your studies moving forward?

User: I could use that feeling when I sit down to do my homework. I’ll work on that and try to keep my fears in check.

Consultant: Yes, and remember, it's a journey! Every time you practice these strategies, you're working towards being more confident and focused. As we begin to wrap up today, what are some key takeaways you’d like to remember moving forward?

User: I want to use my painting to help me feel more positive about studying and try to talk to my friends whenever I feel upset.

Consultant: Those are wonderful goals, Li! You’ve made excellent progress today. As you continue to explore these new approaches, I believe you will find ways to feel more confident and focused. If you ever feel unsure, just remember the strategies we’ve talked about.

User: Thank you so much! I feel more hopeful now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. Keep that positive spirit, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. You've got this!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, especially about your painting and schoolwork?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty excited about my painting. It's fun! But sometimes, I still struggle to focus in class. I really want to keep that excitement going into my studies.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear about your excitement for painting! It sounds like you’re willing to find ways to connect that interest with your studies. Can you tell me more about how you feel when you're painting versus when you're in class?

User: When I'm painting, I lose track of time and feel really happy. In class, though, I often find my mind wandering. It’s hard to pay attention.

Consultant: I can see how that contrast would be frustrating for you. It seems like painting gives you a lot of joy and focus, while classes might feel less engaging. What do you think makes painting easier to concentrate on than your schoolwork?

User: I think because I enjoy it so much! In class, sometimes the subjects aren’t as interesting to me, and I feel a bit pressured.

Consultant: That makes sense. Enjoyment can definitely help with focus. Since you find painting so engaging, let’s explore how we can use that interest in your studies. What if we created some small tasks that combine painting with your learning subjects?

User: That sounds like a fun idea! How could I combine painting with my school subjects?

Consultant: Well, for example, if you have a topic in class that you’re learning about, maybe you could create a painting based on it. This way, you would use your painting skills to express what you've learned. How does that sound?

User: I like that! If I could paint about what we’re learning, I think I’d pay more attention because it would be more interesting.

Consultant: Exactly! Using your creativity can help make those lessons more engaging for you. Also, would you like to try setting a small goal to practice focused attention while painting? This could help improve your concentration in class as well.

User: Yes! I’d like to try that. What kind of goal do you suggest?

Consultant: How about starting with a goal to paint for 10-15 minutes every day, really focusing on what you are creating? You can also try to minimize distractions during this time. We can then discuss how that feeling of focus translates into your classwork.

User: That sounds doable! I think I can manage that.

Consultant: Great! It's all about building habits, Li. After practicing, we can talk about how it feels and whether it helps you stay focused in class. Do you think this approach might help you?

User: I hope so! I feel excited to try it out now!

Consultant: I love that enthusiasm! As you start this practice, remember to notice how you feel during and after your painting sessions. You can share your experiences with me next time we meet. 

User: I will! I feel like I can do it now.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! And if you happen to find it challenging at times, that’s completely normal. We can work through any obstacles together. How do you feel about talking to your grandparents about this goal?

User: I think they’d support me! They always encourage me when I discuss my interests.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It's great to have support. Sharing your goals with them might also give you additional motivation. How about we also think of a way you can reward yourself after reaching your painting goals each week?

User: I could treat myself to some extra time playing video games! That would be fun.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect reward! It’s important to celebrate your achievements, no matter how small. So, just to summarize, you will practice painting for 10-15 minutes a day, focus on your art, and talk to your grandparents about your goal.

User: Yes, I’ll definitely do that!

Consultant: I’m really proud of you for taking these steps, Li. It sounds like you’re ready to blend your passion for painting into your studies, which can help with your focus in class. 

User: Thank you! I feel much more confident about my plan now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. Keep sharing your feelings and any challenges you face. We'll keep adjusting our plan as needed. I'm really looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time.

User: Me too! Thanks for helping me. I feel happy about this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li. I’m here to support you every step of the way. Have fun painting, and I look forward to seeing you next time! 

User: Bye! I can’t wait for our next session!

Consultant: Bye, Li! Take care and enjoy your painting!

Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. I heard you had a wonderful experience with your drawing competition! How are you feeling about that?

User: Hi! Yes, I won an award! It felt amazing to hear my classmates and teacher praise my work. I was really happy!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like this achievement has boosted your confidence. How do you think this experience affects the way you approach your other school subjects?

User: I think it makes me feel more confident in my abilities. I want to try using the same focus I had while drawing, but sometimes it’s difficult to stay concentrated in class.

Consultant: It’s fantastic that you want to carry that focus into your classroom activities. Could you tell me what you think makes it challenging to stay focused during your lessons?

User: Well, sometimes the lessons can be boring, and I get distracted easily. I don't feel like drawing is as engaging.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Boredom can definitely make it harder to concentrate. What if we think about ways to make those lessons feel a bit more engaging for you? 

User: Maybe I could try to imagine my subjects as stories or think about how to draw them. That could help me focus better. 

Consultant: That’s a brilliant idea! Turning lessons into stories or visualizing them can definitely help you stay engaged. Have you tried any specific strategies to improve your focus when you're in class?

User: I’ve been trying to take short notes, but I still find my mind wandering sometimes.

Consultant: Taking notes is a good step. When you notice your mind wandering, how do you feel? What thoughts come to mind?

User: I feel frustrated because I want to pay attention, but I just can’t. It makes me think maybe I’m not good at this subject.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel frustrated when focusing is hard. Let’s try to challenge that thought for a moment—why do you believe not paying attention means you’re not good at the subject?

User: I guess because when I don’t understand, I think it’s because I didn’t pay enough attention.

Consultant: That’s an interesting insight! So, it's less about your ability and more about the attention in the moment. If a friend struggled in a class, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay to have off days and to ask for help if they don’t understand.

Consultant: Exactly! Why not treat yourself the same way? It’s okay to have off days, and seeking help shows strength. What do you think would help you on those tougher days?

User: Maybe I could talk to my teacher if I don’t understand something right away. 

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! Communicating with your teacher could really help clarify things for you. Besides that, let’s think about your success with drawing—how can you reward yourself when you successfully apply focus in class?

User: Hmm, if I do a good job focusing, maybe I could allow myself some extra drawing time afterward!

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic reward! Associating your progress with something you enjoy can encourage those positive behaviors. Do you think you can start implementing this idea this week?

User: Yes, I’d like to try that! 

Consultant: Great! As you work on applying your drawing focus to your classes, remember to celebrate those small victories. How do you feel about your plan now?

User: I feel excited! I can’t wait to start using my drawing focus in class. 

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about building those positive habits step by step. What will be your first small step this week?

User: I think I’ll try to focus during math class by visualizing the problems as drawings.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic first step! Visualizing can really help solidify your understanding. As we wrap up today, let’s recap what you’ve learned. What’s one key takeaway from our session?

User: I learned that I can use my drawing focus in other subjects and that it’s okay to ask for help when I need it!

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve made great progress today. Keep nurturing your confidence, and remember your successes. How do you feel about continuing to work on your focus and slowly developing your plan?

User: I feel really good about it! I’m looking forward to our next session too.

Consultant: I am too! Don't hesitate to reach out if you need support before we meet again. I’m proud of the effort you’re putting in. You’re doing great! See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm so glad you're here today. How are you feeling about your recent progress in your studies?

User: Hi! I'm feeling really good, actually! I've improved a lot in my exams recently, and my grandparents have been super supportive.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like the encouragement from your grandparents has made a positive impact on you. What specific changes have you noticed in your studies since the exams?

User: Well, I’m spending more time studying, and I feel like I can concentrate better. I used to get distracted easily, but now I can focus more on my work.

Consultant: That's fantastic! It seems like you're developing a stronger ability to focus. How do you feel about maintaining this level of concentration moving forward?

User: I want to keep it up! Sometimes I worry that I might go back to being distracted like before.

Consultant: It's quite normal to have those worries, but recognizing them is a great first step. What strategies do you think could help you stay focused?

User: Maybe I could set specific study times and take breaks? My teacher suggested using a timer to manage my time better.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Using a timer can help you stay on track while also giving you the chance to take short breaks. How does that plan make you feel about your ability to focus?

User: I think it would really help. I already feel more confident about my studies, and having a plan makes it seem easier.

Consultant: Confidence is key! Let's build on that. Along with the timer, are there any other techniques you think could help enhance your focus?

User: I could try studying in a quieter space or using some light music. I find it helps me concentrate sometimes.

Consultant: Excellent! Creating an environment that supports your focus is very important. How would you combine these strategies into a daily routine?

User: I could start with a quiet study session for about 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. After a few rounds, maybe I can take a longer break and do something fun.

Consultant: That sounds like a balanced approach! Structuring your study time like that can really help maintain your concentration. How do you feel about sharing this plan with your grandparents for their support?

User: I think they would be happy to know! They want me to do well, and I can ask them to help remind me to take my breaks.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Their support can reinforce your efforts. As we wrap up, let's review your progress and the strategies we discussed to help you keep moving forward. How do you feel about everything we talked about today?

User: I feel more positive! I'm excited to try out my plan and keep improving. It’s nice to talk about it, too.

Consultant: It’s been great to see your enthusiasm! You’ve made significant strides, and I believe you’ll continue to build on them. Just remember to be kind to yourself and adjust your plan as needed. Would you like to set a date for our next session?

User: Yes, I’d like that! I want to share how my new study routine is going.

Consultant: Perfect! I look forward to hearing about your experiences with the new routine. Keep up the good work, Li, and know that you can always reach out if you need support in between our sessions.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad to be here for you. Have a great day, and I’ll see you at our next session!

User: Bye! See you next time!
