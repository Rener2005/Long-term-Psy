Consultant: Hello, Honghong! I’m glad to have you here today. I’d like to start by asking you how you’ve been feeling lately after the incident on the playground.

User: Hi! I feel a bit upset. I just wanted to play with the big ball, but I got into a fight with my classmate. I didn’t think it was such a big deal at the time.

Consultant: That sounds frustrating. It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you want to have fun. Can you tell me more about what happened during that incident?

User: Well, I saw the ball and wanted to kick it, but my classmate was also trying to get it. I got angry when he didn't let me, so I pushed him. 

Consultant: I see. It seems like you felt really strongly about getting the ball. Can you share what went through your mind when you pushed him? What were you feeling at that moment?

User: I just felt really mad and wanted to get the ball. I didn’t think about him or how he felt.

Consultant: It makes sense to have strong feelings in that situation. It’s important to recognize how those feelings can lead to actions like pushing someone. What do you think your classmate felt when you did that?

User: He looked surprised and maybe a bit scared. I didn't think about that.

Consultant: That’s a good observation, Honghong. It’s important to consider others’ feelings too. Could there be other ways to handle situations like this without getting angry or pushing someone?

User: I guess I could have asked him to share or just waited for my turn.

Consultant: Yes, those are great alternatives! Asking to share or waiting for your turn shows respect for others and can help avoid conflict. How about we think more about how to express your needs without getting angry? 

User: That sounds good! I want to learn how to do that.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s practice a situation together. Imagine you see a friend with a toy you want to play with. What could you say to them?

User: I could say, “Can I try playing with that toy too, please?”

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a kind and respectful way to express what you want. How do you think your friend might react to that?

User: They might say yes, or maybe we can play together.

Consultant: Right! And by using kind words, you’re more likely to have fun together. What do you think is the most challenging part for you when trying to stay calm and ask instead of getting angry?

User: Sometimes I just get really excited and forget to ask. I just want it right away!

Consultant: That’s completely understandable, feeling excited can be overwhelming. What if we came up with a little reminder or a cue for you when you feel that way? 

User: A reminder could help! Maybe I can take a deep breath before saying something.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Taking a deep breath can help you calm down and think before acting. How do you feel about using that technique next time?

User: I think it would help me not get so mad. I can try that!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! It's all about finding ways to handle your feelings. Let’s also think about how to talk to others about what you’re feeling. How do you usually feel when someone takes something away from you?

User: I feel really upset and think it’s unfair. 

Consultant: Feeling upset is a very normal response. It's about finding a way to express that feeling without letting anger take control. You might say something like, “I feel sad when you take the ball.” Does that sound like something you could try?

User: Yes, it sounds easier than pushing. I think I could say that.

Consultant: That’s a great step forward, Honghong! Remember, sharing how you feel can help others understand you better. What else do you think could help you in these situations?

User: Maybe sharing with my friends could be good? I can tell them how I feel and ask them to help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing with friends can build better connections. Plus, they can help you stay calm. For our next session, let’s think about scenarios where you can practice these techniques, and we’ll explore how it goes. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I’m excited to try this out.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about practice, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. Let’s recap what we’ve learned today about expressing your feelings and being respectful. What do you think was the most important thing we talked about?

User: I think it’s better to ask for things and express my feelings instead of getting angry.

Consultant: Exactly! Understanding your feelings and using words can change how you interact with others. Our next session will focus on exploring these techniques further. I’m proud of the progress you’re making!

User: Thank you! I feel better thinking about it this way.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Honghong! Remember, it’s a journey, and I’m here to support you. Looking forward to our next chat!

Consultant: Hello, Honghong! I'm glad to see you today. Let's talk about what's been going on with you. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I’ve been really frustrated. My desk mate took my special spot for my pencil case, and I got into an argument with him again. I just can't stand when someone takes what's mine!

Consultant: I can see that this situation has made you very upset. It's important to feel like your space and belongings are respected. Can you remember what thoughts went through your mind when this happened?

User: I thought he was being really unfair and disrespectful. It felt like he was trying to take my things away from me.

Consultant: That sounds really intense. It's understandable to feel protective over your belongings. But what if we looked at it another way? Could there be a possibility that he didn’t mean to take your space, maybe he just didn't realize it was yours?

User: I guess. But it still makes me angry when I see him in my spot!

Consultant: Anger is a strong feeling, Honghong. When you feel that anger, what do you usually want to do?

User: I just want to yell at him! Or sometimes I push him a bit.

Consultant: That reaction is natural when you feel threatened. However, I'm wondering if yelling or pushing helps you solve the problem or makes it worse?

User: It usually makes things worse. Then we both get in trouble.

Consultant: Right. It sounds like those actions don't help you get what you want. Let’s try to understand how we can approach the situation differently. What do you think might happen if you talked to him instead of getting angry?

User: Maybe he would listen? But what if he doesn’t care?

Consultant: That's a possibility. However, often people don’t mean to upset each other. What if we practiced how you could talk to him about your feelings? Would you be willing to try that?

User: I could try talking. But what should I say?

Consultant: You might start by saying, “I felt upset when I saw you were in my spot. I really like having my pencil case there.” This way, he understands how you feel without feeling attacked.

User: That sounds okay, but what if he still takes my spot again?

Consultant: That's a valid concern. If that happens, you can calmly tell him again how it makes you feel. It's important to express your feelings clearly. Would that be alright with you?

User: Yeah, I guess I can give it a shot.

Consultant: Awesome! And just a reminder, even if he doesn’t respond the way you hope, your feelings are still important. How do you think you might feel if you communicate your thoughts without being aggressive?

User: I think I might feel less mad if I just talk. Maybe I’d feel more in control.

Consultant: Exactly! Talking shows that you’re expressing yourself in a constructive way. Now, how would you feel about practicing that with a little role-play?

User: Okay, let’s try it!

Consultant: Great! I can be your desk mate. So, let's begin. Go ahead and tell me how you would express your feelings.

User: Um, okay. “Hey, I felt upset when I saw you were in my spot. I really like having my pencil case there.”

Consultant: That’s a good start! Now, based on my response—let's say I respond, "Oh, I didn’t know that. I’m sorry!" How do you think you'd like to reply?

User: I guess I could say, “It's okay, but could you please ask me next time?”

Consultant: Exactly! That is a nice way to communicate your need while also opening the door for understanding. How does this practice make you feel?

User: It feels better than fighting. I think I can try this next time.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It sounds like you're open to trying some new ways to handle these conflicts. What is one thing you’ll focus on the next time you feel angry?

User: I will try to remember to talk instead of getting mad right away.

Consultant: That's a fantastic goal! And always remember, it’s okay to feel angry, but finding a way to express it is what matters. How do you feel about today’s session?

User: I feel good! I think I learned a lot about how to talk it out instead of just fighting.

Consultant: I'm really proud of you, Honghong. You’ve taken important steps today. As we move forward, just keep practicing these skills. I believe you can do it! 

User: Thank you! I will try my best.

Consultant: You’re welcome! Don’t hesitate to come back if you need more support. You've got this!

Consultant: Hello, Hong Hong! I'm glad you're here today. Let's talk about how things have been going for you lately. I know you've been facing some challenges with your emotions and reactions. What's been on your mind?

User: Hi! I don’t know… I keep getting really angry at my friends! Just because I want to play with their toys, and they won’t let me. I’ve been hitting them sometimes, and I don’t want to be like that, but I can't help it!

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling frustrated when you see your friends with their toys, and that makes you respond with anger. It’s great that you want to change how you react. Can you tell me what goes through your mind when you're about to get angry?

User: I just get really mad! I feel like I have to take the toy, or I won’t get a turn. I think they’re being unfair!

Consultant: I can see how you feel that way, Hong Hong. It’s tough when you perceive things as unfair. When you feel that anger, what do you notice in your body? How does it feel before you hit someone?

User: My heart races, and I feel really hot inside. Then I just do it before I think!

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. Your body is sending you signals that you’re really upset, but acting on those feelings can lead to conflicts and hurt feelings. Let's try to think about another option. What could you do instead of hitting when you're feeling that way?

User: I don’t know... maybe I could just walk away or something?

Consultant: Walking away is a good start! When you feel that anger rising, distancing yourself can help you calm down. How about we come up with a "cool down" plan together? What are some things you could do to help yourself relax when you start to feel angry?

User: Um... I could take deep breaths or count to ten!

Consultant: Absolutely, counting to ten or taking deep breaths can help you pause and think before you act. Let’s practice that together now. Imagine a situation where you want a toy. Take a deep breath and count to ten in your mind. What do you notice?

User: I guess it feels a bit better… I can think more clearly.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! You're starting to see that you can have some control over how you respond. Now, let’s also talk about sharing. Have you thought about how sharing can be fun?

User: Sometimes. But I really want to play with the toy myself!

Consultant: It’s normal to want to enjoy things by yourself! However, sharing can also lead to more fun with your friends. What could be a fun way to share a toy?

User: Maybe we could take turns or play together with it?

Consultant: Exactly! Taking turns allows everyone to enjoy the toy while also having fun together. How do you think your friends would feel if you suggested taking turns?

User: I think they would like that… but what if they don’t want to share either?

Consultant: That’s a good question. If they don’t want to share, you could still find a way to play together. You could look for something else fun to do or suggest another game. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds okay. I could find something else to do instead of getting mad.

Consultant: Yes! Finding alternatives is a great strategy. Now, let’s turn that into a little challenge. This week, I want you to try using your cool down methods and suggest taking turns at least three times. How does that sound?

User: I can try that! I don’t want to be the “little tyrant” anymore.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset, Hong Hong! I believe you can make this change. Oh, and if you ever find it hard to control your anger, remember that it’s okay to talk to someone about it. It’s a part of learning. 

User: Yeah, I think I can do that. It's kind of fun to think about sharing now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Reflecting on sharing can help you build stronger friendships. Let's remember that while it might be hard sometimes, practicing these tools can benefit you and your friends. 

User: I’ll try to remember.

Consultant: Fantastic! Before we finish today, let’s review what we’ve worked on. We talked about recognizing your feelings, using strategies like counting or deep breathing, and how fun sharing can be. 

User: Yeah, and I might feel good if I can share!

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s a win-win situation. Next time we meet, let’s talk about how your challenges went and what worked for you. Remember, you're growing and learning, and that takes time.

User: Okay, thanks! I feel a bit better now.

Consultant: You're welcome, Hong Hong! I'm proud of you for sharing today. Keep practicing what we discussed, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!

User: Bye! I’ll try my best!

Consultant: Hi there! I'm really glad to see you today. How are you feeling about your experiences with cooperation since our last session?

User: Hi! I'm feeling a bit better. In the group, we played some games that needed teamwork, and I enjoyed it. But sometimes, I still feel like I want to win all the time.

Consultant: That’s great to hear that you're finding enjoyment in teamwork! It's completely normal to want to win, but I'm curious to know—what do you think it would feel like to win while cooperating with others instead?

User: I think it might feel good because everyone would be happy together, but I’m still not sure how to do that when I really want something.

Consultant: It's wonderful that you're thinking about how everyone can be happy together. Let's explore a situation. Can you think of a recent time when you felt the urge to take something from a friend? How did that make you feel afterward?

User: Yes, I remember wanting a toy from a classmate. At first, I was mad when he wouldn't let me have it. But then I felt a bit sad afterward because I didn't have fun playing with him.

Consultant: It sounds like you realized that taking the toy didn’t lead to a good feeling after all. What do you think could have happened if you asked him to play with you instead?

User: Maybe he would have said yes, and we could have played together? That would have been fun.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a great insight. By asking to play together, you would create a chance for both of you to enjoy the toy and the game. What do you think you could try next time you feel the urge to take something?

User: I think I should ask first instead of grabbing it. I want to try to share more.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Practicing asking first can lead to more fun opportunities. Can we find a specific game or situation to practice this idea?

User: Maybe when we have our next break, I can ask to play with the toys instead of just taking them.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Just asking can change the whole experience. How do you feel about this plan? 

User: I feel excited! I want to see if my friends will say yes.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It's great to feel excited about trying something new. What do you think might help you remember to ask instead of taking?

User: I could think about how much more fun it is to play together. Maybe I can also remind myself before the break.

Consultant: That’s an excellent reminder! It can be helpful to think about the fun you’ll have. Let’s also think about any feelings you might have if someone says no when you ask to play.

User: I might feel disappointed, but I guess it’s okay. I can ask someone else or try something different.

Consultant: That’s a healthy way to look at it! Disappointment can happen, but you’re learning how to cope with it. What can you do to feel better if you encounter that situation?

User: I could distract myself with another toy or play with a different friend.

Consultant: Exactly! Distracting yourself or engaging with others is a great strategy. It keeps your spirits up and allows you to find joy in different experiences. How does this make you feel about working on cooperation with your friends?

User: I feel more confident! I think practicing will help, and I can see how much fun we can all have when we share.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful outlook! Practicing cooperation will definitely bring more enjoyment. Would you like to set a goal for the next time you’re with your classmates to see how well you can share and cooperate?

User: Yes! I want to ask at least three times during the break to share toys and see what happens.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Asking three times will give you a chance to practice and see how it feels. I’m proud of you for being open to this. How do you feel about your progress so far this week?

User: I feel happy! I can see how this might help me make better friends.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear you're feeling happy! Building better friendships is a wonderful reward from cooperation. Today, let’s summarize what we’ve talked about. What are the key things you want to remember moving forward?

User: I want to remember to ask to share toys, think about the fun we’ll have, and not feel too bad if someone says no.

Consultant: Those are wonderful points! Remembering to ask, focusing on the fun, and having strategies for disappointment will really help you. Are you feeling ready to try this out until our next session?

User: Yes, I can’t wait to try!

Consultant: Great! I believe in you and your ability to cooperate and share with your friends. Remember, I’m here for you if you need support. Looking forward to hearing all about your experiences next time!

User: Thank you! I feel excited about sharing and being better with my friends.

Consultant: Hello, Honghong! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, especially with your family and friends?

User: Hi! I think I've been doing a bit better. I actually got into less trouble at school recently, and my parents said I’m more friendly at home.

Consultant: That sounds positive! It's great to hear that you've noticed some changes in how you're interacting with your family. Can you tell me more about what you think is making a difference?

User: I guess I’ve been trying harder to share my toys and not just take them from other kids. It's been tough sometimes, but I feel a bit happier when I share.

Consultant: Sharing can definitely be challenging, especially if you’re used to taking what you want. How does it feel when you successfully share your toys with others?

User: It feels nice! Like when I let my friend play with my new action figure, and he smiled. I liked seeing him happy.

Consultant: That's wonderful, Honghong! It sounds like you’re beginning to see the joy that comes from cooperation. What do you think about the idea of cooperation bringing happiness to everyone involved?

User: It makes sense! I think if we all share, we can have more fun together instead of fighting over things.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’re really getting the hang of it. Now, let’s think about a situation where you can practice this. What activities could you do with your friends that would encourage sharing and cooperation?

User: Maybe we could have a game day where we all bring our toys and play together, so no one feels left out.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Planning a game day could be a great opportunity for you to show your friends how fun sharing can be. What do you think you could do to encourage everyone to participate?

User: I could tell them that it’d be more fun if we all played together and that they should bring their favorite toys too.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Encouraging others in that way can create a positive environment. How do you feel about suggesting this to your friends?

User: I feel excited! I just hope they think it’s a good idea too.

Consultant: It’s perfectly okay to feel a little nervous about suggesting new ideas. How might you handle it if some friends are hesitant or don’t want to share?

User: Maybe I could remind them of the fun we can have if we work together. I can tell them that sharing is cool!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach! Reminding them about the fun aspect can help ease their worries. Let’s think about what your next steps will be. After you have this game day, how will you reflect on the experience?

User: I can talk with my parents about how it went and if my friends had fun. Maybe we can even plan it regularly.

Consultant: Great idea! Keeping track of how things go will help you see your progress. It sounds like you're developing a strong understanding of cooperation and its benefits. How does that make you feel about yourself?

User: I feel proud! Like I’m learning how to be a good friend.

Consultant: You should definitely be proud! Recognizing your growth is an important step. As we wrap up, what do you think will be the most important lesson you’ll take away from our conversation today?

User: I think it’s how good it feels to share and have fun with friends instead of being the “little tyrant.” I want to keep being a good friend.

Consultant: That's an excellent takeaway, Honghong! It's clear you’re making strides toward becoming a supportive and friendly person. Remember, every small step counts. How about we plan to talk again next time and see how your game day goes?

User: Yes! I’d like that. Thank you for helping me.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m excited to hear how it goes next time. Keep up the great work till then!

Consultant: Hello, Honghong! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good actually. I think leading the team during the class activity made me feel more confident. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you enjoyed the experience of being a leader and working as part of a team. What part of being a team leader did you find most rewarding?

User: I really liked how everyone listened to me and worked together. It felt good to guide my classmates and see us succeed together.

Consultant: That sense of accomplishment must have been fantastic. How do you feel this experience has changed your view of teamwork and leadership?

User: I used to think that being in charge meant being tough all the time, but now I see that it's better to help others and work together.

Consultant: That's an important insight, Honghong! It shows you are growing in understanding what it means to be a good leader. What challenges do you think you might face if you take on more leadership roles in the future?

User: I worry that I might get angry again or not know what to do if things don't go as planned.

Consultant: It's normal to have those concerns. Anger can sometimes bubble up when we feel stressed. How might you handle your feelings if you start to feel angry during a group activity?

User: I guess I could try to take deep breaths or talk to someone to calm down. I want to stay in control.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Taking a moment to breathe or reaching out for support can really help manage those feelings. Can you think of a time recently when you felt calm during an activity?

User: Yes, during the team activity, I felt calm when I was explaining our plan to everyone. I focused on what we needed to do, and I didn't get mad.

Consultant: That's a great example! It shows you have the ability to maintain calmness when you focus on the task at hand. How might you apply this focus in other situations?

User: Maybe for recess or when I want a toy, I should think about how I can ask nicely instead of getting mad.

Consultant: That’s a thoughtful approach! Asking nicely can help you get what you want without the frustration. How do you think your friends would respond to you asking instead of being aggressive?

User: I think they would like it more! They might even want to play with me more often.

Consultant: Exactly! Building positive relationships with your friends can make playtime much more enjoyable. What specific steps can you take this week to practice this new approach?

User: I could practice asking my friends to play with my toys first and share with them. Maybe I'll do it tomorrow!

Consultant: That's a fantastic plan, Honghong! It sounds like you’re setting yourself up for success. How do you feel about trying this out?

User: I feel excited! I really want to try it.

Consultant: That’s great to hear. Remember to be patient with yourself. If it doesn't go perfectly, it's okay! You’re learning and growing. How else can I support you in your journey of personal growth?

User: Just talking with you helps! It makes me think about how to be better with my friends.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Reflecting on your thoughts and feelings is an important part of growth. As we wrap up our session, let’s review what you've learned today. What would you say is your biggest takeaway?

User: I learned that being a leader means helping others and being calm, and that asking nicely can make me more friends.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway, Honghong! You’ve made good progress in understanding teamwork and personal growth. How do you envision using these insights in your daily life moving forward?

User: I think I can use these ideas to build better relationships and feel more confident when I lead again.

Consultant: Absolutely! It's all about practicing these skills. Remember, every step you take contributes to your growth. If you face challenges, you can always come back and talk about them. 

User: Thank you! I will!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Honghong! I’m proud of your efforts and the progress you’ve made. This will be our last session for now, but I’m confident you have the tools to continue improving. If you ever need support again, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thanks for everything! I'm going to try my best! 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your successes in the future. Goodbye for now!
