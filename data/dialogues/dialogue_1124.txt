Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you could make it to our session today. How have you been feeling recently?

User: Hi. To be honest, I've been feeling a bit lost. I recently participated in a field study for my biology major and I made some progress, but I can't help but question the significance of my goals.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're experiencing some internal conflict after your field study. Can you share more about what specifically feels lacking or unfulfilled for you?

User: Well, I’ve always been passionate about nature and biology, but now I feel like my efforts are meaningless. I'm not sure if I can really make an impact or if this is the right path for me.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It's understandable to feel disheartened when you're questioning the significance of your efforts. What do you feel when you think about your studies and future career?

User: I feel a sense of confusion and uncertainty. Sometimes I feel excited about the possibilities, but most of the time it's like a heavy weight on my chest.

Consultant: It makes sense that you would feel a mix of excitement and heaviness. This conflict can be quite distressing. Can you pinpoint any thoughts that come to mind when you're feeling this way?

User: I have thoughts like “What if I'm not good enough?” or “What if I don't find a job that I enjoy?” These negative thoughts keep circling in my mind.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite overwhelming. It’s important to reflect on how they influence your feelings about yourself and your future. How do these thoughts affect your motivation to engage with your studies or pursue your goals?

User: They make me feel discouraged. Sometimes I just want to give up altogether because it feels like nothing really matters.

Consultant: That sense of wanting to give up is really tough. Let’s explore these thoughts further. When you think, “What if I'm not good enough?”, do you find any evidence that supports or contradicts this belief?

User: I guess I’ve done well in my classes and received positive feedback from my professors, but I still doubt myself.

Consultant: It sounds like there are achievements that contradict that negative thought. What would you say to a friend who is in your situation, feeling unsure despite having accomplishments?

User: I would tell them to look at the positives and to remember their achievements. But I don't seem to apply that advice to myself.

Consultant: That's an interesting insight. It's easier to be compassionate towards others than ourselves. What if we worked on reframing that negative belief? What could a more balanced perspective look like regarding your abilities?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it's okay to have doubts and that it doesn't make me a failure. Perhaps acknowledging my efforts would help.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthier perspective. Acknowledging your efforts can help foster motivation rather than diminish it. What steps could you take to reinforce this new perspective?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal of my accomplishments or positive feedback. It would help me remember my capabilities during tough times.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Journaling can be a powerful tool for self-reflection and motivation. How do you feel about implementing this idea?

User: I feel like it could really help me. It’s something concrete I can do.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s a proactive way to combat those negative thoughts. As you start this process, what additional supports might you need to keep on track?

User: I think having a regular check-in could be helpful. Maybe I could share it with you next session?

Consultant: Absolutely! We can review your journaling together in our next session. That way, we can celebrate your progress and tackle any challenges that arise. How does that sound?

User: I like that idea! Writing down my thoughts could help me process everything.

Consultant: Absolutely! It can serve as a valuable tool for reflection. As you start this journey, remember to be kind to yourself. It’s okay to feel uncertain as long as you’re exploring possibilities. 

User: Thanks for that reminder. It helps me feel more at ease about the whole situation.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As our session is coming to a close, let’s recap what we’ve discussed. You’ll explore volunteer opportunities, create a balanced schedule, and keep a journal for reflection. Does that sound good to you?

User: I feel a bit hopeful when I receive compliments, but it's immediately followed by anxiety. What if people expect too much from me now? What if I can’t deliver in the future? Those thoughts creep in and ruin the moment.

Consultant: It's impressive that you can recognize the duality of those feelings. On one hand, you feel proud and hopeful; on the other, anxiety takes over. Let's explore those anxious thoughts a bit deeper. Can you share what specifically worries you about the expectations others might have?

User: I guess I'm scared of failure. If people think I'm capable of doing amazing things, but I end up not meeting those expectations, it would be really disappointing—not just for them, but for me too.

Consultant: That fear of failing to meet expectations is quite common, especially among high achievers like yourself. It can feel very heavy. What evidence do you have that supports these fearful thoughts versus your capabilities and strengths?

User: I suppose some of it comes from past experiences where I felt overwhelmed or didn’t live up to what I could have done. But thinking about it now, there have also been many moments of success where I surprised myself.

Consultant: It’s great to recognize those moments of success! They highlight your ability to rise to challenges. Let's challenge that fearful thought: if a friend were in your position, feeling the same way, what would you tell them about their strengths and capabilities?

User: I would probably remind them of their achievements and that it’s okay to struggle sometimes. Everyone has their off days, but it doesn’t define their worth or potential.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve just provided some powerful advice that you might also consider for yourself. Remembering your strengths can keep you grounded during these challenging times. Let's think about ways to reinforce that mindset. What steps can you take to celebrate your successes moving forward?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal of my achievements, both big and small, and remind myself of those when doubts start to creep in. It could help put things in perspective.
