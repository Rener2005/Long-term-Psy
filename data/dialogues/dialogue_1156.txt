Consultant: Hello, Jiang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! Honestly, it's been a bit of a rollercoaster. I initially felt excited about being in a new place, but now I feel quite lonely and confused, especially regarding my relationship with this guy I met who's from my hometown.

Consultant: It sounds like you're going through some significant adjustments. Loneliness and confusion can be very challenging feelings to navigate. Can you tell me more about what's been on your mind regarding this guy and how his behavior has changed?

User: Sure. At first, he was really friendly, and it felt comforting to talk to someone who understood where I came from. But recently, he seems distant and less responsive, and that's making me feel insecure about our friendship.

Consultant: That must be really tough for you. It's understandable to feel insecure when someone you depended on for support is now acting differently. What thoughts do you notice coming up when you think about this change in his behavior?

User: I keep thinking maybe I did something wrong or that he doesn't want to be friends anymore. I feel like I'm losing the only connection I had in this new place.

Consultant: You're experiencing a lot of uncertainty with your thoughts. It’s common to jump to conclusions in situations like this. Let’s explore those thoughts further. What evidence do you have that he doesn’t want to be friends anymore?

User: Well, he doesn't initiate conversations as he used to, and sometimes he takes a long time to reply. I guess that seems like a sign to me, but I also wonder if he's just busy.

Consultant: It’s good that you’re considering multiple possibilities. So, there’s that thought that he is busy. What would happen if you leaned towards that more positive interpretation instead of assuming the worst?

User: I suppose I could feel less anxious if I thought he was just busy with school. But it’s hard to shake off the worry that I did something to push him away.

Consultant: It's completely normal to worry, especially when relationships are important to us. How about we try to challenge the thought that you've done something wrong? What would you say to a friend who felt this way about a similar situation?

User: I would probably tell them they shouldn’t jump to conclusions and that it's not always about them. 

Consultant: That's a wise perspective. It seems like you already know how to approach this as a friend. Can we try applying that same kindness and understanding to yourself in this situation?

User: That makes sense. I should be more compassionate toward myself. 

Consultant: Exactly! Self-compassion can really help reduce anxiety. How do you feel about reaching out to him to clarify things and see how he’s been doing?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but it's probably better than waiting and worrying about it. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Perhaps we could think about what you might say when you reach out. What would you want to ask him?

User: I would probably just ask if he’s okay and if he wants to hang out again. I miss talking to him.

Consultant: That sounds like a nice approach. It shows you're open and willing to reconnect. What do you think could be some of your fears about reaching out to him?

User: I guess I fear he might say no or that he’s not interested anymore, which would hurt.

Consultant: That’s a valid fear. When we care about someone, the thought of rejection can be painful. If that does happen, how might you cope with that feeling?

User: I could remind myself that it’s not the end of the world and that I still have other friends and interests. 

Consultant: That's a healthy way to think about it. Keeping in mind your support network and activities can help cushion the impact. How do you feel about taking this step to reach out in the next few days?

User: I think I can do that. I will try to focus on the possibilities rather than the negatives.

Consultant: That's a positive mindset! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize some insights you’ve gained. It sounds like recognizing your own thoughts and applying self-compassion could really help you. 

User: Yes, I feel more equipped to handle the situation now. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it's okay to feel anxious, but you’ve also got tools to navigate through it. Do you have any strategies in mind for the upcoming week to practice this?

User: I could keep journaling my thoughts and feelings, and maybe try some deep breathing when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Journaling can provide clarity, and deep breathing helps manage anxiety. I believe you’re making great progress. 

User: Thank you for all your help. I feel more motivated to engage with people. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been wonderful to see your progress. Remember, it's about taking small steps. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: I appreciate that. I think I’ll come back after I’ve reached out to him.

Consultant: I look forward to hearing how it goes! Take care, Jiang, and I’ll see you in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hi there! I'm really glad you're back for this session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've been trying to immerse myself more in class activities, but I still feel a little anxious when I interact with my classmates, especially the guys. I wish I could feel more comfortable.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're making an effort to participate in class activities! Feeling anxious in social situations is completely understandable. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel anxious when interacting with your classmates?

User: I guess I'm worried they might judge me or not like me. It sometimes feels like I'm putting myself out there and the fear of rejection is pretty overwhelming.

Consultant: That fear of rejection can indeed be very daunting. It's important to remember that many people share similar feelings. Can you share with me a recent interaction where you felt this anxiety? What were your thoughts during that moment?

User: Just the other day, I tried to join a conversation during lunch, and I kept thinking they might find my contributions silly. I ended up just nodding instead of speaking up.

Consultant: It sounds like you really wanted to engage but found yourself feeling held back by those thoughts. What kind of feelings did that create in you when you held back?

User: I felt embarrassed and frustrated with myself. I wanted to be part of the conversation but just couldn't push through the fear.

Consultant: I can see how that would be really upsetting. It's completely normal to have those experiences, but it seems like we need to challenge those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that your contributions would be considered silly?

User: Honestly, I don't have much evidence, but those thoughts just pop up in my head. It's like a reflex to think negatively about myself.

Consultant: It's interesting how those automatic thoughts can become almost instinctive. Let's try to identify one specific thought that comes up for you in those moments and see if we can reframe it together. What’s a common thought you have before joining a conversation?

User: I often think, “What if they think I'm annoying?”

Consultant: That’s definitely a thought we can work with. Let’s explore this: What would you say if a friend was worried about being annoying in a conversation? 

User: I would probably tell them that most people are just happy to have a conversation and wouldn’t focus on minor details.

Consultant: Exactly! So, maybe we can use that perspective to challenge your own thought. If most people are not focused on the small stuff, could it be possible that they actually appreciate your contributions?

User: That makes sense! I suppose I could offer my remarks without worrying too much.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Could we also discuss some small goals for you in future social interactions? Perhaps one situation where you could practice sharing your thoughts more openly?

User: Sure! Maybe I could try to comment or ask a question in our next group project meeting.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! How about we set a goal for that meeting, like aiming to share at least one thought or question? How would that feel for you?

User: I think that would be doable! I might still feel nervous, but I can try to remind myself of our conversation. 

Consultant: Excellent! It’s perfectly okay to feel nervous. What other strategies do you think could help you feel more confident when the moment comes?

User: Maybe I could take a few deep breaths before speaking up, and remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: Breathing is a great technique! And giving yourself permission to make mistakes can take some pressure off. Practice that mindset when you're in the group, and let's talk about how it goes next time. 

User: Sure! I’ll do my best. 

Consultant: I believe in you! Before we wrap up today, how do you feel about the progress we've made in understanding your social interactions and working through those thoughts?

User: I feel a bit lighter, actually. Talking about it has helped me see that I can change my thinking patterns.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. In our next meeting, we can check in on how those strategies went and explore any other areas you might want to work on.

User: Sounds great! I feel more motivated to take action now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Just remember, it’s a journey, and it's fine to reach out for support as things evolve. You’re doing really well, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and understanding.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: Hello, Jiang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been trying to adjust to campus life, but there are still some moments where I feel uneasy. I’m still actively participating in activities, but sometimes I just lack the energy to keep going.

Consultant: It sounds like you're making efforts to engage with your studies and social life, which is great to hear. Can you share more about those moments of unease? What typically triggers those feelings?

User: Well, sometimes I feel overwhelmed with assignments or social events. I worry about whether I'm managing everything well or if I'm disappointing anyone.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Balancing academic and social responsibilities can be challenging. It seems like there may be some pressure you place on yourself. How do those worries affect your ability to focus or participate in activities?

User: When I start to worry, I often feel exhausted, and it becomes hard to concentrate on studying or enjoying myself. I sometimes avoid situations because I'm scared I'll mess things up.

Consultant: It’s tough when those worries lead to feeling exhausted and hesitant to engage. It may be helpful to identify any specific thoughts you have in those moments. What thoughts cross your mind when you worry about disappointing others or messing up?

User: I often think, "What if I fail?" or "What if people think I’m not good enough?" Those thoughts make me feel really anxious and low on confidence.

Consultant: Those thoughts certainly sound distressing, and it's understandable they'd impact your feelings and actions. Can we explore how realistic those thoughts are? Is there evidence that supports or contradicts those fears?

User: I guess I don't have much evidence to support the idea that I would fail. I’ve done well in my studies so far, and my friends have been supportive.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It sounds like you have been doing well. It can be helpful to gather evidence against those negative thoughts. How about trying to replace those troubling thoughts—is there a more balanced thought you could tell yourself when you feel like you might fail?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that I’ve succeeded before and that it’s okay to have ups and downs. It wouldn’t be the end of the world if I made a mistake.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful replacement thought! Focusing on your successes and allowing room for mistakes can be so freeing. How do you feel when you think about that positive perspective instead?

User: I feel a bit lighter. It’s comforting to know that I can have ups and downs without it being catastrophic.

Consultant: That’s really encouraging to hear. Shifting your mindset can significantly impact your confidence. Now, let’s explore some strategies you could use when you start feeling overwhelmed. Are there activities or techniques that have helped you relax before?

User: I sometimes listen to music or go for a walk, but I haven't been consistent about it.

Consultant: Those sound like great activities! Consistency can certainly help in managing stress. Would you be open to setting a small goal to incorporate these activities into your routine more regularly?

User: Yes, I think setting a reminder to listen to music or take a walk every few days could be doable.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Establishing those regular moments for yourself can really help in creating a sense of balance. What other strategies could you think of to manage feelings of unease in social or academic situations?

User: I could practice breathing exercises to calm myself before a big event or try to visualize a successful interaction.

Consultant: Those are fantastic strategies! Visualizing success can be very powerful. And breathing exercises can help ground you in moments of anxiety. How confident do you feel about trying out these techniques over the next week?

User: I feel pretty confident! I really want to manage my anxiety, and I think these tools will help.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! As we start to wrap up our session today, let’s reflect on the progress you’ve made. What do you feel you’ve learned today that can support your journey moving forward?

User: I’ve learned that I can challenge my thoughts and that I have the confidence to manage my feelings better. And I really like the idea of setting small goals for myself.

Consultant: That’s a significant takeaway, Jiang! Recognizing your ability to challenge thoughts and setting achievable goals can lead to lasting change. Let's make sure to check in on your progress in our next session. 

User: Definitely! Thank you for your support. I feel more hopeful about managing my emotions and engagements.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Keep practicing those strategies, and remember that it’s okay to reach out for support whenever you need it. Until next time, take care!

User: Thank you! I look forward to our next talk.

Consultant: Hello, Jiang! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a mix of excitement and confusion. I've really enjoyed my time in the club activities and I've seen some positive changes in my studies, but I still have some worries about my relationship with that guy back home.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing some positive developments, which is wonderful! But it also seems like there are still some uncertainties regarding your relationship. Can you tell me more about what specific worries you have?

User: Well, I just wonder if things will change too much once we both settle into our college lives. I don’t want to lose what we have, but I’m also unsure if it’s realistic to think it can continue as it is.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It’s natural to question the stability of relationships, especially with changes happening in your life. What would it look like for you to feel secure about this relationship while also embracing your new environments?

User: I guess I want to feel like I can keep the connection without it holding me back. It would be great if we could both have our own experiences here and still share our lives with each other.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective. Maintaining your individuality while nurturing the relationship is important. However, how do you currently feel your connection is allowing you to do this? 

User: Sometimes I feel like I’m too focused on him, and it takes away from my new experiences here. Other times, I worry that being independent could lead to us drifting apart.

Consultant: It sounds like you're in a bit of a tug-of-war between wanting to grow as an individual and maintaining the relationship. Can you identify moments when you felt you were able to balance both? 

User: Yes, like when I shared my experiences from club activities with him. It made me feel connected without losing my own space. But then I also feel guilty if I don’t message him regularly.

Consultant: Sharing your experiences is a wonderful way to nurture your bond! Guilt can sometimes distort our feelings and lead to unhelpful thinking. How do you think guilt impacts your decisions regarding this relationship?

User: It makes me anxious and I often feel obligated to check in more than I want to. I fear he might think I’m not interested if I don’t.

Consultant: That makes sense. It sounds like the guilt is creating pressure on you. How realistic do you think those fears are? Is there a way to communicate your intentions with him to lighten that burden?

User: I think if I talked to him about how I’m feeling, it might help. But I still worry about him thinking I’m pulling away.

Consultant: Communication is key in any relationship. What if you framed the conversation in a way that emphasizes your desire to share your journey while also exploring your independence? 

User: That could work! I could explain that I’m really enjoying college and want to share those experiences with him but need some space to grow too.

Consultant: That sounds like a thoughtful approach! By expressing both your enjoyment of your new experiences and your need for space, you’re opening a door to mutual understanding. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel relieved thinking about it. It feels good to have a plan instead of just worrying. 

Consultant: That’s great to hear, Jiang! Let’s take a moment to reflect on what you’ve just developed. How can this plan help you maintain your connection while still allowing you to grow independently?

User: Well, I guess it means I can build my own path here without feeling guilty. I can keep the relationship alive by sharing but also focus on myself.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’re recognizing the importance of both personal growth and the relationship. How can you maintain this balance moving forward, even as challenges arise?

User: I could set reminders for myself to check in, but also prioritize my activities. That way, I’m being present in both aspects of my life.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic strategy! It emphasizes both commitment and independence. How do you feel about establishing this commitment to yourself?

User: I feel empowered! I want to embrace my college life and still be there for him. I think I can do this.

Consultant: Empowerment is a strong feeling! As we conclude this session, let's summarize what you've accomplished. You've identified a clearer path for nurturing your relationship while prioritizing your personal growth. Would you say you’re leaving this session feeling more equipped for your next steps?

User: Definitely. I’m excited to try out this balance and see how things unfold.

Consultant: I believe in you, Jiang! As you embrace this new chapter, remember that open communication is vital. If any doubts or anxieties resurface, know that you can always reach out. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate this advice. It’s been so helpful.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today's session. I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last discussion?

User: Hello! I think I'm feeling a bit better. I've been trying to focus more on my studies and make plans for the future, but I still have some uncertainties about my career path.

Consultant: That’s a positive step, and it’s great to hear you’re feeling a bit better. It’s completely normal to feel uncertain about the future, especially at this stage in life. Can you tell me more about your current feelings and thoughts regarding your career ambitions?

User: I just feel a bit lost sometimes. My parents are both teachers, and I know they expect me to find a stable job, but I’m not sure if that’s what I want. I feel pressure to meet their expectations, and it makes me anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing a conflict between your desires and your parents' expectations, which is causing you some anxiety. Let’s explore this together. What specific thoughts come to mind when you think about pursuing a career that aligns with your interests versus following your parents' path?

User: I think about how I’ve always admired creative careers, like graphic design or writing, but I worry they won't provide the same stability my parents have. I feel torn between what I enjoy and what I feel I should do.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel torn. You have dreams that resonate with you creatively, but the expectation of stability weighs on you. Can you reflect on what this stability means to you? Is it purely financial, or is there more to it?

User: I think it’s mostly about financial security. I don’t want to struggle to make ends meet, especially since I’ve seen my parents work very hard and have a stable life. 

Consultant: Your desire for financial security is valid, especially when you’ve seen your parents’ hard work pay off. Let’s consider this: what if you could combine your interests with a stable career? What alternative paths might allow you to explore your creativity while still providing the security you seek?

User: Maybe there are options like teaching art or creative writing. That sounds appealing because I would still have some stability, but I could also pursue my interests. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Combining your passion for creativity with a stable role could offer you the best of both worlds. How does thinking about these alternatives affect your anxiety about the future?

User: It makes me feel a bit lighter, actually. It’s nice to think that I don't have to choose one or the other. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s empowering to recognize that multiple paths can lead to fulfillment. What specific steps could you take to explore these creative teaching roles further?

User: I could look into programs or workshops that focus on art education or creative writing. I think just getting some experience in those areas would help.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Immersing yourself in experiences related to your interests will reinforce your confidence and help you determine a path that feels right for you. How might you incorporate this exploration into your current routine?

User: I could set aside some time each week to research and perhaps volunteer at creative programs, even if it's just for a few hours. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Setting aside time for exploration allows you to gradually build a clearer vision of your future while alleviating some anxiety. What feelings arise when you think about this plan of action?

User: I feel excited about it! It feels like I’m taking control of my future instead of just worrying about it.

Consultant: It’s fantastic to feel that sense of control and excitement about your future! This is a significant shift from anxiety to proactive planning. Before we close today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed and outline some actionable goals for you.

User: Sure! So, I will research creative education programs, volunteer my time, and keep focusing on my studies while keeping an open mind about my career.

Consultant: Perfect summary! By taking these actions, you're setting up a clear plan that not only addresses your interests but also works towards your goal of stability. As you keep this momentum, remember to check in with yourself about how you feel through each step.

User: I will. Thank you for helping me see things a bit clearer.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made today. Keep reminding yourself of this excitement and control as you move forward. If any challenges arise, remember I’m here to support you. 

User: Thank you! I look forward to our next session.

Consultant: Me too! I look forward to hearing about your experiences. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jiang! I'm glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good. I’ve settled into college life well and I'm enjoying the experience. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re adapting well. Can you share some specific changes you've noticed in yourself since you started college?

User: I feel more confident when interacting with my peers. I’ve also made some new friends who have really supported me.

Consultant: Making new friends is indeed a great step toward building your support system. How has this support helped you in your day-to-day life at college?

User: My friends and I often study together, which makes it more enjoyable. They’ve also encouraged me to join clubs and participate in activities.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic way to engage with your campus community! How do you feel about your participation in these activities?

User: At first, I was hesitant to join, but now I feel excited. It’s nice to step out of my comfort zone.

Consultant: Stepping out of your comfort zone shows a lot of bravery! What do you believe contributed to this positive change in your mindset?

User: I think my parents' support and my own determination to succeed have played a big role. I also remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: It's great that you've learned to embrace mistakes as part of growth. What kind of strategies do you use to maintain this positive attitude?

User: I try to focus on the lessons I learn rather than the outcomes. I also practice gratitude every day, which helps me stay grounded.

Consultant: Practicing gratitude can be very powerful. How do you typically express that gratitude?

User: I keep a gratitude journal where I write down things I'm thankful for each day. It really helps me shift my perspective.

Consultant: That’s a lovely practice! With all these positive changes, what goals do you have for the future as you continue your college journey?

User: I want to keep building my confidence and also focus on my studies to maintain good grades. I aim to contribute positively in group projects too.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! How do you plan to balance your social activities with your academic responsibilities?

User: I’ve been scheduling my week to include study time and also slots for social activities. It feels more manageable that way.

Consultant: Scheduling can definitely help create a balance! If you find yourself facing difficulties in this balance in the future, how could you address them?

User: I could adjust my schedule and maybe talk to friends about taking breaks when it gets too overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid approach. Remember, it’s okay to communicate your needs. Have you experienced any challenges in implementing this strategy so far?

User: Not really, but sometimes I feel guilty if I take breaks. I guess I need to remind myself that breaks are beneficial.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. Breaks can actually enhance productivity. How have your past experiences shaped your view on taking breaks?

User: In high school, I often pushed through without resting, and it made me feel burnt out. I’ve learned it’s better to take time off when needed.

Consultant: Learning from past experiences is crucial. As you continue on this path, how would you like to sustain your well-being moving forward?

User: I want to continue practicing self-care and connect with my support network whenever I need help or feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Building that connection is vital. How do you see yourself maintaining these relationships in a long-term sense?

User: I plan to reach out regularly and participate in future activities together. I think keeping in touch strengthens bonds.

Consultant: That's a positive perspective. Let's also explore if there are specific resources you might need to support your growth in the coming months.

User: I’d love to receive recommendations for workshops or resources that help with personal development.

Consultant: I can help with that! There are often workshops on time management and personal growth available through the campus. Would you like to look into those?

User: Yes, that would be great! I think those will be very beneficial for me.

Consultant: Excellent! As we wrap up, let’s take a moment to reflect on your progress today. What stands out to you the most from our conversation?

User: I feel proud of the progress I’ve made and reassured to keep focusing on balance and connection with others.

Consultant: That's a wonderful realization, Jiang. It sounds like you’re on a great path to maintaining your mental health. Remember, I'm here for support whenever you need it in the future.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your guidance and feel more equipped to face upcoming challenges.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in your ability to manage your journey. Good luck with everything, and don’t hesitate to return if you need additional support.

User: I will, thanks again! Goodbye! 

Consultant: Goodbye, Jiang! Take care and keep moving forward!
