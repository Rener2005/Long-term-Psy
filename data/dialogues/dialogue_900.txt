Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you're here for our session today. I understand you've been feeling a bit overwhelmed with your studies lately. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite anxious, actually. With all the assignments piling up, I can't shake off this feeling that I'm falling behind. It makes me question my abilities a lot.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like the pressure from your studies is really affecting your confidence. Can you share a bit more about what specifically makes you feel that you’re falling behind?

User: Well, I see my classmates grasping the material so much faster than I do. Whenever I try to study, I feel this nagging thought that I just don't have what it takes to keep up.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way when you compare yourself to others. When you think about not keeping up, what thoughts cross your mind? How do they make you feel?

User: I often think I’m just not intelligent enough. That thought makes me feel really anxious and even a bit hopeless. It’s like I’m stuck, and no matter how hard I try, I can't catch up.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Li. You mentioned feeling hopeless—let's explore that thought a bit deeper. What evidence do you have to support the idea that you're not intelligent enough?

User: I guess there's no concrete evidence—it’s just something I keep telling myself. When I see others succeed, it just reinforces that belief.

Consultant: It's interesting how those thoughts can take over. If a friend came to you with similar feelings of inadequacy, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on their progress and not compare themselves to others. I know that’s what I should do too, but it’s hard to remember in the moment.

Consultant: It sounds like you already have some compassionate advice for others that could also help you. Let’s try to challenge that negative thought you have about yourself. Can we come up with some situations where you have succeeded or felt capable in your studies?

User: Well, I did complete a project that I was really proud of last semester. And I also helped a friend understand a tough topic in class recently.

Consultant: Those are significant achievements, Li! It seems like you have the ability to succeed when you focus. How might reminding yourself of these successes change your perspective on your current struggles?

User: I suppose if I could keep those successes in mind, it might help me feel less pressured. I could remember that I have done well before, so maybe I can again.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s important to celebrate those wins, no matter how small. We can also work on practical strategies to manage your study time better. What activities help you feel more relaxed or focused when you're studying?

User: I find that taking breaks and going for a walk helps clear my mind. But I often feel guilty for taking those breaks because I think I should be studying.

Consultant: It’s a balance, isn’t it? Breaks are essential for maintaining focus and efficiency. How about setting a timer for study intervals, followed by short breaks? This could allow you to study without the guilt of needing to take a break.

User: That sounds like a good idea! I think setting a structure could help me feel more in control of my studying.

Consultant: Exactly! It empowers you to manage your time better and takes some pressure off. As you try this method, I encourage you to reflect on how it makes you feel about your progress.

User: I will definitely try that! I think it could alleviate some of the anxiety.

Consultant: Great! I'm here for you to share how it goes. Also, let’s talk about the feelings you experience when you think of falling behind. What else do you notice beyond anxiety?

User: I sometimes feel frustrated with myself because I expect to understand everything immediately. It’s like I don’t allow myself to learn at my own pace.

Consultant: That's an important realization, Li. It seems you place high expectations on yourself, which can add to those feelings of frustration. What do you think would happen if you allowed yourself the time to learn gradually?

User: I suppose I would feel less stressed. Learning takes time, and I know that deep down. I think I'm just afraid of disappointing myself.

Consultant: It's normal to have those fears, especially when you care about your performance. But remember, learning is a journey, and you have every right to move at your own pace. How can you remind yourself of this during stressful times?

User: Maybe I can create a positive affirmation for myself, like “It’s okay to learn at my own pace.” That might help me when I feel pressured.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Having reminders can greatly help in shifting your mindset. I’d like to encourage you to write it down and keep it in a visible place.

User: I’ll do that! It might help to see those words regularly.

Consultant: Now, as we wrap up our session today, let’s summarize some of the strategies you’re planning to implement. What stands out to you?

User: I’ll focus on acknowledging my achievements, set study intervals, and use positive affirmations. I believe these strategies can help reduce my anxiety and improve my confidence.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan, Li! As you move forward, remember to be gentle with yourself. You’re making progress, and every small step is valuable. If you encounter any challenges, we can explore them together in our next session.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I feel a bit more hopeful about tackling my studies now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li. I’m proud of your efforts today. Keep believing in yourself, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! Welcome to our session today. I understand you've been feeling quite anxious about your academic performance, especially after the recent classroom experience. Can you share a bit more about how you’ve been feeling?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been really anxious since I didn't perform well in class. I worry about how my teachers view me and it's making it hard for me to study. I just feel like I'm not good enough, and that's really frustrating.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly tough. It’s understandable to feel frustrated when you perceive your efforts aren’t yielding the results you want. You mentioned worrying about your teachers' evaluations—can you tell me more about those thoughts when you're studying or in class?

User: I keep thinking that my teachers must think I'm lazy or not smart enough. It feels like everyone's watching me, and it makes me even more anxious during lessons. I feel like I have to prove myself.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts about how you're perceived are adding extra pressure to your studies. When you think, “everyone’s watching me,” how does that make you feel in terms of your ability to focus on the tasks at hand?

User: It definitely makes it harder to focus. I just feel so self-conscious, and then I end up not being able to concentrate on what I'm supposed to learn. It feels like a never-ending cycle of stress.

Consultant: It seems like your anxiety is creating a cycle that makes it challenging to engage fully in your studies. Let’s take a moment to explore some of those automatic thoughts. When you think about your classroom performance, what specific thoughts pop into your mind?

User: I often think that if I mess up again, it will make all my previous efforts pointless. I also have this nagging feeling that I’ll never meet my own expectations or those of my family.

Consultant: Those are very strong beliefs, and I can imagine they can feel overwhelming. Let's consider them a bit more closely. You mentioned that messing up would make your efforts pointless—how realistic do you think that belief is? 

User: Well, I guess it's a bit extreme. I mean, everyone makes mistakes, right? But in my mind, it feels like one failure is just the end of everything.

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s normal to feel that way at times, but let’s question that thought together. If a friend were to come to you and say they felt the same way after a setback, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to fail sometimes and that it doesn’t define their overall ability. I think I would encourage them to keep trying.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! It’s interesting how we can be kinder to others than to ourselves. So what if we tried to apply that same understanding to your situation? Instead of seeing a single setback as a reflection of your worth, could we view it instead as a learning opportunity?

User: I see what you mean. I need to remind myself that one failure doesn’t mean I’m incapable. It’s just one moment in time.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s just one moment, and you have so many opportunities to learn and grow. Let’s think about how we can shift those thoughts into something more empowering. What would it look like for you to think, “I am capable and this is just part of my learning process”?

User: I think if I can adopt that view, it would relieve some pressure. I could focus more on my progress rather than fearing judgment.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic insight! Focusing on your progress is key. Now, let’s discuss some practical steps you can take when you feel overwhelmed. What activities or strategies have you previously used to help you calm down when anxiety hits?

User: I used to go for walks, but I haven’t done that in a while. I could also try listening to music to relax.

Consultant: Those sound like great ideas! Walking can help clear your mind, and music can be a fantastic way to shift your mood. How about we set a goal for you to incorporate one of these activities into your routine this week?

User: That sounds good! I can commit to taking daily walks. It’ll help me clear my head and hopefully improve my focus.

Consultant: That's a wonderful plan! Remember to be gentle with yourself as you integrate these strategies. How do you feel about sharing your new approach with others—maybe friends or family—who can support you in this?

User: I think sharing it with a close friend would be a good idea. It might help me feel accountable to keep going.

Consultant: I love that idea! Sharing your goals with a supportive person can really help reinforce them. Now, before we wrap up, let’s briefly discuss how you can manage any negative feelings about social situations. How do you usually feel when you need to interact with classmates?

User: Honestly, I get nervous talking to them. I worry they won't take me seriously or that I’ll embarrass myself.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Social anxiety can be challenging. But remember, many people share similar feelings. One way to ease into interactions is to start with small talk or shared interests. How do you feel about that?

User: I think starting with small talk could work. I just need to remind myself that they’re just people too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Everyone has their own insecurities, and starting small can help ease the pressure. As we conclude today’s session, what do you feel you’ve learned about yourself and your anxiety?

User: I've realized that I can change my perspective about failure and that I have strategies I can use to manage my anxiety. I need to trust myself more.

Consultant: That's a powerful recognition, Li! Trusting yourself is a crucial part of this journey. Remember, you can always return to these strategies when you feel overwhelmed. I’m really proud of the progress you've made today. If you ever need support, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about facing these challenges now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello Li! I'm pleased to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit anxious, especially during social situations. I doubt my opinions and feel somewhat insignificant compared to others. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing some social anxiety and feelings of inadequacy in those situations. Let’s explore this together. Can you describe a recent social situation where you felt this way?

User: Sure, I was in a group discussion with a few classmates. When it was my turn to share my thoughts, I hesitated and ended up saying less than I wanted to. I felt like no one was really paying attention to me.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It’s tough to feel overlooked, especially when you’re trying to express yourself. What thoughts were running through your mind when you felt like no one was paying attention?

User: I thought maybe my opinions weren't valuable. I also worried that others were judging me and found me unprepared.

Consultant: Those thoughts can feel really heavy. It's understandable to be concerned about how others perceive you. Can we talk about how those beliefs might be impacting your feelings during social interactions?

User: Yes, I think they make me more anxious. When I believe my opinions don’t matter, I feel like I should just remain quiet instead of trying to contribute.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization. So, when you tell yourself that your opinions don’t matter, it affects your confidence. Let’s explore those thoughts further. Do you think there’s evidence to support the idea that your contributions lack value?

User: Well, I guess everyone has their own perspective. Some of my classmates do contribute valuable insights, which makes me question mine.

Consultant: It's important to recognize that everyone has different experiences and insights. It might be helpful to consider what would you say to a friend who felt this way about their opinions?

User: I would tell them that their thoughts are important and that everyone can contribute something unique. 

Consultant: Exactly! You’d encourage them to speak up and share their perspectives. Now, let’s try to apply that kindness to yourself. Can you think of a positive experience where your input was valued in a discussion?

User: I remember during a project last semester, my idea was well-received and even encouraged some of my classmates to think differently. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Your idea had an impact, and it seems like you can offer valuable insights too. How can you remind yourself of that experience the next time you feel anxious in a social setting?

User: Maybe I could write it down and read it before I join discussions. That might help boost my confidence.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Writing down positive affirmations can reinforce your belief in your value during interactions. Let’s think about how we can practice this. Are there any upcoming situations you could prepare for?

User: Yes, there’s a group project meeting next week that I'm anxious about. 

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s plan some ways for you to approach that meeting. We can create some affirmations together based on the positive experiences you’ve had, like the one from last semester. 

User: I like that idea. I could start with something like, “My opinions are valuable and contribute to our discussions.”

Consultant: That’s an excellent start, Li! How about adding, “I have unique insights to offer,” as a reminder of your strength? 

User: Yes, that feels empowering. I’ll try to keep that in mind.

Consultant: Wonderful! Now, let’s discuss some practical steps for that meeting. Are there specific topics you anticipate discussing where you could contribute?

User: Yes, I think we’ll be discussing strategies for our project, and I have some ideas about that. 

Consultant: That’s great to hear! How about preparing a couple of key points in advance that you’d feel comfortable sharing? This might help you feel ready and confident.

User: That sounds helpful. I could write them down beforehand to have something to refer to.

Consultant: Absolutely! Having your thoughts organized can ease anxiety and give you a focus point during the discussion. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds good! I feel like I have more control over what I want to say now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, preparation can be an effective way to build confidence. How about we summarize what we’ve discussed today?

User: Sure! I need to remind myself of my past successes, prepare key points for discussions, and use positive affirmations before social situations.

Consultant: Exactly! These tools will help you build your confidence over time. How do you feel about implementing these strategies in your next interaction with your parents as well?

User: I feel nervous because I still worry about their feedback, but I really want to improve our communication.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. We can incorporate what we've discussed to help you approach those conversations. Remember to practice your affirmations beforehand, and consider what you’d like to express positively.

User: Yes, I’ll keep that in mind. I want to open up more and face their critiques with a positive mindset.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal, Li! You’re making progress. As we continue to work on building your confidence in social situations, I’m here to support you. How are you feeling about our session today?

User: I feel more hopeful and equipped to handle these situations better. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been great to see your growth. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello Li! I'm glad you could join me today. I understand that you're feeling a bit anxious about your communication with your parents. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling lately?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling quite tense lately. I really want to connect with my parents on a deeper level, but I'm worried about being criticized. It makes it hard to open up.

Consultant: That sounds difficult, feeling anxious about opening up to your parents. It's understandable to want to improve those connections. What specific feelings or thoughts come up when you think about having deeper conversations with them?

User: I often think that they might not understand me or that they'll judge my thoughts. It makes me second-guess everything I want to say.

Consultant: It seems like you're carrying a lot of concern about their reactions. Recognizing those fears is an important step. What would it feel like for you if you could express yourself more freely without that worry?

User: I think I would feel more confident and maybe even closer to them. It would be great to share my thoughts without feeling scared.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive goal. Building that confidence can really enhance your relationship with them. Let’s explore what might help you feel more secure and relaxed during those conversations. Have you thought about what kinds of topics you’d like to discuss with them?

User: I really want to talk about my studies and my future plans, but I also want to share how I feel about certain things in our family. It all feels so heavy, though.

Consultant: Sharing heavy feelings can indeed feel daunting. It could help to start with lighter topics and gradually introduce the more serious ones. What do you think about trying a role-play where you practice expressing these feelings?

User: That could be useful. Practicing might help me feel less overwhelmed when the moment comes.

Consultant: Absolutely, practice can be a great way to build confidence. Let's role-play a scenario where you share your feelings about your studies. Imagine you are telling your parents about a challenge you’ve faced recently. What would you say?

User: I might start with something like, "I've been feeling a bit stressed about my classes this semester, and I want to make sure I'm handling it well." 

Consultant: That’s a solid start! It’s clear and sets the tone for an open conversation. How do you think your parents might react to that?

User: I hope they would be understanding. But part of me fears that they’ll just tell me to “toughen up” or not take it seriously.

Consultant: It’s understandable to fear that reaction. What if we rephrase that thought? Instead of assuming they might dismiss your feelings, consider a more balanced perspective. What evidence do we have that they might actually be supportive?

User: Well, they have helped me in the past when I faced challenges. I guess I’m just too focused on the negative possibilities.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! Focusing on past support can shift your perspective. As we work on this, try to remind yourself of those positive experiences. How can you use that realization in your upcoming conversations with them?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that they’ve been supportive before and believe they can do it again. I’ll try to focus on what I want to say instead of worrying about their response.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach! It’s about shifting from uncertainty to clarity about your own feelings. As you prepare for the conversation, what steps can you take to help manage your anxiety?

User: I could write down my thoughts or even practice speaking them out loud ahead of time, so I feel more prepared.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Preparing will help you feel more empowered. How do you feel now about your upcoming discussion with your parents?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful and less anxious, actually. Having a plan makes it seem more manageable.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Let’s acknowledge this positive shift. It’s essential to recognize progress, no matter how small. If you face challenges during the conversation, how will you remind yourself of the strategies we’ve discussed today?

User: I’ll think back on this session and the reasons I wanted to talk with them in the first place. I can also breathe and take a moment to collect my thoughts before responding.

Consultant: Those are valuable tools to have. As we wrap up, remember that it's a process, and being open with your parents can lead to a stronger relationship. You’ve made great progress today, Li. Is there anything else you’d like to explore before we finish?

User: I just want to thank you! This has been really helpful. I feel more equipped to handle the conversation now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It's been a pleasure working with you. Remember, take it one step at a time, and you’re welcome to return anytime you wish. Good luck with your conversation, Li! 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your support.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm really glad to see you today. Last time we talked about the positive feedback you received from your group project and how it helped you recognize your self-worth. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I'm feeling quite good actually. It's really nice to be appreciated by my classmates. I hadn’t thought about how much that recognition could mean to me before.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like this experience has given you a fresh perspective on your value. Can you share a little more about how this recognition has influenced your thoughts or feelings about yourself?

User: Well, I find that I feel more confident when I'm working with others. I’ve even started to initiate small group discussions in my classes, which I didn’t do before.

Consultant: That's a fantastic step, Li! Initiating group discussions shows that you’re embracing your social skills. What about those discussions feels different for you now compared to before?

User: I think I just feel more comfortable expressing my thoughts. Before, I would hesitate to speak up, but now I feel like my opinions do matter.

Consultant: Feeling that your opinions matter is a significant shift. How do you think you can maintain this confidence in your next social interactions or academic activities?

User: I guess I can remind myself of the positive feedback I received and how well the discussions went. Maybe I can set some small goals for participating more actively.

Consultant: Setting small goals sounds like a practical strategy! Can we explore what those goals might look like for you? What would be a manageable step you could take next?

User: Maybe I can aim to contribute at least once in our next group discussions, or even offer to lead a small part of the meeting.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Contributing to discussions and even leading parts can bolster your confidence further. Let’s also think about how to handle any feelings of doubt that might arise. How do you usually respond to negative thoughts about your abilities?

User: I usually just push them aside, but sometimes they do creep back in and make me second-guess myself.

Consultant: It’s normal to have those doubts, but challenging them can be helpful. When you catch yourself doubting your abilities, what could you say to yourself instead?

User: I could remind myself of the praise I received and think about the value I added to the project.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on your strengths and the positive impact you’ve made can really help reframe those negative thoughts. Would you like to practice identifying some of those strengths now?

User: Sure, I think I’m good at organizing discussions and making sure everyone feels included. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful strengths! Let’s focus on how you can build on those skills. How might you use your organizing ability in your upcoming classes or social activities?

User: I could suggest discussion formats that ensure everyone has a chance to share. It might also help to provide a summary at the end, which I think people would appreciate.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Offering to summarize discussions can help others feel more engaged and valued. How does it feel to think about utilizing those skills in such a proactive way?

User: It feels empowering! I’m excited about the possibility of contributing more actively.

Consultant: Empowerment is a powerful feeling! Let’s make sure to keep that momentum. How about we talk about ways to keep track of your progress as you implement these new strategies?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal where I jot down my experiences and feelings after each discussion.

Consultant: A journal is a fantastic tool for reflection! It can help you recognize patterns and celebrate your successes. What would be some key points you’d want to include in your journal entries?

User: I could write about how I felt before and after discussions, any feedback I received, and what went well or didn’t go so well.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Tracking those aspects will give you valuable insight. As we wrap up our session today, what would you say has been the most significant takeaway for you?

User: I’ve realized that I am capable of making positive contributions and that I can handle any doubts I face. I feel much more confident going forward.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Li! It's fantastic that you’ve recognized your capabilities. Moving forward, keep reinforcing that confidence and remember to acknowledge your progress. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss before our next session?

User: No, I think I’m good! I feel excited to apply everything we talked about.

Consultant: Great! I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember, you’ve got this! See you soon, Li!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm so glad to see you again for this session. How have you been since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good actually. I've been participating more in study groups with my friends, which has really helped my confidence in both studying and socializing.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It sounds like you’re making great strides in your social and academic life. Can you tell me how you feel when you participate in those study groups?

User: I feel more engaged and less anxious. Sharing ideas with others makes me realize that I'm not alone in my struggles, and it boosts my confidence.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you’re feeling more engaged and confident. It seems like those interactions have positively impacted your mindset. Have you noticed any changes in how you approach your studies since becoming more involved with your friends?

User: Yes, definitely! I find myself more motivated to study and I’m able to stick to my study plan better. I actually enjoy studying now because it feels more collaborative.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift! Collaborating with others can be really beneficial. How do you think this newfound motivation influences your overall attitude towards studying?

User: It makes studying feel less like a chore. I used to dread opening my textbooks, but now I look forward to learning new things and discussing them with my friends.

Consultant: That’s a remarkable change in perspective! It sounds like you’re not only improving your study habits but also enjoying the process more. Are there any specific challenges you still encounter, or do you feel like you've overcome most of them?

User: I still feel a bit nervous when it comes to speaking up in larger groups or classes. I’m afraid my ideas might not be as good as others.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous in those situations, especially when sharing ideas. Let’s explore that feeling a bit more. What type of thoughts cross your mind when you feel this way?

User: I often think, “What if my contribution is not valuable?” or “What if people judge me?” It makes me hesitant to speak up.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really overwhelming. It’s important to recognize that many people share similar fears. How do you think these thoughts affect your ability to participate in discussions?

User: I think they hold me back. Sometimes I just stay quiet because I’m too scared to speak out loud.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. Let's challenge those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that your contributions wouldn’t be valuable?

User: Well, I guess when I do share, I often get positive feedback. My friends seem to appreciate my input.

Consultant: That’s a key point! It seems like you are actually contributing valuably to discussions. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about their contributions?

User: I’d probably tell them that their ideas are worth sharing and that everyone has unique perspectives.

Consultant: Exactly! You’d encourage them, just like they would encourage you. What could be a small step for you to take to start speaking up more in those larger groups?

User: Maybe I could prepare a few points beforehand so I feel more confident when I speak.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Having prepared points can help boost your confidence. How do you feel about trying that in your next group or class discussion?

User: I feel a bit anxious but also excited. I think it could really help me.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel anxious about stepping out of your comfort zone, but it’s great that you’re open to trying. What else can you do to support yourself in those situations?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that everyone is there to learn.

Consultant: I love that mindset! Mistakes are just part of the learning process. Let’s summarize what you can do to reinforce this growth. You’ll prepare points, remind yourself of the value of your contributions, and give yourself permission to make mistakes. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I feel more equipped to handle it now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we move forward, think about how you can celebrate each time you take that step, no matter how small. How do you feel about your progress today?

User: I feel proud! I’ve come a long way, and it’s nice to recognize that.

Consultant: Absolutely, you should feel proud! You’ve worked hard to build your confidence and engagement. As we wrap up today, what do you think will be your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I think it’s the importance of acknowledging my progress and not letting fear hold me back.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight! Remember, you have all the skills needed to keep progressing. It’s been great working with you. If you ever feel like you need support again, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and I wish you all the best in your studies and interactions. Goodbye for now!
