Consultant: Hello, Ms. Li! I’m glad to see you again today. I know we’ve been exploring your relationship with your mother. How are you feeling after our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling quite guilty about our fight. I want to improve our relationship, but I still feel lonely and anxious about it all.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of emotions—guilt, anxiety, and a longing for connection. Let’s talk more about that. Can you share what specifically has been weighing on your mind since the argument?

User: Well, I keep replaying the argument in my head and imagining what could have been done differently. I just want to reconnect with her but don’t know how.

Consultant: I understand that it can be really tough to navigate those feelings. When you think about reconnecting, what are some specific things you hope to say or do with your mother?

User: I want to apologize for my part in the argument and express how much I care about her. I just hope she’d be willing to listen.

Consultant: That’s a great step to consider! Apologizing can be a powerful way to open up communication. How do you feel about the possibility of approaching her with that message?

User: I’m nervous. What if she responds negatively again? I really don’t want to feel rejected.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. Rejection can be painful. Let's explore that thought. What evidence do you have that she would respond negatively this time?

User: I guess it’s just based on past experiences. She often gets defensive and doesn’t want to talk about emotions.

Consultant: That’s an important observation. It seems like your past experiences are shaping your current feelings. Have you considered how you might approach the conversation differently this time to encourage a more positive dialogue?

User: I haven’t really thought about that. I usually feel overwhelmed when I try to bring up emotions.

Consultant: It can be overwhelming, especially when emotions are involved. What if we brainstorm some ways you might approach her that could help reduce some of that intensity?

User: That sounds good. Maybe I could start by expressing my feelings without directly blaming her?

Consultant: Exactly! Using "I" statements can be a helpful way to express your feelings without sounding accusatory. For example, saying, "I feel anxious and sad about our last conversation," might help her understand where you're coming from. What do you think?

User: That sounds like a good idea. It feels less confrontational.

Consultant: Absolutely! It encourages a more open conversation. It’s also helpful to recognize that the goal is connection, not just resolution. How does that mindset change things for you?

User: It makes me feel like I can approach her without the pressure of having all the answers. I just want to be heard.

Consultant: That's a healthy perspective! Focusing on being heard rather than immediate solutions can decrease that pressure. Would you like to role-play how that conversation might go?

User: Yes, I think that could help me practice my approach.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you’re starting the conversation with your mother. What would you say first?

User: I’d probably start with something like, “Mom, can we talk? I’ve been feeling really sad about how we left things.”

Consultant: That's a strong opening! It sets a gentle tone. What do you think her response might be?

User: I hope she would acknowledge how I feel, but she might be defensive at first.

Consultant: That’s a possibility. If she does respond defensively, how might you react to maintain the connection?

User: I guess I could remind myself to stay calm and reiterate that I just want to express my feelings without blaming her.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Staying calm and reiterating your intentions can help de-escalate the situation. How are you feeling about trying this approach?

User: I feel a bit more confident now. It seems manageable.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Confidence in communication can make a big difference. Let’s recap the strategies we discussed today. What are some key takeaways you can apply when you speak with your mother?

User: I’ll use “I” statements, focus on expressing my feelings, and stay calm even if she gets defensive.

Consultant: Excellent! Those are powerful tools. How do you plan to remind yourself of these strategies before the conversation?

User: I think I could write them down and maybe practice saying them in front of a mirror.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Practicing can help reinforce your confidence. As we wrap up today’s session, how do you feel about the progress we've made?

User: I feel hopeful but a bit anxious about actually having the conversation. But I’m willing to try.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious—change can be challenging. Just remember, you’re taking positive steps towards healing your relationship. I believe in your ability to handle this. If you need support afterward, I’m here for you.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate it. I feel more prepared now and hopeful about what will happen next.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes in our next session. Take care, and remember to be compassionate with yourself during this process.

Consultant: Hello, Li! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better, but there's still a lot of anxiety when I communicate with my mother. We've had some improvements, but there are still moments where we clash.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It's understandable to feel anxious, especially when trying to change long-standing patterns in your communication. Can you tell me more about the improvements you've noticed?

User: Well, I've been trying to stay calm and express my feelings more clearly. Sometimes it works, and we have good conversations, but other times I feel misunderstood, and that leads to arguments.

Consultant: It sounds like you're making progress by expressing your feelings more openly. That's a positive step! When you feel misunderstood, what thoughts go through your mind at that moment?

User: I often think that no matter what I say, she won’t understand me. It makes me feel defeated and anxious.

Consultant: Those thoughts can really impact how you feel and respond. Let's explore those feelings a bit more. What evidence do you have that suggests she won't understand you? Are there any moments when she does?

User: There are times she acknowledges my feelings, and we do connect, but when we disagree, those doubts flood back. It’s like a cycle.

Consultant: I can see how that cycle is frustrating. It's good that you recognize the moments of connection. How did it feel during those times when you connected with her?

User: It feels comforting and hopeful, but it’s hard to hold onto that when the disagreements happen.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s important to hold onto those comforting feelings as a reminder that positive communication is possible. When disagreements arise, do you notice any specific triggers or topics that often lead to tension?

User: Yes, it usually happens when we discuss my career choices. She has strong opinions that clash with what I want for myself.

Consultant: Career discussions can be sensitive, especially when expectations come into play. How do you typically respond when those disagreements start?

User: I usually try to stand my ground, but then I feel guilty and anxious afterwards. It’s like I’m fighting against her.

Consultant: It’s understandable to want to assert yourself, but also feel those emotions afterward. Have you thought about ways to express your opinions while still validating her feelings?

User: That seems hard, but I would like to try. I want to be honest without hurting her.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset, Li! We can work together on developing some phrases or approaches that help you communicate your feelings while respecting her perspective. Would you like to practice some scenarios?

User: Yes, I think that would be really helpful.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s simulate a conversation. Imagine your mother expresses her concerns about your career. How might you respond positively while also standing your ground?

User: I could say something like, "I understand you’re worried about my choices, but I have thought a lot about it and this feels right for me."

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start! It acknowledges her concerns while asserting your feelings. How does that response feel to you?

User: It feels more balanced and less confrontational than how I would normally react.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! This approach can foster a healthier dialogue. Remember, practicing these phrases can help reinforce this positive communication. Would you like to brainstorm more scenarios or perhaps discuss how to handle feedback from her?

User: Yes, handling her feedback is tricky. I tend to take it personally, which amplifies my anxiety.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel that way, especially when dealing with family. One strategy could be to separate her feedback from your identity. What if you practiced reframing it as constructive rather than critical?

User: I see what you mean. Instead of thinking she’s attacking me, I can view it as her expressing concern for my welfare.

Consultant: Exactly! This shift in perspective can reduce that anxiety and guilt you mentioned earlier. Have you thought about how you might respond to criticism in a way that feels empowering?

User: Maybe I could acknowledge her concern first, then explain my point of view more calmly without being defensive.

Consultant: That sounds excellent, Li. It’s a way to acknowledge her feelings while also standing firm in your own. How confident do you feel about implementing these strategies during your next conversation?

User: I feel more hopeful now. I really want to try these new approaches.

Consultant: That's a positive mindset! It sounds like you're ready to take these steps forward. How do you feel about our session today? 

User: I feel like I've gained some valuable skills to work on. However, I’m still a bit anxious about how it will go in practice.

Consultant: That’s completely natural, and it shows how much you care about your relationship with your mother. Keep in mind that progress takes time and practice. You’ve demonstrated a commitment to improving your communication, which is wonderful. 

User: Thank you! I needed that reassurance. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember, it’s okay to experience some anxiety as you work through this. In our next session, we can discuss how it went and any challenges you encountered. Keep focusing on the positive changes!

User: I will. I appreciate your guidance today!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Li. It’s been a pleasure working with you. I look forward to our next session, where we can continue building on your progress. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've noticed some positive changes in my communication with my mother. We’ve started having more constructive conversations, but I still feel anxious about whether this will last.

Consultant: That’s great to hear about the positive shift in your conversations! It’s understandable to feel anxious about sustaining those changes. What specific thoughts or worries do you have regarding your interactions with your mother?

User: I worry that the good communication might just be temporary. I fear that if I slip back into old habits, things will get worse again. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're concerned about losing the progress you've made. Let’s explore that fear further. What would that slipping back look like for you? 

User: I guess it would mean not being able to express myself clearly again, and feeling frustrated or misunderstood. 

Consultant: That makes sense. How does thinking about that possibility make you feel in the moment? 

User: It definitely makes me feel more anxious and insecure. 

Consultant: Acknowledging that anxiety is important. Can you recall any situations recently where you felt your communication with your mother went well? 

User: Yes, there was one time when we discussed my career goals, and she actually listened and shared her thoughts without getting defensive. That felt really good! 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful moment! You were able to express your thoughts, and she responded positively. What thoughts do you have now about how to carry that success forward? 

User: I think I should try to keep our conversations focused on topics I’m passionate about rather than getting into uncomfortable subjects that might trigger negativity. 

Consultant: That's a smart strategy. Keeping the focus on positive subjects can help reinforce good communication. But what about when uncomfortable topics need to be addressed? How do you feel about that? 

User: That’s where I struggle. I’m not sure how to approach those topics without feeling overwhelmed. 

Consultant: It’s natural to feel overwhelmed. Let’s think about how you can prepare for those tougher conversations. What small steps could you take to approach those topics more comfortably? 

User: Maybe I could write down my thoughts beforehand? Having a plan might help. 

Consultant: Writing down your thoughts is a fantastic idea! It can provide clarity and reduce anxiety. How would you feel about sharing your plan with your mother beforehand? 

User: That might actually help her understand where I’m coming from. I hadn’t thought of that! 

Consultant: It’s an effective approach. Open communication can build trust. If she knows what to expect, it might ease the conversation. How do you feel about trying this in your next discussion? 

User: I’m a bit nervous about it, but I think it could be worthwhile. 

Consultant: That’s understandable. Starting with small steps can make it less daunting. What if you outline your main points and practice what you want to say? How does that feel? 

User: Practicing sounds helpful. I can see it making me feel more prepared. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Preparation can significantly reduce anxiety. Besides, developing these skills can empower you to manage similar situations in the future. Does that resonate with you? 

User: Yes, it makes sense! I want to be able to manage these conversations better. 

Consultant: You’re showing a proactive mindset, which is key. It's also important to remind yourself of the positive outcomes from good communication. What can you tell yourself to reinforce your confidence before these talks? 

User: Maybe something like, “I’ve improved my communication and am working hard to maintain it.” 

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation! It emphasizes your journey and progress, helping to build your confidence. How can you incorporate that affirmation into your preparation? 

User: I could write it down and read it before our conversations. 

Consultant: That's an excellent plan! Repeating affirmations can reinforce positive thinking. As we wrap up today, what’s one key takeaway you want to hold on to from our conversation? 

User: I think the idea of preparing and practicing my thoughts before conversations is something I want to use. 

Consultant: That's a valuable takeaway! And remember, it's natural to feel a bit anxious about changes, but you’ve already shown significant growth. As you navigate this journey, what support would you like to seek from me in the future? 

User: I’d like to focus on managing my anxiety and developing more strategies for these conversations in our next sessions. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! We will continue working on those strategies together. Remember, I believe in your ability to handle these situations constructively. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate the support and am looking forward to our next session. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li! I look forward to hearing about your experiences. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! Thanks for asking. I've been trying to be more independent and not rely so much on my mother’s opinions. It's been a bit challenging but I feel a slight boost in confidence.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant step for you! It's common to feel both excited and apprehensive when trying to establish more independence. Can you share more about what kinds of challenges you've been facing?

User: Well, sometimes I feel anxious when I think about making decisions on my own. I worry about whether I'm choosing the right path, and that makes me second-guess myself.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel anxious about decision-making, especially when stepping into independence. Let’s explore this a bit—when you find yourself second-guessing, what thoughts run through your mind?

User: I often think that if I make a mistake, it will disappoint my mother or that I won’t be able to handle the consequences on my own.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy and understandably contribute to your anxiety. What emotions do you feel when those thoughts arise?

User: I usually feel a mix of fear and loneliness. It’s like I want to reach out to someone but I also want to prove to myself that I can do this alone.

Consultant: That’s a very relatable struggle—wanting both support and independence. When you feel that fear and loneliness, how do you usually respond to those feelings?

User: I tend to shut down or avoid making decisions. I’ll wait for my mother’s input instead, even if I don’t want to.

Consultant: Avoidance can often feel like a safe choice but can also reinforce feelings of anxiety and decrease your confidence. What do you think would happen if you tried making those decisions independently, even just small ones?

User: I guess I’d feel less pressure if I didn’t rely on her so much, but the thought still scares me.

Consultant: That makes sense, Li. It can be intimidating to step out of your comfort zone. What if we worked together on some small steps or strategies to help you gradually build confidence in making your own decisions?

User: I’d be open to that. It would help if I had a plan rather than just jumping in.

Consultant: Great! How about we start with identifying a small decision you can make this week? Something that feels manageable yet still allows you to practice independence.

User: Maybe I could decide what to cook for myself this week? I often just go with what my mother suggests.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect place to start! What do you think you would enjoy cooking for yourself?

User: I’ve been wanting to try making a stir-fry. I think it would be fun and not too complicated.

Consultant: Stir-fry sounds delicious and a great choice! As you plan this out, how do you feel about setting a specific day to cook it for yourself?

User: I think I’ll aim for Saturday. That gives me some time to get ingredients and think through the steps.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Setting a specific day is a great way to hold yourself accountable. How will you celebrate this achievement once you cook it?

User: I might treat myself to a nice dessert afterward. It’d be a good way to reward myself for trying something new.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Rewards can really reinforce positive experiences. As you approach this cooking day, what thoughts or feelings come to mind about making this decision independently?

User: I feel a bit excited actually. I think if I can pull this off, it might give me more confidence to make other decisions too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Each small step you take toward independence can lead to greater confidence in yourself. I encourage you to reflect on how you feel after you cook this meal. 

User: I will definitely do that. I’m starting to feel more optimistic thinking about it.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it's okay to feel a mix of emotions as you navigate this journey. How do you plan to manage any fear or anxiety that comes up as you move forward?

User: I think I need to remind myself why I'm doing this. I want to be more self-reliant and not let my fears hold me back.

Consultant: That’s a strong mindset, Li. Keeping your goals in mind can help you push through those uncomfortable feelings. Before we wrap up today, what’s one takeaway you'd like to focus on until our next session?

User: I want to focus on celebrating my independence, even in small ways. Cooking this meal will be a start.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway! I look forward to hearing how it goes. You’re making meaningful strides, and I believe in your ability to manage this journey. If you need support, remember I’m here for you.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. It makes a difference to have someone to talk to.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li. It’s been a pleasure to discuss your progress today. I look forward to our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ms. Li! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a lot better, actually. I recently attended a design training, and it went really well. It gave me a new perspective on my career and helped ease some of my anxiety.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like the training was quite beneficial for you. What specific insights or feelings did you gain from that experience?

User: I realized that I have more potential than I thought. It made me feel more hopeful about my future in design. But I still struggle a bit with family interactions, especially with my mom.

Consultant: It's great that you're feeling hopeful about your career! However, it's understandable to have challenges with family dynamics. Can you tell me more about your relationship with your mom and what specifically makes it difficult for you to connect?

User: My mom tends to criticize my choices, which makes me feel inadequate. I want her approval but also want to pursue my own path. It's conflicting.

Consultant: That sounds very challenging, feeling torn between seeking approval and wanting to follow your own passion. Have you had a conversation with her recently about your career goals or the training you attended?

User: Not yet. I'm afraid she won't understand. I usually keep things to myself because it's easier that way.

Consultant: It's understandable to want to protect yourself from potential criticism. However, sharing your achievements with her might open the door for a more positive conversation. What do you think could happen if you shared your design training experience with her?

User: I suppose it could go either way. She might surprise me and be supportive, but I also worry she could dismiss it.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s some fear around her reaction. Let’s think about some ways to approach the conversation that might help you feel more confident. What if you prepared some points about what you learned and how it relates to your career?

User: That sounds helpful! Preparing might help me stay focused during the conversation.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on the positive aspects of your training can help guide the discussion. Besides, engaging her with your growth may lead to a deeper understanding. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds good. I feel like I need to advocate for myself a bit more.

Consultant: Advocating for yourself is a strong step forward, especially when it comes to pursuing your own goals. Do you feel ready to set a time to have that conversation with her?

User: I think I could do it this weekend. It gives me some time to prepare, and I hope I can express my thoughts clearly.

Consultant: That's a good plan! Just remember to take your time expressing your feelings, and it’s okay to ask for her support. How do you feel thinking about this upcoming conversation?

User: I feel a mix of excitement and anxiety. Part of me is eager to share, but I'm also nervous about the outcome.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way. It shows how much you care about your relationship with your mom. If that anxiety comes up, remind yourself that whatever the outcome, you are taking steps towards your own growth. 

User: That's true. I need to focus on my progress and be proud of my achievements.

Consultant: Absolutely! Celebrating your achievements is important. Would you like to discuss some strategies to help manage the anxiety leading up to the conversation?

User: Yes, I think some techniques could help me calm down before talking to her.

Consultant: One technique could be practicing deep breathing or mindfulness exercises. Taking a few moments to center yourself before the conversation can help reduce anxiety. Would you like me to guide you through a simple breathing exercise now?

User: That would be great. I definitely need to practice calming my mind.

Consultant: Okay, let’s take a moment. Find a comfortable position, and we’ll take a deep breath in through the nose… and slowly exhale out through the mouth. Let’s repeat this a few times, focusing on your breath.

User: (After the exercise) I feel a bit more relaxed now. I think I can use this technique before the talk with my mom.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Practicing this deep breathing can anchor your emotions. Now, is there anything else you’d like to explore today related to your career or family?

User: I’d like to discuss some goals I can set for my design career, especially now that I'm feeling motivated.

Consultant: Setting goals is a great idea. Let’s break that down. What specific areas within your design career would you like to focus on or improve?

User: I’d like to work on building a stronger portfolio and maybe look for freelance opportunities.

Consultant: Excellent goals! Let’s look at a practical way to start. How about setting a timeline for updating your portfolio and searching for freelance gigs? What do you think would be a realistic timeline?

User: I think I could aim to update my portfolio over the next month and start applying for gigs after that.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Breaking it down into manageable timeframes will help keep you motivated. How will you track your progress towards these goals?

User: Maybe I can create a checklist or a schedule to keep myself accountable.

Consultant: A checklist is a great idea! It can help you see your progress as you check off each item. Eventually, this accountability will enhance your confidence as you move forward. 

User: I feel more organized already. I'm excited to start working on these goals.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s progress, not perfection. As you work on these goals, also keep checking in with your feelings towards your mom and use your breathing techniques as you prepare for that conversation. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate the support and strategies. I feel more empowered now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been great discussing your insights and plans today. Let’s continue to build on this momentum in our next session. If you feel comfortable, we can review how the conversation with your mom went and tackle your goals further.

User: I’d like that! I’ll see you then.

Consultant: Looking forward to it! Take care of yourself, and remember to celebrate the progress you’re making.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ms. Li! I'm glad to see you again. I hope you've been well since our last session. Can you share with me how things have been for you lately?

User: Hi. I'm feeling pretty good actually. The interactions with my mother have improved a lot, and I find it easier to have daily conversations with her. It has made my life feel more peaceful.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like your relationship with your mother is on a positive path. How does that make you feel in terms of your overall mood and well-being?

User: I feel a sense of relief and hope. I used to carry a lot of emotional weight, but now I feel lighter and more open to the future.

Consultant: That’s a significant change, and it’s great to know you feel more hopeful. Keeping this positive momentum is important. Are there any particular challenges or concerns that have come up as a result of these changes?

User: I sometimes worry that this improvement might be temporary. I’m afraid of falling back into old patterns of anxiety and isolation.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those kinds of concerns, especially after experiencing positive changes. Let's explore what strategies you might use to maintain this progress and keep those old patterns at bay. What do you think has contributed to your improved relationship with your mother?

User: I think we've both made an effort to communicate better. I've also tried to be more understanding and patient.

Consultant: That's insightful. Open and patient communication is crucial in any relationship. How do you feel about applying these same principles to other aspects of your life, particularly during challenging times?

User: I guess I could be more patient with myself. I tend to rush things and feel like I should be better immediately, especially in my work.

Consultant: That’s a very valid realization. It's important to allow yourself the same grace you offer to others. What would it look like for you to practice more patience with yourself in your work?

User: Maybe I could set more realistic goals and not pressure myself so much. It would help to break tasks into smaller steps instead of trying to tackle everything at once.

Consultant: Absolutely! Breaking tasks into manageable steps can significantly reduce feelings of overwhelm. How do you feel about implementing this strategy in your daily routine?

User: I think it would make a big difference. I often feel so pressured that I end up procrastinating, which makes everything worse.

Consultant: Exactly! Procrastination often stems from feeling overwhelmed. By simplifying your tasks, you create a smoother path towards productivity. Do you have any specific steps in mind that you want to try starting this week?

User: I think I’ll start by mapping out my tasks for the week. I can prioritize them and set small, achievable goals for each day.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Mapping out your tasks and prioritizing them can help you stay organized and focused. How do you anticipate you might feel once you start this new approach?

User: I hope I’ll feel less anxious and more accomplished. Just thinking about it makes me feel a bit more at ease.

Consultant: That’s a positive sign! It demonstrates the power of your actions in shaping your feelings. As we move forward, let’s also consider how to manage any potential setbacks. Would you like to explore some strategies together?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful. I want to be prepared if I start feeling anxious again.

Consultant: A proactive approach is key. We can develop a few strategies, like grounding techniques or self-compassion exercises, that you can use whenever you feel those anxious thoughts creeping in. Have you tried any techniques like that before?

User: I've heard of deep breathing and mindfulness but haven’t practiced them regularly.

Consultant: Those techniques can be very effective! Perhaps we can integrate them into your daily routine. Would you be open to setting aside a few minutes each day for some deep breathing or mindfulness exercises?

User: Sure, I can try that. It sounds manageable.

Consultant: That’s excellent! Committing just a few minutes daily can really help. Additionally, as you work on your tasks and practice these techniques, how do you plan to reward yourself for your progress?

User: I think I could treat myself to something small, like a nice snack or some time to relax and watch a show I enjoy.

Consultant: Perfect! Recognizing your efforts is important in maintaining motivation. Celebrating small victories can help reinforce positive behaviors. Do you feel prepared to implement all the strategies we’ve discussed today?

User: Yes, I feel more confident about putting these plans into action. Thank you for the guidance!

Consultant: You’ve done great work today, Ms. Li. As we wrap up this session, let’s reflect on your progress and the strategies we discussed. How do you feel about the steps you’re taking moving forward?

User: I feel hopeful and excited. I believe I can maintain this momentum and manage my anxiety better.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. You have the tools and strategies to handle future challenges. If you ever need support, I'm here for you. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It's been a pleasure to see your progress. If you ever need to talk again, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care!
