Consultant: Hello, welcome to today's session, Chen Jie. Before we start, I’d like to check in on how you’ve been feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really down. I thought college would be exciting, but it just feels so dull. I’ve lost interest in everything, and I find it hard to connect with others.

Consultant: I hear you, it sounds like you're feeling a bit disconnected and disappointed with your college experience. Can you tell me more about what specifically feels dull to you?

User: I expected to meet new people and have fun, but it’s just lectures and studying. I feel like I’m just going through the motions. Sometimes, I even think about how meaningless everything feels.

Consultant: That sounds really overwhelming, experiencing a lack of excitement and meaning in your daily life. It’s understandable to feel lost in such a situation. Have there been specific moments or experiences lately that made you feel particularly low?

User: Just every day feels the same. I sit through classes, and I can’t get motivated to study. Socializing seems exhausting. Sometimes, I just wish things would end.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that it’s been so tough for you, Chen Jie. It sounds like you’re feeling quite overwhelmed and possibly discouraged about social interactions. Let's explore these feelings a bit more. What kind of thoughts cross your mind when you think about socializing or engaging in activities?

User: I think no one would want to be around me. I feel like I’m not interesting enough, and my insecurities just keep me from trying.

Consultant: It must be really challenging to feel that way about yourself. It seems like your thoughts are leading you to avoid social situations out of fear. Can you recall a recent instance when you felt like this?

User: Last week, there was a casual gathering organized by some classmates but I didn’t go. I just convinced myself it would be awkward and that no one would miss me.

Consultant: That sounds like a difficult decision to make. You’re not alone in feeling anxious about social gatherings. Let’s take a moment to challenge those thoughts. Can we explore how valid those beliefs are? What evidence do you have that people wouldn’t have missed you?

User: I guess I’m not sure, but it just feels like others have closer friendships than I do. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way, especially during times of transition. What if we thought about this from a different perspective? If a friend felt similarly, what would you say to encourage them to go?

User: I’d probably tell them to just give it a try and that their presence matters.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you see value in being present and connecting with others, even if it feels difficult for you personally. How can we apply that same kind of encouragement to your situation?

User: I guess I could try to remind myself that I might be surprised by how people respond. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It’s about giving yourself the chance to experience those connections. What might be a small step you could take to try engaging a little more?

User: Maybe I could ask one of my classmates to study together instead of going to a large gathering first.

Consultant: I love that idea! It allows you to connect in a way that feels more manageable. How does that make you feel about taking that step?

User: It’s a little scary but also exciting. I haven’t really reached out to anyone one-on-one yet.

Consultant: It’s perfectly natural to feel scared, but trying smaller interactions can be a wonderful start. Remember, even if it feels uncomfortable, you have every right to seek connection. What kind of feelings do you think will come up if you reach out?

User: I might feel nervous, but maybe some relief too. 

Consultant: Absolutely! A mix of nerves and relief is common. Let’s think about how you can prepare for that interaction. What might you say to initiate a study session?

User: I could just say I’m looking for a study partner for our next exam and see if they're interested.

Consultant: That sounds straightforward and friendly! Focusing on common interests like studying can help ease into the conversation. How do you feel about setting this as a goal for the week?

User: I think I can do that. I’ll try to reach out to someone.

Consultant: Fantastic! Remember to be kind to yourself through this process. It’s all about taking those small steps. We can discuss how it goes in our next session. Is there anything else on your mind today?

User: Just thinking about how much I hope this actually helps me feel better.

Consultant: It’s perfectly okay to hope and worry about outcomes. Just remember, it's the journey of trying that counts. Each small step can lead to progress. Thank you for sharing today, Chen Jie. You're making brave choices, and I look forward to hearing about how your efforts go in our next meeting.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: Hello, Chen Jie! I'm glad you’re here today. Let’s start by discussing how you’ve been feeling recently and what’s been on your mind.

User: Hi. I've been feeling really down lately, especially when trying to join club activities at school. I keep feeling like I don't belong and it's really overwhelming.

Consultant: It sounds tough, feeling that way when you’re trying to connect with others. Can you tell me a little more about those feelings? What has stood out to you in those situations?

User: I just feel this sense of rejection. Even when I try to engage, it seems like others aren't interested in me, and it makes me retreat even more.

Consultant: I understand how that can lead to feeling rejected and discouraged. That’s a painful experience. What thoughts go through your mind when you feel this rejection in social situations?

User: I often think that nobody actually wants me around, and that I must be annoying or uninteresting. It hits my confidence hard.

Consultant: It makes sense that those thoughts would impact your confidence. Can we look at these thoughts together? For example, how true do you think it is that nobody wants you around? 

User: I guess I don’t know for sure. But it feels very real in the moment. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way based on your experiences, but feelings can sometimes lead us to believe things that might not be true. What would you say to a friend if they were feeling the same way?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s not true; that they are worthy and someone out there will appreciate them.

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate response. So, if you were to apply that same kindness to yourself, how might your perspective change about your belonging in social situations?

User: I guess it could help me see that my presence does matter to some, and not everyone will reject me. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to challenge those negative beliefs. Now, let’s think about some small steps you could take in social settings. Are there any small interactions you could try to ease into the group better?

User: Maybe I could try to talk to one or two people at the next club meeting instead of trying to engage with everyone at once.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Focusing on just a couple of people is a manageable approach. How do you feel about trying that?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also a little hopeful. 

Consultant: It’s normal to feel nervous about trying something new. Let’s also think about a way to cope with that nervousness. What could help you feel a bit more confident before you enter the meeting?

User: Maybe I could remind myself of what I would say to a friend in that situation or even just take a few deep breaths. 

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Remembering to be kind to yourself can also help. Can you name a few positive things about yourself that you can hold onto when you’re feeling anxious?

User: I think I’m creative and I care about people. Those are good traits.

Consultant: Absolutely! Embracing those qualities can help you feel more grounded. In terms of your feelings about being part of the clubs, have you noticed any patterns in how you react when you believe you might be rejected?

User: I often want to just leave or avoid going altogether, which just makes it worse. I feel so stuck in that cycle.

Consultant: That’s a common reaction. Avoiding can temporarily ease the discomfort, but it can lead to feeling more isolated. What do you think would happen if you decided to stay and engage, even if it was just for a bit?

User: I guess I might discover that it’s not as bad as I thought. There’s a chance some people might be welcoming.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! You might be surprised by the positive interactions you can have. How can you remind yourself of this when the urge to avoid comes up?

User: Maybe I could write down that positive thought and keep it with me, so I can read it before going into these situations.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Having a tangible reminder can help reinforce those positive beliefs. As we discuss these strategies, I want to reflect on your progress today. What do you think is the biggest takeaway from our session so far?

User: I think I’ve realized that I need to challenge my negative thoughts more and take steps to engage, even when it's uncomfortable. 

Consultant: That’s a significant realization, Chen Jie! You’re showing incredible openness to change. As we continue our work together, what are some specific goals you’d like to set for yourself in the coming weeks regarding these situations?

User: I want to try attending at least two club meetings and talk to at least two new people each time.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic target! Setting those goals makes them more attainable. As we wrap up our session today, let’s talk about how you can keep building on this progress. How do you plan to maintain this new mindset and approach?

User: I think keeping a journal of my feelings and experiences could help, along with reminding myself of my worth. 

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies to reinforce your growth! Remember, it's okay to take small steps. I believe in your ability to navigate these feelings. If these challenges come up again, just know you can always come back for support. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to hear that. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Chen Jie! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit better since I joined that study group. It's nice to connect with others, but I still find myself feeling down sometimes.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear you're feeling a bit better and enjoying the group! It's a positive step towards connecting with others. Can you share what aspects of the group you find enjoyable?

User: I like that we can share ideas and help each other out. It feels nice to have a supportive environment. But sometimes, I still get really anxious about not fitting in.

Consultant: That makes sense. Seeking a sense of belonging can bring up some anxiety. When you feel anxious about fitting in, what thoughts go through your mind?

User: I often think that maybe I'm not good enough, or that they'll see I'm not as smart as they are. 

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like you might be experiencing some negative thoughts about your abilities. What feelings do those thoughts evoke in you? 

User: They mostly make me feel worthless and overwhelmed. It’s exhausting.

Consultant: That exhaustion can be really tough to manage. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more—what evidence do you have that supports them? Could there be other ways to interpret your experiences in the group?

User: I guess I sometimes get good feedback from them, but those negative thoughts just drown it out. It feels like those aren't true.

Consultant: It's excellent that you’re recognizing some positive feedback! Could we practice reframing those negative thoughts together? If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I would tell them that everyone has strengths and weaknesses and that they shouldn't compare themselves to others.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! Remembering to view yourself with kindness, just as you would for a friend, can be powerful. How do you think you can incorporate this mindset into your daily life?

User: I guess I could try to remind myself that I have my own strengths and that it's okay to not be perfect.

Consultant: Absolutely! Acknowledging your strengths can foster a more positive self-view. What strengths do you feel proud of at this moment?

User: I really enjoy helping others and sharing knowledge. I think I’m good at explaining things in a way that makes them easier to understand.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strength! It sounds like you have a lot to offer in those group dynamics. Let's use that as a foundation. How might focusing on your strengths help reduce feelings of anxiety in the group?

User: It might help me feel more confident and less focused on trying to be perfect.

Consultant: Exactly! Focus on what you bring to the table. Moving forward, let's set some actionable steps for you to practice this week. What activities can you engage in to celebrate your strengths in the group?

User: Maybe I could offer to lead a discussion or help explain a topic. That could be fun!

Consultant: That sounds like a brilliant idea! Leading a discussion can definitely showcase your strengths. How do you feel about setting that goal for the upcoming week?

User: I feel excited about it! But I’m also a little scared.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel a bit scared. What do you think might help you manage that fear when the time comes?

User: I could prepare what I want to say ahead of time, and remind myself that it's okay if things don't go perfectly.

Consultant: Preparing in advance is a great strategy! And you're right; it’s important to allow room for imperfection. Let’s wrap up by discussing how you plan to reflect on this experience afterward. What will you be looking for in terms of your feelings and thoughts?

User: I want to see if I feel less anxious and more engaged. I hope to recognize any negative thoughts and not let them take over.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Self-reflection can help you track your progress. Keep practicing these strategies, and remember, I’m here to support you. We can continue to build on what we’ve achieved today in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’m looking forward to trying out these strategies. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Chen Jie. It's wonderful to hear your enthusiasm. Keep embracing those positive moments, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time!

Consultant: Hello, Chen Jie! I’m really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good lately. Participating in that volunteer activity gave me a sense of purpose and accomplishment that I haven't felt in a long time. But I still worry about losing this positive change.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that the volunteer experience had such a positive impact on you. You mentioned worry about losing this progress. Can you share more about what specifically concerns you?

User: I guess I’m just afraid that once the volunteering is over, I’ll slide back into my old routine, which felt pretty meaningless. I really want to keep this positive momentum going.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It's common to worry about reverting back to old patterns after experiencing positive changes. Let’s explore how you can maintain this momentum. What aspects of the volunteer work did you find most meaningful?

User: I felt like I was really helping others, and that made my own problems seem smaller. It also made me appreciate my own life more.

Consultant: That’s a lovely realization. Helping others can often provide a new perspective on our own challenges. How can you integrate this sense of appreciation and meaningfulness into your daily life moving forward?

User: Maybe I could look for more volunteer opportunities or find ways to help others in my community. It would give me something to focus on outside of school.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Volunteering can be an excellent way to reinforce that sense of purpose. Besides volunteering, what other values or activities bring you joy and fulfillment?

User: I’ve always enjoyed art, but I haven't made much time for it lately. I think expressing myself through creative outlets could help me, too.

Consultant: Art can be a powerful way to process emotions and express yourself. What if you set aside a specific time each week to engage in this creative activity? How would that affect your mood and outlook?

User: I think it would definitely help. Having something to look forward to might keep me grounded and happy.

Consultant: That’s a positive connection! Establishing regular creative expression can help you maintain that uplifted feeling. Now, let’s consider your goals. What specific goals could you set for both your volunteering and your art to ensure you stay connected to these fulfilling activities?

User: For volunteering, I’d like to commit to one activity every month, and for art, maybe I could set aside two hours every weekend to create something, whether it's drawing, painting, or even crafts.

Consultant: Those are excellent, achievable goals! Committing to specific actions can provide structure and help you keep that sense of purpose. How do you feel about these commitments moving forward?

User: I feel really good about them. Setting these goals makes everything feel more manageable, and I’m excited to get started.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It sounds like you’re on the right path. Let’s talk about potential challenges. What do you think might interfere with you sticking to these commitments, and how can we tackle that together?

User: I worry that if school gets too overwhelming, I might push these aside. Sometimes I get caught up in anxiety about grades.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It’s important to find a balance between your commitments. Perhaps we can develop a strategy for managing your time so that schoolwork doesn't overshadow your personal goals. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I think if I plan my weeks better, I can find time for both my studies and the things that bring me joy.

Consultant: Planning and time management can definitely help. Would you like to brainstorm some specific ways to organize your week to include both studying and your personal activities?

User: Yes, I could try making a weekly schedule, blocking out time for studying, volunteering, and art. I think seeing it all laid out could keep me focused.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! A visual schedule often makes it easier to stick to commitments. How about we outline what your ideal week might look like together, incorporating these elements?

User: Okay! I’d like to have weekday evenings for study, maybe Friday for volunteering, and set aside Saturday for art. That way, I still have my Sundays free to relax.

Consultant: That sounds balanced! You’re creating space for both responsibilities and self-care. As you implement this schedule, how can we ensure you stay motivated and check in on your progress?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal to reflect on each week, noting what I accomplished and how I felt about it. I could even include any challenges I faced.

Consultant: Keeping a journal is an excellent idea! It will help you to reflect on your experiences and stay connected to your progress. You could also revisit your goals each week and adjust them as needed. How does that resonate with you?

User: I think that will be really helpful. I want to be able to adapt my goals instead of getting discouraged if something doesn’t go as planned.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! Flexibility is key in maintaining motivation. Before we wrap up, what are the most important takeaways from today’s session? What do you feel you’re leaving with?

User: I’m feeling more confident about managing my time and committing to activities that make me happy. I now have a plan to keep my positive mindset going, and I’m excited about it!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Chen Jie! You’ve made considerable progress today in solidifying your goals and plans. Let’s set a goal to review your progress in our next session. Keep in mind that it’s okay to seek support if challenges arise. 

User: Absolutely! Thank you so much for your help today. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, I’m here to support you. I look forward to hearing about your journey in our next meeting. Take care of yourself!

Consultant: Hello, Chen Jie! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing better, actually. I feel a bit more confident about my studies and have been getting some positive feedback from my classmates.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made some progress. Can you share more about the specific feedback you received and how it made you feel?

User: Sure! I got a compliment from a classmate on my project presentation, and it really boosted my confidence. I hadn't realized I was doing that well. 

Consultant: It’s great that you recognized your efforts and received validation from others. How does this positive feedback affect your motivation to continue working on your studies?

User: I feel more motivated now. I think I’m starting to enjoy learning a bit more and seeing that my hard work is paying off.

Consultant: Enjoying the learning process is such a positive shift! Can you reflect on what specific changes you've made in your study habits or mindset that contributed to this improvement?

User: I’ve been trying to set smaller, achievable goals for myself instead of overwhelming myself with the big picture. It feels less daunting that way.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Breaking things down can really help manage anxiety and keep you focused. What are some of the small goals you’ve set for yourself recently?

User: I’ve been trying to study for shorter periods with breaks in between, and I’ve been setting daily study targets. Just little things, but they help!

Consultant: Those small goals can lead to significant changes over time. How do you feel at the end of the day after accomplishing these targets?

User: I feel a sense of achievement, which is nice. It’s kind of motivating to see that I’m making progress, even if it’s slow.

Consultant: That sense of achievement is important for maintaining motivation. How do you plan to keep up this momentum moving forward?

User: I think I’ll continue setting those small goals. Maybe also reward myself a bit when I hit them to stay motivated!

Consultant: Rewards can be a great way to reinforce positive behavior. What kind of rewards do you think would work for you?

User: Probably something small, like taking some time to watch a show or treat myself to a snack after a study session.

Consultant: That sounds like a nice way to treat yourself! As we reflect on everything we’ve discussed, how do you feel about your overall growth and the direction you’re heading in?

User: I feel optimistic! I’m starting to see that I can turn things around and make my college experience fulfilling.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Chen Jie! It’s vital to recognize your potential. Let's create a plan for your continued development. What areas do you feel you’d like to focus on moving forward?

User: I’d like to focus on maintaining my motivation and also working on my social connections. I still feel a bit lonely at times.

Consultant: Strengthening social connections is a wonderful goal. What steps do you think you could take to build more relationships with your peers?

User: Maybe I could join some clubs or study groups. That way, I can meet more people who share my interests.

Consultant: Joining clubs and study groups sounds like a great idea! It provides a space to interact and connect. What clubs are you interested in?

User: I’m thinking about joining a book club or perhaps something related to my major, like a student organization.

Consultant: Both options sound promising! They could enrich your experience and help you develop friendships. What do you think would be your first step toward joining one?

User: I’ll look into the schedules for the clubs and see which meetings I can attend this week.

Consultant: That’s a great first step! Remember, putting yourself out there is key. As we wrap up today, let’s take a moment to reflect on your achievements and what you've learned in this process.

User: I’ve learned that setting small, manageable goals really helps me stay motivated and that it’s okay to reach out and build connections.

Consultant: Absolutely, those are valuable lessons! Moving forward, how can you ensure that you continue applying what you’ve learned?

User: I can keep reminding myself of the importance of these strategies, and I’ll keep a journal or something to track my progress.

Consultant: Keeping track of your progress is a great choice! It gives you a tangible way to see how far you've come and identify what works best for you. 

User: Yes, I think that would be really helpful. I feel excited about the future now!

Consultant: I’m very pleased to hear that, Chen Jie! You’ve made significant progress, and I believe in your ability to keep moving forward. If you ever feel overwhelmed, you can always revisit these strategies. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate all the support and guidance. 

Consultant: It was my pleasure, and I’m glad I could help. Remember that you have the tools to manage your journey. Good luck, and take care!

User: Thank you! I’ll be sure to put everything we talked about into practice.
