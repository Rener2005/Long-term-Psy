Consultant: Hello, Yi Yi! Welcome back. It's good to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling really down. I keep thinking about my exam grades and how disappointed my parents must be. It's like there's this voice in my head telling me I'm just not good enough.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like those thoughts are really weighing on you. Let's talk a bit about what you've been experiencing—what thoughts come to mind when you're feeling this self-doubt? 

User: I just keep replaying my exam results over and over. I think about all the effort I put in and how it didn't pay off. It makes me feel like I'm a failure, and like I let everyone down.

Consultant: I can understand why you would feel that way—it's natural to feel disappointed when things don't go as planned. But let's explore those thoughts a bit more. Can you identify any specific phrases or messages that come to you during those moments?

User: I hear things like, "You should have studied harder," or "Why can't you be more like other students?" It's like my mind is constantly criticizing me.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really harsh and can definitely contribute to your feelings of self-doubt. Have you noticed how those thoughts affect your emotions and actions? 

User: Yes! When I think those things, I feel really sad and anxious. Sometimes, I don’t even want to go to school because I'm afraid of what others might think of me.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense, Yi Yi. Avoiding situations that make us anxious is a common response. Let's think together about how we might challenge some of those critical thoughts. What evidence do you think supports or contradicts the idea that you're a failure? 

User: Well, I did try hard in other subjects and I have done well in the past. It's just this one exam that makes me feel awful.

Consultant: That's an important observation! Yes, you’re more than one exam and you have had successes in your studies. If a friend came to you with similar feelings, what would you tell them?

User: I guess I would tell them that one bad grade doesn’t define their worth. I would encourage them to keep trying.

Consultant: Exactly! You have such a supportive approach. It’s great to hear you recognize that. What if we tried to apply that same kindness to yourself? How would that change your internal dialogue when you think of your exam?

User: I think it might help if I told myself that it’s okay to mess up sometimes and that I can learn from it instead of just thinking I'm a failure.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful and more positive perspective, Yi Yi! Shifting from self-criticism to self-compassion can take practice but is very powerful. Let’s also reflect on the voices you mentioned earlier. Can you share more about when those happen and what they say? 

User: They usually come when I’m alone or stressed. They just echo everything negative I feel about myself, urging me to give up.

Consultant: Those voices can be very challenging to deal with. It might be helpful to start noticing when you hear them and what triggers them. By doing so, we might be able to understand their origins and challenge them effectively. 

User: I hadn’t thought of it that way. I guess I do hear them more when I'm feeling down or isolated.

Consultant: That’s insightful! Recognizing those triggers is a crucial step. When you notice those moments, try to take a moment to question what you’re hearing. Ask yourself, “Is this thought really true?” or “What would I say to a friend in my situation?”

User: I can try that. It seems like it could help to step back and question my thoughts, rather than just accepting them.

Consultant: Yes, questioning those thoughts can empower you! Remember, thoughts are not facts; they’re just interpretations. Do you think you can practice this until our next session?

User: I think I can! It sounds like it might help me feel less overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Also, it might be beneficial to jot down these thoughts and your responses in a journal. Writing can help you to process feelings more effectively.

User: I like that idea. I often keep my feelings to myself, so writing could be a good way to let it out.

Consultant: Absolutely! Journaling can be a safe space for you to explore your feelings and thoughts. You’re doing so well in acknowledging these challenges, Yi Yi. 

User: Thank you! It helps to talk about these things. I didn’t realize how helpful it could be to share my thoughts. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that your experience has been positive! Remember that opening up takes courage, and you're making significant progress. 

User: It feels good to know that. I hope I can continue to improve my self-talk.

Consultant: You definitely can, and I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Let's plan to check in on your journaling and reflections next time. 

User: Sounds good! I’m looking forward to it. 

Consultant: Me too, Yi Yi. Remember, you are not alone in this; together we’ll work through it. Until next time, take care! 

User: Thanks! I’ll see you soon!

Consultant: Hi Yi Yi! Welcome back to our session. It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last talk?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit more confused and anxious lately, especially when I try to interact with my classmates. It seems like every time I talk to someone, I get really worried about what they think of me.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like the concern over how others perceive you is weighing heavily on your mind. Can you share a specific situation where you felt this way recently?

User: Well, just the other day, I tried to join a group of classmates during lunch, but I thought they were laughing at me. I felt really embarrassed and ended up sitting alone again.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Yi Yi. It’s understandable to feel embarrassed in those situations. What thoughts were going through your mind when you felt they were laughing at you?

User: I thought they were making fun of me because I’m different. I kept thinking, “They must think I’m weird and I don’t belong with them.”

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite painful. It's important to recognize how these feelings affect you. Did you notice how that thought made you feel in the moment?

User: I felt really anxious and sad. It makes me not want to try to connect with them anymore.

Consultant: It’s tough when those feelings prevent you from reaching out. Let's explore this thought a bit more. What evidence do you have that they were really laughing at you?

User: I don’t know... Maybe they weren't laughing at me, but it just felt that way at the time.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Yi Yi. It seems like your feelings may have impacted your perception of the situation. If a friend was in your place, what would you tell them about those kinds of thoughts?

User: I would probably say they shouldn’t take it personally and that it might not be as bad as it seems.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s often easier to speak kindly to a friend than to ourselves. How do you think you could remind yourself of that when you're feeling anxious about interacting with others?

User: Maybe I could write it down or say it to myself in my head when I start feeling anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a helpful strategy. Writing it down can help reinforce those positive thoughts. Let’s practice a little role-playing. Can you think of a simple way to start a conversation with a classmate?

User: I guess I could just say hello and ask them about their favorite subject.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! Let’s role-play that scenario. I’ll be your classmate. Go ahead whenever you’re ready.

User: Um, hi! What’s your favorite subject?

Consultant: Hi Yi Yi! I really enjoy science. How about you?

User: I’m not sure… I think I like art. 

Consultant: That’s cool! Art is a great subject. What do you like to create?

User: I like painting, but I’m not very good at it.

Consultant: It’s okay not to be perfect! What matters is that you enjoy it. How did that feel to talk to me just now?

User: It felt a bit easier than I expected. Maybe I can try that with someone at school.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s all about practice. Each time you try it, it may feel more natural. Do you think you could try this conversation technique in the next few days?

User: Yeah, I think I could. I’ll give it a shot!

Consultant: I’m proud of you for taking that step, Yi Yi. Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous, but try to focus on the fun of getting to know others. How about we touch base on how it went in our next session?

User: That sounds good! I’ll try to remember what we talked about.

Consultant: Perfect! As we wrap up, let's quickly summarize what we've worked on today. We looked at those negative thoughts about others and practiced starting conversations. How do you feel about what you’ve learned?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful and ready to try talking more. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Yi Yi. I believe in your ability to connect with others. Remember to be kind to yourself in this process. I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes. 

User: Thank you! I can’t wait to share my experiences next time.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing today, Yi Yi! Remember, I'm here for you, and it’s okay to take things one step at a time. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Yi Yi! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately regarding your studies and other activities?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really stressed after failing my recent mock exam. I just feel doubted about my abilities, and it's hard to even think about studying.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience has made you question yourself more, which is completely understandable. Can you tell me more about what you're feeling specifically after that exam?

User: I just feel lost. I thought I was preparing well, but failing made me feel like I'll never get better and that I’m a disappointment.

Consultant: I can see how disappointing that must feel, especially after putting in your effort. What are some thoughts that come to your mind when you think about studying now?

User: I keep thinking that no matter how much I try, I’ll never understand the material or do well in exams. It’s really discouraging.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy to carry. It seems like they're making it hard for you to find motivation. Let's try to look at them together. What evidence do you have that you won’t improve, or that you don't understand the material?

User: I guess I don't have solid evidence. I just feel like I don’t get the grades I want. It feels like proof that I’m not good enough.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, but grades don’t define your abilities. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their feelings and worries?

User: I would probably tell them to keep trying and not to give up, that it’s normal to struggle sometimes.

Consultant: Exactly! You would encourage them to keep pushing forward, right? What if you could give yourself the same kindness and understanding? 

User: I think I could try that. But it’s still hard for me to feel that way about myself.

Consultant: I completely understand, and it's okay to find it difficult. Let’s focus on creating a learning plan together that breaks your studying into smaller, manageable pieces. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good, I think smaller steps might help.

Consultant: Great! What subjects do you want to focus on first? And let’s also think about how you can reward yourself for completing those smaller tasks.

User: I really want to work on math and science. I like the idea of rewarding myself; maybe I could watch a favorite show after studying.

Consultant: Watching a favorite show sounds like a fun way to reward yourself! How about we set a specific time each day for math and science? What time do you think you'd be able to study?

User: Maybe in the afternoon after school? I usually feel a bit better then.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! We can designate a certain time in the afternoon for your study sessions. Let’s aim for at least 30 minutes and see how you feel. How does that sound?

User: I can try that. It feels manageable, I think.

Consultant: I’m glad you feel that way! Also, during these sessions, you might want to pause and consider how well you’re understanding the material. If something feels tough, we can make adjustments. Does that feel okay?

User: Yeah, that makes sense. I guess it’s about finding what works best for me.

Consultant: Exactly! And remember, it’s a process of learning to adapt. How do you feel about social activities? Would you want to explore ways to connect with classmates as well?

User: I don't know. I feel a bit awkward since I don’t have many friends. But I want to try to be more included.

Consultant: That’s a brave step, and wanting to connect with others is a positive sign! Maybe we can focus on small social interactions first. Would you be open to chatting with a classmate about homework?

User: That could work! I’ve never really talked to my classmates outside of class. 

Consultant: Opening that door can be a little daunting, but it can also be really rewarding. What about asking one classmate to study together? 

User: I could try that. It sounds less scary than just trying to hang out randomly.

Consultant: That's a great approach! Remember, each small step counts. Also, how do you think your classmates would react, based on what you know about them?

User: I think they would be friendly, but I’m just scared they won’t want to study with me.

Consultant: It’s normal to have those fears, but often people are more open than we anticipate. What if you approached it by framing it as a study group? 

User: That could make it feel less personal and more about schoolwork, which feels less scary.

Consultant: Absolutely! Framing it as a study group can help ease the pressure. As we wrap up today's session, what have you learned that you feel you can take forward?

User: I feel like I can make a plan for studying and try to reach out to classmates. It feels a bit more achievable now.

Consultant: You’re making wonderful progress today, Yi Yi! Remember, taking small steps will help build your confidence along the way. We can continue to work on this next time. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! Thank you for helping me think of a plan.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hi Yiyi, welcome to our session today! I’m here to support you. How have you been feeling recently, especially about interacting with your peers?

User: Hello. I’ve been feeling a bit confused. I want to join in the group activities at school, but I also feel nervous about it. I really hope to make some friends, but I don’t know how to start.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing quite a mix of emotions—wanting to connect with others while feeling nervous. Let’s take a moment to explore what makes you feel nervous about joining these activities.

User: I guess I’m worried that they won’t like me or that I’ll embarrass myself. I often sit alone after class, and it feels awkward when I see others hanging out together.

Consultant: That's completely understandable, Yiyi. Many people feel nervous about connecting with others, especially when they perceive those around them as already having friendships. What if we discussed some of the thoughts that come to mind when you're feeling this way?

User: I often think I am not interesting enough for them. I also feel like they have their own groups already, and I don't really belong.

Consultant: It seems that these thoughts might be quite discouraging for you. Let’s unpack them a bit. Can you identify how these thoughts make you feel in those moments?

User: They make me feel sad and left out. Sometimes I just wish I could be part of the fun, but I hold back because I feel like I don’t fit in.

Consultant: Feeling sad and left out can be really tough, especially when you desire connection. How do you think we can start to challenge those thoughts about not fitting in?

User: Maybe I could try to remind myself that others might also feel shy or nervous?

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Yiyi! Recognizing that everyone has their own insecurities can help you feel less isolated. What if you tried reaching out to someone you see sitting alone, too?

User: That's a good idea. I just worry that they might turn me down or not want to talk.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to worry about rejection, but sometimes people appreciate when someone makes the effort to connect. How would you feel about trying that as a small step? 

User: I think I could try that. Just saying “hi” and maybe talking a little bit seems less intimidating than joining a big group right away.

Consultant: Absolutely, starting small can feel more manageable. Do you remember a recent group activity where you felt a little positive about your experience?

User: Yes, during the art club. I actually enjoyed working on a painting, and some classmates complimented my work.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! It sounds like you had a positive interaction there. How can we build on that experience to help you feel more confident in future activities?

User: I guess I could focus on the compliments and remember that I can contribute positively, like I did in the art club.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on those positive experiences can help shift your perspective. How about we brainstorm ways to remind yourself of those successes when you’re feeling unsure next time?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal of positive comments I receive or moments I enjoy. It could help me remember them.

Consultant: I love that idea! Keeping a journal can serve as a great reminder of your strengths and the good moments. How do you feel about sharing your thoughts with family members too, since you’ve mentioned wanting more emotional support?

User: I feel a bit nervous about it, but I think it might help. I’ve always felt like they don’t understand me, but maybe I could try talking to them about my feelings.

Consultant: That’s a brave step, Yiyi. Sharing your feelings could not only help them understand you better but may also strengthen your connection with them. What would be an easy way to start that conversation?

User: I could just say that I’ve been feeling lonely and want to talk about it. 

Consultant: That sounds like a sincere way to express yourself. You might be surprised at how willing they are to listen. How do you feel about trying both the journaling and the conversation with your family this week?

User: I think I can do that! I’m feeling a little more hopeful about it now.

Consultant: That’s great to hear, Yiyi! Hope can be a powerful motivator. Remember, it's okay to take small steps, and it’s important to celebrate your progress, no matter how small.

User: Thank you for your support. It helps to talk about these things. I feel more equipped to try to connect with others.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’re already taking steps to enhance your social connections. Before we wrap up, let’s discuss your goals for the upcoming week. What would you like to focus on?

User: I want to try talking to someone new and also start my journal. 

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! You’re setting yourself up for success. When we meet next time, we can check in about how those experiences went and reflect on what you learned.

User: Yes, I’m looking forward to it. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Yiyi. It’s been a pleasure working with you today. Remember, I’m here to support you anytime. Take care, and I’m excited to hear about your experiences next time!

User: Goodbye!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yiyi! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit uncertain. I tried to share my school experiences with my parents, but I'm still worried about how they'll react. I want them to support me.

Consultant: I see you're feeling a mix of hope and uncertainty about sharing with your parents. Can you tell me more about what you shared with them and how you felt in that moment?

User: Well, I told them about my classes and some projects I'm working on. They listened, but I felt nervous. I just want them to understand me better.

Consultant: It sounds like you took a brave step by opening up to them. What thoughts crossed your mind while you were sharing, especially when you felt nervous?

User: I kept thinking they might not care or that they would judge me for my grades. It made it hard to speak freely.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those thoughts—it’s a common fear. Have you noticed how these thoughts affect your feelings during conversations with them?

User: Yes, when I think they might judge me, I feel anxious and want to stop talking altogether.

Consultant: So, this worry about judgment is impacting your willingness to open up. What if we explored some alternative thoughts that might help you feel more confident in sharing?

User: Like what? I’m not sure what else to think.

Consultant: For example, what if you considered that your parents might simply want to understand you better, even if it doesn't come across as supportive at times? How does that shift your perception?

User: That feels a bit comforting, actually. Maybe they just don't know how to respond. 

Consultant: Exactly! You're beginning to recognize that their responses may not be as critical as you feared. How can you remind yourself of this the next time you want to share something with them?

User: Maybe I can take a deep breath and remember that they might just not know what to say but still care.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Taking a deep breath to center yourself can help manage your anxiety. How do you feel about setting a goal to share something small with them next time?

User: I think I could share a little story about my favorite subject. It doesn’t seem too heavy.

Consultant: Absolutely, that sounds like a wonderful idea! Sharing something you enjoy can help create a positive atmosphere for conversation. How do you feel about approaching this next time?

User: I feel more confident now. It helps to think of it as something light-hearted.

Consultant: I'm proud of you for turning this nervousness into excitement! Once you share this story, what do you hope to achieve from that interaction?

User: I want them to see me as someone who has interests and not just grades they need to worry about.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! By sharing your interests, you’re building a connection. How do you think this might affect your feelings towards yourself and your parents?

User: I hope it helps me feel more connected to them, and maybe they’ll be more supportive of things I enjoy.

Consultant: Developing a connection is an essential part of emotional support. As you move forward, how do you plan to handle any nerves you might feel when sharing?

User: I’ll remind myself that it’s okay to feel nervous but that I’m sharing something positive. 

Consultant: That's a healthy mindset! It's about progress, not perfection. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you've learned about expressing yourself to your parents?

User: I’ve realized that I can take small steps, and it’s okay if it doesn’t go perfectly. Plus, thinking positively helps.

Consultant: Absolutely, Yiyi! You’re learning to express your needs and feelings, which is a huge step forward. Remember, it’s a process. How do you envision maintaining this positive change in your interactions with your family?

User: I think I’ll keep trying to share more and focus on the things that make me happy or excited. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan, Yiyi. As we finish today, can you express one thing that makes you feel proud about yourself in this journey?

User: I’m proud that I’m willing to talk more with my parents, even when it’s hard for me.

Consultant: That's an amazing realization, and I believe it shows your growth and resilience. I look forward to hearing more about your experiences next time. Remember, you're not alone, and it’s okay to seek the support you need. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate our talk today. 

Consultant: You’re welcome, Yiyi. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Yi Yi! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, especially after the positive changes you've experienced at school?

User: Hi! I've been okay, but I still feel a bit uncertain about the future. I mean, it's nice that I've made some friends, but I worry if things will change again. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel uncertain, especially when you’ve just started to build new relationships. Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you about the future?

User: I guess I worry that I'll end up alone again. Sometimes I feel like I don't really fit in, even though I have friends now.

Consultant: I hear you, Yi Yi. It's tough to shake off those feelings of isolation, especially when you've experienced them before. What do you think contributes to that feeling of not fitting in? 

User: Maybe it’s just my past experiences. I’ve often felt like an outsider since my parents were away and I lived with my grandparents. 

Consultant: That makes sense, and it's important to acknowledge how your past has shaped your feelings. Since you've started to form friendships now, can you reflect on what you believe has helped you connect with others this time?

User: I started opening up a bit more and trying to join in on conversations. I think that helps. I also feel more confident lately. 

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like you've made significant progress in connecting with your peers. How has that newfound confidence impacted your social interactions?

User: I feel less anxious when I talk to my classmates. I don't think about how they see me as much anymore.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful shift! It seems like you’re learning to enjoy the moment rather than worrying about how others perceive you. Do you think there are any strategies that helped you reach this point?

User: Yes, I tried to focus on enjoying the conversations instead of stressing about them. It’s like I remind myself that it’s okay to just be myself.

Consultant: Excellent! Embracing your authentic self can lead to deeper connections. Looking ahead, how do you plan to maintain this confidence and continue building your friendships?

User: I think I want to keep being more open and maybe even invite a friend to hang out outside of school. 

Consultant: That's a positive approach! Inviting a friend out could help solidify those bonds. What feelings do you anticipate when you think about reaching out to someone?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but excited too. It just feels good to have friends now.

Consultant: That combination of nerves and excitement is completely natural, especially when stepping outside of your comfort zone. If those feelings start to feel overwhelming, how can you remind yourself of the progress you’ve made?

User: I can write down the positive experiences I’ve had and the friendships I’ve built. I think reflecting on my progress helps me feel more confident. 

Consultant: Absolutely, keeping a record of your positive experiences can help reinforce your self-efficacy. As we wrap up today, what is one takeaway you want to remember that can support you in maintaining your confidence and friendships?

User: I want to remember that being myself is enough, and that it’s okay to feel a little nervous—it doesn’t mean I can’t still connect with people.

Consultant: That's a powerful takeaway, Yi Yi. You’ve shown a lot of growth and insight during our time together today. As you continue your journey, keep utilizing those strategies and reflecting on your progress. I'm confident you can navigate whatever challenges come your way.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate our sessions. They help me a lot.

Consultant: It’s been a pleasure working with you, Yi Yi. Remember, you’ve got the skills and resilience to face the future. If you ever need support again, you’re always welcome to come back. 

User: Thank you! I will keep that in mind. 

Consultant: Take care, Yi Yi, and keep focusing on those positive connections!
