Consultant: Hello, little Y! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately with everything going on?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really lonely. My mom is always busy with work, and I don't have anyone to play with. I miss my dad too.

Consultant: I'm truly sorry to hear that you're feeling lonely. It's tough when things change, and I understand that you miss your dad. Can you tell me more about the times when you're feeling lonely? What do you usually do during those moments?

User: I just sit in my room and play with my toys, but it's not the same as playing with friends. And sometimes I feel scared to talk to other kids at school. 

Consultant: That sounds really hard. It's understandable to feel scared when talking to other kids, especially if you're feeling lonely. What do you think makes it difficult for you to approach them?

User: I think they might not want to talk to me. I feel like I don’t know what to say.

Consultant: It’s normal to worry about what others think. Can you remember a time when you did talk to someone at school? How did that make you feel?

User: I talked to a classmate once about a puzzle. They seemed nice, but I got nervous and stopped. 

Consultant: It sounds like starting a conversation about puzzles could be a good way to connect with someone. Do you enjoy puzzles? What do you like about them?

User: Yes! I like putting the pieces together. It feels good when I finish a puzzle.

Consultant: That's great to hear! Finishing a puzzle is a fantastic accomplishment. What if we think about how you could use your interest in puzzles to connect with a classmate? 

User: Like what? 

Consultant: How about inviting someone to work on a puzzle with you during recess? It might be an easier way to start a conversation. What do you think?

User: I’m not sure. What if they say no?

Consultant: It’s possible they might say no, and that can be disappointing. But sometimes they might say yes! If they say no, it doesn’t mean they don’t like you. How would you feel about trying it just once?

User: I think I could try. It would be fun to share a puzzle.

Consultant: That's a wonderful way to think about it! If it goes well, it might encourage you to try again. Also, how do you feel about sharing how you enjoy puzzles with others? 

User: I usually keep quiet about it.

Consultant: That’s okay. It’s understandable to feel shy. What if we practice talking about what you like about puzzles? For example, you could say, "I love puzzles because they are fun, and I enjoy finishing them." Would you want to give that a try?

User: Okay, I can do that.

Consultant: Fantastic, little Y! Practicing can make it easier when you actually meet someone. How about we think of some more fun things to do that involve puzzles or games you can share with others?

User: Maybe we can do puzzle races or something fun?

Consultant: I love that idea! Puzzle races sound exciting and a great way to engage with friends. It can be a fun activity that encourages interaction. How would you feel about trying it with your classmates?

User: I think it would be fun. I hope they like it.

Consultant: I believe they will! It’s a creative way to connect with others. If you're feeling nervous, remember to take a deep breath and remind yourself that it’s okay to feel a bit anxious. 

User: I will try to remember that.

Consultant: Good! It's all about taking little steps. As we move forward, how do you see yourself feeling when you try talking to the other kids?

User: I really want to feel brave. 

Consultant: That sounds empowering, little Y! Feeling brave is a strong goal. Let’s keep practicing ways you can approach them, and over time, you might find it becomes easier.

User: I hope so. 

Consultant: It will get easier with practice. I'm proud of you for being open and willing to try new things. Next time we meet, we can talk about how it went and what you experienced. 

User: Okay, that sounds good. 

Consultant: I’m looking forward to hearing all about it! Remember, even if it feels tough at first, each step you take is progress. You're doing great! 

User: Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, little Y! Before we wrap things up, is there anything else you would like to discuss or any questions you have?

User: Not right now. I just want to try talking to the kids.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! I'm excited for you. Remember, it's okay to take your time with it. I believe in you! 

User: Thanks, I'll do my best! 

Consultant: That's the spirit! You’re making wonderful strides. On our next session, we can review how it went and what you learned. Keep it up, little Y!

User: I will! See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, little Y! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately with everything going on at home?

User: Hi. I don't know... it's just that things feel different. My grandma seems stressed when she's with me, and my mom is busy with work a lot. Sometimes I feel alone.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a bit lonely with your grandma and mom so busy. That's really understandable. Can you tell me more about how that makes you feel when you're home?

User: I feel like I want to talk to them, but they are usually tired or busy. I just want to play and have fun, but sometimes it's hard.

Consultant: I hear you. You have a desire to play and enjoy time with your family, but it feels challenging when they are preoccupied. That's completely natural. What activities do you enjoy doing that you think could help you feel more connected with them?

User: I like building with blocks and playing with puzzles. But I don't know if they want to play those with me when they are tired.

Consultant: Those sound like great activities! Building with blocks and puzzles can be a lot of fun. Maybe we can brainstorm ways for you to share those activities with them in a way that feels comfortable. How does that sound?

User: Yeah, that might be fun. I just think they might say no.

Consultant: It's okay to worry about that. Let’s think about how you might ask them in a way that makes it easier for them. For example, how about starting with a gentle invitation? You could say, “I have some puzzles I’d love to do together, if you have a little time.” What do you think?

User: I could try that! But what if they are too tired?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. If they are too tired, you can also plan a time when they might be less busy, like during weekends. How would it make you feel to have special time set aside just for you two to play?

User: That sounds nice! I like the idea of having a special time.

Consultant: Wonderful! Creating special time can help you feel more connected and share those fun moments together. Sometimes, just having that time planned out can ease some worries. Can you think of other things that might help you feel more comfortable to ask them?

User: Maybe I could say I really want to play with them because it makes me happy.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Expressing how much you enjoy time with them shows that you care about the time spent together. Being honest about your feelings can help them understand how important this is to you. 

User: Okay, I will try that. But sometimes when I play with others, I feel a bit awkward.

Consultant: That’s completely normal! When we are trying to connect with others, it can be challenging. Sometimes our own worries can make the situation feel tougher. Can you share what feels awkward when you play with others?

User: I don’t know what to say or do. So I just don’t say anything.

Consultant: That can happen! What if we practiced some things to say or do during playtime? Sometimes having a few ideas in mind can help reduce that awkward feeling. Would you like to try that?

User: Sure! I guess practicing might help.

Consultant: Fantastic! Let’s think of some simple conversation starters. For instance, if you’re building something with blocks and someone else is too, you could say, “Look at what I built! What are you making?” How does that sound?

User: That sounds okay. I can do that!

Consultant: Great! That’s a wonderful way to get a conversation going. Sharing what you're doing can help others feel involved and can make you feel more comfortable too. Do you think that would help?

User: Yeah, I think it would make it easier to talk to them.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember, everyone feels a little nervous sometimes. The more you practice, the more naturally it will come to you. What about times when someone has said something nice to you? How does that make you feel?

User: It makes me happy! I like when people say good things.

Consultant: That’s really important! Positive feedback can boost your confidence. When you feel good, it’s easier to share and connect. Maybe you can also try giving compliments to others. What do you think that might do for your interactions?

User: I could tell someone their building is cool! It might help them talk to me too.

Consultant: Exactly! Complimenting others can break the ice and encourage them to respond. It can start a lovely conversation, too. How do you feel about trying that next time?

User: I feel a little excited to try!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Excitement is a wonderful feeling to have as we explore new interactions. Just remember, it’s okay to take small steps. How are you feeling about the ideas we've talked about today, Y?

User: I think they will help. I want to try talking and playing with them more.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! I believe in you. You’re taking important steps towards feeling more confident socially. Just remember, if it feels tough, it’s okay—practice makes it easier. 

User: Thank you! I'll practice and try to tell them how I feel.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m excited for you and can’t wait to hear how it goes next time we meet. Remember, take your time and be proud of every effort you make. 

User: I will! See you next time!

Consultant: See you next time, Y! Keep up the great work!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Y! I'm really glad to see you today. Before we begin, can you share how you've been feeling about the group activity at school?

User: Hi! I feel kind of embarrassed because the other kids noticed when I do the same thing over and over again. It makes me not want to join in the activity.

Consultant: It sounds like feeling noticed for your repetitive behavior has made you uncomfortable. You're hoping to enjoy the group activity more without feeling embarrassed. Is that right?

User: Yes! I don't want to feel awkward around the other kids anymore.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense, Xiao Y. Let's take a closer look at what happens during those activities. Can you tell me what specific rules or parts of the group activity confused you the most?

User: I got confused by the rules about how to take turns. I didn't understand when it was my turn, and I got stuck doing the same thing, which made me feel funny.

Consultant: Understanding the rules can be tricky, especially when there are many parts to keep track of. It sounds like that made you anxious about joining in. Have you thought about what might help you feel more comfortable with those rules?

User: Maybe if someone helps me understand them before we start, it would be easier.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Having someone explain the rules beforehand can give you more confidence. Would you like to practice what you could say or ask to get help before the next activity?

User: I think I could ask the teacher to explain it again. But what if I still don’t understand?

Consultant: It's completely okay to ask questions. You can say, "Can you help me understand the rules a bit better?" Most teachers are happy to help! What do you think about practicing asking that now?

User: Okay, I can try. "Can you help me understand the rules a bit better?"

Consultant: That sounded perfect! If you feel confused again, remember you can say that. It’s also okay to take a moment to think before jumping in. How do you feel about giving it a try next time?

User: I feel a little better talking about it. I think I can try asking!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You’re on the right track. Let’s also talk about your repetitive behaviors. What do you think usually makes you want to do those things during the activity?

User: I think it makes me feel safe to do the same thing again. It’s like a habit, and it’s hard to stop.

Consultant: Feeling safe is important! Habits can be tough sometimes. Maybe we can think of a few strategies to help you feel a bit more flexible during those activities. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I’d like to try something.

Consultant: Great! One strategy could be to take a deep breath and count to five before responding to a prompt in the activity. Would you like to practice this with me now?

User: Okay! I can try counting.

Consultant: Awesome! Let’s imagine a scenario where someone asks you to share your opinion during the activity. Close your eyes for a moment and let’s practice breathing and counting together. Inhale deeply… and exhale… Now count with me to five.

User: One, two, three, four, five.

Consultant: Perfect! How do you feel after that practice?

User: I feel a little more relaxed. I think I can remember to breathe.

Consultant: That’s a good start! Remember, you can always take that breath and count before responding. It can help you feel more in control. Are there any other things you’re worried about when participating in the group?

User: I’m also worried about not making mistakes in front of everyone.

Consultant: It's natural to worry about making mistakes, especially in front of others. Mistakes are a part of learning! What if they didn’t feel so scary? How would that change how you approach the activities?

User: I guess if I think of mistakes as learning, it wouldn’t be so bad.

Consultant: Exactly! Mistakes can help us grow. What if we reminded you that making a mistake is totally okay, and you can try again? 

User: That sounds helpful! I can remind myself it's okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: Yes! And maybe you could share that with a friend in the group. Finding support from others can help you feel less alone. How do you feel about discussing this with a friend during your next activity?

User: I think I could try talking to my friend about it!

Consultant: That’s fantastic! You’re building great strategies, Xiao Y. Let’s summarize what we’ve talked about today. We practiced asking for help, counting to calm down, and thinking of mistakes as learning opportunities. How do you feel about everything we’ve discussed?

User: I feel more ready to try next time! I want to do better in the group.

Consultant: I’m so proud of you for feeling ready to participate! Remember, these strategies can help you have a more positive experience. Do you have any last thoughts or questions before we wrap up today?

User: No, I think I'm all set for now!

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember, you're equipped with new skills, and I'm here for you. You’ve made great progress today. Until next time, keep practicing those strategies, and I believe you’ll feel even more confident in group activities!
###################
Consultant: Hello, little Y! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel a bit happier. I did a puzzle with some volunteers, and it was fun! I never thought I could finish it.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Completing the puzzle must have made you feel really proud of yourself. How did it feel to work with the volunteers on that challenge?

User: It was great! They helped me and cheered for me. I felt like I could do it.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! The support from the volunteers seemed to really boost your confidence. Have you thought about any other activities you might like to try that could give you that same feeling of success?

User: Maybe I can try building with blocks. I saw some kids doing that, and it looked fun.

Consultant: Building with blocks sounds like a great idea! What do you think you could create with them? 

User: I want to build a big tower! It would be cool to see how tall I can make it.

Consultant: A tall tower would be amazing! And just like with the puzzle, you'll have the chance to feel proud of what you've made. What do you think you would need to do to start building that tower?

User: Maybe I should get some blocks first. I can ask my mom for help to find some.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan! Asking for help is important, and it's great that you're thinking about that. Once you have the blocks, how would you go about building the tower? 

User: I think I will start with a big base so it doesn’t fall over. Then I can add more pieces on top.

Consultant: That's a smart strategy! Starting with a strong base is key. How do you think you would feel if you successfully built a tall tower?

User: I would feel really happy! I want to show my mom and grandma.

Consultant: I love that! Sharing your success with your family would make it even more special. What else do you think you could do to share your achievement with them?

User: I can take a picture with the tower and show it to them! 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Pictures capture the moment perfectly. When you think about trying new activities like this, what’s something that makes you a little nervous?

User: Sometimes I worry I won’t do it right, or it will fall down.

Consultant: That’s a very common worry! It’s okay to feel that way. What if I told you that even if it doesn't go perfectly, it's still a great experience to try? 

User: Yeah, I guess I can always try again.

Consultant: Exactly! Trying is what matters, and each time you try, you learn something new. How do you think you could remind yourself of that when you feel nervous?

User: Maybe I can tell myself it’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: That's perfect! Encouraging yourself like that can help you feel more brave. Let’s keep building on this positive mindset. Are there any other activities you’d like to try with your new confidence?

User: I want to try making a simple craft with some paper and glue.

Consultant: Crafts sound fun and creative! What kind of craft do you have in mind?

User: I want to make a picture of a house with trees around it.

Consultant: What a lovely idea! This will give you another chance to create something special. How do you think you’d go about making that picture?

User: I can cut out the shapes and then glue them on the paper. 

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! And remember, it’s all about enjoying the process of creating. What if I told you that every time you create something, it’s a small success?

User: That sounds good! I like thinking of it that way.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Focusing on the enjoyment and effort will help you build more confidence. Let’s discuss how you can keep trying these activities regularly. 

User: Maybe I can ask my mom to set aside time for crafts each week.

Consultant: That’s a great idea to plan ahead! Scheduling time for fun activities will give you something to look forward to and practice your skills. 

User: I can’t wait to get started! 

Consultant: I'm excited for you too, little Y! You've made a lot of progress. Remember, it’s all about having fun and enjoying what you create. Keep sharing your experiences, and don’t forget—every effort counts as a success! 

User: Thank you! I will try my best!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of what you've accomplished today. Keep that positive attitude, and I'll look forward to hearing all about your success in our next session!

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s great to hear you enjoyed collaborating with the volunteers. What made that experience fun for you?

User: I liked working together. We solved the puzzle faster than I thought we would!

User: Yes! I want to talk and help more when we work together. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, little Y! Wanting to communicate and help others is a big step. Can you think of a situation where you’d like to use this teamwork approach again?

User: Maybe next time when we do art projects! 

Consultant: Absolutely! Art projects can be a fun opportunity to express yourself and work together. What kind of role do you think you would enjoy taking on in a team during the art project?

User: I can help choose the colors and maybe paint! 

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Helping choose colors and painting can really bring a project to life. How do you think you could encourage your friends to work with you during the art project?

User: I can ask them what colors they like and share my ideas too! 

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Asking others about their ideas can make everyone feel included. How do you feel about sharing your ideas with the group?

User: I feel a little nervous sometimes but also excited. 

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel both nervous and excited! Can you think of something you could tell yourself to feel more confident when sharing your ideas?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that my ideas are good too. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful thought! Believing in your ideas is important. Would you like to practice saying that to yourself right now?

User: Yes! I can say, "My ideas are good." 

Consultant: That’s perfect! It’s a strong affirmation to boost your confidence. When situations get tough, remember to repeat that phrase to yourself. Is there any other thought you’d like to work on when in a group?

User: I want to feel brave when they don’t agree with me. 

Consultant: Feeling brave is a great goal. How about thinking, "It’s okay if others have different ideas; we can still work together"? How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I can try that. 

Consultant: I believe you can! Let’s take a moment to think about how you can practice these ideas in your next group activity. What is one action you want to take during that activity?

User: I want to share my colors first and see what they think. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Sharing your colors first can help set a positive tone for the group. How do you think it will feel to take that step?

User: I think I will feel proud if they like my ideas. 

Consultant: Feeling proud is a fantastic motivation! Remember that each time you share, you’re building connections with others. What are some ways you can keep your team spirit up even if things don’t go as planned?

User: I can smile and say, “Let’s try again.” 

Consultant: That’s a brilliant approach! Smiling and encouraging your team to keep trying shows great leadership and resilience. How do you feel about approaching your next team project with these new strategies?

User: I feel more ready and excited! 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, little Y! Being ready and excited can lead to great experiences. Let’s take a moment to recap what we’ve practiced today. What are the key ideas you want to remember?

User: I will share my ideas, remind myself they're good, and be brave even if others disagree. 

Consultant: You've captured it perfectly! You’ve set yourself up for success in your future teamwork. How are you feeling about your social interactions now?

User: I feel hopeful. I want to keep practicing. 

Consultant: Hope is an amazing feeling to have! Remember, building social skills takes time and practice, and you’re on the right path. If ever you feel stuck or need to chat, you can always reach out! 

User: Thank you! I will remember that. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, little Y! I’m so proud of the progress you’re making. Let’s keep this momentum going. Until next time, take care and keep practicing!

User: Bye! I will!

Consultant: Hello, Little Y! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling about your friendships lately? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling happier. I made a new friend in school, and we’ve been playing together. I want to keep this friendship strong.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Building friendships can be really rewarding. What are some things you enjoy doing with your new friend?

User: We like playing soccer during recess. Sometimes we talk about our favorite cartoons too. 

Consultant: Playing soccer sounds like a lot of fun! It’s great that you’re also able to chat about things you both enjoy. How does it make you feel to have someone to share these activities with?

Consultant: Inviting him over sounds like a fantastic idea! Sharing your toys and games can really help strengthen that bond. What do you think about how he might feel about that?

User: I think he would like it. He seems friendly and likes games too.

Consultant: That’s a positive outlook! It's important to share fun experiences together. Is there anything that worries you about inviting him over?

User: I feel a bit shy about asking him. What if he says no?

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel shy about asking. Let’s think about it together—what could be some outcomes if you ask him?

User: Maybe he will say yes! Or he might not want to come. 

Consultant: Exactly! And if he says no, it doesn’t mean he doesn’t like you. There could be many reasons. How do you think you would feel if that happened?

User: I might feel a little sad, but I would understand. 

Consultant: That’s a mature way to think about it. It’s okay to feel sad, but it’s great that you can also understand his perspective. What about if he says yes? How would that make you feel?

User: I would be really excited! I hope we can have a lot of fun.

Consultant: That excitement is wonderful to hear! It's important to focus on those positive feelings. How do you plan to invite him over?

Consultant: That sounds like a nice approach! Highlighting the fun you can have can make the invitation even more appealing. What do you think his response might be?

User: I hope he’ll say yes and be excited too!

Consultant: That’s a great hope! Remember, your enthusiasm can be contagious. Just be yourself, and even if he needs some time to think about it, that's okay. How does that make you feel?

User: It helps me feel braver! I can do this!

Consultant: You really can, Little Y! It seems like you’re building not just friendships, but also your confidence. What are some other things you can do to keep your friendship strong?

User: We can play soccer regularly and maybe share lunch together sometimes.

Consultant: Playing soccer and sharing meals can really deepen your connection. That’s a fantastic idea! How do you feel about making plans to do those things?

User: I feel happy! I want to be a good friend.

Consultant: And it sounds like you’re already on the right track to being an amazing friend. It's great that you’re thinking about how to support your friendship. Is there anything else you think could help you in this situation?
