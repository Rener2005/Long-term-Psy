Consultant: Hello, Robert! I'm so happy to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling okay, but I'm a bit frustrated. I tried hard with my science project, but I got some comments from my teacher that didn’t feel great. 

Consultant: It sounds like your teacher's feedback has been bothering you. Can you share what some of those comments were and how they made you feel?

User: Well, my teacher said that my project was good, but it wasn’t based on real scientific principles. That made me feel like everything I worked on was useless.

Consultant: I see. You put a lot of effort into your project, and it must be tough to hear that it’s not meeting expectations. How do you think this feedback affects the way you see your work in science?

User: I feel really defensive about it. I mean, I worked hard, and I thought I did a good job! Now, I’m not sure if I want to try again or just give up.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel defensive when you think you've done well, but it’s important to remember that feedback is often aimed at helping us improve. How do you usually respond to criticism from others?

User: I usually laugh it off or just ignore it, but this time it feels different. I really care about science, and I don’t want to mess it up.

Consultant: That makes sense, Robert. You care deeply about your work, and when you face criticism, it can feel more personal. What would it look like for you to take a more constructive approach to this feedback?

User: I guess if I could look at it as a way to make my project even better, that would be helpful. But it’s hard to not feel upset about it.

Consultant: Absolutely, it is challenging. What could help you shift your mindset from feeling upset to seeing it as an opportunity for growth?

User: Maybe if I talk to my friends about it, I could get some new ideas. They usually have a different way of looking at things.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Talking with friends could provide you with new perspectives and support. What specific steps can you take to reach out to them and discuss your project?

User: I could start a group chat, or maybe ask them if they want to work together to brainstorm improvements.

Consultant: Excellent! Collaborating with your friends not only helps you improve your project but might also reduce some of that frustration. How do you think sharing your feelings about the feedback with them would help you?

User: I think it would help me feel less alone. They might understand what I’m going through, and it could make it easier to cope with the teacher’s comments.

Consultant: That sounds really positive, Robert. Support is important, especially when dealing with tough feedback. Besides reaching out to friends, are there any other strategies you think could assist you in handling your teacher's comments?

User: I could try to write down the feedback and think about how I can improve based on it. Maybe that would help me focus on the positive side.

Consultant: That’s a very proactive approach! Writing things down can help clarify your thoughts and make the feedback more manageable. How do you feel about taking those steps after our session today?

User: I feel more motivated now! I think I can do this and maybe even surprise my teacher with my next project.

Consultant: That’s the spirit, Robert! It’s wonderful to hear your motivation returning. As we wrap up, let’s reflect on your journey. What have you learned today about handling feedback and your feelings around it?

User: I’ve learned that feedback isn’t about me failing, but about growing. It feels less threatening when I think of it like that.

Consultant: That’s an important insight! Recognizing that feedback is a part of growth can change the way you approach challenges in the future. How can you remind yourself of this when you face criticism again?

User: Maybe I can write it on a sticky note or something and put it on my desk. That way, I’ll remember to stay positive.

Consultant: That’s a great practical idea! Keeping reminders close can help reinforce a positive mindset. As we finish today’s session, what final thoughts do you have about what we discussed?

User: I’m glad I talked about this. I feel like I have a plan now, and I’m excited to get started on my project again.

Consultant: I'm really pleased to hear that, Robert! Remember, it’s great to reach out for support and to see feedback as a tool for improvement. You have great potential in science, and I look forward to hearing how it goes next time. Take care!

User: Thank you! I’ll work on my project and talk to my friends. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Robert! I'm glad to see you today. I want to hear about your week—how have you been feeling since we last talked?

User: Hi! I feel proud of the science model I made, but I'm really frustrated about what happened with my teacher. I don't understand why they didn't like my work.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're proud of your model! That shows how creative and talented you are. The disagreement with your teacher sounds tough. Can you share what specifically upset you about their feedback?

User: Well, I thought my model was really cool, but my teacher said it wasn't practical enough. I felt like they didn't appreciate my effort, and that made me defensive.

Consultant: That makes sense. Feeling like your hard work isn’t recognized can be really discouraging. How did you respond to your teacher when they gave that feedback?

User: I just felt like arguing with them. I wanted to explain why I thought it was a good idea, but instead, I got really upset. 

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to want to defend your work. Sometimes, it can feel easier to react emotionally rather than to listen. How did that interaction leave you feeling afterward?

User: I guess it made me feel even more frustrated and confused. Now I don't know how to talk to my teacher without feeling like I’ll get shut down again.

Consultant: It sounds like this experience affected your confidence in communicating with your teacher. That's important to recognize. How do you think you could approach a conversation with them differently next time?

User: I don't really know. Maybe if I just stay quiet and nod my head, they won't get upset again?

Consultant: Staying quiet can sometimes seem like a safe option, but it can also leave you feeling unheard. What if you tried to express your thoughts calmly instead? How might that change the conversation?

User: I guess if I explained my ideas clearly and listened to what they said, it might work better. But what if they still don’t like it?

Consultant: That's a valid concern. It's natural to worry about rejection. However, even if they don’t agree, you’ll be opening the door to dialogue. What do you think you could learn from their feedback this time?

User: Maybe I could find out what they actually want from my projects. I’d like to improve and not just feel bad about it.

Consultant: Exactly! Seeking clarity on their expectations could help you feel more prepared and confident next time. Let's talk about some strategies for how you can actively listen during feedback. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I want to try to be more open, but it's hard when I feel defensive.

Consultant: I understand that it’s challenging to set aside those defensive feelings. One technique is to take deep breaths and remind yourself that feedback is aimed at helping you grow. How does that resonate with you?

User: Breathing sounds easy enough to do, I can try that. I don't want to keep feeling this way.

Consultant: That’s a positive step, Robert! Remember, feedback is a chance to enhance your skills. You’ve already shown so much creativity, and using this feedback can help you shine even brighter. 

User: I hope so. I just want my teacher to see my effort.

Consultant: And you deserve to have your efforts recognized! It's okay to feel anxious about this, but building a better relationship with your teacher can make a big difference. What’s one small step you can take this week to practice this new mindset?

User: Maybe I could talk to my teacher after class and ask them about how I can improve? That could help.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! It shows initiative and willingness to learn. By doing this, you’re also demonstrating respect for your teacher’s feedback. How does thinking about that conversation make you feel?

User: I feel a little nervous but also a bit excited, like I might actually learn something useful.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mix of feelings! Nervousness is normal, but excitement shows you're open to new possibilities. Remember to acknowledge your feelings and remind yourself that it’s okay to be vulnerable in this process.

User: I will try to remember that. Thanks for helping me see it differently.

Consultant: My pleasure, Robert! I’m proud of you for being willing to face this challenge. As we wrap up today, reflect on what we discussed and think about how you can implement these strategies. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel hopeful and a bit more prepared. I think I can give it a try.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You’ve made great strides today. Remember that building these skills takes time, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. I'm excited for you! 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. If you have any challenges or need further support, don't hesitate to reach out. Good luck with your teacher!

Consultant: Hi Robert! I'm really glad you're here today. I hear that you've been working on developing better relationships with your classmates and teachers. Can you tell me a bit about how you've been feeling about this?

User: Hi! Well, I feel excited about the science project I organized with my classmates, but I also worry that it might not go well. What if they don't like my ideas or I make mistakes?

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel a mix of excitement and worry. It sounds like you're looking forward to the project but are also worried about how others will react. Can you share a bit more about what specific thoughts go through your mind when you think about the possibility of making mistakes?

User: I think things like, "What if they laugh at me?" or "What if I ruin everything?" It makes me really nervous to talk in front of everyone.

Consultant: Those thoughts can definitely create a lot of anxiety. It seems like you're worried about being judged or not meeting expectations. Let's take a moment to explore those thoughts. How likely do you think it is that your classmates would actually laugh at you or criticize your ideas? 

User: I guess it's not very likely. But when I think about it, it feels really real in the moment.

Consultant: That's understandable. Our feelings can sometimes make thoughts feel more intense than they actually are. Let’s try to challenge those thoughts a little. If you were to give advice to a friend who was worried about the same thing, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably say that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay. I would remind them that we’re all learning together.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! It shows that making mistakes is part of learning. How can we apply that same understanding to your own situation? 

User: Maybe I can tell myself it’s okay to make mistakes and that I’ll learn from them if they happen. I just need to focus on doing my best.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on doing your best, while keeping in mind that mistakes are part of the process, can really help ease some of that pressure. What is one small step you can take to prepare for speaking up in class or during your presentation?

User: I think I could practice what I want to say a few times before presenting. Maybe with my parents or friends first.

Consultant: Practicing with others is a fantastic idea! It can help build your confidence. How do you feel about that plan—does it make you feel a bit more at ease?

User: Yeah, I feel a bit better about it! I think practicing will help me feel more confident.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Confidence often grows with practice. During your presentation, how do you think you can remind yourself to stay calm if you start to feel nervous?

User: I could take deep breaths and maybe even think about all the times I’ve done well before. 

Consultant: Deep breathing is a great technique! And remembering past successes can really help shift your mindset when nerves hit. How do you think it would feel to rely on those strategies during your presentation?

User: I think it would make me feel more confident. I’d feel like I have something to fall back on if I start to get anxious.

Consultant: Absolutely! Having those coping strategies can be very reassuring. Let's discuss something—what would success look like for you at the end of this presentation? 

User: If I get through it without feeling too nervous and if my class enjoys it, I'll consider that a success.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid definition of success. And I believe you can achieve that! What would you do if someone offers feedback that you might perceive as critical after your presentation?

User: I guess I wouldn’t take it personally. I could think about how it might help me improve instead.

Consultant: That’s a healthy approach! Viewing feedback as an opportunity for growth rather than a personal attack can really help you maintain a positive mindset. How does that idea resonate with you?

User: It makes sense. I want to improve, so feedback can be useful!

Consultant: Exactly! It’s all about turning potential criticism into constructive advice. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you’ve learned or how do you think you’ve grown from our conversation?

User: I think I’ve learned that it’s okay to make mistakes and that practicing can really help. I also feel more prepared to handle criticism.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic takeaway, Robert! You’ve developed some useful strategies for managing anxiety and building your confidence. As you move forward, remember to be kind to yourself and keep those lessons in mind. If you ever need to talk again, know that you're welcome to come back anytime.

User: Thank you! I appreciate it. I feel much better now. I’ll practice and think positively about my presentation!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad you’re feeling better. I look forward to hearing about your success next time. Good luck with your project, Robert!

Consultant: Hello, Robert! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since your science project presentation?

User: Hi! I feel really happy about the praise I got from some classmates and teachers, but I can't stop thinking about the criticism. It bothers me a lot.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing both joy from the praise and some distress from the criticism. Let's explore that a bit. What specific thoughts do you have about the criticism?

User: I keep replaying what they said in my head. It makes me wonder if I really did a good job or if I should have done things differently.

Consultant: I understand that those thoughts can be overwhelming. It’s normal to start questioning yourself after receiving criticism. Can you share how that criticism makes you feel?

User: It makes me feel a bit sad and anxious. I want to do well, and when I get criticized, I start doubting my abilities.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way, especially when you care about doing well. Have you noticed if there are any parts of the criticism that could be constructive instead of just negative?

User: Maybe. Some of the feedback was about being clearer in my explanations. I guess that makes sense, but it still stings.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Robert. It looks like there’s a constructive element to what they said about clarity. How do you think you could use that feedback to improve in the future?

User: I could practice explaining my project more simply and maybe get someone to listen to me first before presenting. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Practicing can definitely help boost your confidence. How would it feel to approach your next project with this constructive feedback in mind?

User: I think it would make me feel more prepared and less scared of what others say. Maybe I can show them I can improve!

Consultant: That’s a positive approach, Robert! It sounds like turning that feedback into a way to grow could be empowering for you. What else do you think you could do to manage when you hear criticism?

User: I could remind myself that not everyone will like what I do, and that’s okay. I can focus on the people who appreciate my work.

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation! Focusing on those who appreciate your work can really help balance out the harsh feedback. Can you think of any specific ways to remind yourself of this during a presentation?

User: I could write down positive feedback from others and read it before I present, to boost my confidence.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Having that reminder handy can be very encouraging. Let’s also think about how you would feel after receiving positive feedback next time. What would that mean for you?

User: I’d feel really proud and maybe even more motivated to do bigger projects. It would feel great to know people believe in me.

Consultant: It sounds like those positive feelings can really fuel your motivation. Embracing both praise and constructive feedback can lead to growth. How does it feel thinking about handling criticism with this mindset?

User: It feels good! I can turn it into something useful, and it makes me less scared.

Consultant: Absolutely! Engaging with criticism as a tool for improvement is a great step. As we look ahead, what goals do you have related to your leadership skills in presentations?

User: I want to be able to lead my group better and make sure everyone feels included in the project. I think that would be a good way of showing my leadership.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, Robert! Leading a group while including everyone is an essential skill. How can you begin practicing your leadership skills with your next project?

User: I can start by asking everyone what they think before we begin, and make sure everyone gets to share their ideas. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy for fostering a collaborative environment! Encouraging input from others can help strengthen your leadership. What can you do to feel more confident in taking on that role?

User: Maybe I could take small steps first, like leading discussions in group work and gradually taking charge in presentations.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Starting small can help build your confidence. How would it feel to lead more in those small ways?

User: It would feel exciting and a little scary, but I think I can do it! I want to be someone others can rely on.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful ambition, Robert! Being someone others can rely on shows a lot of maturity. How can we further celebrate the progress you're making as you develop these skills?

User: I could keep a journal of what I learn each time I present or lead a project, and celebrate when I achieve small goals.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Keeping track of your learning and celebrating those achievements can reinforce your growth. Let’s summarize your progress today. How do you feel about what we’ve discussed?

User: Better! I feel more ready to face criticism and use it to improve myself. I also feel more excited about leading others.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’ve made great strides in building your confidence and developing your leadership skills. Remember, using feedback as a tool for growth can empower you. How are you feeling as we wrap up today's session?

User: I feel really hopeful and motivated. Thank you for helping me think things through!

User: I guess I’m worried that people will expect me to be perfect, and I might disappoint them.

Consultant: Practicing and seeking feedback are excellent strategies! How do you think you can apply those methods in your leadership role during the science exhibition?

User: I can ask my classmates for their ideas and feedback about our project. That way, we all contribute, and I won’t feel alone.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Involving your classmates can not only ease the pressure on you but also build a sense of teamwork. How do you feel about asking them for help?

User: I think it would be good! I’m just a bit shy about it.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel shy, but remember, asking for help shows strength and leadership. What if we brainstormed some ways to help you feel more comfortable approaching them?

User: That would help! Maybe I could start by sharing my ideas and then ask what they think?

Consultant: Absolutely! That's a wonderful approach. By starting with your ideas, you open up a conversation. How do you think they might respond?

User: I think they would like that. They usually have good ideas too, so it would be nice to hear their thoughts.

Consultant: Definitely! Collaborating with your group can lead to new, exciting ideas. You mentioned feeling proud of your achievements—how can you remind yourself of this pride when you feel shy or nervous?

User: I can think about how I felt when I finished my model and got my teacher’s praise. That made me really happy!

Consultant: That’s a powerful memory to lean on. It shows that your hard work pays off. How about setting a small goal for yourself related to your leadership this week?

User: I could aim to have a group meeting before the exhibition to discuss our project!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Setting a meeting can help you take charge and also involve everyone. How do you feel about preparing for this meeting?

User: I’m a bit anxious, but it feels exciting too! 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mix of feelings. Embracing both excitement and anxiety can help you grow. What’s one thing you can do to prepare for this meeting? 

User: I could write down an outline of what I want to discuss.

Consultant: Great idea! Having an outline can help you feel more organized and confident during the meeting. How would you feel after you complete that preparation?

User: I think I would feel more ready and less anxious!

Consultant: Exactly! Preparation can make a big difference. Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. As you prepare and connect with your classmates, what impact do you think this will have on your leadership skills?

User: I think it will help me be a better leader. If I can communicate well, the group will work better together.

Consultant: You’re absolutely right! Good communication is key to effective leadership. As we wrap up our talk today, what’s one key takeaway you’ll remember from our session?

User: I’ll remember that practicing and involving my team can help me be confident in my leadership.

User: Maybe I can create a schedule. It would help me see when I have time for homework, club meetings, and practice.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Creating a schedule can help you visualize your commitments and ensure you have time for everything. Would you like to discuss how you might set up this schedule?

User: Sure! I think starting with my homework and then seeing how much time I have left for clubs would work.

Consultant: That sounds like a good approach. Start by listing your homework assignments and then factor in your club meetings and sports practices. How do you feel about sticking to a schedule once you've created one?

User: I think it could help me feel more organized. But I sometimes forget to follow through.

Consultant: It's totally normal to struggle with keeping to a new routine at first. What might help you remember to stick to your schedule?

User: I could set reminders on my phone! 

Consultant: That's an excellent idea! Using reminders can help keep you on track. As you think about these new goals and strategies, how does it make you feel about your school experience overall?

User: I feel really positive! I think I have a lot to look forward to.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Focusing on the positive aspects can really help you as you pursue these goals. Is there anything else you'd like to address or any concerns before we conclude today's session?

User: No, I think I'm good! I'm excited to try out my ideas.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Robert! You've made some great plans today. Remember, it's perfectly okay to adjust as you go along. I believe you have the ability to maintain this positive momentum. 

User: Thanks! I really appreciate your help.
