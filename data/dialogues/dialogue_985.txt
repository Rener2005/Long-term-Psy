Consultant: Hello, Little A! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling really upset. Sometimes, I just cry over small things, like when my shoes get wet or when I don’t want to go to a certain class.

Consultant: I understand that crying is your way of expressing what you're going through. It's okay to feel upset. Can you tell me more about what makes you cry in those situations?

User: Well, when my shoes get wet, I just feel so frustrated and it makes me want to cry. I think it’s unfair when I have to do things I don’t want to.

Consultant: It sounds like you feel frustrated when things don't go your way. When those feelings come up, what kinds of thoughts do you have in your mind?

User: I don’t know... I just feel like everything is going wrong and no one understands me.

Consultant: That feeling of no one understanding you can be really tough. It’s important for us to explore that. What would it feel like if you could express those feelings in a different way rather than crying?

User: Maybe it would feel better? But I don't know how to do that.

Consultant: It's great that you're open to thinking about new ways to express yourself. How about we try to identify some other ways you might express your feelings when you feel upset? 

User: Okay. 

Consultant: Think about a time where you were upset but didn’t cry. What did you do instead? 

User: I think once I just sat quietly. 

Consultant: Sitting quietly can definitely be a way to cope! Now, what if you could share your feelings when you’re upset, maybe by using words instead of tears? 

User: I guess I could try telling someone how I feel, but I feel embarrassed.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel embarrassed about sharing feelings. But remember, showing how you feel is a brave thing to do! What would you say if you could tell someone you're feeling upset?

User: I would say, "I'm upset because I don't want to do this," but I don’t think they would really care.

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry about how others might respond. What if we practiced saying that together right now? It can help build your confidence. 

User: Okay… "I'm upset because I don’t want to do this." 

Consultant: That was great! How did saying that feel for you?

User: I felt a little nervous, but also a bit better.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful first step! With practice, it may become easier to express your feelings. Let’s talk about a situation from your day where you felt upset and use those words instead of crying. 

User: Like when we had to go out for labor class? I didn’t want to go, so I cried.

Consultant: Yes! So, how could you express your feelings about that class? 

User: I could say I don’t want to go outside and feel scared.

Consultant: Exactly! You can say "I feel scared about going outside." This not only helps others understand you better but also allows you to feel heard. 

User: I think I can try that when I feel upset next time.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset, Little A! Remember, it’s okay to still cry sometimes, but adding words can help you express your feelings in a different way. 

User: Yeah, I see that. 

Consultant: Let's explore another situation. Have there been any moments, like at school, where you’ve felt overwhelmed and could use your new words? 

User: Sometimes I feel overwhelmed when everyone else is doing something, and I just don’t know how to join in.

Consultant: That’s a valid feeling. What words could you use to tell someone that you feel overwhelmed and need help? 

User: Maybe I could say, "I feel lost and need some help."

Consultant: Perfect! That’s very clear and expressive. How do you think they might respond if you tell them that?

User: They might help me or see that I’m having a hard time.

Consultant: Yes! That is likely, and it can lead to support from those around you. 

User: I hope so! 

Consultant: You’re doing awesome, Little A. Every step you take to express yourself is progress. How do you feel about using your words in these situations moving forward? 

User: I feel hopeful! It might be helpful for me. 

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, remember, it’s a journey. It’s okay to have ups and downs, but keep practicing those new expressions. 

User: I will try! 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Before we conclude, do you have any thoughts or feelings you'd like to share from our session today? 

User: I feel like I have some new ideas for next time.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! I look forward to hearing about how you use those ideas in our next session. You’re doing great, Little A! 

User: Thank you! 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember, I’m here for you anytime you need to talk. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hi there, it's great to see you today! Before we dive into our session, I want to talk a bit about how you've been feeling lately. Can you share what's been on your mind?

User: Hello. I've been feeling a bit anxious and sometimes I cry when things don’t go my way. Like at school, when the teacher was late, I just couldn't help crying even though they comforted me later.

Consultant: I can see how that situation would make you feel upset. It's okay to express your feelings, but it's good to explore other ways to communicate when you're feeling overwhelmed. Can you think of other times when you've felt like crying? What were you thinking or feeling in those moments?

User: Well, usually I feel like I'm not being paid enough attention. I sometimes think, "Why doesn’t anyone notice me?" That makes me sad, and I cry.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. The thoughts of not being noticed can be quite powerful. It's understandable that you'd feel sad and want to cry. Let’s think together—what might be a different way to express that feeling instead of crying? Perhaps you could talk to someone about how you feel?

User: I guess I could try telling my parents or my brother when I'm upset, but I'm not sure if they'll understand.

Consultant: It’s a good idea to share how you feel with your family. Sometimes, they might surprise you with how supportive they can be. How would you feel about practicing saying something like, "I feel sad when I think I'm not getting enough attention?" 

User: I could try saying that, but it feels scary. What if I cry again?

Consultant: Feeling scared is completely normal, especially when trying something new. Remember, it's okay to feel different emotions, but using words can help you feel more in control. What if you practiced with me? We can pretend it's your brother or your parents.

User: Okay, let’s try it. 

Consultant: Great! I’ll pretend to be your brother. You can start by telling me how you feel.

User: Um, okay. "I feel sad when I think I'm not getting enough attention." 

Consultant: That was a brave start! How did that feel for you? 

User: A bit weird, but maybe better than crying... 

Consultant: That's a positive step! It’s normal to feel a bit weird at first. Over time, it'll become easier. What do you think might happen the next time you’re feeling sad? 

User: Maybe I could just talk instead of crying? 

Consultant: Yes, that's exactly it! You can start by saying how you feel when you're sad. And if you still find it hard, that’s okay too. Would you like to share how you think your parents might respond to you expressing yourself this way?

User: I hope they would listen and not get angry. 

Consultant: It sounds like you really desire understanding and support. What if you also let them know ahead of time that you want to share something important with them? That might prepare them to be more attentive.

User: That sounds like a good idea! When I’m calmer, I could ask them to listen to me. 

Consultant: Absolutely! You’re developing a wonderful strategy. Practicing when you feel calm can help when you are upset. Is there a situation with your family where you think you could try this out?

User: I think during dinner might be a good time. They usually listen then.

Consultant: Dinner sounds perfect! You can have a little chat with them about how you feel and practice expressing yourself. How do you feel about doing that?

User: I feel a bit more confident thinking about it.

Consultant: Confidence is key! Just remember, it’s okay to feel a mix of thoughts and emotions. We can keep working on this each session. What other ways do you think we could help you express emotions besides talking? 

User: Maybe writing? I like to write stories.

Consultant: Writing is an excellent way to express feelings! You could write a little note about how you feel and hand it to someone you trust. Would that be something you’d like to try?

User: Yes, I like that idea! 

Consultant: Wonderful! You can combine both talking and writing as tools to manage your emotions. Over time, this can help you feel less reliant on crying when you're upset. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds good. I think I can do this!

Consultant: I believe in you! You’ve already taken significant steps today. Before we wrap up, let’s summarize what you will try until our next session.

User: I want to talk to my family during dinner and maybe write a note if I feel upset.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! I’m so proud of you for being willing to try new things. These steps will help you grow. Remember, it’s okay to share your feelings however you're comfortable. 

User: Thank you! I feel happy to have a plan.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing how those conversations go in our next session. Remember, I’m here to support you. Until next time!

User: Bye!
###################
Consultant: Hello, little A! I'm really glad you're here today. Before we start, I want to make sure you feel comfortable. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been really upset at home. My brother took the cookies I wanted, and I ended up crying. Mama didn't calm me down right away, and I felt really ignored.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It must have been frustrating for you to not get the attention you needed. Can you tell me more about how you felt when your brother took the cookies?

User: I just got really angry and sad at the same time. I wanted to yell, but I ended up just crying instead.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel angry and sad, especially when things don’t go the way we want them to. Sometimes our feelings can feel really big. Let’s explore this together. When you feel really upset, what do you usually do to cope?

User: I... I just cry. I don’t know what else to do. Sometimes I yell at my brother, but that doesn’t help.

Consultant: I see. Crying is a way for you to express your feelings, and that’s okay. But it sounds like you want to find other ways too. How about we practice some techniques that can help you calm down before you get to that crying stage? Would you be interested in trying that?

User: Yeah, I guess so. I want to feel better.

Consultant: That’s a great attitude! One simple technique we can try is deep breathing. It can help you feel a little calmer when you’re upset. Would you like to learn how to do that with me?

User: Okay! How do I do it?

Consultant: Here’s how it works: You take a slow, deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a moment, and then breathe out gently through your mouth. Let’s try it together. Ready? Deep breath in… hold it… and now breathe out. How did that feel for you?

User: I felt a little good, but it was hard to remember to do it when I'm upset.

Consultant: That’s okay! It can be tricky at first. The important thing is to practice it when you’re feeling calm, so it becomes easier to remember when you’re upset. Would you like to practice it a few more times together?

User: Sure! I can try.

Consultant: Great! Let’s do it again. Ready? Deep breath in… hold it… and breathe out. Wonderful! One more time. Deep breath in… and out. How do you feel after practicing?

User: I feel a bit lighter. It’s nice.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Another helpful technique is self-talk, which means saying kind things to yourself when you’re feeling upset. Can you think of something nice you could say to yourself when you start feeling angry or sad?

User: Umm... maybe "It's okay to be sad"? 

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a perfect start. Remembering that it's okay to feel sad can help you be kinder to yourself during tough moments. How about we practice saying that together?

User: Okay. "It's okay to be sad."

Consultant: You did it! How did that feel to say?

User: It felt... nice. Maybe it's okay to feel sad sometimes.

Consultant: Exactly! You are allowed to feel sad, and it’s a part of being human. Let’s think about when you might use your new breathing technique and positive self-talk when something upsets you, like when your brother takes something from you. What would you do?

User: I can breathe and say it's okay to be sad before I cry.

Consultant: Yes! That sounds like a great plan. Remember, it’s all about taking those steps to calm down before things become overwhelming. How confident do you feel about trying this next time?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I want to try!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful attitude to have! Remember, it’s normal to feel nervous about trying new things. Just like practicing the breathing, the more you try these techniques, the easier they will become. 

User: Yeah, I can practice!

Consultant: Exactly! Would you like to talk about anything else today or would you feel ready to end our session and practice what we discussed?

User: I think I’d like to finish and try what we practiced!

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! I’m proud of you for being open to learning these techniques. Remember, if things get tricky, you can always come back here for support. 

User: Thank you! I’ll try!

Consultant: You're welcome, little A! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself!
###################
Consultant: Hello, little A! I’m glad to see you here today. Let’s talk about what’s been on your mind lately. How have you been feeling?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling kind of frustrated. I was crying because my brother wouldn’t share his toys with me. It made me upset, but I tried to calm myself down by thinking of other ways to ask him to share.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re trying really hard to manage your feelings about that situation, which is great! Could you tell me how you felt when you started to cry, and what thoughts were running through your mind?

User: Well, I felt really sad because I wanted to play with him. I thought he was being mean for not sharing, and that made me feel even worse.

Consultant: I see. It can be tough when we feel like others aren’t being fair to us. It’s understandable that a thought like that would make you feel sad. Let’s explore that feeling—what else were you thinking after you cried?

User: After I cried, I thought maybe I could try talking to him differently. I wanted to say, “Can I play with that toy for a little while?” instead of just asking to share.

Consultant: That’s a really good approach! You took a step back and tried to think of a better way to communicate. How did you feel about that idea?

User: I felt a bit better, like I was trying to do something instead of just being sad.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Taking action can really help change how we feel. Let’s talk about recognizing your emotions. When you start to feel upset, what are some signs that tell you this is happening?

User: Sometimes I feel a tight feeling in my chest, or I might want to cry.

Consultant: Those are important signals to notice! Recognizing those feelings can help you decide what to do next. When you feel those signs, what skills do you think could help you manage those emotions?

User: I’ve been trying to take deep breaths and think happy thoughts. But sometimes I still feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a great skill! It can really help calm you down. If you start to feel overwhelmed, we can also think about using something like emotion cards. Do you know what I mean by that?

User: Um, I think so. Are they like cards with faces showing different feelings on them?

Consultant: Exactly! They can help you identify what you’re feeling at the moment. If you can label your emotions, you can understand them better and figure out the best way to respond. Would you like to give it a try?

User: I would! That sounds interesting! 

Consultant: Wonderful! We can create a few emotion cards together. We can write down different feelings and draw faces or symbols to represent them. This way, when you feel something strong, you can look at these cards and choose the right one.

User: That sounds fun! I think I can do that!

Consultant: I believe in you, A! This can really help you gain more control. Let’s say you have a card for sadness. What might help you when you pick that card to manage that feeling?

User: I could think of something that makes me happy, like playing outside or drawing.

Consultant: Those are great coping mechanisms! Thinking of something you enjoy can definitely lighten the mood. Now, let’s practice together. What if you were to feel sad right now? What would you do after picking your emotion card for sadness?

User: I would take some deep breaths and maybe try drawing something happy after.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! It sounds like you’re really understanding how to manage your emotions better. How do you feel about your progress today?

User: I feel more confident! I didn’t think I could handle my feelings, but now I know I can try.

Consultant: That’s an amazing feeling to have! You’re learning to take charge of your emotions, and that’s something to be proud of. As we move forward, remember that practicing these skills is key. Do you have any other thoughts or situations you want to discuss today?

User: Not right now, I’m just happy to have this progress. But I want to keep practicing.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing is crucial. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve learned. You’re starting to understand your feelings better, and you have new tools to handle them. How do you plan to practice what we talked about?

User: I’ll make my emotion cards and use them when I feel upset. I’m excited!

Consultant: That’s a great plan! I can’t wait to hear how it goes next time. Remember, whenever you need support, I'm here for you. Keep going, and I believe you will keep making progress!

User: Thank you! I feel better talking to you. See you next time!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to be here for you. See you next time, little A!
###################
Consultant: Hello, A! I'm really happy to see you in this session. How have you been feeling since our last talk? 

User: Hi! I feel like I've been doing a bit better with my emotions. I didn't cry when my teacher criticized me in class, and I actually used some of the emotional dialogue techniques we talked about.

Consultant: That's fantastic, A! It sounds like you've made significant progress by using those techniques. Can you tell me more about how you felt when you handled that situation?

User: I felt proud of myself because I didn’t cry like I usually do. I remembered what we practiced, and it helped me stay calm. 

Consultant: It’s great to hear that! Feeling proud is such a positive emotion. Can you describe what specifically helped you stay calm in that moment? 

User: I just took a deep breath and reminded myself that it’s okay to make mistakes. I thought about what my teacher said instead of just feeling upset.

Consultant: That’s a powerful approach. Taking deep breaths can really help in those situations. How did your classmates respond when you stayed calm?

User: They seemed surprised because I usually get upset. I think they were just shocked at how I handled it.

Consultant: It sounds like you surprised not only yourself but also your classmates! How did that make you feel about your ability to manage your emotions moving forward?

User: It made me feel more confident, like I can actually control how I react to things. 

Consultant: Confidence is such an important part of managing emotions. Are there other situations where you think you can apply what you've learned? 

User: Yes! Sometimes I argue with my brother a lot. I think if I could use those techniques then, it might help us get along better.

Consultant: That's a brilliant idea, A! We can actually practice some scenarios that might trigger those emotions during arguments with your brother. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I think it would help me a lot.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine a situation where your brother wants to play a game, but you want to do something else. How do you think you might feel, and how might you respond?

User: I might feel upset and want to argue with him. But instead of arguing, I could try to express how I feel.

Consultant: Exactly! Expressing your feelings instead of arguing is a fantastic step. What words would you use to tell him you’re upset?

User: I could say, "I'm feeling upset because I want to do something else right now. Can we choose a time to play together later?"

Consultant: That’s a wonderful way to express your feelings, A! It’s assertive and calm. How do you think he might respond to that?

User: I think he would understand and not get angry. He usually listens when I explain my feelings.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive outcome! By using your new skills, you can strengthen your relationship with your brother too. Are there other emotions you’d like to explore handling in different scenarios?

User: Sometimes I feel really anxious about joining new activities or making friends. I don’t want to feel left out.

Consultant: Addressing anxiety is really important. Let’s practice a situation where you might feel anxious about meeting new people. What thoughts often come to mind in those moments?

User: I usually think that they won’t like me or that I’ll say something stupid.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very overwhelming. How about we challenge those thoughts? What evidence do you have that supports or goes against those ideas?

User: Well, I made a new friend last time at a school event, and we had a lot of fun.

Consultant: That’s a perfect example! Remembering times when you connected with others can help counter those anxious thoughts. How does recalling that experience change how you feel about meeting new people?

User: It makes me feel a little less scared, like maybe I can make friends again.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on positive experiences can really help ease that anxiety. What’s a small step you could take towards joining a new activity?

User: Maybe I could try to participate in the art club after school. I like drawing, and it might be easier to talk to people there.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Engaging in activities you enjoy can be a great way to meet people and form connections. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel excited but also a bit nervous. I hope I can remember what to say.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a mix of excitement and nerves. How about we prepare a few sentences you can use when you first introduce yourself?

User: That sounds helpful! I could say my name and that I like to draw. Maybe ask them what they like too.

Consultant: Perfect approach, A. That will help create a friendly atmosphere right from the start. Are you feeling more prepared for that step now?

User: Yes, I think it's making me feel a bit more confident. 

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Remember, every step you take helps build your confidence and ability to handle emotions. Before we end today, let's briefly summarize your progress and the skills you've developed.

User: I’ve learned to use breathing techniques, express my feelings calmly, and challenge my negative thoughts.

Consultant: Exactly! You've done an amazing job working on these skills. As you continue to practice them, I believe you'll find even more success in managing your emotions. 

User: Thank you! I feel much better about everything we talked about.

Consultant: You're welcome, A! I'm really proud of the progress you've made. Always remember, you've got these skills to support you. If you ever feel you need more help, just reach out. 

User: I will! Thank you for your help today!

Consultant: It was my pleasure, A! Keep up the great work, and I look forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, little A! I'm so glad to see you today. I want to start by congratulating you on the excellent performance you've shown at school recently! How are you feeling about that?

User: Hi! Thank you! I feel really happy about it. I didn't expect to get praised, and it made me feel confident. But sometimes, I still cry when I don't get along with my brother.

Consultant: It sounds like you've experienced a real boost in your confidence from the praise! That’s wonderful to hear. I also understand that you still have moments of sadness when you and your brother argue. Can you tell me a bit more about those times?

User: Well, sometimes we just don't agree on things. Like when he wants to play a game that I don’t like. I feel left out and then I cry because it makes me upset.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel upset when you have different preferences from your brother. How do you usually feel immediately after crying? 

User: I just feel really mad and sad at the same time. But then, it’s like I forget what I was upset about, and I move on after a little while.

Consultant: It’s great that you can move on after some time! That shows strength. But those feelings of anger and sadness can be tough. Let’s think about how you could handle those situations without crying. Have you thought about different ways to talk with your brother when you disagree?

User: Sometimes I just tell him I don’t want to play and that makes him upset too. But I don’t know how else to say it without making him cry.

Consultant: It’s kind of you to think about how your words might affect him! Perhaps we could practice some different ways to express your feelings that would help both of you. For example, instead of saying, "I don’t want to play," you might say, "I’d rather do something else." What do you think about trying that?

User: I could try that! But what if he gets mad?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It might be helpful to remind yourself that it’s okay for both of you to have different feelings. Plus, it might also help to suggest an alternative activity you both can enjoy. Would you like to come up with some ideas together?

User: Sure! Maybe we can draw or play outside instead.

Consultant: Those sound like great alternatives! By suggesting these activities, you’re not only expressing your feelings but also keeping the fun going. It’s a wonderful way to develop your communication skills. Can you share how you feel when you play together? 

User: I feel happy when we play together. I love laughing and having fun!

Consultant: Happiness is such a lovely feeling! It’s fantastic that you can experience joy with your brother. What about when you feel that happiness—can you think of ways to keep that positive atmosphere going even when you disagree?

User: Maybe we could make a deal? Like, take turns picking games.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Making deals and taking turns can help both of you enjoy your time together. It shows understanding and respect for each other's choices. How do you feel about approaching your brother with this idea?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited! 

Consultant: Feeling nervous is completely natural, and it also shows you care about the outcome. Remember, by sharing this idea, you're creating a chance for better understanding between you two. If it doesn’t go as planned, what could you say to yourself to help manage how you feel?

User: I could remind myself it’s okay if he doesn’t want to do it my way. I can try again later.

Consultant: Absolutely, that’s a wonderful strategy! It’s great that you can be understanding of his feelings and be open to trying again. How does that make you feel, knowing you have a plan?

User: It makes me feel less worried and more ready!

Consultant: That’s an excellent mindset, little A! You’re showing great progress in managing your feelings and communicating with your brother. As we finish our session today, what do you think is the most important thing you’ve learned that you can use in the future?

User: I think learning how to express what I want without crying is the most important thing!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic takeaway, and I’m proud of you for recognizing that! Always remember, understanding your feelings and communicating them properly will help you in many situations. I believe you have the skills to navigate these challenges in the future! If you ever need to talk more, I’m here for you.

User: Thank you! I feel really happy after talking. I’ll try my best!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, little A! I’m delighted to hear that. Keep up the great work, and don’t hesitate to reach out when you want to chat again. Have a wonderful day!
