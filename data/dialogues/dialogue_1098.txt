Consultant: Hello, Huang! I'm glad you're here for our session today. I want to acknowledge the challenges you've been facing recently. Can you share with me how you've been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. To be honest, I'm still feeling quite heartbroken. My boyfriend's sudden distance has made me really question my worth. It hurts to see him getting close to someone else. I just feel lost and unsure about everything.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time. It's understandable to feel heartbroken and question your self-worth after a betrayal like that. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts have been going through your mind regarding this situation?

User: I keep thinking that if he chose someone else over me, I must not be good enough. It’s like I’m not worthy of love or happiness anymore. I just don’t know how to get past this feeling.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pain and self-doubt right now, and those thoughts make it hard to see your worth. Let's explore these thoughts together. How strong do you believe those thoughts about not being good enough are on a scale from 1 to 10?

User: I would say it's a solid 9. I feel almost certain that there’s something wrong with me.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. A 9 is quite high, indicating that those thoughts are very powerful for you right now. Can we examine if there’s any evidence to support this belief? Are there other sides to this situation, or other people in your life who see your worth?

User: My friends are supportive, and they say I’m a good person. But sometimes, I feel like they’re just saying that to comfort me. It’s hard to believe it's true.

Consultant: It’s understandable that you might doubt their support when you feel down. However, it sounds like there's some evidence from your friends that contradicts the belief of not being good enough. If you were to consider what your friends see in you, what might that be?

User: They say I’m kind and thoughtful. I try to be there for them, but it’s hard to see those qualities in myself right now.

Consultant: Those qualities are important and reflect your value. It's normal to struggle with self-perception, especially after a painful experience. How would you advise a friend who was in your situation and felt this way about herself?

User: I would probably tell her that she deserves better and that one person’s decision doesn’t define her worth.

Consultant: That’s a very empathetic and wise perspective. You definitely deserve better, and it’s important to remind yourself of that. Can we try practicing that self-compassion together? Perhaps you could tell yourself something similar whenever those negative thoughts come up.

User: I guess I could try that. It just seems hard to change how I feel overnight.

Consultant: It is indeed challenging, and it’s okay to take things one step at a time. Changing thoughts and feelings doesn’t happen instantly. What if instead of focusing on changing them completely, we focus on small moments of self-kindness throughout your day? 

User: That sounds more manageable. I think I could start by acknowledging when I do something good, even if it’s small.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Celebrating small achievements can really help shift your mindset over time. This week, can you commit to writing down at least one positive thing about yourself or something you did well each day? 

User: Yes, I can do that. I think I need reminders of my worth outside of this relationship.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re starting to see the potential for a shift in perspective. As you work on recognizing your positive traits, how do you envision this impacting your feelings about social interactions and future relationships?

User: Maybe it will help me feel more confident about meeting new people. Right now, I’ve been avoiding social situations because I just don’t want to deal with it.

Consultant: That avoidance is understandable when you’re feeling anxious. However, gradually exposing yourself to social situations could really help build your confidence. Can we brainstorm some small, manageable ways you might re-enter your social circle?

User: I think I could start by joining a study group or something casual with friends from class. That doesn’t feel too overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic start! A study group can provide structure and a focus on school, which might make social interactions feel less intense. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think it’s a good idea. I just hope I won’t feel out of place.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous when stepping back into social situations. Remember, it’s about taking small steps and being kind to yourself. You might surprise yourself with how supported and welcomed you feel. How about we set a goal for you to reach out to someone by next week?

User: Yes, I’ll try to reach out and see if anyone is interested in forming a study group. That feels doable.

Consultant: Great! I believe you can do it. Before we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed and your action items moving forward so you can feel confident about your path ahead.

User: We talked about recognizing my self-worth and taking small steps to be kinder to myself. I also plan to reach out to form a study group. 

Consultant: Exactly! And remember, self-compassion is a journey. You’re already making progress just by acknowledging these feelings and taking steps to address them. I’m here to support you through this process, and I look forward to hearing about your experience in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I feel a little more hopeful today. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Huang. Remember, it’s okay to feel what you’re feeling, and you’re not alone. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Huang! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello. I’ve been feeling a mix of relief and anxiety. I managed to say no to a friend's gathering, which felt significant, but I still worry about my ability to connect with others.

Consultant: That sounds like a big step toward becoming more comfortable with social situations. It’s natural to feel both a sense of accomplishment and anxiety at the same time. Can you share more about what you felt when you turned down the invitation?

User: I felt proud for standing my ground, but then I started doubting if I should have gone. What if missing out means I'm isolating myself more?

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel conflicted. You did something that felt right for you at that moment, but it’s common to second-guess ourselves afterward. Can we explore what specific thoughts were going through your mind when you decided not to attend?

User: I thought about how uncomfortable I usually feel at these gatherings. I imagined feeling out of place and not being able to connect with anyone. 

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts were quite overwhelming in that moment. How did those thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: They made me feel really anxious, like I was stuck between wanting to go and fearing the experience would be terrible.

Consultant: That’s a tough spot to be in. Let’s look at those thoughts. Can you think of any evidence that supports the idea that you would have felt out of place or unable to connect?

User: I guess I've had those feelings before, but I can't say every gathering has been bad. Sometimes I feel okay.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize that not every experience has to be negative. This might be a good opportunity to replace the extreme thought with a more balanced one. What could be a more realistic way to view those gatherings?

User: Maybe I could think that while I might feel a bit awkward, I could also meet someone nice or find a moment of connection.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a much healthier perspective. Let's build on that. What would it take for you to feel a bit more comfortable attending a social event in the future?

User: I suppose if I could go with someone I trust, it might lessen my anxiety about connecting with others.

Consultant: Bringing a friend can definitely help ease anxiety. We can also think about smaller gatherings at first, perhaps just a coffee with one or two friends. How does that sound?

User: That sounds more manageable. It would feel less daunting, and I could practice connecting in a less overwhelming environment.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! Let’s also consider how you can respond to any anxious thoughts that may arise. If you start to feel anxious about the gathering, what might be a helpful thought to tell yourself?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to feel a little anxious and that I’m capable of handling the situation.

Consultant: That’s a perfect way to frame it. Acknowledging your feelings while reassuring yourself of your capabilities can really help. Moving forward, how do you feel about taking this step to engage in smaller social situations?

User: I feel optimistic about trying it out. It's reassuring to think I can approach it at my own pace.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we work on this, it’ll also be important to reflect on your experiences afterward. We can explore how each interaction felt and what you can take from them. How would you feel about that?

User: I think that would be helpful. I’d like to learn from each experience to build up my confidence slowly.

Consultant: Absolutely! Each experience will add to your confidence. Just remember, it’s a process, and it’s okay to take your time. So what’s our next step? When do you think you could try out a smaller social interaction?

User: Maybe I could invite a close friend for coffee this weekend. I feel ready to try.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! I’m here to support you as you take that step. Remember to take notes afterward on how it felt—what went well and any challenges you faced. 

User: I will definitely do that. I’m feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness, but it's a start!

Consultant: That’s a great mindset to have! It's completely normal to feel both excited and nervous. After you’ve had your coffee, we’ll take some time to reflect on it in our next session. Would you like to set some goals for what you’d like to achieve by then?

User: I hope to focus on being present during the conversation and enjoying the moment rather than worrying so much.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! Enjoying the moment will help reduce anxiety. I’m looking forward to hearing all about your experience next time. Remember, you’re learning and growing with each step you take.

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful now. I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Huang! I’m proud of the progress you’re making. Remember, it’s okay to have ups and downs. Just keep taking those strides, and I’ll be here whenever you need guidance. 

User: I will! See you next time!

Consultant: Take care, Huang. Until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Huang! I'm glad you're here today. Let’s start by discussing how you’ve been feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a mix of pride and anxiety. I performed well in a recent group project, but I can't shake off the feeling that I'm not being recognized for my efforts. It's frustrating.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a sense of accomplishment from your project, yet you're feeling anxious about others not recognizing your hard work. Can you tell me more about what thoughts are running through your mind regarding this situation?

User: I keep thinking that maybe my efforts aren’t good enough. Even though I did well, I wonder if people really see my contributions, or if they just think I'm lucky or not as capable as others.

Consultant: I can imagine how that might feel disheartening. You mentioned feeling like your contributions aren’t valued. Can you share how those thoughts impact your emotions and behaviors?

User: When I think no one appreciates me, I feel really down and it makes me want to avoid socializing. I end up isolating myself instead of celebrating successes with my classmates.

Consultant: It seems that these thoughts lead you to withdraw from social interactions, which can further enhance those feelings of doubt. What do you think would happen if you challenged these negative thoughts about your contributions?

User: I guess I would feel a little less anxious if I could prove to myself that I did contribute meaningfully. But it’s hard to shake off that feeling of self-doubt.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Challenging those thoughts can be tough. Let’s try something together. Can you think of specific instances where you received positive feedback or recognition from others for your contributions?

User: Well, during the project, my teammates did mention my research skills were really helpful. I also received some praise from our professor. But still, it feels overshadowed by my worries.

Consultant: Great! It’s important to acknowledge those instances of positive feedback. How can you remind yourself of these strengths and accomplishments when those doubts creep in?

User: Maybe I could write them down or remind myself of my good work when I start feeling anxious. But I'm not sure that would fully help me.

Consultant: Writing down your achievements is a fantastic idea! It serves as a tangible reminder of your capabilities. Also, let's challenge those negative thoughts together. What evidence supports the belief that your efforts aren’t good enough?

User: I know logically that my professor praised my work, but I still feel like I could have done better compared to others.

Consultant: It’s common to compare ourselves to others, but it often leads to distorted views of our abilities. Imagine if a friend expressed the same thoughts; how would you reassure them?

User: I would tell them they did their best and that it's okay not to be perfect. I guess I should be kinder to myself in the same way.

Consultant: Exactly! Practicing self-compassion can significantly change how you perceive your achievements. Could you think of a positive affirmation you could tell yourself when those doubts arise?

User: Maybe I could say, “I am capable and my contributions matter” or “I’ve succeeded before, and I can succeed again.”

Consultant: Those affirmations sound powerful! Let’s incorporate them in your daily routine. How might affirming these statements change your emotional state and behavior moving forward?

User: I think it could help me feel more empowered and encourage me to engage more with others instead of avoiding them.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Engaging positively with others can reinforce your self-worth. Let's also consider activities that make you feel confident. What things do you enjoy that make you feel good about yourself?

User: I love writing and being creative. When I focus on those activities, I often forget my worries.

Consultant: Focusing on your passions can definitely uplift your mood. Could you set aside time each week to engage in writing or creative projects? 

User: Yes, I can definitely make time for that. It’s something I’ve missed lately.

Consultant: Wonderful! Balancing your responsibilities with things you love can help alleviate anxiety. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the steps we've discussed to enhance your self-affirmation?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I like the idea of self-affirmations and writing down my achievements. It feels manageable.

Consultant: I'm thrilled to hear that, Huang! Remember that acknowledging your feelings and empowering yourself through these strategies can significantly contribute to your well-being. Before our next session, practice those affirmations and engage in your creative activities. 

User: I will! Thank you so much for your guidance today. It’s made me feel more relaxed and ready to face my doubts.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It’s been a pleasure to talk with you today. Remember, you’re already on a positive path, and you have the tools to continue building your confidence. I'll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Huang! I’m glad to see you again. I hope you're feeling a bit more relaxed since our last session. How are you doing today?

User: Hi! I think I feel a little better. I’ve started to open up more with my parents about my feelings, which is new for me. But at the same time, I still find it hard to express myself sometimes. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear that you’re beginning to share your feelings with your parents! Being able to express yourself is a huge step forward. Can you share with me what specific feelings are harder for you to express?

User: I often struggle to talk about sadness. When I try to explain how I feel to others, I tend to hold back, and then I end up feeling even more upset. 

Consultant: It sounds like the act of expressing your sadness is quite challenging for you, and that can create a cycle of frustration. Can you recall a recent moment where you felt sad but found it hard to express that?

User: Yes. Just the other day, I felt really down about my future and I wanted to talk to my parents, but I couldn’t find the right words. I ended up crying alone in my room instead. 

Consultant: It sounds really tough to feel that way and to end up alone with those feelings. Let’s explore that moment a bit. What thoughts were running through your mind when you felt that sadness?

User: I kept thinking that I might not find a job after graduation, which made me feel worthless. 

Consultant: That thought seems quite heavy. Feeling worthless can have a big impact on your emotional state. Can we look at that thought together? How true do you feel that statement is about yourself?

User: I don't know... It feels really true when I’m overwhelmed, but I try to remind myself that I have skills, even if they feel small. 

Consultant: Acknowledging your skills is a great step! Let’s challenge that feeling of worthlessness together. If a friend told you they felt that way, what would you say to them?

User: I would probably tell them they have many talents and that they shouldn’t be so hard on themselves. 

Consultant: Exactly! You can extend that same kindness to yourself. What might happen if you reframed your thoughts into something more supportive for yourself?

User: Maybe I could say something like, “I’m still learning and that’s okay.” 

Consultant: That’s an excellent reframing! Can we practice saying that out loud together? 

User: Sure! “I’m still learning and that’s okay.” 

Consultant: That sounded great, Huang! How did that feel to say that?

User: It felt a little comforting, actually. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let's talk about how we can apply this technique when you're feeling sad and want to express it to others. 

User: Okay! I guess I could try telling my parents that I’m feeling unsure about my future, instead of holding it all in.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a solid step. When you frame it that way, it becomes less overwhelming and opens up room for discussion. Would you be willing to practice expressing that with me now?

User: Yes, I can try. “Mom, I feel unsure about my future, and it’s been weighing on me.” 

Consultant: That was wonderful! You communicated your feelings clearly. How did it feel to say that to someone, even if it’s just me?

User: It felt relieving. I'm still nervous about saying it to my parents, but it’s a start. 

Consultant: That's a brave step forward! It sounds like we've made good progress in developing your emotion expression skills today. What do you think will help you maintain this practice with your parents?

User: Maybe I could set a goal to talk to them about how I feel once a week. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Setting a regular time to check in can help both you and your parents stay connected. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what you’ve gained and how you want to keep this positivity moving forward. 

User: I’ve learned that I can reframe my negative thoughts and that expressing how I feel doesn’t have to be so scary. 

Consultant: You’ve made incredible strides today, Huang. Remember that these tools are available to you whenever you need them. Keep practicing, and you’ll continue to grow. If you need support, you always have a place to come back to. 

User: Thank you! I feel much more optimistic and ready to talk to my parents more openly. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm proud of your progress. Keep nurturing that openness within yourself, and I look forward to hearing about your future experiences when we meet again.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Huang! It's great to see you today. I'm glad you're here. Can you share with me how you've been feeling lately and what's been on your mind?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good actually. I've been trying to be more involved in school activities and make new friends. But sometimes, I worry if I'm doing enough to keep this positive feeling going.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear that you're getting involved and trying to build new friendships! It sounds like you want to sustain this positive momentum. What specific things do you think might help you maintain this state?

User: I think if I could explore more things that interest me, like joining new clubs or hobbies, that might help. But I also feel a bit anxious about putting myself out there sometimes.

Consultant: Exploring new interests and hobbies can definitely enhance your experience. It's understandable to feel anxious about stepping out of your comfort zone. Can you tell me more about that anxiety? What thoughts come to your mind when you think about joining new activities?

User: I often think that people might not like me or that I’ll embarrass myself. That makes me hesitate to approach new people or join groups.

Consultant: Those feelings are quite common, Huang. It can be tough when we fear rejection or feel insecure. Let's look at those thoughts together. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that people might not like you?

User: Well, there have been times when I felt ignored in conversations. I just thought maybe I'm not interesting enough.

Consultant: It's easy to conclude that we are uninteresting based on limited experiences. However, have there been times when people responded positively to you or showed interest in what you had to say?

User: Yes, actually. Some of my classmates have complimented me on my presentations or asked for my opinion. I just sometimes forget those moments when I'm feeling down.

Consultant: It's wonderful that you have had positive experiences! It might help to remind yourself of those moments when you're feeling anxious. We can work on creating a list of your interests and talents that can bolster your confidence when you feel that way. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds helpful! I think writing down what I'm good at might make me feel better about approaching people.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let's start that list together. What are some interests or skills you believe you have that you can feel proud of?

User: I love painting and I've been told I'm good at it. I also enjoy writing stories, although I haven't shared them much.

Consultant: Those are fantastic interests to have! Painting and writing can be great ways to express yourself and connect with others. Maybe you can look for art clubs or writing groups at your school. How do you feel about that idea?

User: I think that could be really fun! I’ve been wanting to meet people who share similar interests.

Consultant: That's a great approach! By engaging in activities you love, you'll likely find connections with others who share your passions. Let’s also think about setting small, achievable goals as you explore these groups. What would be a small step you could take towards joining one?

User: I could start by attending a club meeting as a guest just to see what it's like. That feels less intimidating.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan, Huang! Starting as a guest lets you observe and ease into the experience without pressure. How do you plan to remind yourself to focus on the positive moments when you start to feel anxious?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal and write about any good experiences I have. That way, I can look back at it when I'm feeling unsure.

Consultant: A journal is a wonderful idea! It can be a great tool for reflecting on your experiences and recognizing your growth. How do you feel about this strategy moving forward?

User: I feel really good about it. I think it will help me stay grounded and remember that I can handle social situations.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Keeping track of your feelings and experiences is a powerful way of reinforcing your self-awareness and confidence. As we wrap up today, let’s revisit what you've learned and how your perspective has shifted. 

User: I’ve realized that I tend to focus on negative thoughts and feelings but there are also many good moments I can cherish.

Consultant: That's a significant insight, Huang! Recognizing the balance between positive and negative experiences can help you manage your anxiety better. What's one thing you'll take away from our conversation today?

User: I think I can approach new situations with less fear, knowing that I have skills and good experiences to lean on.

Consultant: Absolutely! You've shown great progress in how you view yourself and the possibilities ahead. Remember, it's perfectly normal to feel anxious from time to time, but you have the tools to navigate those feelings. 

User: Thank you so much for your help! I feel more confident now.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Huang! I'm proud of you for taking these steps. If you ever feel overwhelmed, remember to reach out. I believe you can continue on this path of growth and connection!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Huang! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing better lately. Celebrating my birthday with my family made me feel really supported. It was nice to experience that warmth.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Celebrating a birthday with loved ones can bring a lot of joy. How has that experience impacted your mood since then?

User: I feel less lonely and more connected to my family. It's like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I've been reflecting on how important they are to me.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you feel more connected and lighter. Recognizing the value of family support can be really empowering. Have you thought about how you can continue to nurture that connection moving forward?

User: Yes, I want to spend more quality time with them. I think I might start organizing family activities more often, just to keep that bond strong.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Engaging in family activities can strengthen those connections. What kind of activities do you enjoy doing together?

User: We like going for walks, cooking meals together, and watching movies. I think those moments really bring us closer.

Consultant: Those sound like meaningful ways to connect! As you move forward, it might be helpful to establish a routine for these activities. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good. Having a routine would make it easier to prioritize family time. I think I can start by planning something for this weekend.

Consultant: Planning for the weekend is a great first step! As you look ahead, let’s also discuss your personal development goals. What do you envision for your future?

User: I’m not entirely sure yet, but I want to graduate successfully and maybe explore some internships next year. I feel a bit lost about what to do after school.

Consultant: It's common to feel uncertain about the future, especially with graduation approaching. Let’s break that down a bit. What are your interests or subjects you enjoy studying?

User: I really like psychology and sociology. I find human behavior fascinating. But I'm worried about finding a job in those fields.

Consultant: Those are great fields with many possibilities! It’s understandable to feel worried about job prospects. Have you considered exploring internships or volunteer opportunities to gain some experience?

User: I have thought about it! I just don’t know where to start looking. I'm anxious about putting myself out there and getting rejected.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about the job search. Sometimes we can get caught up in fear of rejection. Let's think about this together. What if you viewed it as a learning experience rather than focusing solely on the outcome?

User: That's a new perspective. If I see it as learning, it seems less daunting, and I might actually enjoy the process.

Consultant: Exactly! Shifting your mindset can make a significant difference. It’s about gaining experience and building skills along the way. Would you be willing to set a small goal, like researching one internship opportunity this week?

User: Yes, I can do that. I think starting small will help with my anxiety. I’ll look into psychology internships and see what’s available.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Remember, every step you take is progress. As you pursue these opportunities, it’s important to reflect on your experiences and feelings. How do you think you’ll keep track of that?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal or a note on my phone to write down my experiences and feelings along the way. I like the idea of reflecting on my journey.

Consultant: Journaling is an excellent way to process your thoughts and track your progress. It will allow you to notice patterns and celebrate your achievements, no matter how small. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel optimistic about keeping a journal. It’ll be good to have a space to express my thoughts as I move forward.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It sounds like you're carving a path that feels more aligned with who you are. As we conclude today’s session, let's summarize your key takeaways. What do you feel are the most important things you want to remember going forward?

User: I want to remember to prioritize family time and to view my internship search as a learning opportunity rather than just a task. I also want to keep journaling my thoughts.

Consultant: Those are wonderful insights, Huang! You’ve made great progress and have valuable strategies to continue on this journey. Remember, it’s okay to seek support when needed, and you’ve clearly recognized the strength of your family support.

User: Yes, I feel more secure in my support system now. Thank you for your guidance!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It has been a pleasure working with you. Remember, you have the skills to handle what comes next in your journey. If you ever need to talk again, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care!

User: Thank you! I will. Take care!
