Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today, Ding. Before we dive in, I want to take a moment to talk about how you’ve been feeling. Can you share what has been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I feel quite lost. Since I found out about my father's affair during the summer, everything has just turned upside down. I’ve been struggling to focus on my studies, and it feels like my whole motivation is gone.

Consultant: It sounds like the news about your father's affair has really shaken things up for you, and it's affecting your motivation to study. Can you tell me more about how this situation has impacted your daily life and emotions?

User: I used to enjoy studying, but now I find myself just sitting around, feeling apathetic about everything. It’s like I can't get myself to care about anything, including my exams. I just feel abandoned, as if my family is falling apart.

Consultant: That's really tough, and it's understandable how you’d feel that way. The feeling of being abandoned can be very intense, especially coming from a close family situation. What thoughts have been running through your mind when you think about your family and your studies?

User: I've been thinking a lot about how my father could do this to us. It's like I don't even know who he is anymore. I also feel like my mother has been shielding me from the truth, which just makes me feel more isolated. It feels like I can't trust anyone.

Consultant: I can see how that situation would create a sense of distrust and isolation for you. It’s painful when we feel disconnected from our loved ones. Can you describe how those thoughts make you feel day to day? 

User: They make me feel anxious and depressed. I'm worried about my grades, but I can’t seem to motivate myself to study. I’m just anxious about everything, like what’s going to happen to my family. It’s overwhelming.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed in such an emotionally charged situation. Let’s take a moment to unpack those thoughts and feelings. What specific thoughts arise when you start to feel anxious about your family and your studies?

User: I keep thinking that if my father can betray us, then what’s the point of trying to succeed in school? It feels pointless. I guess I also feel like I’m letting my parents down by not doing well academically.

Consultant: It sounds like you're connecting your father's actions to your own sense of purpose and self-worth. That can be a heavy burden to carry. Can we explore the evidence behind these thoughts? For instance, is there a way to view your academic efforts independently of your family's situation? 

User: I guess from another perspective, my studies are for my own future, not just for my parents. But it’s hard to separate that when everything feels so connected right now.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Ding. Your education is indeed for your personal growth and future. Let's challenge this negative thought. If a friend were in your shoes, feeling like their family issues are affecting their studies, what would you advise them to think or do?

User: I’d probably tell them to focus on what they can control and not feel guilty about things they can't change. But I’m struggling to take my own advice.

Consultant: It’s common to give good advice to others and find it difficult to apply it to ourselves. Let's try to think of some small steps you could take to focus on your studies despite the family issues. What’s something manageable you could do this week to start re-engaging with your studies?

User: Maybe I could set a small goal to study for an hour a day? It sounds simple, but I haven't even managed to do that in a while. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan. Setting a small, achievable goal can help rebuild your motivation. How do you think it would feel to accomplish that goal each day?

User: I think it might help me feel a bit accomplished, even if it’s just a little. I guess it could help restore some of my confidence.

Consultant: Absolutely, those small wins can significantly impact your overall mindset. As you work on this goal, try to also recognize how you feel after accomplishing it. Let’s also talk about any support you might need during this time. Is there anyone you trust that you could talk to about how you’re feeling?

User: I haven’t really talked to anyone about it. I’m not sure who I'd feel comfortable with. I don’t want to burden my friends with my problems.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel hesitant about sharing your difficulties. However, sharing can often lighten the load. Perhaps you could look for a friend who has a knack for being supportive. If you feel ready, you might even think about discussing it with your mother; she may have insights or comfort to offer. 

User: I haven’t considered talking to my mother. I just thought it would make things more complicated. But maybe she could help me see things differently.

Consultant: It could be worth exploring, especially if she has been trying to protect you. Having a conversation may open a path for you both. Now, let's shift back to your studies—the one-hour goal. How do you plan to remind yourself to study each day?

User: Maybe I could set an alarm on my phone? It would help create a routine for me, I think. 

Consultant: That's a practical idea! Creating a routine can offer a sense of structure. How would you feel if you followed through on that reminder for the next week?

User: I think it might help me feel a bit more in control. I’ve just been feeling lost lately. 

Consultant: It’s very valid to feel that way, especially under your circumstances. As you work on your goal, try to notice any changes in your emotions or how you view your situation. I'm here to help you navigate this, and we can discuss progress in our next session. 

User: Thank you. I appreciate your support and guidance. It helps to talk about it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Ding. Remember to be gentle with yourself during this process. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time, and we can continue exploring these feelings together. 

User: I will. Thank you again. 

Consultant: Take care, and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Ding! It's nice to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially regarding the conversation you had with your parents?

User: Hi! Honestly, I've been feeling quite disappointed. It seems they don't understand my perspective at all, and I feel ignored. It's frustrating because I really thought we could communicate better.

Consultant: I hear you, and it's understandable to feel disheartened when you feel like your thoughts and feelings aren't being acknowledged. Can you share more about what specifically has been bothering you about that conversation?

User: Well, I brought up the issue of their affair, hoping we could talk about it openly. But instead, they just brushed it off and said I was overreacting. It made me feel like my concerns don’t matter to them.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, feeling like your concerns aren’t being taken seriously. Feeling dismissed can definitely shake your trust in your relationships. What do you feel this situation has done to your view of your family?

User: It’s made me feel that I can't trust them. When I think about it, it's not just about this situation; it makes me question how well they know me. I feel like I've been left out of their lives.

Consultant: It’s natural to reevaluate relationships when faced with such conflicts. You mentioned feeling left out—can we explore what this feeling means for you and how it connects to your relationship with your parents?

User: I guess it makes me feel unwanted or unimportant. I’ve always tried to be the ideal son, studying hard and making them proud. Now, it seems all of that doesn’t matter in the face of their issues.

Consultant: You’ve put a lot of effort into being a supportive son, and it’s painful when that effort seems overlooked. Let’s reflect on your personal value—what makes you feel important or valuable outside of your parents’ expectations?

User: I’ve always thought my achievements in school were a big part of my value. But now, I wonder if that’s enough. I want to be seen for who I am, not just for my grades.

Consultant: That’s a crucial insight, Ding. It’s important to recognize your intrinsic value beyond achievements. How might acknowledging your worthiness in other areas help you navigate your feelings towards your parents?

User: I guess it would remind me that I have my own identity and worth, regardless of their actions. But it’s hard; I still feel a lot of hurt.

Consultant: Feeling hurt is a valid response to your situation. It’s okay to sit with that hurt while recognizing your own identity. Would it be helpful for us to explore how you might express this to your parents in a constructive way?

User: I’d like that. The idea of talking to them again is intimidating, but I don’t want to keep everything bottled up.

Consultant: That’s a brave step! One approach could be to share how their actions have made you feel rather than just focusing on the situation itself. Can you think of a way to start that conversation?

User: Maybe I could say something like, “I felt hurt and confused when…” and then explain how their choices affect me personally. I think that might allow them to see my side better.

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! Expressing your feelings can open a door to dialogue. Let’s think about what other aspects you might want to include. How might you want them to respond?

User: I want them to acknowledge my feelings and show that they care about how I see things. It would mean a lot if they tried to understand rather than dismiss me.

Consultant: Wanting to be acknowledged is completely reasonable. Perhaps think about how you can also show understanding towards their perspective, making it a mutual conversation. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds fair. It’s just hard since I feel so hurt by them. But if I can get them to see my feelings, maybe it can help.

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s a step towards rebuilding trust. Remember, it’s about sharing feelings on both sides. Allow yourself to express your hurt while inviting them to share their thoughts too. What are your feelings about going into that conversation with this outlook?

User: I feel a bit better knowing I have a plan. But part of me is still nervous about how they’ll react.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. It’s normal to feel apprehensive in such emotional situations. If their response isn’t what you hope for, how can we prepare you to manage those feelings?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that their response doesn’t define my value. I could also talk to friends about it afterward to process my emotions.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies, Ding! Prioritizing your self-worth and reaching out for support are vital. Remember, communication is a two-way street, and you’re taking an empowered step in voicing your feelings.

User: Thank you, that helps. I feel a little more hopeful. I just hope that they can listen and understand where I’m coming from.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that you’re feeling more hopeful! It’s a process, and change takes time. Keep focusing on expressing yourself clearly, and you may be surprised at how they might respond. How do you feel about our conversation today?

User: It’s been really helpful to think things through. I appreciate the support and guidance on how to approach my parents. 

Consultant: It’s been great discussing this with you. Remember, every step you take is a part of building healthier communication. If you ever need further assistance, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you! I feel more confident about facing this now. I’ll keep you updated on how it goes.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! I look forward to hearing from you next time. Take care, and remember you're not alone in this journey.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ding! I’m glad you’re here today. I know you've been focusing on improving your communication with your parents and seeking emotional support from peers. How have things been for you recently?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really confused about how to communicate with my parents. I realize that there's a gap in our conversations, and I don't always know how to express myself. It’s been weighing on me.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a bit overwhelmed by the communication challenges with your parents. It can be tough when we feel like our voices aren't being heard. Can you share a specific situation where you felt this way recently?

User: Well, the other day I tried to talk to my mom about my studies, but it turned into a discussion about my grades instead. I felt like she wasn’t really listening to how I felt; she was just focused on the numbers.

Consultant: That must have been frustrating for you. It seems like you wanted to share your feelings, but instead, the conversation became more about expectations. What do you wish had happened instead in that conversation?

User: I really wanted her to understand my stress about studies, not just how I was performing academically. I wanted to feel supported, but I ended up feeling judged instead.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to want emotional support in those moments. Let’s explore how we can express your feelings more effectively. What do you think would help your mom to better understand your feelings about studying?

User: Maybe if I could phrase it in a way that shows her I'm not just struggling with the grades, but with the pressure and anxiety that come with it.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Framing your feelings around pressure and anxiety can invite empathy. Would you like to practice how you might start that conversation with her?

User: Yes, that would help! I think I could say something like, "I’ve been feeling really anxious about my studies, and it’s been hard for me to keep up." 

Consultant: That’s an excellent start! It directly addresses your feelings. When you share feelings like anxiety, it encourages a more open conversation. How do you think your mom might respond to that?

User: I hope she would listen and ask me more about it. But I still worry she might go back to focusing on grades.

Consultant: It’s natural to have that worry. You might consider giving her a cue to stay on the emotional aspect, like, "I really appreciate your concern about my grades, but I need to talk about how I'm feeling right now." Does that sound like something you could try?

User: Yes, that approach could really help keep the focus where I need it to be.

Consultant: Fantastic! Preparing yourself with these strategies could enhance your confidence. Now, let's also think about your peers. You mentioned looking for emotional support from them. How has that been going for you?

User: I’ve tried talking to a couple of friends about what I’m going through. It felt good to share, but sometimes I feel like they don’t fully understand either.

Consultant: Sharing can be a big step. Have you thought about communicating what you need from them in those moments—perhaps stating that you're seeking understanding over solutions?

User: I haven’t really articulated that yet, but it makes sense. I guess I’m looking for someone to just listen without trying to fix everything.

Consultant: That’s a very important distinction. You can let them know you value their presence and just want someone to hear you out when you’re feeling overwhelmed. How do you think they would respond if you shared this with them?

User: I think they might be really receptive. It would probably create a more honest vibe between us.

Consultant: That’s a positive perspective. Creating an honest environment can lead to deeper connections. As you practice these communication techniques, how do you feel about approaching these conversations with both your parents and friends?

User: Honestly, I feel a bit more hopeful. I thought my feelings weren't valid, but recognizing that I can express them makes me feel lighter.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Acknowledging your feelings is a crucial step in improving communication. As we move forward, let’s work on reinforcing these strategies. What are some steps you can take this week to continue this progress?

User: I will definitely try out those conversation ideas with my mom and friends. Maybe after that, I can reflect on how it goes and share my thoughts with you in our next session.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Reflection can help you understand what worked and what didn’t. We'll explore it more in our next session. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Ding! I'm proud of the steps you're taking. Keep being open to expressing your feelings, and remember I'm here to support you. Looking forward to hearing how it goes next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ding! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello! I've been feeling a bit more mature about my family relationships. I can now see things from different perspectives, which is a nice change. 

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like you're making progress in understanding your family dynamics. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts or feelings have contributed to this change?

User: I've started to accept my parents' behaviors more. I guess I'm becoming better at recognizing that everyone has their struggles. 

Consultant: That's a powerful realization. Accepting others' challenges can really help in building healthier relationships. Do you feel this acceptance has affected your interactions with your friends or peers?

User: Definitely! I find myself being more open in social situations. I no longer feel as pressured to maintain a certain image. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful! It sounds like you’re developing more confidence in your social life. How does this newfound openness affect your feelings during interactions? 

User: I feel more relaxed and less anxious when talking to others. It’s like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you feel lighter and more relaxed. Together, let’s explore what you might want to work on next. Are there any specific challenges or situations that you still find difficult?

User: Sometimes I still struggle with initiating conversations or joining group activities. I worry about how others might perceive me.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel some apprehension about those situations. Can you describe what thoughts come to mind when you think about starting a conversation or joining a group?

User: Well, I often think they might not be interested in what I have to say or that I’ll embarrass myself.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite limiting. Let’s challenge them a bit. What evidence do you have that supports those fears? Have you had any experiences where those thoughts turned out to be untrue?

User: Actually, when I've tried to engage with others, they’ve generally responded positively. I just forget that in the moment.

Consultant: It’s encouraging that you’ve had positive experiences! It shows that your worries may not always reflect reality. What would be a more balanced thought to replace the worries you mentioned?

User: Maybe I could think that people might actually appreciate what I have to share.

Consultant: That’s a much healthier perspective! Considering that others can appreciate your input can boost your confidence. How can you remind yourself of this new thought when you feel anxious?

User: I could write it down and read it before I go into a social situation. That might help me remember!

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Writing it down makes it more tangible and easier to recall. Are there any specific social situations coming up where you might put this strategy into practice?

User: There’s a club meeting next week that I’m considering attending. It would be a good chance to practice.

Consultant: That’s a great opportunity! When you attend, remember to use that positive thought to guide you. What activities can you engage in during the meeting to feel more comfortable?

User: I can prepare a few topics to discuss beforehand. That way, I'll feel more ready to contribute.

Consultant: Preparing topics is an excellent idea! It gives you a sense of control over the conversation. As this meeting approaches, how can you keep your focus on the positives instead of letting anxiety take over?

User: I suppose I can remind myself that everyone else is there to connect too, so I'm not alone in my feelings.

Consultant: Exactly! Remembering that others likely feel similar can help reduce pressure. Let’s take a moment to reflect on how far you’ve come. What do you feel you’ve learned about yourself through our sessions?

User: I’ve learned that I can approach my family and social relationships more openly, and that I can shift my thinking when I get anxious.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight! Recognizing your ability to shift your thoughts and approach relationships brings you closer to the goals you’ve set. How do you plan to maintain this positive mindset moving forward?

User: I think I will keep practicing those strategies we talked about. Also, I feel like being actively involved in campus life will help me stay positive.

Consultant: Engaging in campus activities is a fantastic way to reinforce those skills! As we wrap up today's session, remember the achievements you've made and the skills you've gained. 

User: Thank you! I feel like I'm in a much better place now. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You've worked hard, and I'm proud of your progress. If you ever feel the need to revisit any of these topics or need support, don't hesitate to reach out. 

User: I will! Thanks for all your help. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I wish you all the best with the club meeting and remember to utilize your new strategies. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ding! I'm glad to see you again. It seems like you've made some positive changes since our last session. How are you feeling today?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel much better now. I’ve been participating in campus activities and interacting more with my classmates. It’s great to rediscover the joy in life.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Engaging in activities and building relationships can have such a positive impact on your well-being. What specific activities have you enjoyed the most lately?

User: I've joined a study group and also participated in some events organized by the student union. I feel more connected with everyone.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really putting yourself out there and embracing new experiences. How has this newfound connection affected your feelings towards school and your studies?

User: Honestly, I feel much more motivated to study. It’s like having a support system makes the pressure less daunting.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Having a support system can really help reduce stress. Speaking of support, how do you feel about the balance between your social activities and your study schedule?

User: I think I’m managing it well. I still find time to study, but I also make sure to have fun and engage with others. It feels more fulfilling that way.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re developing a healthy balance! As we continue today, let’s explore how we can maintain and enhance this positive momentum. Do you have any specific goals in mind that you'd like to achieve in the coming weeks?

User: I want to continue being active socially, but also maybe develop some hobbies. I’ve been thinking about joining a hobby club or starting a sport.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Hobbies can be a wonderful way to meet new people and relieve stress. What hobbies are you considering?

User: I’m not entirely sure yet. Maybe something like photography or playing a team sport like basketball. I’ve always liked both.

Consultant: Both of those options sound exciting! Photography can be a great creative outlet, and team sports often help build camaraderie. How do you feel about trying out one of these activities?

User: I think I would enjoy both, but I might lean towards playing basketball because I like being active. 

Consultant: That sounds good! Engaging in a sport like basketball could also help foster teamwork and create new friendships. How would you feel about setting a goal to attend a basketball game or practice this month?

User: I would really like that! It would be a great way to meet others who enjoy the sport as much as I do.

Consultant: Absolutely! Setting that goal can help keep you motivated and build your confidence within a group. What’s the first step you could take to make that happen?

User: I could check with the student union about any upcoming basketball events or practices. 

Consultant: That’s a great plan, Ding! It’s proactive and will help you get involved. Can you share how this prospect makes you feel?

User: I’m excited! I can already imagine having fun and learning new skills.

Consultant: That's the spirit! Keeping such enthusiasm is key. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on the progress you've made. What do you think is the biggest change you've noticed in yourself recently?

User: I believe it's my confidence and willingness to engage more with others. I never thought I could feel this way just a few months ago.

Consultant: That’s a significant transformation! Recognizing your growth is essential. What strategies do you think you can use to maintain this positive outlook moving forward?

User: I think I should keep reminding myself of these achievements and stay open to new experiences, even if they feel challenging at first.

Consultant: Yes, that’s a powerful strategy. Embracing challenges and reflecting on your successes will help strengthen your resilience. As our sessions conclude, remember you have the tools to continue this journey. How do you feel about your path ahead?

User: I feel positive about it! I'm ready to face challenges and continue building towards my goals.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've worked hard, and I trust you'll keep thriving. Remember, you’re always welcome back if you ever need support. Wishing you the best in all your future endeavors, Ding! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help. I’ll definitely keep in mind how to reach out if I need to.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Ding! It's great to see you again. I'm looking forward to hearing about how you've been doing since our last session. What have you been feeling or thinking lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite positive, actually. I've been communicating regularly with my family and even getting ready for a school competition. I feel excited about my future plans.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It’s encouraging to hear that you're feeling positive and actively engaging with your family and future plans. What specific goals or hopes do you have for this competition?

User: I really hope to showcase my skills and maybe even win something. It's a chance for me to prove myself and gain some recognition, which feels important to me.

Consultant: It sounds like this competition means a lot to you, both as a personal challenge and an opportunity for recognition. How do you feel about the preparation process for the competition so far?

User: I think I've been doing well in my preparation, but sometimes I worry about not being good enough compared to my peers. 

Consultant: It's natural to have those worries, especially when you care about your performance. Can you share what specific thoughts cross your mind when you think about not being good enough?

User: I often think things like, "What if I don't perform well?" or "What if everyone else is better than me?" These thoughts make me anxious.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. Those thoughts can certainly create pressure. How do those thoughts make you feel emotionally when they arise?

User: They make me feel anxious and a bit discouraged. I sometimes question whether I should even participate.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel anxious with those kinds of thoughts, but it’s important to remember that they might not reflect reality. Can we explore together the evidence for those thoughts? For instance, have you ever performed less than well in the past?

User: No, not really. I've usually done fine in competitions before, but I just get worried about this one being more significant.

Consultant: That's great to hear that you have done well previously. It seems like past experiences could serve as a good foundation. If a friend expressed similar concerns about their performance, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on their preparation and not be too hard on themselves.

Consultant: That’s wise advice! So, can we consider applying that same mindset to yourself? What if you focused on the effort you're putting into preparation rather than just the outcome?

User: That makes sense. I guess it would relieve some pressure if I concentrate on doing my best rather than worrying about being the best.

Consultant: Exactly! Your effort is what you can control. How can we incorporate that mindset into your preparation for the competition?

User: Maybe I can set small daily goals to focus on what I need to improve instead of thinking about the competition as a whole.

Consultant: That's a fantastic strategy! Setting daily goals could help you see progress and reduce feelings of overwhelm. How do you feel about creating a routine for this preparation process?

User: I feel good about that! I think having a routine could help me stay focused and less anxious.

Consultant: That sounds promising. Let’s think about what specific small goals you can set for your preparation. What would be a good starting point for you?

User: I could start by dedicating specific hours each day to practice the skills I need for the competition. It sounds manageable.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Dedicating specific hours will help create structure. How can you make sure to stay motivated throughout this preparation?

User: I think I could reward myself after reaching each small goal. That would help me stay positive and motivated.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Rewards can be excellent motivators. How do you feel now about your upcoming competition and how you will prepare for it?

User: I feel much more optimistic now. I think I have a good plan in place and I won’t just focus on the outcome anymore.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! This mindset can help you approach challenges with more confidence. Remember, it’s all about your effort and growth. How can you apply what you've learned today moving forward?

User: I’ll keep reminding myself that it’s about my effort and not just the result. I think I can also try to talk about my feelings with friends to keep anxiety at bay.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Sharing your feelings can definitely help ease anxiety, and trying to maintain that positive focus will assist you greatly. As our session comes to an end, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway today?

User: My biggest takeaway is that I can control how I prepare and that the outcome doesn’t define my worth. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! I'm confident you'll do great with this mindset. If you ever need to revisit these ideas or continue our work, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care until we meet again!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today. I'm looking forward to applying everything we talked about.
