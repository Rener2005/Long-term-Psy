Consultant: Hello, Yang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling pretty low, to be honest. Adapting back to school has been really difficult for me, and I’m still struggling a lot after my breakup. It’s just overwhelming. 

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of emotions right now. Can you tell me more about how your feelings have been impacting your daily life?

User: Well, I find it hard to get out of bed sometimes. I just feel hopeless and unmotivated. I also have thoughts about self-harm, which scares me. 

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way, Yang. It's crucial to talk about these feelings. Let’s work together to identify what triggers these thoughts. Can you think of specific situations or moments when these feelings become stronger?

User: Usually, it gets worse at night when I'm alone, or when I'm reminded of my breakup. I just feel so isolated and sad.

Consultant: It makes sense that loneliness and reminders of the breakup would intensify those feelings. When you have these thoughts at night, what kind of things run through your mind? 

User: I often think that I'm not good enough, and that things will never get better. It’s like a cycle of despair.

Consultant: That sounds really tough to deal with, and it’s understandable to feel trapped like that. I want us to explore those thoughts further. When you think that you're not good enough, can you trace back what evidence supports this belief? 

User: I guess my mind just jumps to all the mistakes I've made, especially around my pregnancy and the breakup. I feel like I’ve failed.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re being really hard on yourself. We all make mistakes, and it doesn't define your worth as a person. If a friend came to you with the same feeling, what would you tell them? 

User: I would probably tell them it's okay to mess up and that they shouldn't be so hard on themselves. 

Consultant: Exactly! You can extend that same compassion to yourself. Let’s also explore some alternative thoughts that can challenge the belief of being a failure. What could be a more balanced way to view your experiences?

User: Maybe I could say that I've learned from my mistakes, and they don’t define who I am completely. 

Consultant: That’s a great shift in perspective! Recognizing your growth through difficulties is powerful. Now, let’s talk about how you can manage these feelings when they come up. Have you thought about any coping strategies that might help you?

User: I haven’t really thought about it. I mostly just kind of sit with my feelings, which isn’t helpful. 

Consultant: It’s common to feel overwhelmed. Some strategies might include grounding techniques, like focusing on your breathing or engaging in a simple activity. Would you be open to trying one of these techniques together?

User: Sure, I’d like to try.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment to practice a simple breathing exercise. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable and take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a moment, and then slowly release it through your mouth. Let's do this a few times together.

User: Okay... (takes a deep breath)

Consultant: How did that feel for you, Yang? 

User: It felt a bit calming, honestly. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It's important to find moments of calm. Practicing this regularly can give you a tool to manage overwhelming feelings. As we continue our sessions, let’s focus on developing these skills further. How does that sound to you?

User: Yes, that sounds good. I need more tools to cope.

Consultant: Absolutely. It's a process, and I'm here to help you through it step by step. Now, apart from these feelings, what other aspects of your life would you like us to focus on? 

User: I guess I want to improve how I interact with people at school. I feel so shy and withdrawn.

Consultant: That’s a great area to work on. Building social skills can boost your confidence and help you feel more connected. Let’s explore some specific situations where you feel shy. Can you describe one?

User: Sometimes in class, when we have group discussions, I just freeze. I don’t know what to say or how to contribute.

Consultant: That’s a common experience, and it’s okay to feel that way. We can practice some strategies for contributing to group discussions. Would you be open to role-playing a group discussion scenario with me?

User: Sure! I’d like to try.

Consultant: Perfect! I’ll pose a question, and you can respond as if we're in a class. Remember, there are no wrong answers here. What’s a topic you’re interested in? 

User: I like art.

Consultant: Great! Let’s say the class topic is "What role does art play in society?" How would you start responding to that?

User: Um... I think art is important because it expresses feelings?

Consultant: That was a great start! You made a valid point. What if you expanded on that by sharing a personal experience or an example? 

User: Okay... well, I remember a painting I saw that really made me think about my emotions during tough times.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic way to connect your thoughts with personal experience. Sharing your perspective and emotions can make your input more impactful. How do you feel about trying this in class?

User: I suppose it’s less scary when I think about it that way! 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s all about practice and shifting the way you view the situation. Remember, it’s a gradual process. Let’s keep working on it together, and I know you can make progress.

User: Thank you, I feel a bit better about trying now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, let's summarize what we've discussed. You’ve identified your feelings of hopelessness and the negative beliefs surrounding them. We also practiced a few coping strategies and talked about improving your social interactions. 

User: Yes, that sounds right.

Consultant: Moving forward, remember to practice the breathing techniques we discussed, and consider using your voice in class as a way to connect with your peers. You’re capable of this, Yang. 

User: Thank you. I'll keep that in mind.

Consultant: You’re welcome! Remember, it’s okay to have ups and downs. I’m proud of the steps you’re taking, and if you ever need to talk, I’m here for you. 

User: Thanks, I appreciate it.

Consultant: Today’s session is our last for now. Reflect on what we've worked on, and continue using the strategies you've learned. I believe in your ability to navigate your feelings and relationships. If you need anything in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: I will. Thank you so much!

Consultant: Take care, Yang! You've got this!

Consultant: Hello, Yang! I'm really glad you could join me today. I understand that you’re looking to improve your social skills and confidence in your interactions with peers. How have you been feeling about that lately?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling quite anxious, to be honest. Whenever I try to talk to my friends, it just feels awkward. I struggle to express myself, and it makes me feel even more isolated.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Yang. It’s understandable to feel anxious in social situations, especially when it feels awkward. Can you tell me about a recent conversation where you felt this way? What thoughts were going through your mind at that moment?

User: Well, just the other day, I tried to join a group discussion, but I ended up saying very little. I kept thinking that my contributions wouldn't be valued, so I just stayed quiet. It felt horrible afterwards.

Consultant: It seems like you felt that your thoughts of not being valued kept you from participating. That kind of thinking can really affect your confidence. What emotions did you experience during and after that situation?

User: I felt really embarrassed and sad. I think it made me feel like I’m not good enough to be part of the group. I also worried that they didn't want me around.

Consultant: Those feelings of embarrassment and sadness are important to acknowledge. It's tough when you believe that you don’t fit in. Let's take a moment to challenge some of those thoughts. Do you think there’s any evidence that supports the idea that your contributions aren't valued?

User: I guess I don’t really know for sure. I mean, there are some times when friends seem to appreciate my input, but I tend to focus on the negative moments.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Yang. It sounds like you might be focusing on the negative experiences more than the positive ones. What if you were to think about a time when your input was appreciated? How might that change your perspective?

User: I can remember a time when my friend thanked me for my support during a tough situation. It felt nice, but I usually forget moments like that when I'm anxious.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to reflect on! Remembering those positive experiences can help challenge those negative thoughts. How might you remind yourself of that moment when you start feeling anxious about social interactions?

User: Maybe I could write it down or think about it before I go into a social situation. It might help me feel more confident.

Consultant: That’s a good strategy! Keeping reminders can really help. Now, let’s talk about some practical steps. What is one small action you could take in your next interaction with friends to encourage yourself to speak up?

User: I could set a goal to say at least one thing during our next conversation, even if it's just a comment. That seems manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan, Yang! Setting a small goal is an excellent way to build confidence. How do you feel about practicing that in our session today? 

User: I feel a bit nervous but also willing to try. Practicing might make it easier.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s role-play a casual conversation. I’ll play a friend of yours. Ready? 

User: Okay, I’ll try my best!

Consultant: Great! Hi Yang! I was wondering what your plans are for the weekend? 

User: Umm... I was thinking about just relaxing and maybe catching up on some reading. 

Consultant: That sounds nice! What book are you reading?

User: I'm reading a fantasy novel. It's really exciting. 

Consultant: That’s awesome! What do you love most about it? 

User: I like the characters and the world-building. It feels like an escape from reality.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! How did that feel for you? 

User: It was a bit easier than I expected. I felt more at ease when I focused on something I enjoy.

Consultant: Definitely! Focusing on something you’re passionate about can make conversations flow better. How about we think of another scenario where you can use this technique?

User: Sure! Maybe when I see my friends in class, I can ask them about what they liked in the last lesson.

Consultant: That’s brilliant, Yang! As we wrap up today, what do you feel you’ve gained from our session?

User: I think I’ve learned to challenge my negative thoughts and practice speaking up. I feel a little more hopeful.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a journey, and every small step counts. How will you apply what you’ve learned in the next week?

User: I’ll try to remind myself of positive experiences and practice speaking up in my classes. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I'm proud of the progress you’ve made today. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out. You’re not alone in this.

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Yang. Keep believing in yourself, and I look forward to hearing how it goes next time! Take care!

Consultant: Hello! I’m really glad you’re here for our session today. I understand you’ve been feeling quite anxious about your studies and future. Let’s start by discussing how you’ve been feeling lately.

User: Hi. Yes, I've been feeling really overwhelmed with my studies. It’s tough to focus, and I keep worrying about what I’ll do after finishing school. 

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when there’s so much pressure. Can you share more about what specifically is causing you anxiety about your studies and future?

User: Well, I’m worried I won’t do well in my courses, and that’ll hold me back from finding a good job. What if I make the wrong choices about my future?

Consultant: Those worries sound quite heavy. It seems like there’s a lot of fear around your academic performance and decision-making. What thoughts go through your mind when you think about not doing well or making the wrong choices?

User: I keep thinking that if I fail, I’ll disappoint everyone, especially my grandparents who raised me. That just makes me feel worse, and I struggle to study even more.

Consultant: It’s clear that you feel a strong sense of responsibility towards your grandparents. Let’s explore those thoughts together. When you say you would disappoint them, what evidence do you have that supports that idea?

User: I just feel like I’ve already let them down by getting pregnant and dropping out before. If I mess up again, I can’t bear the thought of facing them.

Consultant: I can see how that past experience weighs heavily on you. But tell me, have your grandparents expressed disappointment in you, or do they understand your situation?

User: They’ve always been supportive, but I’m just scared they’ll see my struggles as a failure. 

Consultant: It’s normal to have fears, but it’s also important to recognize that struggles don't define you or your worth. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about facing challenges?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes, and they shouldn’t be so hard on themselves.

Consultant: Exactly! You show kindness and understanding to others, so why not extend that to yourself? Let's work together to change that negative thought pattern. How would you feel about making a list of the things you’ve accomplished so far, big or small?

User: That could help! I often focus on the negatives and forget the good things I've done.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset to have. Remembering your strengths can help build your confidence. What’s one positive thing you’ve achieved recently in your studies?

User: I managed to pass one of my exams last month, even when I felt really down about everything.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic accomplishment! Passing an exam shows your capability and potential despite the challenges you've faced. How can we use that feeling of achievement to motivate you moving forward?

User: Maybe I could set small goals instead of looking at everything as one big thing? 

Consultant: Absolutely! Setting small, achievable goals can make things feel less overwhelming and more manageable. What would be a small goal you could work towards this week?

User: I think I could focus on studying for just a couple of hours each day without distraction. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! How do you think you will feel after achieving that goal?

User: I think it would give me a little boost of confidence and maybe help me feel more in control.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Feeling in control can significantly reduce anxiety. Let’s also talk about balancing studies with social activities. Are there any social activities you enjoy that could help alleviate some stress?

User: I used to enjoy hanging out with friends, but I haven’t done that in a while because of my studies.

Consultant: It sounds like reconnecting with friends could be really beneficial for you. How about we brainstorm ways to gradually reintroduce social activities into your routine while managing your study commitments?

User: That sounds good! Maybe I could set aside a specific day each week to hang out with friends.

Consultant: Excellent idea! You’d be combining fun with responsibility. How do you think your friends would react to making plans with you again?

User: I think they’d be really happy! They’ve missed me too, and it would be nice to catch up.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear. Building those connections can really enhance your sense of support and well-being. As we wrap up, what are your thoughts on today’s session? 

User: I feel lighter, like I have a plan to work on. Focusing on small goals and reconnecting with friends sounds like a good way to relieve stress.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’re taking positive steps, and I believe these strategies will help you manage your anxiety. If you feel up to it, we could discuss more about staying connected socially in our next session. 

User: Yes, I’d like that. Thank you for your help today!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, you have the strength to navigate through this. I'll be here to support you. Have a great week ahead, and I look forward to hearing about your progress!
###################
Consultant: Hello Yang! I’m really glad to see you back for our session. Last time we spoke, you mentioned wanting to expand your social circle and your positive experiences from participating in extracurricular activities. How have you been feeling about those interactions lately?

User: Hi! I felt quite excited about joining those activities. I started to connect better with my classmates, and it's nice to receive some positive reactions from them. But I still sometimes feel anxious in large groups.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re connecting with your classmates and that the positive feedback has been uplifting! Feeling anxious in large groups is quite common, especially when you’re venturing into new social situations. Can you share what thoughts or feelings come up for you when you’re in those larger gatherings?

User: Well, I worry that I might say something awkward or that people won’t like me. Sometimes I feel like I’m just trying too hard to fit in.

Consultant: Those thoughts of trying hard to fit in and fearing judgment are understandable. It sounds like they might be causing some pressure in those social settings. Let’s explore this a little more—what specific thoughts do you notice when you feel anxious in a group?

User: I usually think, "What if they don't think I'm interesting?" or "What if I embarrass myself?" 

Consultant: Those thoughts can definitely add to your anxiety. It’s important to recognize that these thoughts might not accurately reflect reality. Can we look at how likely it is that those fears will come true? What evidence do you have that supports these thoughts, and what might suggest otherwise?

User: I guess when I think about it, most of the time, people have been friendly and engaging with me. Still, I can't shake off the worry sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a really insightful observation! The friendliness of your classmates suggests that your fears may not be as significant as they feel. It’s good to challenge those automatic thoughts. What would you say to a friend who felt the way you do in social situations?

User: I would probably tell them to relax and just be themselves because most people are not judging them that harshly.

Consultant: Exactly! You have the ability to offer reassurance to someone else, so why not give yourself the same kindness? Let’s try to create a more supportive thought for yourself to use when you feel anxious. How about something like, “I am interesting, and others appreciate me for who I am”?

User: That sounds nice. I can try repeating that to myself. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! It’s about practicing those supportive thoughts until they feel more natural. Now, since you’re already experiencing some improvement in social interactions, let’s think about how we can build on that. What new experiences can you pursue that would help you feel even more connected?

User: I think I’d like to join another club or activity where I can meet different people. Maybe something related to music since I enjoy it.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Engaging in a club related to your interests, like music, can be a fantastic way to connect with others who share your passions. Plus, it allows for more natural conversation starters. How about setting a goal to attend a few sessions of that music club?

User: Yes, I will look into clubs and try to attend a couple of sessions. I think it will be fun.

Consultant: That sounds exciting! It’s also a way to reinforce your social skills in a more comfortable and enjoyable context. As you take these steps, remember to be gentle with yourself. What emotions are you experiencing as we talk about expanding your social activities?

User: I’m feeling more hopeful and less anxious thinking about joining something new. I’m actually looking forward to it!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Yang! Feeling hopeful about new experiences is a significant step forward. Now, let’s talk about how you can manage any anxiety if it arises when you first join this club. What techniques do you think could help soothe your nerves?

User: Maybe I can listen to some calming music before going in or practice deep breathing to relax.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Listening to calming music and deep breathing can be really effective in managing anxiety. Is there a particular song or type of music that you find especially calming?

User: I love listening to instrumental music, especially piano pieces; they really help me calm down.

Consultant: Instrumental piano music is a lovely choice for relaxation! Maybe you can create a playlist specifically for those moments before you engage in social activities. How are you feeling about trying these techniques in new situations?

User: I feel ready to give it a shot. I think having a plan will make me feel more in control.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! Having a plan can significantly reduce anxiety. As we start to wrap up today’s session, can you reflect on what you feel you’ve gained from our time together?

User: I realize that my thoughts can be challenged and that I can be kinder to myself. I also have some practical steps to take, and that makes me feel empowered.

Consultant: It’s great to see you recognizing your power to manage your thoughts and feelings! As you move forward, remember these strategies and the importance of self-kindness. Is there anything specific you would like to remember or work on before our next session?

User: I want to focus on practicing my new supportive thoughts and making that music club a part of my routine.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! We can build on this progress next time as well. I’m really proud of the steps you’re taking. Remember, it’s okay to feel a range of emotions as you navigate these experiences. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Yang! It’s been a pleasure discussing your journey with you today. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care, and enjoy the music!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I think I’ve been feeling a bit better. I’ve been trying to use what we discussed about music therapy, and it’s been nice to see some positive changes. However, I still have a lot on my mind.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear that you’re noticing positive changes! Could you share more about how you’ve been using music therapy and what those changes look like for you?

User: I’ve been listening to different kinds of music when I feel overwhelmed. I notice that some songs make me feel really relaxed, while others lift my mood. But sometimes it’s hard to find the right music to fit my emotions.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experimenting with music and noticing its effects on your feelings, which is a great approach! When you find a song that resonates with you, how does it make you feel?

User: When I find the right song, I feel lighter and more at ease. It’s like my worries fade away for a moment. But then there are times when I still feel stuck, especially when I think about my past experiences.

Consultant: Those moments of feeling stuck can be challenging. It’s completely normal to have lingering thoughts about previous experiences. Would you like to explore what specific thoughts or memories come to mind when you feel stuck?

User: I often think about the complications I faced last year. The pregnancy and everything that followed was really stressful, and sometimes I feel like I haven’t fully moved on from it.

Consultant: I can see how those experiences would weigh on you. It’s understandable to still carry those feelings. When you think about that time, what specific thoughts do you have that make you feel overwhelmed?

User: I often think, “What if I never recover from this?” or “I messed up my life.” Those thoughts just seem to loop in my mind and add to my anxiety.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very heavy and discouraging. It might be helpful to take a closer look at them together. How much evidence do you think you have to support those beliefs? Are there other perspectives worth considering?

User: I guess I don’t have a lot of solid evidence. I mean, I've returned to school and I’m trying to move forward, but it just feels like I can’t shake off the past completely.

Consultant: It’s a positive sign that you’re back in school and trying to move forward. Reflecting on your current achievements can help balance the negative thoughts. If a friend were in your situation, what might you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to feel that way, but to focus on the positives and look ahead. I just wish I could take my own advice.

Consultant: It’s common to give advice to others that we have trouble applying to ourselves. Let’s practice this together. What are some positive steps you’ve taken recently that you can remind yourself of?

User: I’ve started attending my classes regularly and I’ve also been involved in a few group activities. That feels good, but I still get nervous sometimes.

Consultant: Engaging in classes and group activities is a significant achievement! It’s normal to feel nervous, especially when putting yourself out there. Would you like to develop some strategies to manage that anxiety when it arises?

User: That would be helpful. I usually just end up avoiding situations that make me anxious, but I know that’s not the best solution.

Consultant: Avoidance can provide temporary relief but often makes anxiety worse in the long run. Let’s try to think of small steps to face those situations gradually. What’s an upcoming event or situation that makes you feel nervous?

User: There’s a group project coming up next week, and I’m worried about speaking in front of everyone. 

Consultant: Group projects can be intimidating. How about we break it down? What’s one small, manageable action you could take to prepare for this project that might help ease your anxiety?

User: I guess I could prepare my part in advance and maybe practice sharing it with a friend first.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Practicing with a friend can boost your confidence. How might you feel after completing that practice session?

User: It might make me feel more prepared and less anxious about the actual presentation.

Consultant: Exactly! Preparation often leads to a sense of control. After you practice, could you also remind yourself of the positives, like your recent successes in classes and activities? 

User: Yes, I can do that! I want to keep reminding myself that I am making progress.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset to nurture. As you continue to embrace music therapy and practice these strategies, reflect on how these efforts can reinforce healing and growth in your life. How does that feel to you?

User: It feels hopeful. I really want to believe that I can move past the anxiety. I think the music helps a lot, too.

Consultant: Music can be a powerful ally in your emotional journey. As we move forward, let’s focus on utilizing it and your newfound techniques to build a more confident approach to various challenges. Would you be open to setting small goals each week related to music or speaking in front of others?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I think it would help keep me focused on moving forward instead of getting stuck in those negative thoughts.

Consultant: That’s a great attitude! Let’s outline some goals together that you can gradually work toward, ensuring they feel realistic and achievable. What’s one goal that you might want to set for this week?

User: I’d like to aim to practice speaking out loud about my project two times before the group meeting.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic goal! Practicing will definitely help build your confidence. I believe in your ability to accomplish this. Remember to be gentle with yourself during this process. 

User: Thanks! I appreciate your support. It feels good to be working on this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, let’s take a moment to reflect on your progress. What do you feel has been your biggest takeaway from our sessions so far?

User: I’ve learned that I can approach my anxiety in new ways, and that music really can help me manage my emotions.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve made significant strides in understanding yourself and your emotions. Keep embracing those tools, and remember you have the strength to face your challenges. 

User: I will! Thank you so much for your help today. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Yang! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Remember, you can always come back if you need support. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yang! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing okay, I think. The anxiety has lessened quite a bit. I can focus more on my studies, and I'm starting to feel better about socializing with my classmates.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some significant progress. Can you share more about what changes you've noticed in your feelings and interactions with others?

User: Well, I used to feel really anxious when I had to talk to my classmates or give presentations. Now, I still feel a bit nervous, but I can handle it better. I even joined a study group, which is something I wouldn't have done before.

Consultant: Joining a study group is a big step! It's great that you're finding ways to engage with your classmates. How did you feel when you made that decision to join?

User: Honestly, I was scared at first, but I wanted to push myself. Once I was there, I felt more comfortable than I expected. The group was really supportive.

Consultant: It's fantastic that the group provided a supportive environment for you. What do you think helped you feel more comfortable during the group study sessions?

User: I think just being surrounded by friends and seeing that they were also struggling with similar subjects made me feel less alone. Plus, when we worked together, it felt motivating.

Consultant: That sense of camaraderie can be very motivating! It seems like you've found a way to connect with others that works for you. How have your emotions been during your studies and social activities recently?

User: They've been more stable. I still have moments of doubt or stress, especially when exams approach, but I don't feel overwhelmed like I used to. I feel more equipped to handle it.

Consultant: That's a significant improvement! Recognizing that you can manage your stress is a crucial step. When you do start to feel those moments of doubt, what strategies have you been using to cope?

User: I've been practicing some breathing exercises to calm myself down, and I've started making to-do lists to organize my study materials. It helps me feel in control.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Breathing exercises can be very effective for managing anxiety. It's great to hear that you're taking control of your studies with to-do lists. How does doing this influence your overall feelings towards your academic work?

User: It helps a lot! When I see everything laid out, I feel less chaotic in my mind. It's satisfying to check things off my list, and I feel more productive.

Consultant: That sense of accomplishment can be so uplifting. As you're navigating through your studies and social interactions, are there any challenges that you feel might still hold you back?

User: Sometimes, I still hesitate to reach out for help or ask questions in class because I worry about how others will perceive me. Those thoughts creep back in occasionally.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to have those lingering thoughts. Let's explore them a bit—what evidence do you have that supports the worry about how others perceive you?

User: I don’t have strong evidence, just an old habit of overthinking things. I often just assume they might judge me for asking questions.

Consultant: It sounds like you're caught in a cycle of unhelpful thinking. What if you considered that most people understand how challenging it can be to ask questions? How would you feel about framing it that way?

User: I guess that makes sense. I wouldn't judge someone for asking a question. It might actually show that they're engaged and interested.

Consultant: Exactly! By reframing your thoughts, you could make it easier to reach out for the help you need. Let's practice that together—if a classmate were in your position, what would you advise them?
