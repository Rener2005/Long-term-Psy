Consultant: Hello, Zhao Rou! I'm really glad to see you today. I know you've been facing some challenges lately. Can you share more about how you've been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really down after those exam results. I keep thinking that I'm not smart enough and that I'll never be able to achieve anything. It's like I'm stuck in a loop of self-doubt.

Consultant: That sounds very difficult for you, feeling stuck and questioning your worth. It’s understandable to feel this way after disappointing results. What have these thoughts made you feel about yourself or your abilities?

User: I just feel worthless, like I don't deserve to be proud of anything I do. It's frustrating because I really want to do well and be seen as capable.

Consultant: I hear you, and it’s understandable to want to be recognized for your efforts. Let’s explore that a bit more. When you think about your worth, what specific thoughts come to mind that make you feel this way?

User: I think about how I didn’t do well on the exam, and then I remember times in the past when I’ve failed. It just reinforces this belief that I’m not good enough.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a painful pattern of recalling past failures that feeds your current feelings of inadequacy. Have you considered how these thoughts might be affecting your overall perspective on yourself?

User: I think it makes everything harder. I avoid trying new things because I’m scared of failing again. I just want to feel better about myself.

Consultant: That makes sense. Avoiding situations where you might fail could provide temporary relief, but it seems like it’s also limiting your opportunities for growth. What would it look like for you to feel more confident and open to new experiences?

User: I guess I would try more things without worrying so much about the outcome. I want to feel like I can handle whatever happens.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! We can definitely work towards that. Let's identify these negative thoughts you have when facing challenges. What automatic thoughts come to your mind when you think about trying something new?

User: I often think, “What if I fail? Everyone will see how bad I am.” It’s really discouraging.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite harsh. Have you thought about how you could challenge or reframe them? For example, what evidence do you have that failing means you are bad or unworthy?

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence, it just feels true. But maybe I should really think about it more.

Consultant: That’s a good start! Begin to look for evidence that contradicts those thoughts. When you focus on your efforts and progress instead of just outcomes, how does that change your view of your worth?

User: I suppose if I think about my effort, I can recognize that I'm trying, which is worth something. That feels a bit more hopeful.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on your effort is a significant step toward acknowledging your value. Are there specific achievements, no matter how small, that you can remind yourself of?

User: I did manage to improve my grades in some subjects last semester. I felt proud of that, even if it’s not perfect.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Celebrating those improvements is crucial. How about setting some goals that allow you to build on those achievements? What’s a small step you could take next week?

User: Maybe I could join a study group. It’s a bit scary, but it might help me not feel so alone.

Consultant: Joining a study group sounds like an excellent idea! It's a way to connect with others and share your knowledge. What do you think are the potential benefits of engaging with peers like that?

User: I could get help when I’m struggling and maybe feel more supported. Plus, it might make studying less lonely.

Consultant: Those are wonderful benefits! It sounds like this could help not only with your studies but also with your feelings of self-worth. How do you think you’ll feel if you take that step?

User: I think it could help me feel more connected and less self-critical. It’s a bit nerve-wracking, but I want to try.

Consultant: It’s completely okay to feel nervous! Change takes time and courage. Remember to be kind to yourself through this process. What coping strategies could you use to ease your anxiety about joining the group?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to be nervous and that I’m still trying something new. I could also think about the positives of being in the group.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Keeping a positive focus while acknowledging your feelings will help you navigate this transition. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about your progress and the steps you plan to take?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I think I can do this, and I want to keep working on my confidence. 

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Zhao Rou. You’re making meaningful progress. Remember to practice self-compassion along the way. Let’s continue to build on this in our next session. You can do this!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I'm looking forward to our next session already.

Consultant: Hello, Zhao Rou! I'm glad to see you again. I've heard that you've participated in a cultural activity recently. How did that go for you?

User: Hi! Yes, I did participate. At first, I was really nervous, but overall it was a good experience. I felt a little accomplished when my teachers and classmates appreciated my efforts.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you were able to overcome your initial nervousness and receive some positive feedback. How did that recognition affect your feelings about yourself?

User: It made me feel a bit better, but I still find myself doubting if I did well or if they were just being nice. I want to feel more confident with social interactions.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those doubts, especially when you're working on building your confidence. Let's discuss what specific thoughts or worries cross your mind in those social situations. Can you tell me about a moment during the activity where you felt anxious?

User: Well, when I spoke in front of everyone, I was really scared that I would mess up. I kept thinking, "What if I embarrass myself?"

Consultant: That fear of embarrassment is common, but it sounds like it’s holding you back from enjoying these moments fully. Can you identify how that thought made you feel at that moment?

User: It made me feel really anxious and like I wanted to run away. I thought everyone would judge me harshly if I tripped over my words.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Let's explore that thought, "What if I embarrass myself?" What evidence do you have that supports that fear? Can you think of any moments that might contradict that thought?

User: Actually, I remember during the event, even when I stumbled a bit, people just smiled and encouraged me. I guess they weren't judging me as harshly as I thought.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! You had a positive experience even when things weren't perfect. Could it help to remind yourself of that encouraging feedback the next time you’re in a similar situation?

User: Yes, I think it could help. I just need to learn to trust that people are more supportive than I assume.

Consultant: Exactly! Trusting in that support can lessen your anxiety significantly. What do you think would be a small step you could take to practice this trust in your next social interaction?

User: Maybe I could try speaking up more in class and remind myself that the feedback will likely be positive, just like last time.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! By intentionally replacing negative thoughts with positive reminders, you'll start building a more confident self-image. Can we also talk about how to handle any criticism you might receive, too?

User: Sure. I often get defensive or just think that I'm not good enough when I face criticism, and then I feel even worse.

Consultant: It’s common to feel defensive, especially if you're sensitive to others' opinions. Would you be open to a practice we can do to help you respond more calmly to criticism when it arises?

User: Yes, what kind of practice?

Consultant: We can role-play a scenario where you receive constructive feedback. I'll give you some feedback, and I’d like you to practice responding in a way that allows you to remain open and connected. How does that sound?

User: That sounds okay. I think it could be useful to know how to respond better.

Consultant: Great! Let’s say I’m your teacher and I say, “I think you did well on your presentation, but you could slow down a bit next time.” What would a supportive response look like?

User: I could say, “Thank you for the feedback! I'll try to speak more slowly next time.”

Consultant: Exactly! That shows you are open to improvement while still acknowledging your strengths. How did it feel to practice that response?

User: It felt kind of empowering, actually. I didn’t feel like I was sinking into negativity.

Consultant: That’s the right direction! Embracing a mindset focused on growth can help you navigate social situations with more confidence. Are there other specific interactions you’re worried about that we could work through together?

User: I guess anytime there’s a group discussion or when I need to voice my opinion. I keep thinking nobody will agree with me.

Consultant: That’s a common concern. Let's explore those thoughts further. When you think, "Nobody will agree with me," how does that affect your willingness to participate?

User: It makes me quiet and hesitant to share my ideas.

Consultant: What if we challenged that thought? What evidence do you have that people might agree with you or appreciate your contributions?

User: Well, in a few discussions, I noticed that some classmates seemed to nod when I talked, but I just focused on what could go wrong.

Consultant: It’s great that you noticed that positive feedback! Next time, try to focus on those supportive nods. Would it help to create a mental list of your ideas before speaking, to reinforce your confidence?

User: Yes, I think that could help me feel more prepared and less nervous.

Consultant: Absolutely! Being prepared can ease anxiety significantly. As we approach the end of our session, let’s summarize what you’ve learned today. What strategies do you feel are the most beneficial?

User: I think reminding myself of positive feedback, practicing supportive responses to criticism, and preparing my ideas are all really useful tools.

Consultant: Perfect! You’ve made great progress in recognizing those helpful strategies. It’s important to carry these skills with you. Remember, it’s a process, and practice will help solidify these changes. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel a lot calmer and more hopeful about handling social situations. I really appreciate this conversation.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You've done great work today. If you need anything else or want to revisit any of these strategies, feel free to reach out anytime. Remember, change takes time, but you’re on the right path. 

User: Thank you! I will keep practicing these tips. See you next time!

Consultant: You're welcome, Zhao Rou! I'm looking forward to our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao Rou! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, but after that misunderstanding with my classmates, I can't help but feel isolated again. It just brought back all those negative feelings.

Consultant: I understand, it can be really tough to experience a misunderstanding like that, especially after working on your communication skills. Can you tell me more about what happened and how it made you feel?

User: Well, during a group project, a few classmates assumed I wasn't contributing enough, and it really hurt. I felt like they misjudged me, and I ended up internalizing it, thinking maybe I really am not good enough.

Consultant: That sounds deeply frustrating, Zhao Rou. It seems like their assumptions triggered your feelings of self-doubt. Can you share what specific thoughts crossed your mind in that moment?

User: I thought, "They think I'm useless. Maybe I really am." I just felt really sad and started to blame myself. 

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, but let's take a closer look at those thoughts. How much evidence do you think supports the idea that you're useless? 

User: I guess there's no real evidence. I have done my part, but their actions made me question everything about myself.

Consultant: That's a significant insight, Zhao Rou. It seems like their actions led to some negative thinking patterns. Have you noticed if you tend to see these situations in black-and-white terms?

User: Yes, sometimes I do think that way. If I'm not perfect, then I must be a failure.

Consultant: That perception can be really limiting. What if we tried to reframe that thought? Instead of seeing it as being perfect or a failure, what if you viewed it as a process where improvement is possible?

User: I suppose seeing it that way would help, but it's hard to change how I feel in the moment.

Consultant: Absolutely, it can be challenging to shift perspectives, especially when emotions are strong. It might help to acknowledge your feelings but also remind yourself of your strengths. Can you think of a time when your contributions were valued?

User: Yes, in my art class, my teacher praised my project. That made me feel good.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful example! Remembering instances like that can help combat those negative thoughts. How can we incorporate that positive experience into your daily mindset?

User: Maybe I could write down those positive moments to reflect on when I feel down.

Consultant: That sounds like a great strategy! Keeping a gratitude or achievements journal can help reinforce your positive contributions. How about integrating this practice into our next session?

User: That would be helpful! I think it would remind me that I do contribute and have value.

Consultant: Perfect. It’s all about building a more balanced perspective. Now, let’s discuss some effective communication skills you can use to express your feelings next time there’s a misunderstanding. 

User: I’d like that! I want to feel more confident voicing my thoughts.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal. One technique you might find helpful is the "I feel" statements. For example, you can say, "I feel hurt when it seems like my contributions are overlooked." How does that sound to you?

User: I think that’s a good way to start. It feels less confrontational.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s a way to express your feelings without placing blame. Let’s practice this. How would you approach your classmates if you felt misunderstood again?

User: I would say something like, "I felt left out in our project discussions, and it made me think I wasn’t contributing enough."

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! It clearly communicates your feelings while inviting them to understand your perspective. What do you think your classmates might respond with?

User: I think they might be surprised but hopefully open to talking about it. 

Consultant: Yes, creating a space for discussion can often lead to resolution. How does that make you feel about approaching them in the future?

User: I feel more empowered to talk now. It feels okay to express my feelings.

Consultant: That's great to hear, Zhao Rou! As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on your progress. What do you think you’ve learned about handling misunderstandings?

User: I’ve learned that I can express my feelings better and that it's okay to question negative thoughts. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing your strengths and being able to communicate effectively are significant steps. How can you continue to build on this in your daily life?

User: I plan to keep practicing "I feel" statements and write down positive moments. 

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Remember, it’s all about acknowledging your contributions and maintaining open communication. Our time together has been significant, and you’ve made wonderful progress. 

User: Thank you! I feel like I can move forward with more confidence.

Consultant: I’m really proud of you, Zhao Rou. Keep up the great work! If challenges arise, remember you have tools to navigate them. We’ll check in on your progress next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao Rou! It's good to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling a mix of happiness and anxiety. I recently participated in a volunteer activity, and helping others felt really rewarding. But I can’t shake off the feeling that I didn't do enough.

Consultant: It sounds like you had a positive experience volunteering, which is wonderful! It's understandable to have some self-doubts when you care so much about doing well. Can you share more about what made you feel like you didn’t do enough?

User: Well, I saw some other volunteers who seemed to be much more capable and confident. I felt like I was just in the way, and that made me question if I was actually helping.

Consultant: I can see how that could lead to those feelings of inadequacy. It's common to compare ourselves to others, especially in helpful roles. What do you think made you feel that way about your contributions?

User: I think it's because I have this internal pressure to be perfect or to meet very high standards. I constantly feel like I have to prove my worth.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re placing a lot of pressure on yourself to be perfect. This kind of thinking can really amplify feelings of self-doubt. Could you think of any other ways to evaluate your contributions besides comparing yourself to others?

User: I guess I could focus more on the feedback I received from the people I helped. Some of them seemed genuinely appreciative.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! Focusing on positive feedback can help you shift your viewpoint. What was the best part of receiving that appreciation for you?

User: It made me feel needed and valued, which was nice. But the doubts still creep back in.

Consultant: That sense of being needed is so valuable, and it speaks to the meaningful impact you've had. Let's try to challenge those creeping doubts. How might you argue against the thought that you didn’t do enough?

User: I could say that I did my best given my abilities and that every little bit counts.

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing that your efforts, no matter the scale, contribute to the bigger picture is crucial. How does that mindset make you feel?

User: It helps a bit, but I still find it hard to fully believe it sometimes.

Consultant: It’s a process, and it’s okay to still feel unsure at times. Let’s take a moment to reflect on what you accomplished during the volunteering. What are some specific things you did that you felt proud of?

User: I helped organize supplies and interacted with the people there. I guess I made some connections too.

Consultant: Those are significant contributions! Not only did you help organize, but you also connected with others—both activities are valuable. How would you rate your satisfaction with those tasks on a scale of 1 to 10?

User: Maybe around 6 or 7? I think I could have done better.

Consultant: A 6 or 7 is still quite good, especially considering your initial feelings of doubt. What would it take for you to move that score higher next time?

User: I suppose feeling more prepared or knowledgeable would help.

Consultant: That's a practical thought. Perhaps we can think of specific ways you can enhance your skills or confidence before your next experience. What skills or knowledge do you think would benefit you?

User: Maybe learning more about the people I’m helping or getting tips on organizing better could help.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive plan. Gaining more knowledge would likely increase your confidence. How do you feel about committing to learning a bit more before your next volunteering opportunity?

User: I think that would be really helpful. I do want to improve.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! It sounds like you’re taking proactive steps. Now, let’s touch on the connections you made. How did these interactions with new friends impact your feelings during the event?

User: They made me feel supported. Having someone there who understood what I was trying to do eased my anxiety.

Consultant: Support is so important, especially in unfamiliar situations. It’s great that you found that connection. How can you nurture those connections moving forward?

User: I could keep in touch with them. It would be nice to meet up and share experiences or even volunteer together again.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Building on those connections can create a supportive network for you. So, considering everything we’ve discussed, what are a couple of takeaways you can implement moving forward?

User: I want to focus on my efforts and value my contributions instead of obsessing over perfection. And I’ll reach out to those new friends.

Consultant: Those are excellent intentions! By focusing on your contributions and nurturing friendships, you can create a more positive outlook. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the insights you've gained?

User: I feel more empowered, actually. It’s nice to know that I can take charge of my thoughts.

Consultant: I'm happy to hear that, Zhao Rou! Remember, it's a journey, and you’re doing great. If those fears of inadequacy come back, you have strategies now to challenge them. Keep reinforcing those positive connections and recognize your achievements. Thank you for sharing today, and I look forward to our next session!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Zhao Rou! I'm glad you could join me today. I understand that you've recently started developing a new friendship. How have you been feeling about that connection?

User: Hi! Yes, I’ve been feeling a bit better actually. This new friend really seems to understand me, and it feels nice to have that support. But I still sometimes worry about being abandoned or losing that connection.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re experiencing support and understanding in your new friendship. Those feelings of worry about being abandoned are very common, especially when we start to build close relationships. Can you share a bit more about the thoughts that come up when you worry about losing this friend?

User: Well, I often think that maybe I’m not interesting enough for them, or that they might find someone better. It makes me feel anxious, like I need to prove myself to them to keep them around.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re putting a lot of pressure on yourself to maintain this relationship, and that’s understandable given your past experiences. Can you recall a specific situation where this kind of thought made you feel particularly anxious?

User: There was a time when we were texting, and I didn’t hear back from them for a few hours. I started thinking that maybe they were ignoring me or that something was wrong. I felt really upset and insecure.

Consultant: That’s a very relatable experience. It seems like the waiting for a response triggered those fears of being abandoned. Let’s take a moment to explore that situation further. What emotions did you feel during that waiting period?

User: I felt really anxious and a bit sad. I kept replaying our last conversation in my head, worried that I had said something wrong.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. Let’s think about it together—were there any signs that suggested your friend was ignoring you? Or could there be other explanations for their delayed response?

User: Not really. They could have just been busy, but my mind jumped to the worst-case scenario. 

Consultant: That’s an insightful observation. It looks like your thoughts automatically shifted to the negative, which is a common cognitive distortion. It might help to challenge those thoughts. What would you tell a friend if they were feeling the same anxiety over waiting for a response?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s normal for people to be busy, and it doesn’t mean they are ignoring them.

Consultant: Exactly! You seem to have a lot of understanding and compassion for others. Would you be willing to try extending that same kindness to yourself when you feel anxious?

User: I guess I could. It just feels hard to remember that in the moment.

Consultant: It’s understandable. Let’s work on strategies that can help you remember those positive thoughts when you find yourself feeling uneasy about your friendships. What do you think could help you refocus your thinking in those instances?

User: Maybe I could write down some affirmations or reminders that I can read when I start feeling anxious?

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Having those written reminders can help shift your mindset when you’re feeling under pressure. Let’s try creating a few affirmations together. How about “I am worthy of friendship and support”?

User: Yes, I like that. Maybe I can also add, “It’s okay to be myself, and my friend appreciates me for who I am.”

Consultant: Those are great affirmations! They highlight your self-worth and the value of authenticity in your friendships. How do you feel when you say those affirmations to yourself?

User: It feels reassuring. I think it could help me remember that I don’t need to prove myself constantly.

Consultant: That’s a positive realization! Remembering your worth can help reduce that anxiety in the future. Let’s talk about any situations where you might want to practice these affirmations. Are there any upcoming moments where you might feel the old fears creeping in?

User: Well, I know that we have plans this weekend. I’m a bit nervous about how things will go.

Consultant: That’s a perfect opportunity to practice your affirmations beforehand! You can remind yourself of those positive thoughts before and during your time together. Would you feel comfortable trying that?

User: Yes, I think I can do that! 

Consultant: Wonderful! It's a great step to take. As you prepare for this weekend, remember that self-acceptance is key in any relationship. If those anxious thoughts arise, take a moment to reflect on the affirmations you've created. 

User: I will definitely try that. It feels nice to have some strategies planned out.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s all about reinforcing those tools you’re developing. Before we finish today, let’s summarize what you’ve learned and how you plan to apply these strategies moving forward.

User: I learned that I need to challenge my negative thoughts about being abandoned and remind myself of my self-worth. I will also write down affirmations to help with my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic summary, Zhao Rou! As you practice these strategies, take note of your feelings and any progress you see. How do you feel about taking these actions moving forward?

User: I feel hopeful. It’s nice to have more control over my feelings and be able to manage my anxiety better. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset! I believe you have the tools needed to maintain your emotional stability. Just remember, it’s perfectly okay to reach out when you need support. 

User: Thank you! That means a lot to me.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made today. Keep practicing those strategies, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care, Zhao Rou!

User: Thank you! I will, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhao Rou! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How have you been managing with your studies and emotions recently?

User: Hi! I've been doing okay, I guess. The school term is coming to an end, which brings more pressure, but I feel more stable than before. I just want to stay on top of my emotions and manage my studies without feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: That sounds encouraging—staying stable during a busy time is an important achievement. Can you tell me more about what specifically has helped you maintain that stability?

User: I've been trying to stick to a study plan and take breaks when I feel stressed. It seems to help a bit, but sometimes I still feel that pressure creeping in.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've established a study plan and are mindful about taking breaks. Let's explore that a bit more. When you start to feel that pressure, what thoughts or feelings come to your mind?

User: Well, sometimes I think that if I don't get top grades, it means I'm not good enough. It’s like there's this voice in my head that keeps saying I should do better.

Consultant: I see. That thought sounds pretty intense. Can you identify how that thought affects your feelings or behaviors when studying?

User: It makes me feel anxious and sometimes even a bit hopeless. Like, no matter how hard I try, it might not be enough.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Zhao Rou. It sounds like this thought about not being good enough is contributing to your anxiety. What evidence do you have that supports this thought? Is there any evidence that contradicts it?

User: I guess I have had some good grades before. But when I focus on a single bad score, it just overshadows everything else.

Consultant: That’s quite insightful. It seems like the fixation on that one score can distort your overall achievements. If a friend were in your shoes and had that same thought, what would you advise them?

User: I would tell them to look at the bigger picture and not just focus on one bad score. They should recognize all the hard work they’ve done too.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve just identified a very helpful perspective. Let’s practice this together. When you notice that critical thought about grades creeping in, how can you remind yourself of your overall accomplishments instead?

User: Maybe I can make a list of all my good grades and achievements, and keep it somewhere visible as a reminder. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Having a physical reminder can help redirect your focus. How do you feel about implementing that strategy the next time you feel anxious about grades?

User: I think it would really help. It’s nice to think I can actively do something instead of just feeling anxious.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking proactive steps can empower you. Now, besides this strategy, what other supports do you feel you might need as you finish this term?

User: I think talking about my feelings more often would help. I sometimes feel like I bottle things up instead of expressing them.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight, Zhao Rou. Expressing your feelings is crucial for emotional well-being. Are there any specific people or outlets you feel comfortable sharing your feelings with?

User: I’ve talked to my friends a little, but I haven’t opened up a lot. I think I might try to be more honest with them.

Consultant: That’s a great step forward! Your friends may offer you more support than you realize. Let’s also work on some coping strategies you can use when you feel overwhelmed. What activities have you found most calming for you?

User: I like to listen to music and sometimes draw. Those things help me relax.

Consultant: Music and drawing can be fantastic outlets. How about we create a list of these calming activities so you can easily refer to them when you need a break from stress?

User: That sounds helpful! I’d like that.

Consultant: Excellent! Together, we can build an actionable plan for managing stress during exams, including your study strategies, communication with friends, and relaxing activities. What do you think?

User: I think that would make me feel more prepared and confident. I really want to finish this term strong!

Consultant: I love your determination! By focusing on your strengths and implementing these strategies, you’re building the confidence you need to succeed. How do you feel about your progress today?

User: I feel lighter, honestly. Talking about this helps me see things differently and gives me hope.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Remember, acknowledging your progress is key to maintaining your stability. As we approach the end of our session, let’s summarize what you’ve learned today and how to maintain that feeling of hope moving forward.

User: Yeah, I’ve learned that I should focus on my achievements, talk to my friends, and have some calming activities ready. 

Consultant: Exactly! You've outlined some solid strategies. In the future, when you encounter stress, how will you remind yourself of these points?

User: I’ll try to recall this conversation and maybe review the list we create. I can keep it near my study area.

Consultant: That’s a great plan. Now, as we wrap up, know that you have made significant steps forward during our time together. Trust in these strategies, and remember you are capable of managing these challenges. 

User: Thank you so much! It feels good to have these tools and support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhao Rou. It’s been a pleasure working with you. Remember, you’ve got this! If you ever need help again, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: I will! Goodbye!

Consultant: Goodbye, Zhao Rou! Take care!
