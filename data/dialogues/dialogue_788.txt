Consultant: Hello, Y! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really disappointed. My math exam didn’t go well, and I just feel so overwhelmed with all the schoolwork. Sometimes I just want to escape and play games online instead of studying.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like the exam has added a lot of pressure on you. I know that escaping into online activities can be tempting during stressful times. What do you think it is about being online that you find appealing right now?

User: I think it's just easier and more fun. When I’m playing games or chatting online, I don’t have to think about my studies or the pressure to perform well. 

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s definitely a way to distract yourself from the stress. However, I wonder how you feel after spending time online instead of studying. Does it help in the long run?

User: Not really. I often end up feeling guilty afterwards for not studying, and that just makes me feel more anxious about my schoolwork.

Consultant: It seems like there’s this cycle where you escape into online activities, but it ends up increasing your anxiety about school. Let’s explore this a bit more. Can you think of a time when you felt a little more in control of your studies? 

User: I mean, there were times in elementary school where I was doing well. But now, it just feels like I can’t keep up. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially with the transition to middle school. Can you identify what has changed between elementary school and now that might have affected your attitude toward studying?

User: I guess there’s just more pressure to perform now. And I don't have as much support from my parents since they are so busy with work.

Consultant: That lack of support can be really tough. It’s natural to feel lost without guidance. So right now, it seems you’re caught between the pressure of school and your desire to escape online. Have you thought about how you might navigate this situation differently?

User: Not really. I just feel stuck and unsure about what to do. 

Consultant: It’s okay to feel that way. Let’s take a step back and think about some small steps you can take to help manage your feelings of overwhelm about schoolwork. What if we set some specific study goals that feel more achievable for you?

User: Maybe. Like what kind of goals?

Consultant: How about starting with just 15 to 20 minutes of focused studying, followed by a short break? This way, you can gradually build your study time without feeling too pressured. Does that sound manageable to you?

User: I could try that. It might help me not feel so anxious.

Consultant: That’s a great start! And after the study session, you can reward yourself with a bit of online time. How do you think that might change your feelings about studying?

User: It might make studying feel less like a chore, and I’ll have something to look forward to afterwards.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about creating a positive association with studying rather than only feeling pressure. Let’s also talk about your feelings with friends at school. How have you been experiencing those relationships lately?

User: I feel really left out sometimes. Like when my classmates talk, I don’t really have anything to say. 

Consultant: That feeling of exclusion is tough. Have you tried reaching out to anyone in particular? 

User: Not really. I’m afraid they might not want to talk to me.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have that fear, but remember, often others feel the same way too. What if you could find just one person to start a conversation with, even if it's about something small? 

User: I could try talking to someone in my class about school stuff. Maybe that could be a start.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Small connections can lead to bigger conversations. As you begin practicing these goals and reaching out to others, notice how it affects your feelings. 

User: Yeah, I will try. I really hope it helps me feel a bit relieved. 

Consultant: I'm here to support you through this. Remember, change takes time, and it's about progress, not perfection. How do you feel now about addressing these challenges we've talked about?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I think breaking things down into smaller steps is a good idea.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Hope can be a powerful motivator. As we move forward, let's aim to check in on your progress and how you're feeling about both studying and your friendships. 

User: That sounds good. I’ll definitely keep you updated.

Consultant: Perfect! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences. Remember, it's okay to reach out for support whenever you need it. How are you feeling about our session today? 

User: I feel like I have some direction now, which is nice. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Y! I'm proud of you for discussing these feelings. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. Looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoy! Welcome to today's session. I'm glad you're here. How have you been feeling lately, especially after your recent experience with your classmates?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious. The conflict with my classmates has made me feel more isolated, and I don't know how to handle it. I feel like they don't want me around, and that makes me want to retreat even more.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel anxious in light of those tensions with your classmates. You mentioned feeling isolated—can you share a bit more about what happened and how it impacted you?

User: Well, there was a misunderstanding during group work. I felt like everyone was blaming me. Now they’re kind of avoiding me, and it feels like I'm an outsider. I used to enjoy spending time with them, but now I just want to hide.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling blamed and then isolated from your friends. It’s important to feel connected. How have you been coping with this situation so far?

User: To be honest, I've been spending a lot of time online—chatting and playing games. It feels easier than facing the reality with my classmates.

Consultant: I see. Using online activities as a distraction can provide a temporary escape. However, it sounds like it may also be contributing to your feelings of isolation. Have you considered how this might affect your friendships in the long run? 

User: I know it might make things worse, but I just feel overwhelmed. I don't know how to talk to them about what happened.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed when conflicts arise. Let's explore this together. What thoughts come to your mind when you think about approaching your classmates and discussing what happened? 

User: I keep thinking that they won't listen to me or that they'll just get mad again. I don't want another fight.

Consultant: That sounds really stressful—fearing another confrontation. It seems like you’re assuming the worst possible outcome. Can we try to break that thought down a bit? What evidence do you have that they would react negatively if you tried to talk to them?

User: I guess I don’t have any solid evidence... It's just how I feel. They were so angry about what happened.

Consultant: It’s important to acknowledge those feelings, but it’s also useful to consider alternative perspectives. If a friend were in your position, what might you advise them to do in order to improve the situation?

User: I would probably tell them to just be honest and explain how they feel. But I’m just not sure if I can do that myself.

Consultant: It’s great that you can identify helpful advice for a friend. Perhaps you can apply a similar approach to your situation. What if you tried reaching out calmly and honestly to express your side? How does that idea resonate with you?

User: It sounds less scary when I think about it that way. Maybe if I express myself calmly, they would understand where I’m coming from.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re seeing it from a new angle. Practicing this approach can help strengthen your confidence. How would you feel about preparing what you might want to say to them?

User: I think I could try writing it down. That might help me organize my thoughts better.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Writing can be a useful tool for clarifying your thoughts and feelings. What points would you want to include in your message to them?

User: I want to tell them that I didn’t mean to cause any issues and that I want to fix things. Maybe I could also mention how I’ve been feeling isolated.

Consultant: That sounds like a sincere approach. Expressing your intentions and feelings can open up the conversation and help bridge the gap. After preparing your note, how do you plan to approach the conversation?

User: I think I’ll find a quiet moment when we’re not in a group setting. I don’t want to make it awkward in front of everyone. 

Consultant: That sounds wise. Choosing the right environment can make a big difference. How do you feel about setting a small goal for yourself, like initiating that conversation by the end of this week?

User: I think I can do that! It gives me a bit of time to think it over and prepare.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Having a timeline can help keep you motivated. As you prepare, what can you do to manage any nervousness you might feel before initiating the conversation?

User: I might practice what I want to say a few times in front of the mirror. It helps me feel more confident.

Consultant: Practicing is an excellent tactic. It can help reduce anxiety and make you feel more definitely prepared. As you approach this conversation, remember that it’s okay to be vulnerable and express your feelings. 

User: That makes sense. Just being honest could open things up.

Consultant: Absolutely! Honesty often leads to deeper connections. As we wrap up today, how are you feeling about the strategies we’ve discussed and your plan moving forward?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Thinking through this has helped me see that I can take steps to make things better.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, progress takes time, and it’s completely normal to feel anxious. You’re already taking significant steps toward improving your situation. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance.

Consultant: It’s my pleasure! I believe in your ability to navigate this. Let's reconvene next week to discuss how the conversation went and any other feelings that may arise. You're not alone in this journey.

User: Sounds good! I’ll talk to you then.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Y! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I've been really confused about my future and anxious about how my mom keeps trying to control things. It feels overwhelming.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're feeling a mix of anxiety and frustration with your mom’s attempts to communicate. Can you tell me more about what happened during your recent conversation?

User: Well, she wanted to talk about my future, but I felt like she was just telling me what to do instead of listening to what I really want. I didn’t feel comfortable at all.

Consultant: It sounds like you wanted more understanding and space to express yourself rather than being directed. What would you have preferred from that conversation?

User: I wish she had asked me how I felt about my future instead of making assumptions. It just made me feel like she doesn’t trust me to make my own decisions.

Consultant: That makes sense. Feeling trusted and understood is really important, especially at your age. Let's think about some ways you could express your feelings to her. What do you think might work?

User: Maybe I could tell her that I want to share my thoughts, but I need her to listen more and not just talk.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Using “I” statements can help convey your feelings without making her feel defensive. For example, you could say, “I feel overwhelmed when I feel controlled.” How does that sound to you?

User: I think that might help. But I worry she’ll still push her ideas on me.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. You could also set aside specific times to talk, so she knows when you’re ready to discuss your future. Would that make you feel more comfortable?

User: Yes, having some control over when we talk sounds good. I can prepare myself for it.

Consultant: Excellent! Preparation often helps reduce anxiety during conversations. How do you typically feel before a discussion with her?

User: I usually feel tense and expect it to go badly, which makes me reluctant to talk.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It seems like your anticipation adds to your anxiety. What if we explore ways to feel calmer before these conversations? 

User: Maybe I can do some breathing exercises or listen to music to calm down before we talk.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Calming exercises can definitely help clear your mind and reduce tension. Do you think practicing those techniques can help improve your communication with her?

User: I think so! If I’m calmer, maybe I can express myself better.

Consultant: Absolutely! Also, role-playing some scenarios with me could help you practice. Would you like to try a role-play of a conversation with your mom?

User: Sure! That sounds fun and useful.

Consultant: Great! Let’s set up a situation where you bring up how you prefer to communicate. I’ll play your mom. Are you ready?

User: Yes, I’m ready.

Consultant: “Hey Y, I want to talk to you about your future. I think you should consider doing a science program.” 

User: “Mom, I appreciate your concern, but I really feel confused about what I want right now. I need you to listen to my feelings, too.”

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Y. I can tell you really want to be heard. You can also add, “Can we set up a time where I can share my thoughts with you?” How does that feel?

User: It feels good! I could use that approach to make it clearer.

Consultant: I’m glad! Establishing this boundary can help improve your interactions. Do you feel like practicing a bit more, or do you want to discuss something else?

User: I just want to make sure I can remember this during the real conversation. It gives me hope!

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It’s important to have hope. You might even consider writing down your main points before the discussion. 

User: Writing it down sounds helpful. I could also practice my calming techniques as a prep.

Consultant: Exactly! Having both a written plan and calming strategies can boost your confidence. Is there anything else you’d like to address today?

User: I think we covered a lot already. I feel more prepared and hopeful now!

Consultant: I’m really pleased to hear that, Y! Just remember, it’s all about small steps. As you continue to practice, I believe you’ll find a balance between sharing your feelings and listening to your mom.

User: Thank you! I’ll definitely work on this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Let’s keep working together to strengthen these skills. If you ever feel unsure, reach out, and we can process it together. 

User: I will! I appreciate this talk.

Consultant: It’s been a pleasure. Take care of yourself, Y, and I look forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoy! I'm so glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling slightly better, especially since I joined the school's interest group and got back into music. But I still struggle with balancing my study time and my hobbies.

Consultant: It sounds like engaging in music has brought you some joy, which is wonderful! Let's explore how you can balance your studies with this newfound interest. What does being able to balance your time look like for you?

User: I hope I can spend enough time studying but also enjoy practicing music without feeling guilty about it.

Consultant: That’s a great intention. It seems important to you to enjoy your passions while also keeping up with your studies. What do you think is currently making it difficult to find that balance?

User: I often get distracted by my phone or games, especially at night, which makes me procrastinate on my homework.

Consultant: Procrastination can be really challenging, especially when there are tempting distractions around. Can you remember a moment when you felt you managed your time well? What did that look like?

User: Last week, I managed to finish my homework before practicing music, and I felt so accomplished. But I can't seem to do that consistently.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic example! It shows you are capable of managing your time effectively. What do you think prevented you from repeating that experience?

User: I think when I get home, I just want to unwind, so I dive into games instead of thinking about homework.

Consultant: That makes sense—it's natural to want to relax after a long day. This creates a habit. How might we create a new routine that incorporates both relaxation and productivity?

User: Maybe I could set specific times for both my studies and music practice, but I’m not sure how to start.

Consultant: Establishing a routine can certainly help! If we break it down into smaller, manageable goals, would you feel more comfortable? For instance, how about scheduling short study sessions followed by music time?

User: That sounds doable. If I have a timer, I might be able to focus better during those study sessions.

Consultant: Using a timer is a great idea! It can help create a sense of urgency and focus. How long do you think you could focus on studying before taking a break for music?

User: I think starting with 25 minutes of studying followed by 10 minutes of music practice could work.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! This method is known as the Pomodoro Technique. How does it feel to think about using this technique to structure your time?

User: It makes me feel hopeful! I can visualize it in my mind, but I worry if I can stick to it.

Consultant: It's common to have doubts about sticking to a new plan. What do you think might help reinforce this commitment to follow through on your schedule?

User: Maybe I could reward myself after completing my tasks, like playing a little longer on my game after studying?

Consultant: That’s a brilliant idea! Rewards can be a great motivator. What type of rewards might you consider that could encourage you to stick to your plan?

User: I like the idea of rewarding myself with some game time or even a treat after a productive study session.

Consultant: Great! It sounds like you’re setting yourself up for positive reinforcement. As you start to implement these changes, what will you do if you feel tempted to skip your study session?

User: I’ll remind myself how good I felt when I finished my homework last time, and maybe even jot that down somewhere to see it.

Consultant: That sounds like an effective strategy—keeping a reminder will encourage you to stay on track. As we wrap up today, are there specific goals you feel excited to implement in your schedule?

User: I’m excited to try the timer method and plan out my rewards. I hope it helps me feel more accomplished.

Consultant: I believe it will! You’ve shown a lot of insight today, and I'm confident you can manage this balance. If you encounter challenges, remember, you can always reach out for support. 

User: Thank you, I really appreciate your help today! I feel more motivated to tackle my studies now.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Xiaoy! Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. I'm looking forward to hearing how things go at our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Y! I'm really glad to see you here today. You mentioned feeling encouraged by the support from your teacher. Can you tell me more about how that has affected you?

User: Hi! Yes, my teacher has been really nice and she understands my struggles. I actually feel a bit more motivated to try harder in my studies, but I still struggle with focusing.

Consultant: That’s great to hear that your teacher’s support has motivated you! It sounds like you want to use that motivation to improve your focus. Can you share what specific challenges you're facing when you try to study?

User: I find it really hard to sit down and concentrate on my homework. I get distracted easily, especially with my phone. It’s like I just want to escape into games or chats online.

Consultant: I see. It’s understandable to want to escape into things that are fun when studying feels overwhelming. How do you feel after you spend time on your phone instead of studying?

User: At first, it feels nice and I forget about my stress, but then I feel guilty afterward because I didn’t do my work and my grades are slipping.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re caught in a cycle of temporary relief followed by guilt. Let's explore that a bit more. When you think about studying, what thoughts go through your mind that make you feel reluctant to start?

User: I often think that I won’t be able to understand anything, or that I’m too far behind to catch up. It feels hopeless sometimes.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy and discouraging. Let’s challenge them a bit. What evidence do you have that suggests you can't catch up or understand the material? 

User: Well, I guess I have had some moments when I understood things in class, especially when I ask my teacher for help.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! It sounds like when you reach out for help, you can grasp the material better. How can you remind yourself of those moments when you feel overwhelmed next time?

User: Maybe I could write down those experiences? Like, times when I actually understood something or felt good about what I learned.

Consultant: Writing down those positive experiences is a fantastic idea! It can serve as a reminder of your capabilities. How about setting specific study times where you allow yourself breaks to check your phone afterwards?

User: That sounds helpful! If I know I can take a break, I might be more inclined to study without getting distracted. 

Consultant: Definitely! Breaking tasks into smaller chunks can make them feel less daunting. What small study goal can you set for yourself this week?

User: I think I could start with studying for just 30 minutes at a time for one subject, and then take a 10-minute break.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! And remember to reflect on how you feel after completing your study session. It’s all about the small wins. How do you feel about sharing this plan with your teacher? 

User: I think sharing it with her could be great! She could give me feedback or maybe even help me stay accountable.

Consultant: I love that idea! Your teacher can support you and help make your study sessions even more effective. How could you bring this up with her?

User: I could just explain my difficulties and tell her about my new plan. I think she’ll understand.

Consultant: That sounds like a good approach! Expressing your feelings and plans to her may strengthen that supportive relationship you’ve built. Besides this plan, how else could you cultivate confidence in your studies?

User: I could try celebrating small achievements, like finishing a study session or understanding new material.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking time to acknowledge your progress, no matter how small, can really help boost your confidence. How do you feel about implementing this alongside your studying?

User: I feel more positive about it! Celebrating small wins feels manageable, and I think it’ll help me stay motivated.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Focusing on those small victories can create a positive reinforcement loop. As we wrap up, what’s one key takeaway from our session today that you want to carry with you?

User: I want to remember that reaching out for help is important and that I can set small goals to make studying easier for me.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway! I’m so proud of the steps you're willing to take. You have the ability to improve your situation, and I believe in you. Remember, I’m here if you need further support. How do you feel about our discussion today?

User: I feel really good! I think I have a clearer plan and I’m excited to start. Thank you!

Consultant: You're welcome, Y! I'm excited for you too. Keep focusing on those small goals and enjoy the journey ahead. You’re doing great, and I’m looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, little Y! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good. I did better on my recent monthly exam, and it felt really rewarding to see that my efforts paid off!

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It sounds like you’re starting to recognize your own abilities and feeling more positive about your progress. What do you think helped you improve this time?

User: I think I was more focused and actually tried to study regularly instead of procrastinating. I realized that if I put in the effort, I would see results.

Consultant: That's a great insight! Knowing that your efforts lead to positive outcomes is crucial. Can you share how you managed to stay focused during your studies this time?

User: I set a specific time each day to study, and I tried to stay away from my phone and games while doing that. It was tough, but I stuck with it.

Consultant: Establishing a routine is a valuable strategy. It sounds like you’re finding ways to balance your time better. How did that make you feel when you were able to study without distractions?

User: It felt really great! I was proud of myself, and I liked that I was able to learn new things instead of just wasting time online.

Consultant: That pride in your accomplishments is so important. It's a testament to your hard work. Can we explore more about how you felt when you completed your study sessions?

User: I felt accomplished and less anxious because I knew I was making progress. I didn’t feel as overwhelmed as before.

Consultant: It’s amazing how reducing anxiety can enhance your sense of achievement. Are there any specific strategies that you think helped reduce your anxiety during studying?

User: I started taking short breaks every half hour to relax. I also took deep breaths when I felt stressed.

Consultant: Those strategies are excellent! Taking breaks can really help reset your mind, and deep breathing is a great tool for coping with stress. Moving forward, how do you plan to maintain this positive momentum in your studies?

User: I want to keep my study schedule and perhaps add some new subjects I’m interested in. I think it will keep me motivated.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Exploring new subjects can definitely keep your learning experience fresh and engaging. How do you feel about including some activities that you enjoy outside of studying?

User: I’d love to! I think mixing in something fun would make studying less of a chore.

Consultant: Absolutely! Balancing enjoyable activities with your studies can lead to a more fulfilling routine. What kind of activities do you enjoy that we could integrate?

User: I enjoy drawing and sometimes writing stories. I could set aside some time for those after my study sessions.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect balance! Engaging in drawing or writing after studying can serve as a reward for your hard work. Do you feel excited about this new approach?

User: Yes, very much! I think it will help me stay disciplined while feeling more relaxed.

Consultant: Wonderful! Now, let’s talk about your support system. How do you feel about the encouragement you receive from your family and friends?

User: I think they don’t really understand how hard it is for me sometimes. But my grandparents are supportive when I do well, which helps me feel good about myself.

Consultant: It’s great that your grandparents support you. Their encouragement can make a big difference. Have you thought about sharing your goals and achievements with them to help them understand your journey better?

User: I haven’t really thought of that. Maybe sharing would help them see I’m trying hard.

Consultant: That could indeed foster more understanding and support from them. Communicating about your goals might strengthen your relationship with them as well. Would you feel comfortable discussing your achievements with them?

User: I think I could try that! It might feel nice to share my progress with them.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s also a way to celebrate your successes together. As we wrap up today's session, what would you consider your biggest takeaway from our discussion?

User: I’ve realized that I can manage my time better and that it’s okay to ask for more support. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway! You've shown great growth and awareness of your abilities. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. How do you plan to keep implementing what you've learned in future studies?

User: I will stick to my study schedule and try to be more open about my feelings and achievements with my family.

Consultant: That sounds excellent! Open communication and consistency will definitely support your progress. Today marks our conclusion for this series of sessions. You’ve learned many useful strategies to manage your studies and emotions. If you ever need assistance again in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate everything you’ve helped me with.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, little Y! I'm proud of all you have achieved. Best of luck in your studies, and take care!
