Consultant: Hello, W! Welcome to our session today. I’m here to help you with whatever’s on your mind. Can we start by talking about how you’ve been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I feel very anxious and uneasy all the time. I worry a lot about what my classmates and teachers think of me. Also, I’m feeling lonely because my parents are always busy with work and don’t pay much attention to me anymore.

Consultant: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy load with both your worries about school and your feelings of loneliness at home. That must be tough to handle. Could you tell me more about what kind of thoughts cross your mind when you feel anxious?

User: I often think that everyone is judging me badly, and that I’ll fail at school. I also fear that my parents don’t love me anymore because they’re not around. 

Consultant: Those feelings and thoughts can be overwhelming. When you think about failing at school, what kind of emotions do you experience along with that thought?

User: I feel... scared and hopeless. It’s like I’m going to let everyone down, especially my teachers. 

Consultant: I understand. That fear of disappointing others can weigh heavily on your mind. Let’s try to unpack that a bit. When you think, "I'm going to let everyone down," can you recall any specific situations or events that trigger this thought?

User: I guess it happens a lot during class discussions or when I have to answer questions. If I fumble or say the wrong thing, I just freeze up.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s natural to feel anxious in those situations. In the moments you freeze up, what thoughts run through your mind afterwards? 

User: I just think that everyone thinks I'm dumb, and that makes my heart race even more.

Consultant: It’s tough when we feel judged by others. Sometimes, our minds can jump to conclusions without evidence. Would you say that your thoughts might be more extreme or negative in those moments?

User: Yes, definitely. I don’t think that I just made a mistake; I think I'm completely failing.

Consultant: Recognizing that pattern is a good step. Let’s explore those thoughts a little more. Could you challenge that thought? What if a friend came to you with the same worry—what would you tell them?

User: I guess I would tell them that everyone makes mistakes and it doesn’t define their worth. I would try to reassure them.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a great perspective. It's often easier to be compassionate toward others than ourselves. What if you could extend that same kindness to yourself when you make mistakes? 

User: I don’t know; it still feels really hard to do that for myself.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Learning to practice self-compassion is not easy, but we can work on it together. How about we start by noting down some specific situations that trigger your anxiety? This can help us track those feelings better.

User: Okay, that might help. But I’m not sure how to do it.

Consultant: No worries, W. I can guide you through it. Let’s call it an "emotion record." You can write down the situation, how you felt, and what thoughts went through your mind. Do you think you could try doing that over the week?

User: Yes, I can try that. It might be useful.

Consultant: Great! You’re already taking steps to understand your feelings better. Along with that, would you like to learn a basic relaxation technique that can help when you're feeling anxious?

User: That sounds good.

Consultant: One effective method is deep breathing. Just taking a moment to breathe deeply can help reset your mind and body. Would you like to practice that together now?

User: Sure, I’m willing to try.

Consultant: Awesome! Let's take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four, hold it for four, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of four. Ready? 

User: Okay, let’s do it.

Consultant: Breathe in… 1, 2, 3, 4. Hold… 1, 2, 3, 4. Now exhale… 1, 2, 3, 4. How did that feel for you?

User: It actually felt nice. A bit calming.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You can use this deep breathing exercise whenever you start to feel anxious. It’s your personal tool for managing those feelings. 

User: I will definitely try to remember that.

Consultant: I’m glad! As we continue to work on understanding your feelings and thoughts, I want you to know that it's okay to seek help from others when needed. Have you thought about reaching out to anyone at school, like a teacher or a friend, to talk about how you’re feeling?

User: Not really. I’m scared they will think I’m weak.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but asking for support is actually a sign of strength. Many people appreciate the chance to help others. You might be surprised at their reactions. 

User: I guess that makes sense. 

Consultant: Just remember, W, you are not alone in this. You have the courage to face your feelings and seek support, which is a big step forward. 

User: Thank you, that makes me feel better.

Consultant: I’m here for you, and I’m proud of the progress you’re making. As we wrap up our session today, let’s summarize what you've learned. You’ll be keeping an emotion record and practicing deep breathing. How are you feeling about these steps?

User: I feel a little hopeful. I think I can manage my anxiety better now.

Consultant: That’s a great takeaway! Hold on to that hope. I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Remember, you can always reach out when you're feeling overwhelmed. 

User: Thank you, I appreciate it.

Consultant: Take care, W. I'm here whenever you need support. Have a good week ahead!

Consultant: Hello W! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really anxious about going back to school. It’s been hard to even think about facing my classmates after what happened. 

Consultant: I understand that going back to school feels really daunting right now. Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you about facing your classmates?

User: I’m just scared they’ll laugh at me. I keep imagining what I would do if they make fun of me. 

Consultant: That sounds really overwhelming. It’s common to fear judgment from peers. Let's explore this—what do you think might happen if they do laugh? 

User: I think I would feel really embarrassed and just want to disappear. 

Consultant: Feeling embarrassed is very understandable. What if we think about what you could do in that situation instead of focusing on escaping? 

User: I guess I could try to ignore them, but it’s hard. I feel like everyone is watching me. 

Consultant: It can feel like all eyes are on you during moments of anxiety. Have you ever faced a similar situation before? What did you do then?

User: There was a time in class when I had to present, and I was super nervous. I just stumbled through it and felt awful after. 

Consultant: Presenting can indeed be nerve-wracking. It’s good that you’ve handled that before. How did you feel afterward, after getting through the presentation?

User: I felt relieved but also embarrassed that I messed up. 

Consultant: Relief is a positive feeling, despite the embarrassment. Let’s build on that experience. What if you remind yourself about the relief you felt after facing something difficult, like that presentation, if you find yourself in a similar situation at school?

User: That could help, I guess. But what if my classmates don’t see it that way?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. People often have different reactions, and sometimes they might surprise us positively. What if we create a supportive self-talk script that you can use when you're feeling anxious about going back to school?

User: Okay, like what?

Consultant: You might say something like, “I have faced challenges before and got through them,” or “It’s okay to feel nervous; I’ll give my best.” How does that sound to you?

User: I think I can try that. It sounds a little encouraging.

Consultant: Great! Encouraging self-talk can be very helpful. Let’s also think about breaking down your return to school into smaller steps. What’s one small step you could take towards facing your classmates?

User: Maybe I could go back just for one class, like art. I feel a bit safer there.

Consultant: That sounds like a good starting point, W. How about we plan to go to that art class together next time? This way, you will practice being in the environment without committing to a full day right away.

User: That sounds less scary. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Preparing for a smaller step can make it much more manageable. What do you think might help you feel more comfortable when you go back, even just for that class?

User: Maybe I could talk to a friend who understands. 

Consultant: Talking to a supportive friend is an excellent idea. It can help you feel more secure and less alone. Do you have someone in mind to reach out to?

User: Yeah, I think I’ll message Jake. He usually helps me when I’m feeling nervous.

Consultant: Jake sounds like a good ally to have. Let’s prepare how you might approach him. You could say, “Hey, I’m feeling a bit anxious about school and was hoping we could sit together in art.” How does that sound?

User: That sounds okay. I can do that. 

Consultant: Perfect! Is there anything else you’d like to discuss regarding your feelings or thoughts about returning to school?

User: I just wonder if I can really do it. What if I freeze up?

Consultant: It’s completely normal to worry about freezing up. Remember that it’s okay to feel nervous, and even if you do freeze, you can take a deep breath and regain your composure. You can always have a backup plan, like taking a moment to breathe or using your self-talk.

User: That makes sense. I need to remember that I don’t have to be perfect. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s all about progress rather than perfection. Each step you take back to school is a victory. How do you feel about schools after discussing these strategies?

User: I feel a little more hopeful than before. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, W! Hope is a powerful tool. As we wrap up today, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I think it’s that I can take small steps, and I don’t have to face everything at once. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Small steps can lead to big changes. Before we finish, let’s plan for our next session—how about we check in after you attend that art class?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful.

Consultant: Great! Remember, you've made progress today, and you can always reach out if you need support before then. I’m proud of you for the steps you’re preparing to take. 

User: Thanks! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, W. Looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, W! I'm glad you are here today. I know you've been working on improving your communication with your parents. How have you been feeling about that lately?

User: Hi. I think it's a bit better with my mom. I can talk to her more openly now, but I still feel really nervous around my dad. Sometimes it feels like I can't express myself when he's around.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling more comfortable with your mom. It sounds like you're making some positive progress. However, I understand that communicating with your dad still feels challenging. Can you tell me more about what makes you feel nervous around him?

User: I guess it's because he’s quite strict and I worry about saying the wrong thing. I really want to connect with him, but I fear his reaction.

Consultant: That fear is completely understandable, especially if he tends to be strict. It can create a lot of pressure to communicate perfectly. What kind of things would you like to share with him if you felt comfortable?

User: I’d like to tell him how I feel and maybe share things I’m interested in, like my friends and school projects. But I'm afraid he might not be interested or might just scold me.

Consultant: It seems like you have some important thoughts and feelings you'd like to express. Let's think about ways you could share those thoughts in a way that feels safe for you. Have you considered using "I" statements, like "I feel..." when talking to him?

User: I've heard about that before, but I'm not really sure how to use it. Can you help me?

Consultant: Absolutely! Using "I" statements can help express your feelings more clearly and reduce the chances of him feeling defensive. For example, if you say, "I feel overwhelmed when I think you might be disappointed with me," it focuses on your feelings rather than placing blame. Would you like to try coming up with an example together?

User: I think I could try that. Maybe I could say, "I feel nervous when we talk about school because I want to do well."

Consultant: That's a great start, W! It expresses your feelings and your desire to succeed. How do you think your dad might respond to that?

User: I hope he would understand and maybe help me instead of just telling me to do better.

Consultant: That's a hopeful approach! It's important to express that desire for support as well. You could say something like, "I would really appreciate your guidance on how I can improve." How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I think he might like that I'm asking for help instead of just telling him my problems.

Consultant: Exactly! It shows that you're seeking his support rather than just sharing concerns. Now, let's practice a bit. If you were to have a conversation with him today, what might you say first?

User: I might start with, "Dad, can we talk about school? I feel nervous and could really use your help."

Consultant: That's wonderful, W! It directly invites him in and opens up the conversation. How would you feel if this conversation actually happened?

User: I think I would feel nervous, but also a bit excited to share. 

Consultant: It's natural to feel a mix of emotions. Remember, practicing what we discussed can help ease some of that nervousness. Besides talking to your dad, what are some other things you'd like to work on regarding your friends and social skills?

User: I want to feel more confident when I'm with my friends. Sometimes, I feel like they might not like me as much, and I'm afraid of losing them.

Consultant: That sounds tough. Building confidence with friends is important. What do you think might help you feel more confident in those social situations?

User: Maybe if I could focus on having fun instead of worrying about what they think about me.

Consultant: Focusing on fun is a great idea! It shifts your attention away from worries about their perceptions. Can you recall a recent time when you had fun with them? 

User: Yes, we played video games together last week, and I enjoyed it a lot!

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful experience. How did you feel while you were playing with them?

User: I felt happy and relaxed, like I could just be myself.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! That feeling of being yourself is key. You can remind yourself of that experience when you start feeling anxious. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds really good. I guess I’ll try to remember that when I start feeling nervous.

Consultant: Excellent! So, to summarize, you’ve explored ways to communicate better with your dad using "I" statements, and you're also looking to focus on enjoying time with friends. How do you feel about your progress today?

User: I feel more hopeful and like I have some strategies to try!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, W! You're taking positive steps to improve your relationships. Remember, it's okay to take your time with these changes. If you find yourself feeling anxious, you can always come back and share your experiences. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I feel more ready to face my challenges now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Today was a great session, and I believe you'll do well in your conversations moving forward. Remember, you can always use the techniques we discussed. Good luck, and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello W! I'm glad you're here today. It sounds like you've been working hard on connecting with your classmates recently. Can you share how you're feeling about those new friendships?

User: Hi! Yeah, I'm really happy that I made some new friends when I joined the extracurricular activity. But I still feel a bit anxious when I think about interacting with them. What if they don’t like me or I mess up?

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’ve made some friends! It’s completely normal to feel anxious about your social interactions, especially when relationships are new. What specifically makes you feel anxious about potentially messing up?

User: I guess I worry that I might say the wrong thing or that they’ll judge me. That makes me hesitate to talk to them sometimes.

Consultant: That makes sense. It can be tough when we fear being judged. Let's explore this a bit—when you think about saying the wrong thing, what specific thoughts come to your mind in that moment?

User: I often think that if I say something silly, they won't want to hang out with me anymore. It really makes me want to avoid talking.

Consultant: That’s a strong thought which can create pressure. Have you considered how often that thought actually turns out to be true? What evidence do you have that your friends would reject you for saying something silly?

User: I don’t actually have any solid evidence. They haven't done anything to suggest they wouldn't like me. It's more just my mind running away with negative thoughts.

Consultant: That’s a valuable realization, W! Sometimes, our minds can jump to conclusions without sufficient evidence. It might help to challenge those thoughts. If you had a friend in your situation, what would you tell them about their concerns?

User: I would probably say that it's okay to mess up and that friends would understand. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes.

Consultant: Exactly! Friends are typically supportive. Would you be open to trying an exercise where we create a list of alternative thoughts to counter your worries before social situations?

User: Sure, I think that could help. I need to remind myself that it’s okay to not be perfect.

Consultant: Great! Let’s think about some positive affirmations together. For example, you might say, “I’m doing my best, and it’s okay to be myself.” How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I like the idea of telling myself it’s okay to be myself.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Now, let’s shift gears a bit. Have you tried practicing some of these conversations or interactions before they happen? It might help ease your concerns.

User: Not really, I’ve mostly just been avoiding situations that I feel anxious about. 

Consultant: Understandable. Practicing in a safe environment can really boost your confidence. How would you feel about role-playing a scenario with me to get comfortable?

User: That sounds helpful! I think practicing could make it feel less scary.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s set up a situation where you might interact with your friends. How about a simple greeting or asking about a school project? 

User: Okay, I can try that! I could say, “Hey, did you understand the homework?” 

Consultant: That's an excellent start! Go ahead and try saying that to me. 

User: *clears throat* “Hey, did you understand the homework?” 

Consultant: Great job, W! How did that feel for you?

User: It felt a bit nerve-wracking, but I think it’s good practice. 

Consultant: That’s completely normal. It can help to see that it’s just a conversation with your peers. Let’s work on these interactions regularly to build up your confidence. 

User: Yeah, I’d like that! 

Consultant: As we continue, don't forget that mistakes are part of the learning process too. You’re doing well by reaching out and practicing. What else do you think would help you feel more confident in social situations?

User: Maybe working on keeping the conversation going. Sometimes I run out of things to say.

Consultant: That’s an important skill. We can focus on conversation starters or questions to ask your friends. Would you like to create a list together?

User: Yes, I’d really like that! 

Consultant: Awesome! To start, think about interests you share with your friends. What are some common topics that come up in your conversations?

User: I know we all like video games and movies. 

Consultant: Perfect! You can ask them about their favorite games or movies. That could spark a good discussion. Would you like to brainstorm a few more questions like that?

User: Definitely! I could ask about their favorite characters or what games they’re currently playing.

Consultant: Those are fantastic ideas! Remember, showing interest helps others feel valued and boosts your relationship. How do you feel about using these questions in your next conversation?

User: I feel more ready! I think having topics in mind will help me talk more easily. 

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’re making great strides. Before we end today's session, let’s summarize the strategies we discussed.

User: Sure! We talked about positive affirmations, practicing conversations, and having some questions ready for discussions.

Consultant: Exactly! And remember, it’s okay to be imperfect and take social interactions one step at a time. How do you feel about our progress today?

User: I feel more confident now. I’m really glad I came.

Consultant: I'm happy to hear that, W! Keep using the strategies we discussed, and remember, social skills take time to develop. You can always return if you feel you need more support. 

User: Thank you! I will definitely keep practicing. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome. Take care, and I look forward to our next session to see how things are going!
###################
Consultant: Hello, W! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately, especially after your recent achievements at school?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a little proud of my progress in school, but I can’t shake off the worry about my grades. I keep thinking that if I don’t do really well, my teachers will be disappointed.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of pride and anxiety. It’s great to hear about your progress, but I can see that the fear of disappointing your teachers is weighing on you. Could you tell me more about how this affects you on a daily basis?

User: Yeah, it makes me really anxious when I do assignments. I keep checking if I’m meeting everyone’s expectations. I can’t focus on my work because I’m too worried.

Consultant: That sounds tough, W. It's understandable to want to meet the expectations of your teachers, but it can be really overwhelming. What do you think keeps bringing those worries back when you're trying to study?

User: I guess I’m just afraid of failing. I've always believed that doing well in school is super important, and if I slip up, it’s like I’m letting everyone down.

Consultant: So, it seems like your belief in the importance of doing well is really strong. Let’s explore that a bit. Can you identify any specific thoughts that pop up when you think about potentially not meeting those expectations?

User: When I think about it, I often tell myself, “If I don’t get good grades, I’m just not good enough.” It’s like my brain immediately jumps to that conclusion.

Consultant: That’s a significant thought, and it sounds very harsh. Let’s take a moment to challenge it—what evidence do you have that not achieving a perfect score means you aren’t good enough? 

User: I don’t know… I guess I have done well in some things, but the thought of not doing perfectly makes me worry a lot.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those fears, but it’s also important to recognize that your worth isn’t solely based on grades. What would you say to a friend who was feeling the same way about their performance in school?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay to make mistakes, and grades aren’t everything. I wouldn’t want them to feel as bad as I do.

Consultant: That’s compassionate advice! So, if you can extend that kindness to someone else, why not start practicing it towards yourself? Let’s try to reframe your thoughts. Instead of “If I don’t get good grades, I’m not good enough,” how about “I’m doing my best, and that’s what matters”?

User: I think I could try that. It sounds better, but it feels strange to think that way.

Consultant: It’s completely natural for it to feel strange—changing thought patterns takes time. Would you like to take a small step and try replacing that thought whenever it comes to mind this week?

User: Sure, I can try that! I’ll write it down somewhere to remind myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan, W! In addition to that, let’s also talk about some activities you enjoy—can you remember anything recently that made you feel good about yourself outside of school?

User: I played soccer with my friends last weekend. It was really fun, and I felt confident while playing.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Engaging in activities you enjoy can really help boost your self-esteem. How about setting a goal to allow some time for soccer this week, regardless of your academic performance?

User: I’ll try to do that! It would help me relax.

Consultant: Perfect! Balancing work and play can help reduce that pressure you feel. Lastly, as we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel is the most important takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think it’s important to be kinder to myself and to remember that grades don’t define me.

Consultant: Exactly, W! That’s a powerful realization. Remember, you’re capable and you’re allowed to grow at your own pace. When we meet again, we can check in on the new strategies you've tried and how they’re working for you.

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’ve made some great progress today. Remember, it’s about moving forward one step at a time. I look forward to seeing you next time, W!
