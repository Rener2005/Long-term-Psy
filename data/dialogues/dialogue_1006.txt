Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for this session. I understand you're feeling quite anxious about adjusting to dorm life and your relationships with your classmates. Let's start by talking about how you've been feeling lately. What specific thoughts or feelings have been on your mind?

User: Hi. I feel really overwhelmed since moving to the dorm. I find it hard to talk to my classmates, and whenever I do, I get really tense. I start sweating and my heart races, which makes it even harder to connect with them. I even think about changing majors or dropping out sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing significant social anxiety, and that must be really tough for you. You're feeling pressure to connect with your classmates in this new environment. What do you think is at the root of these feelings when you're in social situations?

User: I guess I worry that if I try to talk to them, they might not like me or think I'm awkward. I feel like I'm always the one trying to keep the conversation going, but it’s exhausting, and I feel like I’m failing.

Consultant: It makes sense that you’d feel that way, especially if you feel like you have to be the one in charge of social interactions. Let’s explore some of those thoughts about not being liked or feeling awkward. Can you recall a specific time recently when you felt this way?

User: Yes, the other day I tried to join a group conversation, but I couldn't think of anything to say. I felt like they were all looking at me, and I just froze. I left feeling really embarrassed.

Consultant: That sounds like a very uncomfortable experience. It’s understandable to feel embarrassed, but let’s consider those feelings. What kind of thoughts were running through your mind in that moment? 

User: I thought everyone was judging me. I kept telling myself that I must have said something stupid and that they probably don’t want me around.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite harsh and critical. Can we challenge them together? What evidence do you have that they were judging you or didn’t want you around?

User: Actually, I don’t really have any solid evidence. I just assumed they were thinking negatively about me.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. It seems like your mind might be jumping to conclusions without enough proof. If a friend were in your shoes, what advice would you give them about handling such situations?

User: I would probably tell them not to worry too much about what others think and to just be themselves. 

Consultant: That’s great advice! So why do you think it’s easier to give that advice to a friend than to take it yourself? 

User: I guess I just feel more pressure on myself to fit in. I think about how I’ve always been the one people look up to, and now I don’t feel that way anymore.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling a lot of pressure to maintain that image. It’s normal to experience changes, especially in a new environment like college. Would you be open to discussing how you can start to ease that pressure by adjusting your expectations for yourself?

User: Yeah, I think that would help. I just don’t know how to start.

Consultant: One way to begin is by setting small, realistic goals for social interactions. For example, you could aim to start a conversation with one classmate each day or ask a question about an assignment. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds doable. I think I could try that.

Consultant: Excellent! As you try this out, it’s also important to recognize and challenge negative thoughts that arise. We could also explore some relaxation techniques that you can use when you feel anxious before a social interaction. Would you be interested in that?

User: Yes, definitely! I need some ways to calm down before talking to others.

Consultant: Great! Simple breathing exercises can be really helpful. For example, you can practice taking a deep breath in for four seconds, holding it for four, and then exhaling slowly for four seconds. We can do a short practice together if you'd like. 

User: I’d like that! I often forget to breathe when I’m anxious.

Consultant: Let’s try it. Breathe in deeply... Hold... Now exhale slowly... How does that feel?

User: A little calming, actually. I feel like I can think more clearly.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It’s a great tool to bring into your daily life. As you continue to practice these techniques, how do you think they might impact your interactions with classmates?

User: I think if I can calm down first, I might be able to approach them more easily.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember, it’s about small steps. With practice, those interactions can start to feel less daunting. What do you think might be a good next step for you this week?

User: Maybe I could introduce myself to someone new in my dorm this week.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! It’s a good opportunity for you to connect with someone. How will you set yourself up for success before you do that?

User: I’ll practice the breathing exercise beforehand, and maybe remind myself that it’s okay to be awkward sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset! Embracing that it’s okay to be imperfect will help reduce some of that pressure. Let’s keep working on these skills in our next session. Before we finish today, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any other concerns on your mind?

User: Not right now, I think we covered a lot. I feel a bit more hopeful about things.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, progress takes time and it’s okay to have ups and downs along the way. You've taken some great steps forward today. I look forward to hearing how things go next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello! It's good to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I think I’ve made some progress, but I still feel really anxious when I'm around my dorm mates. I tried to talk to them more, but I still end up feeling tense and unsure.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re putting in effort to interact with your dorm mates, which is a great step. Can you share a specific situation where you felt anxious recently?

User: Well, the other day we had a group project, and while I wanted to contribute more, I just felt really nervous talking in front of them. My heart was racing, and I was sweating a lot.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. Feeling your heart racing and sweating must have made it even harder for you to speak up. What thoughts ran through your mind during that moment?

User: I kept thinking that they wouldn't want to hear what I had to say, or that they would judge me for not being good enough.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very tough to deal with. It's understandable to feel anxious when you fear judgment. Let’s try to explore these thoughts a bit more: what evidence do you have that they would judge you?

User: I don’t really have any real evidence, it’s just how I feel. I guess I might be overthinking it, but in the moment, it just feels so real.

Consultant: It’s common to feel that way, especially in social situations. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their feelings and thoughts?

User: I would probably say that they are being too hard on themselves and that it’s okay to make mistakes. Maybe they should just go for it.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective! It seems like you can see things a bit more objectively when thinking about a friend. How might you apply that same kindness to yourself in these situations?

User: I think I should remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that everyone feels nervous sometimes. Maybe I can try to lower my expectations.

Consultant: That sounds like a valuable strategy! Lowering expectations can help relieve some pressure. What do you think would be a manageable way to practice this in your next social interaction?

User: Maybe I could focus on just speaking up once during our next group meeting, rather than thinking I need to dominate the conversation.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Focusing on one contribution can help ease your anxiety. How do you think you’ll feel after trying that?

User: I think it might feel good to share something, even if it’s just a little. I guess it would help build my confidence.

Consultant: Exactly! Every small step you take can contribute to building your confidence. Let’s think about a specific scenario in which you can practice this. What opportunity do you see coming up?

User: There’s another group project starting next week. I could use that as a chance to speak up more.

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a great opportunity to practice. How do you plan to remind yourself to stay calm and focused on your goal during that meeting?

User: I could set a little reminder on my phone to breathe deeply before I speak and remind myself that it’s okay to just share a little.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Deep breathing can really help calm those nerves. Let's also think about what you could do if you start to feel anxious again during that project. What could be a comforting thought to have in mind?

User: Maybe I can tell myself, “It’s okay to feel anxious, and I’m still allowed to speak.” 

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate thought! Recognizing that it’s okay to feel anxious while also allowing yourself to contribute is a powerful way to move forward. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It helps to have a plan in mind for what to do when I feel anxious.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Having a plan can certainly bring more confidence. As we wrap up today, what would you say is the most important takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think realizing that I can manage my anxiety and that it's okay to take small steps is really important. It also helps to remember to be kind to myself.

Consultant: Absolutely! That self-kindness will be essential on your journey. Remember, each step you take, no matter how small, is progress. If you find yourself struggling, just remind yourself of these strategies. I believe in you, and I'm excited to hear how it goes next time! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and the strategies we've discussed. I’m looking forward to our next session!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your progress. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you've decided to come in today. I understand that you've been feeling some anxiety in social settings lately. Could you tell me more about that?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling pretty anxious when I interact with my classmates. It's as if my heart races and I start sweating, especially when I try to be more involved in conversations or activities. I hope to find a way to feel more comfortable with them.

Consultant: It sounds like you're putting in an effort to engage socially, which is a great step. But it must be frustrating to feel that anxiety creeping in. What specific situations make you feel the most anxious?

User: Mostly when I'm in a group, like during discussions or social events. I worry that I'll say something wrong or that others won't understand me. This has made my studies feel overwhelming.

Consultant: I can see how that would be really challenging. You want to connect with others but feel anxious about their reactions. Can you think back to a recent interaction that made you feel especially anxious? What thoughts were running through your mind at that moment?

User: I remember trying to join a conversation about a class project. I felt like my suggestions were ignored, and I thought maybe they just didn't value my input. That made me feel unconfident.

Consultant: It sounds like you were really putting yourself out there, but when you felt ignored, it led to doubts about your worthiness in that group. How did that experience make you feel about your social interactions moving forward?

User: I started to think that maybe it’s better to just keep quiet and not get involved if I'm just going to be overlooked. But I also want to make friends and feel included.

Consultant: It's understandable to want to protect yourself from feeling ignored, yet it's also really important to connect with others. Let's explore this further. What if we thought about some alternative ways to perceive those situations—how do you think your friends might feel in a similar circumstance? 

User: Maybe they would feel nervous too? I guess everyone has insecurities, even if they seem confident.

Consultant: Exactly! Most people experience some level of anxiety in social settings. If a friend shared a similar concern with you, how would you encourage them to approach the situation?

User: I would probably tell them to keep trying and to remember that their voice matters, even if people don’t always respond.

Consultant: That’s a really supportive perspective! Now, let's apply that advice to yourself. What if you treated yourself with the same kindness and encouragement? How might that change your approach to interactions?

User: I suppose if I thought of my input as valuable, even if one or two people don’t respond, I might feel less discouraged and more open to sharing.

Consultant: That's a great insight! Also, let's think about concrete steps. Could you plan to share at least one thought or a question during your next group discussion? This might help you gradually build confidence. 

User: Yes, I can definitely try that. Maybe if I start with something small, it won't feel so scary.

Consultant: Wonderful! Starting small is key in facing anxiety. How about we also think of some techniques you might use to calm your nerves before and during these interactions?

User: I could practice some deep breathing exercises or remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes. 

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Breathing can be very grounding, and reframing your thoughts can really help in reducing anxiety. How do you feel about trying these strategies in combination with your plan to contribute in group discussions?

User: That sounds like a good plan. I feel like those steps are manageable and could really help me.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As you try these out, what do you think you could do to celebrate your efforts, no matter how small the outcome?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to something I like, like watching a favorite show or having a small snack afterward to acknowledge my effort.

Consultant: That’s a lovely idea! Rewarding yourself can reinforce the positive behavior. As you go about your week, remember to be patient with yourself. This is a gradual process.

User: Thank you! I need to remind myself that it's okay to take my time with this.

Consultant: Absolutely. Progress takes time, and every step you take is important. Looking ahead, what do you think is the next challenge you want to tackle after addressing your anxiety in group settings?

User: I think I need to work on being more open to new friendships, possibly outside of class. I feel like I've been avoiding that.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! Meeting new people can be a great way to broaden your social circle. How might you approach someone new or invite them to join in something fun?

User: I could invite a classmate to study together or join them for lunch. That feels less intimidating than asking for a deep conversation.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect way to ease into new friendships! You’re thinking practically, and I love that. Remember, each attempt is a step toward becoming more comfortable.

User: I will definitely keep that in mind. Thank you for guiding me through this!

Consultant: You're welcome! I’m really proud of how far you’ve come during our sessions. Let's continue building on this in our future meetings. How are you feeling now about your ability to tackle these social experiences?

User: I feel more hopeful than before. I believe I can handle these situations better as I practice.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Being hopeful is a powerful tool. Hold on to that feeling, and remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help. 

Consultant: It’s my pleasure! Keep practicing those strategies we discussed, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been okay, but I'm still struggling with anxiety, especially when I'm around my dorm mates. I really want to feel more comfortable and secure in social situations.

Consultant: It sounds like you want to build a sense of comfort and security in your interactions. Can you share a bit more about what specific situations with your dorm mates have been causing you anxiety?

User: Well, I've been participating in some club activities to meet new people, but I often feel that I'm being judged. My heart races and I get really nervous, which makes it hard to connect with them.

Consultant: I see. It's completely normal to feel anxious in social settings, especially when you're concerned about how others perceive you. Can you tell me what thoughts go through your mind when you feel this way?

User: I keep thinking that they might not like me or that I might embarrass myself. These thoughts make me even more anxious.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. It seems like they really affect your experience in those social situations. Have you noticed how these thoughts impact your emotions and behavior during those times?

User: Yes, definitely. When I think that way, I usually end up avoiding conversations or just staying quiet, which makes me feel more isolated and anxious.

Consultant: That's understandable. Avoidance often reinforces anxiety. Let's explore this together. If you were to challenge those negative thoughts, what alternative interpretations could you consider?

User: I guess I could think that people might actually be kind and welcoming, or that most of them are too busy with their own thoughts to judge me.

Consultant: That's a great start! Recognizing that others might not be as critical can really help. If a friend were in your position, what advice would you give them regarding these feelings?

User: I would probably tell them to just be themselves and not worry too much about what others think.

Consultant: That's excellent advice! Now let's think about how you can apply that same wisdom to yourself. What small steps could you take to embrace being yourself in these situations, even when you feel anxious?

User: Maybe I could try to initiate a conversation with someone, even if I feel nervous. Just to see what happens.

Consultant: I love that idea! Taking small steps can really help you build confidence. How about setting a specific goal for your next interaction, such as asking someone about their hobbies or a topic you enjoy?

User: That sounds doable. I think I could ask someone about the club activities we do.

Consultant: Perfect! This will not only help you connect but also give you a chance to practice focusing on others rather than how you feel about yourself. Remember, each step, no matter how small, is progress. How do you feel about trying this approach?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited. It's a good challenge for me.

Consultant: That's a healthy perspective! It's okay to feel nervous—that just means you're stepping outside your comfort zone. Let’s also talk about how you can manage those feelings when they arise. Are there any calming techniques you’ve found helpful in the past?

User: Deep breathing helps a little, and sometimes I try to remind myself that it's okay to feel anxious.

Consultant: Those techniques are wonderful tools! You can use deep breathing right before engaging in conversations to help ground yourself. Remembering that it’s okay to feel anxious can also reduce the pressure you put on yourself. What do you think you will tell yourself before your next interaction?

User: I’ll remind myself that everyone is just trying to connect, and that it’s okay if things don’t go perfectly.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic mantra to carry with you. Reinforcing self-compassion can make a huge difference. As you try these new strategies, let’s also keep an eye on your progress and celebrate those small victories. How would you feel about sharing your experiences in our next session?

User: I think that sounds good! I’d like to see how things go and share any progress I make.

Consultant: I’m looking forward to hearing about it! Remember, this is all part of your journey toward feeling more comfortable in social settings. You’re doing an amazing job by taking these steps. Is there anything else you would like to discuss today?

User: Not for now. I feel a bit more hopeful about making new connections after talking with you.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! Hope is a powerful force. As we wrap up today, let's summarize what you’ve agreed to work on until our next session. You’re aiming to engage in conversations by asking questions and using some calming techniques when you feel anxious, correct?

User: Yes, that’s right!

Consultant: Wonderful! Keep in mind that it’s okay to take things one step at a time. I’m proud of the progress you’re making, and remember, I’m here to support you. Looking forward to our next session. 

User: Thank you. I'm looking forward to it too!

Consultant: Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you again for our session today. Last time, we discussed your progress in adapting to the new environment and building some positive interactions. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good overall. I've actually been able to connect with a few classmates, which has been nice. I still have moments where I feel anxious, but they seem to be less frequent.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like you've made some progress in building those connections. Can you share a bit about a specific positive interaction you've had recently?

User: Yes! Last week, I joined a study group, and I felt really comfortable sharing my thoughts. Everyone was supportive, and it made me feel included. For the first time, I didn't feel like I was on the outside.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful experience! Being part of a supportive group can really help boost your confidence. How did that interaction impact your feelings about socializing with your classmates?

User: It made me feel like I can actually do this. I realized that I do have something to contribute, and it's okay to be myself.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing your contributions and being yourself is a significant step toward building that social confidence. Can you think of any specific thoughts or feelings you had during that study group that you would want to remember for future similar situations?

User: I felt excited to share my ideas and happy that they were well-received. I want to remember that feeling of belonging.

Consultant: That's an excellent feeling to hold onto! Let's explore how we can help you internalize that sense of belonging and confidence. What would you say is a small goal you could set for yourself in your next social interaction?

User: Maybe I could try to initiate a conversation with someone new in class. That feels like a good next step for me.

Consultant: Initiating a conversation is a fantastic goal! It sounds like a reasonable step forward. How about we brainstorm some starting points or topics you could use to make initiating that conversation feel easier?

User: Yes, that would help! I think asking someone about their study habits might be a good conversation starter since we’re all in the same situation.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Asking about study habits can lead to sharing tips and experiences, which often helps people connect. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel excited yet a bit nervous, but I think the excitement outweighs the nerves.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a mix of excitement and nervousness. Let’s also think about some strategies you can use if you start feeling anxious during the conversation. What might help you manage your anxiety in that moment?

User: Taking a deep breath before speaking might help. Also, reminding myself that it's okay to be a little nervous.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Deep breathing can help calm those nerves, and self-encouragement is a powerful tool. How do you think you could celebrate your progress after pushing yourself to initiate that conversation?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to something I enjoy afterwards, like my favorite snack or watching a show I like.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely way to reward yourself! Celebrating small victories is important in reinforcing those positive experiences. As we prepare for our next session, do you want to set a timeframe for this conversation goal?

User: I could try to do this by the end of the week. It gives me a little push but isn’t too far away.

Consultant: That’s a perfect timeframe! It sounds achievable. I’m excited to hear about your experience during our next session. Before we wrap up today, is there anything specific you would like to reflect on regarding your journey so far?

User: I think I’ve learned to appreciate the positives more, but I still have some underlying worries about my relationships.

Consultant: It's understandable to still have some worries, especially as you're navigating new relationships. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. We can explore those worries more in our next session. What matters is that you're moving forward and building your confidence. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about my social life and about taking these steps.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm proud of the progress you've made. Remember to focus on those positive experiences and be kind to yourself along the way. I look forward to hearing all about it next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experience since our last session. How are you feeling today?

User: Hi! I'm feeling a bit better overall. I've actually worked on some of the things we discussed, and I'm managing my anxiety better when talking to classmates. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some progress. Can you tell me more about the changes you've noticed in your anxiety levels and interactions with your classmates?

User: Well, I still get nervous sometimes, but it’s not as intense as before. I’m able to engage in conversations without feeling completely overwhelmed. I even joined a study group last week, which felt like a big step for me.

Consultant: Joining a study group is a significant achievement! It shows you're actively trying to put yourself out there. How did that experience feel for you?

User: It was a bit intimidating at first, but once we started discussing the material, I felt more comfortable. I was able to contribute my thoughts, which surprised me.

Consultant: It's impressive that you were able to express your thoughts despite feeling intimidated initially. What do you think helped you feel more at ease during that group discussion?

User: I think knowing that everyone else was nervous too helped. Plus, I was prepared with the material, which boosted my confidence.

Consultant: Preparation can indeed make a difference. It seems like you’re developing strategies to handle anxiety. As we look ahead today, what goals do you have in mind regarding your social interactions and adaptation at university?

User: I want to build stronger connections with my classmates. I’m not sure how to go about it though—sometimes I still struggle to find topics to discuss.

Consultant: That's a great goal. Building connections can feel challenging, but it’s definitely achievable. Maybe we could explore some conversation starters or strategies that align with your interests. What subjects do you enjoy discussing?

User: I love talking about books and movies, but sometimes I worry they won’t be relevant to others.

Consultant: Those are great topics! Many people enjoy discussing books and movies. You could try asking classmates about their favorite movies or any recent books they've read. This can initiate a more engaging conversation. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds doable! I think I often overthink it. I will definitely try to approach conversations that way.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! Remember, it’s okay to have fun and be curious about others’ interests too. Is there anything else that you’d like to achieve in terms of adapting to your new social environment?

User: I’d love to feel more comfortable during group presentations. I often freeze up when it’s my turn to speak.

Consultant: Group presentations can be nerve-wracking. Would you be willing to practice some techniques to manage your anxiety during those moments?

User: Yes, I’m open to that. What do you suggest?

Consultant: One technique is visualization. Before your presentation, you could take a moment to imagine yourself speaking confidently and the audience responding positively. Would you be comfortable trying this?

User: I think I could try that! It sounds like a good way to prepare mentally.

Consultant: Absolutely! Additionally, it might help to focus on the message you want to share rather than the spotlight being on you. What do you think about that approach?

User: That makes sense. Focusing on the content might ease my anxiety a bit.

Consultant: Exactly! The more you concentrate on sharing your knowledge, the less pressure you may feel. As we wrap up, let’s reflect on the progress you’ve made. What do you feel has been your biggest accomplishment in this journey so far?

User: I believe my biggest accomplishment is actually putting myself out there and joining discussions. It feels empowering.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Your willingness to step outside your comfort zone is truly commendable. Moving forward, how do you plan to maintain that momentum?

User: I’ll keep practicing these conversation strategies, and I want to continue joining study groups. It helps to feel connected.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember to be patient with yourself as you continue to grow and adapt. This will not only help you socially but also boost your confidence overall. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and the strategies we talked about today.

Consultant: My pleasure! It’s been truly rewarding to witness your growth. Just a reminder: you can always reach out if you feel you need further support in the future. You're making such great strides! 

User: I will! Thank you so much for everything. I feel much more equipped to handle my social interactions now.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Take care, and I wish you all the best in your upcoming social endeavors. 

User: Thank you! Take care!
