Consultant: Hello, Xiaofang! I'm really glad to see you today. I understand that you've been feeling anxious, especially when it comes to interacting with boys. Can you share more about what's been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been feeling really uneasy. The other day, I made eye contact with a boy I like, and it made me feel so embarrassed and anxious. Now, every time I see guys, I just feel this rush of panic and awkwardness.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way, especially when there’s someone you like involved. Can you describe what thoughts go through your mind when you feel that panic?

User: I keep thinking that I’m going to mess up the conversation or that they'll judge me. I end up imagining all these embarrassing scenarios in my head. 

Consultant: Those thoughts can feel overwhelming. If I may ask, how do those thoughts make you feel physically and emotionally in those moments?

User: I start to sweat, my heart races, and I feel like I can’t breathe. It’s like my body just reacts before I can even think about it.

Consultant: It sounds like your anxiety manifests physically, making it even harder to cope with those situations. Have you noticed if certain situations trigger these feelings more than others?

User: Definitely, it happens more in class when I need to speak or when I’m around guys I don’t know well. It feels so daunting.

Consultant: That makes sense. Being in a classroom setting where you’re expected to interact can heighten the pressure. When you feel this anxiety, what do you usually do? 

User: I try to think positive thoughts like "it's okay" or "just be yourself," but it rarely helps. I still get really worked up.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. Let’s explore those positive thoughts a bit more. How do you usually feel when you remind yourself to be positive? 

User: I guess I feel a bit better for a moment, but then the anxiety comes rushing back, and I feel like I’m not really helping myself.

Consultant: I can see how frustrating that must be. Let's try to identify some specific beliefs or assumptions behind that anxiety. Do you ever think about what might happen if you did speak to a boy or participated in class?

User: I worry they'll find me awkward or stupid, and I end up just avoiding talking at all. 

Consultant: It's common to worry about judgment, but let’s challenge that for a moment. Do you think there might be alternative explanations—ways to view those interactions more positively?

User: Maybe they wouldn’t judge me as harshly as I think. But I’m still worried about saying something embarrassing. 

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It’s natural to fear embarrassment, but let’s consider this: if a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about those same fears?

User: I’d probably tell them it’s not a big deal and that everyone feels awkward sometimes.

Consultant: Exactly! So if you can be compassionate and understanding towards a friend, perhaps you can extend that same kindness to yourself. Let’s work on shifting your perspective on these experiences. Can you think of an interaction with a boy that went better than you expected, even if it was small?

User: I remember chatting with a classmate about homework, and it wasn’t as bad as I thought. 

Consultant: That’s a great example! It shows that interactions can go well. How about we create a small experiment for our next conversation? You could aim to engage in one brief conversation with a boy, and we can discuss how it felt afterward.

User: That could be helpful! I’m nervous, but I want to try.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous, but taking that step is a positive move forward. Also, let’s practice relaxation techniques before you go into these situations. Would you be willing to try some deep breathing exercises together?

User: Yes, I think that could help me calm down.

Consultant: Wonderful! Deep breathing can be a great tool to manage your physical symptoms. Let's take a moment to practice together. Inhale deeply through your nose… hold for a moment… and now exhale slowly through your mouth. 

User: That felt a bit better.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! We can incorporate this into your daily routine. Let’s also plan to set aside some time to reflect on your experiences between sessions. How do you feel about keeping a journal to note your thoughts and feelings after interactions?

User: That sounds like a good idea. I can see how writing it down might help clarify my thoughts.

Consultant: Absolutely! Journaling can provide insight and help track your progress. We’ll review it together next time. For now, let’s summarize what we've discussed today and set some intentions for your upcoming interactions.

User: Okay, so I’ll work on having a small conversation and practice the deep breathing. I want to try to be more relaxed and not overthink things.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, it’s okay to feel anxious at times, but you have the tools to manage it. I believe you can do this. We'll check in on your progress next session. You’re making great strides, Xiaofang!

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful about trying to talk to boys now.

Consultant: It’s my pleasure! I’m here to support you, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences. Be kind to yourself, and remember, every little step counts. Until next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaofang! I'm glad you're here for our session today. Before we dive in, can you share a bit about how you've been feeling lately in relation to your studies and interactions with classmates?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really overwhelmed, especially in class. I often feel anxious when I have to talk to my classmates, and I find it really hard to concentrate. I know my grades have been slipping, and it stresses me out even more, especially with my parents expecting so much from me.

Consultant: I can see how that would be really tough for you. It sounds like the pressure from your parents, combined with your anxiety about interactions, is weighing heavily on you. Can you tell me more about what happens when you have to speak with your classmates?

User: Well, when I'm in class and someone asks me a question, I get this knot in my stomach. I start worrying about what they might think of me, and then I just freeze. I feel like everyone is watching me, and I’m just not good enough.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly stressful. It seems like those feelings of being judged and not measuring up contribute to your anxiety. Do you notice any specific thoughts going through your mind during those moments that might be enhancing your feelings of anxiety?

User: Yes, I often think things like, "What if I say something stupid?" or "They'll laugh at me." It feels like I have to be perfect all the time, or else I’ll disappoint my parents and my classmates.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very heavy and demanding. The pressure to be perfect can sometimes create a cycle of fear and anxiety, making it hard to engage in social situations. Let’s try something together. Can we work on identifying which of these thoughts are the most distressing for you? 

User: Sure, I think the thought "They'll laugh at me" really affects me. It makes me feel so vulnerable.

Consultant: Great job identifying that! Let’s challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that supports that belief? Have you actually experienced someone laughing at you when you spoke up in class?

User: Not really. I mean, I think most of my classmates are just focused on themselves. I haven't been actually laughed at, but it’s just this fear in my head.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when anxiety is involved. Since you mentioned most people are focused on themselves, does it help to realize that others might be preoccupied with their own concerns, too? 

User: Yeah, that does make sense. I guess I sometimes forget that everyone has their own worries.

Consultant: Absolutely! With that in mind, let's explore what it would be like to challenge yourself and take small steps towards speaking up. What do you think about setting tiny goals for participating in class discussions? 

User: That sounds good, but I’m still worried I can’t do it right.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel that way, but remember, the goal here isn't perfection. Instead, it's about making progress. What if you tried to answer one question in your next class? How would you feel about that?

User: I think I could try that! Although I may feel a bit nervous.

Consultant: That’s perfectly okay! Feeling nervous is a normal response. You could remind yourself that it's a learning experience, and even if it doesn't go perfectly, you're still moving forward. What strategies could you use to calm those nerves before answering?

User: Maybe I could take a few deep breaths and just focus on what I want to say rather than worrying about the outcome.

Consultant: Excellent strategy! Deep breathing can help center you. If you feel comfortable, we can also practice a short breathing exercise together before we finish up today. Would you like to do that?

User: Yes, I'd like that.

Consultant: Let’s do it! Close your eyes if you feel comfortable. Take a deep breath in for a count of four... hold for four... and breathe out for four. How does that feel? 

User: It feels calming. I think I needed that.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, you're taking steps towards change, and every little bit counts. As we wrap up today, let’s revisit your progress. What’s one takeaway you want to focus on until our next session?

User: I think I want to focus on my goal of speaking up in class, even if it’s just a little bit. I want to challenge that thought of being laughed at.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! It's all about taking those small steps. I'm really proud of you for being open about your feelings and willing to work on this. Remember, next time we can check in on how that goes. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about trying now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! You’ve shown great strength today, and I believe you can continue to make progress. Remember, I’m here to support you. We’ll talk soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaofang! It's great to see you again. I’m looking forward to our session today. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I've been struggling a bit. I still feel a lot of pressure from my parents' expectations, and it's making me feel really low and anxious. I'm also having a hard time connecting with my classmates. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by what your parents expect from you and that it’s affecting how you interact with others. Can you share more about what specific expectations feel the most burdensome right now?

User: Well, my parents think I should excel academically and be more social. They don’t really understand how hard it is for me to meet those expectations. It just feels like I can never do enough.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiaofang. It’s understandable to feel this way when there’s so much pressure to perform and connect. Can you tell me more about how these feelings affect your daily life or your interactions with your classmates?

User: I often avoid social situations because I fear judgment. It’s embarrassing sometimes when I want to speak up but can’t. My classmates seem to be more confident in their interactions, and I feel like I'm just on the outside looking in.

Consultant: It seems like this fear of judgment holds you back from engaging with your classmates, which can make the situation even more isolating. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come to mind when you think about socializing with them?

User: I usually think something like "What if they don’t like me?" or "What if I embarrass myself?" Those thoughts just make me want to retreat even more.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very challenging. Let’s try to explore them a bit. How much evidence do you have that supports these thoughts? Have you ever had a situation where things went better than you expected?

User: I guess I don’t really have strong evidence. There were times when I talked to classmates and it went fine, but I keep focusing on the negative experiences instead.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s common for negative experiences to overshadow the positive ones. What if we tried to challenge those negative thoughts together? If a friend were in your situation, what would you tell them about their thoughts or fears?

User: I would probably tell them not to worry so much and that it’s okay to make mistakes. But I find it hard to believe that for myself.

Consultant: That’s a helpful perspective! It shows that you can recognize some rational thoughts. How about we practice reframing your thoughts? Instead of thinking "What if they don’t like me?", we could try "I might find someone who shares my interests." How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds a bit easier to think that way. I like the idea of focusing on shared interests. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s also talk about small steps you can take to practice socializing. What’s a manageable situation where you could interact with a classmate? 

User: Maybe I could ask a classmate about a homework assignment or join a school club. 

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Starting with a simple conversation about homework could be a low-pressure way to practice your social skills. What do you think about role-playing that scenario together?

User: That sounds like a good idea. I think practicing will help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s role-play. You can start by approaching me as a classmate and asking about the homework. 

User: Okay... um, “Hi, I was wondering if you could help me understand the homework assignment better?” 

Consultant: That’s a great start! I might respond, “Sure! I had some questions too. What part are you struggling with?” 

User: Thank you! I think that’s easier than I imagined. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It might feel uncomfortable at first, but remember, practice can help build your confidence. 

User: Yeah, I do want to try more. I think it could really help with the pressure I feel from my parents too. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Reducing some of that pressure can happen as you become more comfortable engaging with others. What do you think will be your next step after our session today?

User: I plan to talk to someone in my class about the homework tomorrow. I’m a bit nervous, but I want to give it a try.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan, Xiaofang! It’s normal to feel nervous, but facing that anxiety is a powerful step. Remember to be kind to yourself throughout this process. 

User: Thanks! I’ll keep that in mind. I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session. Don’t hesitate to practice those new skills and for now, enjoy the experience of connecting with your classmates. 

User: I will. Thank you! 

Consultant: Before we conclude today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed and practiced. You’ve identified some of your negative thoughts and started to challenge them. You also practiced reaching out through role-play and planned your first step. How do you feel about the progress we made today? 

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. It’s nice to have these strategies to work on.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s all part of building your social confidence. Keep practicing, and I can’t wait to hear about your experiences next time. If any challenges come up, you can always reach out.

User: I will! Thanks again for everything. 

Consultant: Thank you for sharing and engaging today, Xiaofang. You’ve done some great work! Talk soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaofang! I'm happy to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I managed to participate in a group discussion during an extracurricular activity, and I received some positive feedback. But I still feel anxious about some social situations.

Consultant: That sounds like a big step forward—congratulations on participating! It’s completely normal to still feel some anxiety even with those positive experiences. Can you tell me more about what makes you feel anxious in social situations?

User: I think I worry a lot about what others will think of me. Sometimes, when I try to share my thoughts, I get really nervous and start overthinking everything.

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry about how others perceive you. Let's explore that together. When you start to feel nervous about sharing your thoughts, what kinds of thoughts go through your mind?

User: I often think that if my ideas aren’t perfect, people might judge me or think I’m not smart enough.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re putting a lot of pressure on yourself to be perfect. Can we examine this thought a bit? What evidence do you have that people will judge you harshly for sharing your ideas?

User: Well, I guess I don't really have any solid proof. It's just something I’ve feared for a long time.

Consultant: Fear of negative judgment can be quite powerful, but it often isn’t based on reality. If you were to support a friend who felt this way, what would you tell them about sharing their opinions?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay to make mistakes and that everyone has different ideas.

Consultant: That's a very compassionate perspective! Why do you think it’s easier to be kind and understanding toward others rather than yourself?

User: I suppose I hold myself to a higher standard. I just want to be good at everything I do.

Consultant: That desire for perfection can be exhausting. Let’s try to replace that pressure with a focus on progress instead. What would it look like for you to embrace the idea of “doing your best” rather than “being perfect”?

User: I think it would feel less daunting. I could focus on sharing my thoughts without worrying too much about how they’re received.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on your best effort can help you engage more freely. Last time, we discussed some strategies for participating in discussions. Have you had a chance to practice those?

User: Yes, I tried to speak up a bit more in our group. I didn’t always succeed, but I felt proud when I did.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Every little step counts. When you reflect on those moments you spoke up, how did it feel compared to when you stayed silent?

User: Speaking up felt empowering, even if it was just a little bit. I wish I could feel that way all the time.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognized that empowerment. We can work on building that feeling. How about we practice some role-play scenarios where you can respond in a group discussion? This can help you feel more prepared.

User: That sounds good! I think it might help me become more comfortable.

Consultant: Awesome! Let’s start with a scenario where someone shares an idea that you might want to comment on. I’ll play the other person, and you can practice jumping in.

User: Okay, I’ll give it a try!

Consultant: Imagine I’ve just shared a thought about a project. You can respond by agreeing or offering your perspective. Go ahead!

User: “I think that’s really interesting! I also believe...”

Consultant: Great start! How did it feel to share your thoughts just now? 

User: It felt a bit scary, but also freeing to express what I think.

Consultant: Exactly, keep embracing that feeling! Remember, each time you practice, it gets easier. What strategies do you think will help you stay calm during these discussions?

User: I could take a deep breath before speaking and remind myself that it’s okay not to be perfect.

Consultant: I love those strategies! Deep breathing can help center you, and reminding yourself of that balance takes the pressure off. How do you feel about stepping into more discussions in your group activities moving forward?

User: I feel excited! I want to keep trying, even if I feel nervous.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! You’re making significant progress. Remember, it’s okay to experience those nerves. Would you like to set some specific goals for your next group meeting?

User: Yes, I want to aim to speak up at least twice, even if it’s just sharing a quick thought.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! You’ve built the confidence to keep moving forward. When we meet next time, it’ll be wonderful to hear how you did. How do you feel about what we’ve discussed today?

User: I feel encouraged and hopeful! Thank you for helping me see things differently.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! You’ve done well today. Let's keep building that comfort in social situations. I’m looking forward to hearing more about your experiences in our next session! 

User: Me too! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaofang! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel a lot better actually. I’ve been reflecting on my recent social experiences, and I find that I’m quite proud of how I stepped out of my comfort zone to make new friends.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you gained a sense of accomplishment from those interactions. Can you tell me more about how that made you feel? 

User: Making new friends has been a fun experience. For the first time, I didn’t feel as anxious—it felt freeing to just enjoy their company and laugh with them.

Consultant: It’s great that you felt free and joyful in their company. That's an important step! How do you think this change in your feelings might impact your interactions going forward?

User: I think it will help me be more relaxed in future social situations. I might even try to engage with people more often instead of just waiting for them to approach me.

Consultant: That's a positive shift indeed! Proactively engaging others is a great way to strengthen your confidence. What methods have you considered using to continue this proactive approach?

User: Well, I’m planning to invite a couple of friends out more often. Maybe we can explore new places together or just hang out at a cafe.

Consultant: Inviting friends to explore new places sounds like a fantastic idea! It can strengthen bonds and create more memories together. Do you feel comfortable initiating those invitations?

User: Honestly, I’m a bit nervous about it. What if they’re busy or decline the invitation?

Consultant: It's natural to feel that way. Have you noticed any negative thoughts that come to mind when considering this invitation?

User: I often think that if they say no, it means they don’t like me or don’t want to spend time with me.

Consultant: I see. That thought can be quite heavy to carry. Let's challenge that for a moment. What evidence do you have that a simple decline to an invitation reflects their feelings toward you?

User: I suppose I don’t have concrete evidence. I often just jump to conclusions that they must not want to be friends if they can’t hang out.

Consultant: That’s understandable, but remember, there are many reasons someone might not be available. If a friend declines, it does not necessarily reflect their feelings about you. How could you reframe that thought when it comes up in the future?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone has their own schedules and that it doesn't mean they don't care about our friendship.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s an excellent reframe. It allows you to separate their availability from your worth as a friend. How do you feel about practicing that reframe in your future interactions?

User: I think it will help ease my anxiety. Knowing it’s not personal can take some pressure off.

Consultant: Very much so! Pressure can hinder genuine connections. Besides inviting friends, what other social strategies might you explore to keep nurturing these relationships?

User: Maybe I can join a club or participate in school activities. It might help me meet more people and build confidence.

Consultant: Joining a club sounds like a brilliant way to meet new people and engage in shared interests! What kinds of clubs or activities interest you the most?

User: I’m really interested in art and music. Perhaps I could look for an art class or a music group?

Consultant: Those are lovely choices! Engaging in something you're passionate about could enhance your enjoyment while socializing. How do you feel about setting a goal to explore some of these options this week?

User: I feel excited about that! I’ll look up some classes and events in my area.

Consultant: That's excellent to hear! Taking action steps can feel empowering. Have you thought about how you might remind yourself of this excitement when you feel nervous?

User: I could keep a journal of my feelings and experiences—writing it down could help me reflect positively on them.

Consultant: Journaling is a fantastic idea! It will give you a space to express and process your experiences. How do you think you might incorporate that into your routine?

User: I can set aside some time each weekend to write about my thoughts and any social interactions I had that week.

Consultant: Perfect! Reflecting regularly like that will reinforce your progress and keep you motivated. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you’ve learned about yourself and your social abilities?

User: I’ve learned that I can take steps to reach out and that it’s okay if people decline. I feel more confident and ready to explore social opportunities.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight! It’s evident that you’ve made great strides in building your social confidence. Moving forward, what strategies will you take to maintain this momentum?

User: I’ll continue to invite friends, explore clubs, and keep journaling. I really want to make the most of these experiences.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Embracing self-growth while being kind to yourself will go a long way. I’m pleased with the progress you’ve made. Always remember that it’s a journey and you’re doing great.

User: Thank you for your support! I feel more prepared to manage my social life now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaofang! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Remember, I’m here if you need to revisit anything. I wish you all the best in continuing your journey. Take care!

User: Thank you! I will keep everything in mind. Looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiao Fang! I'm glad to see you again for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last talk?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good. I've noticed some improvements in my ability to socialize, and my relationship with my parents has also gotten better. I feel more supported by them.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some significant progress in your social skills and in your relationship with your family. What specific changes have you noticed in your interactions with others?

User: Well, I've been able to speak up more in group settings at school. I used to stay quiet and feel anxious, but now I can share my thoughts without feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: That's an impressive achievement! Sharing your thoughts in a group is a big step forward. How did it feel when you managed to do that?

User: It felt really liberating! I was nervous at first, but once I spoke up, I realized that people were actually listening and engaging with what I said. It boosted my confidence.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It’s amazing how positive experiences can reinforce your confidence. How do you think this newfound confidence has affected your overall mood and your interactions at home?

User: At home, I feel more comfortable talking to my parents about my day and my feelings. We have better conversations now, and it feels like they understand me more.

Consultant: That's fantastic! It seems like there's a positive cycle developing, where improved social skills at school are enhancing your family dynamics as well. What would you like to focus on today as we build on these successes?

User: I want to ensure that I keep this momentum going and maybe explore other areas where I can grow. I feel good about my progress, but I want to challenge myself a bit more.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! It's great that you want to keep pushing your boundaries. What specific areas of growth are you considering? Are there any new challenges that intrigue you?

User: I'm thinking about joining a club or a group where I can meet more people and practice my social skills further. Just the idea of it makes me a bit nervous, though!

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel nervous about new challenges! Joining a group can be a great opportunity to expand your social circle. What kind of club or activity are you interested in?

User: I’m interested in joining a debate club. I believe it would help me articulate my thoughts better, but I’m also scared of public speaking.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful choice! Debate clubs can really enhance your speaking skills and boost your confidence. Let’s explore that fear of public speaking. What specifically makes you feel scared about it?

User: I worry that I’ll forget what to say or stumble over my words. I don’t want to look foolish in front of others.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those concerns. Many people share similar fears. When you think about it, what evidence do you have that speaking in public will lead to negative outcomes?

User: I guess I don’t have any solid evidence. It’s mostly just my imagination running wild with worst-case scenarios.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! Often, our fears can be rooted in exaggerated thoughts. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them to do regarding their fear of public speaking?

User: I would probably tell them to practice and remind them that everyone makes mistakes sometimes. No one judges you too harshly.

Consultant: Exactly! You’d offer a supportive perspective. How about we think of ways you can practice and remind yourself of that support when you join the debate club?

User: I think practicing with friends or family could help. Maybe even starting small by sharing my thoughts in smaller group settings first.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Gradually exposing yourself to speaking in smaller groups can help build your confidence for larger settings. How do you feel about creating a plan for that practice?

User: That sounds good. I can set specific goals, like sharing opinions during dinners or in weekend gatherings.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Setting specific, realistic goals can make the process feel more manageable. What other support do you think you might need as you embark on this journey?

User: I think regular check-ins with you might help. I want to stay accountable and discuss any challenges I face along the way.

Consultant: I’m glad you brought that up! Regular check-ins can certainly keep you motivated and help address challenges as they arise. Would you like to establish a timeline for these goals?

User: Yes, I would! I could aim to speak up at least once during dinners each week and then join the debate club in a month.

Consultant: That’s a great timeline! It allows for steady, manageable progress. How will you feel after achieving these goals and maintaining that progress?

User: I think I would feel really accomplished and proud of myself. It would also lessen my anxiety about public speaking.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s an empowering feeling to achieve your goals. Remember, every small step counts. As we conclude today’s session, how would you summarize the progress you’ve made and your goals moving forward?

User: I’ve made great strides in my social skills and family relationships. I want to tackle my fear of public speaking by joining the debate club and practicing speaking up more. I feel ready to challenge myself!

Consultant: That’s an excellent summary! I’m really proud of how far you’ve come, and I believe in your ability to take these steps. Keep in mind all of the support we’ve discussed. You’ve got this! I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.

User: Thank you! I feel more confident about moving forward, and I’ll definitely keep you updated. I appreciate your support!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Fang! Take care, and I look forward to our next session.
