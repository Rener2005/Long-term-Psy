Consultant: Hello, Zhang. I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I feel really overwhelmed by my thesis. It's like I can't sit down to write without feeling anxious. I'm stressed because I need to publish something for school, and I also want to apply for a PhD.

Consultant: It sounds like there's a lot on your plate right now. You mentioned feeling anxious and overwhelmed—could you share more about what specifically triggers those feelings when you think about your thesis?

User: Whenever I think about starting my thesis, I get this knot in my stomach. I can't seem to focus, and instead, I find myself scrolling through my phone or watching TV. It makes me feel even worse afterward because I'm not making any progress.

Consultant: I see. So, the thought of working on your thesis leads to anxiety, which in turn makes you want to avoid it by distracting yourself. Let's talk about those thoughts when you feel this way. What comes to your mind when you think about starting your thesis?

User: I think I won't be able to do it well enough. It has to be perfect, and I fear that my ideas aren't good enough to be published.

Consultant: It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to achieve perfection. This can create a cycle of avoidance when you're faced with tasks that feel overwhelming. Have you noticed how this belief about needing to be perfect affects your emotional state?

User: Yes, it definitely makes me anxious. I feel like if I don’t do it perfectly, I’m failing. And then I just avoid it completely, which adds to my stress.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel anxious about wanting to meet high standards, but those beliefs can be quite limiting. What evidence do you have that says you must be perfect in your thesis for it to be valuable?

User: I don't really have any direct evidence. I think it’s just something I've always felt. My family has high expectations, and I want to live up to them.

Consultant: That’s quite a common experience—feeling the weight of expectations can be challenging. If you think about it, would you apply the same standards to a friend in your position? How would you encourage them?

User: I would probably tell them that doing their best is enough and that it’s okay to make mistakes while learning.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to show yourself the same kindness and understanding that you would offer others. What if we tried to reframe your thoughts about your thesis? Instead of thinking it has to be perfect, could we think about it as a valuable learning process?

User: Yes, I can see how that could help. But what if I still struggle with it later?

Consultant: Struggling is a natural part of the process, and it doesn’t define your worth or abilities. Every step, even the difficult ones, contributes to your growth. Let’s consider some small, manageable goals you could set for your writing sessions. What’s one small step you could take towards working on your thesis?

User: Maybe I could set a timer for 25 minutes and just write whatever comes to mind without worrying about perfection.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Focusing on just writing freely can help reduce that pressure. After the timer goes off, you could take a short break. How do you feel about trying this out?

User: I feel a bit relieved thinking about it. It seems less daunting.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s all about taking those small steps. Also, how about developing a routine to help you get started? Something simple, like dedicating the same time each day for your writing?

User: Yes, I think establishing a routine could help me build the habit of writing again. I haven't done that in a while.

Consultant: Establishing routines can really reinforce positive behaviors. You mentioned feeling guilty about screen time—how can you balance that with the time you want to dedicate to your thesis?

User: I could limit my phone time and plan specific breaks where I can relax with my phone after a writing session.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! It ensures you get a chance to unwind while also making progress on your thesis. Remember, it’s about balance. Since we’ve talked about some strategies today, which one resonates with you the most to start applying after our session?

User: I think focusing on small writing sessions feels manageable. I’ll also try to change my mindset about perfection.

Consultant: That sounds fantastic, Zhang! Just remember to be gentle with yourself during this process. Growth takes time, and it's okay to make adjustments along the way. 

User: Thank you. I appreciate your understanding. It feels good to have a plan and not just feel lost.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m here to support you on this journey. As you work on these changes, keep checking in with yourself about how you’re feeling. Next time, we can discuss what went well and any challenges you faced.

User: Sounds good. I look forward to our next session to share my progress!

Consultant: Me too! I believe in your ability to navigate this. Take care until we meet again, and remember this is a process. You’re doing great!

User: Thank you! I’ll try to keep that in mind. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. Honestly, I'm still feeling the pressure of writing my thesis. I keep thinking I'm not good enough, and it’s really affecting my motivation. 

Consultant: I can see how that feeling of inadequacy can weigh heavily on you. Let’s explore this further. What specific thoughts do you have when you sit down to write? 

User: When I try to write, I often think things like "I'll never be able to do this" or "I'm just not smart enough." It makes me feel overwhelmed and want to give up.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really tough. It seems like they create a strong sense of frustration and defeat. Can you tell me more about how these thoughts impact your emotions and actions when you’re working on your thesis? 

User: Well, they make me feel anxious and even a bit depressed. Sometimes, I just end up scrolling through my phone for hours instead of writing. I feel guilty afterward and it just keeps going in circles. 

Consultant: It sounds like there's a cycle happening—negative thoughts leading to anxiety, which then affects your ability to focus and write. In this case, let’s look at those thoughts more closely. Do you think there’s any evidence to support the idea that you're ‘not smart enough’? 

User: I guess not. I mean, I’ve done well in my other classes. It's just that the thesis feels so much more important and stressful.

Consultant: That’s a crucial insight! It seems like your fear is tied more to the weight of this project rather than your actual abilities. What if you reframed that thought to something like, "I can tackle this challenge step by step"? 

User: That sounds better, but it’s hard to convince myself. I feel like I should be able to do it all at once.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way, especially when faced with a big task. Perfectionism can be paralyzing. Let’s try to break this down into smaller, more achievable goals. What if we set a specific, realistic writing goal for today? 

User: Maybe I could aim to write just one paragraph? 

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! Focusing on just one paragraph can help reduce that pressure. When you achieve it, you'll feel a sense of accomplishment without the weight of perfectionism. How does that feel? 

User: It feels manageable. I like the idea of starting small. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Before you begin, let’s also identify any potential obstacles that might emerge while writing. What might distract you or trigger those feelings of inadequacy? 

User: I think my phone will be a big distraction. I often check it out of habit when I feel stuck.

Consultant: That's a common challenge. Would you be willing to put your phone away during your writing time? Perhaps even setting a timer for focus sessions could help you stay on task. 

User: Yes, I can try that. I’ll put my phone in another room and use a timer. 

Consultant: Fantastic! This way, you can keep your focus on writing without distractions. Let’s check back on how that goes in our next session. Remember, the goal is progress, not perfection. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful about making a start now. 

Consultant: You're welcome! It's great to hear that you're feeling more hopeful. Let's also reflect on something positive you can do for yourself today after you finish that paragraph. 

User: Maybe I could treat myself to some time watching my favorite show as a reward? 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful way to celebrate your achievement! Balancing work and relaxation is important. Let’s keep building on this momentum together. 

User: Yes, I want to work on changing these thoughts and feeling better about my progress. 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! We’ll keep identifying those negative thoughts and practice replacing them with constructive ones. By acknowledging your efforts, you’ll gradually build confidence in yourself. 

User: I hope so. It’s just hard to let go of that “I’m not enough” mindset. 

Consultant: Absolutely, it takes time to shift deeply rooted beliefs. But each small step, like today’s paragraph, brings you closer to a healthier outlook. Let's commit to this gradual process together. 

User: I’m ready to try. Talking about it helps a lot. 

Consultant: I’m really pleased to hear that. Keep in mind, I’m here to support you through this journey. In our next session, we can discuss any new thoughts or challenges that arise. 

User: Okay, sounds good! I’ll work on it and see how it goes. 

Consultant: Looking forward to hearing about your progress, Zhang. Remember, it’s all about taking one step at a time. You've got this!

User: Thank you! I feel a bit lighter after our chat. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear. Keep nurturing that positivity, and we'll continue building on it together in our future sessions. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Zhang! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been okay, but I'm still struggling with my paper. There are moments when I feel a bit more motivated, but then I get really anxious about not meeting my expectations.

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing a push-pull between motivation and anxiety. Can you tell me more about what drives this anxiety?

User: Well, I worry a lot about not finishing it on time and disappointing myself. I just can't seem to get started, and then I feel guilty about wasting time.

Consultant: That guilt must feel quite heavy, especially when you're striving to meet your goals. Can we explore how that guilt influences your feelings when trying to study?

User: Yes, definitely. The guilt makes me procrastinate even more, so I end up scrolling through my phone or watching TV instead of working. But I feel terrible afterwards.

Consultant: It's a tough cycle, isn't it? The guilt leads to avoidance, which then increases your anxiety. What thoughts go through your mind when you avoid working on your paper?

User: I keep thinking that I'm not good enough or that I will never finish. I also tell myself that I'll never enjoy studying again.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite overwhelming. Let's break them down a bit. What evidence do you have that supports those beliefs about not being good enough?

User: I guess I don't have strong evidence. I've done well in my studies before, but it just feels different now.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way when facing a big task. If you were advising a friend in this situation, what would you tell them about their abilities?

User: I would probably tell them that they have succeeded before and that it's okay to ask for help. 

Consultant: That's a compassionate perspective! It seems you recognize your past successes. How can we apply that understanding to your current situation?

User: Maybe I could remind myself of my achievements to combat those negative thoughts when I feel stuck?

Consultant: Absolutely! That sounds like a great strategy. Would you like to create a list of your past accomplishments together to remind you of what you're capable of?

User: Yes, I think that might help. 

Consultant: Great! Let's start with small wins. Can you name a few achievements from your academic journey that you're proud of?

User: I completed a tough project last semester, and I received good feedback from my professor. Also, I managed to keep my grades up while juggling other commitments.

Consultant: Those are significant accomplishments! How does it feel to acknowledge those successes?

User: It feels nice. I almost forgot about them in my current struggle.

Consultant: That's understandable. It's easy to lose sight of our strengths during challenging times. Now, let's talk about setting a realistic daily study plan. What do you think you could commit to each day regarding your studies?

User: Maybe one or two hours of focused study, along with breaks in between. 

Consultant: That sounds manageable! How about we also incorporate small rewards for completing each study session? What would motivate you to stick to your plan?

User: I love coffee, so maybe I could treat myself to a nice cup after finishing my study hours.

Consultant: A perfect incentive! How do you think having this plan and reward system would impact your motivation levels?

User: I think it might make studying feel less daunting and more enjoyable. 

Consultant: I believe so too! Now, regarding those moments of uncertainty, have you thought about any specific situations where you feel anxious when studying?

User: Yes, I often get very anxious when I sit down to work on my paper because I feel I should have it all figured out already.

Consultant: That kind of pressure can be extremely challenging. How can we reframe this expectation to make it more realistic and manageable for you?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it's okay to take it one step at a time and that I don't have to get everything perfect right away.

Consultant: Yes, embracing a more gradual approach can lessen that pressure! What’s the first step you want to take towards your paper?

User: I think I will start by outlining my ideas before writing the actual draft.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent place to begin! How do you feel about setting a specific time to focus on your outline?

User: I can set aside time tomorrow morning for that. 

Consultant: Wonderful! As we wrap up today's session, let's take a moment to reflect. You’ve created a solid plan and have a few strategies to manage your thoughts and reward yourself. How do you feel about these changes?

User: I feel hopeful. I think I’m starting to regain a sense of control over my work again.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear, Zhang! I'm glad you're feeling more hopeful. Remember, it’s all about progress. When we meet next, we can check in on how your plan has been working, and we can continue from there.

User: Yes, I look forward to it. Thank you so much for your help today.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m here for you every step of the way. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Tingxia! I'm glad you're back for our session. How have you been feeling since our last discussion about improving your routine and study efficiency?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I've been working on my routine and trying to focus more on my studies. There are still days when I feel overwhelmed, but I think I’m gradually making progress.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re noticing some improvements! Can you share more about what specific changes you've implemented in your routine and how they’ve impacted your emotional state or productivity?

User: Well, I started setting specific times for studying and going to bed earlier. I've also tried to take breaks when I notice I'm getting distracted. On some days, it works well, but other days, I still struggle to stay focused.

Consultant: It sounds like you're actively trying to create a structure for yourself, which is a positive step. When you say you struggle to stay focused, what thoughts or feelings tend to arise during those moments?

User: I often think things like "I should be studying more" or "I’m wasting my time." It makes me feel guilty, which just adds more pressure and makes it even harder to concentrate.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really challenging. They sound quite harsh and can certainly contribute to your anxiety. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit—how much evidence do you think supports the idea that you’re “wasting your time” when you take breaks or don’t study as much?

User: I guess not much. I know breaks can help recharge my focus, but I still think I should be more disciplined with my study hours.

Consultant: It's common to feel that way, but recognizing that breaks can enhance productivity is important. If a friend were in your situation, what advice do you think you would give them about balancing work and rest?

User: I would probably tell them it's okay to take breaks and that they shouldn't be so hard on themselves, especially if they’re trying to make improvements.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective to have! It seems you are capable of offering yourself the same kindness and understanding you would provide to a friend. How could you incorporate that mindset into your own study routine?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it's okay to take breaks and validate my efforts instead of just focusing on results. I suppose I could even write down positive affirmations to help myself stay on track.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Writing down affirmations can serve as a helpful reminder that progress takes time. Let’s discuss some specific affirmations you might find helpful when you start feeling guilty about taking breaks.

User: How about something like, “Taking breaks helps me recharge, and I deserve rest”? 

Consultant: That’s a great affirmation! It promotes self-compassion and reminds you of the importance of rest. How do you feel about incorporating such affirmations into your daily routine, perhaps before you start studying?

User: I think that could help! It might set a more positive tone for my study sessions. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Additionally, as you're adjusting your study habits, what strategies do you think you could apply to gradually increase the complexity of your academic tasks while maintaining that balance you’re striving for?

User: I think I could set smaller, manageable goals within my projects. For example, instead of trying to write a whole section of my paper in one go, I could aim to write a paragraph or an outline.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Breaking tasks into smaller chunks can ease the pressure and make it feel more achievable. How do you think establishing these smaller goals might help improve your focus and motivation?

User: It could make the tasks feel less daunting. I think I’d be less likely to get overwhelmed, and I would feel a sense of accomplishment after completing each small goal.

Consultant: Exactly! Celebrating those small achievements can significantly boost your motivation. As we move forward, let's focus on implementing these strategies consistently. What steps can you take this week to start applying these ideas?

User: I will create a study schedule with smaller goals, and I’ll also write down some affirmations to remind myself during my breaks.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! As we wrap up today, how are you feeling about your ability to maintain this positive momentum in your studies?

User: I feel hopeful. With these strategies, I believe I can regain more control over my studies and approach my tasks with a more positive mindset.

Consultant: I’m really pleased to hear that, Zhang Tingxia! You've made some significant progress, and it’s inspiring to see your openness to these challenges. Remember to be kind to yourself along the way. When we meet again, I’d love to hear about how these strategies worked for you and any new insights you might have gained.

User: Thank you! I will definitely look forward to our next session and share how things go!

Consultant: You’re welcome! Take care, and I’m excited to hear about your experiences in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello Zhang! I'm really glad to see you today. It sounds like you've made some positive changes since our last session. Can you share how you’ve been feeling about your studies recently?

User: Hello! Yes, I have been feeling a bit better. I’m more in control of my study routine now. I’ve managed to talk with my supervisor more openly, which really helps. However, I still want to find ways to challenge myself.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Building that relationship with your supervisor is definitely a step in the right direction. When you think about challenging yourself academically, what specific goals are you considering?

User: I was thinking about tackling more complex topics for my thesis. I want to push myself, but sometimes I worry about not being able to handle it.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to have those worries when stepping out of your comfort zone. Let’s explore that fear a bit. What thoughts come to mind when you think about taking on these more complex topics?

User: I often think that I might not understand them or that I’ll fall behind my peers. Sometimes I feel that I'm not as capable as others.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like there are some self-doubts influencing your feelings. Can you identify any specific thoughts that lead to these feelings of inadequacy?

User: I often tell myself, "What if I’m just not smart enough?" and then I feel anxious about starting.

Consultant: That kind of thinking can be really tough to navigate. Let’s challenge that thought. Is there evidence to support the idea that you’re not smart enough? Or have you had experiences that suggest otherwise?

User: Well, I have received some positive feedback from my supervisor, and I did well on my last assignment. I guess I do have some evidence to contradict that thought.

Consultant: Exactly! Those are important successes that show your capability. If a friend of yours was feeling this way, what would you advise them to think instead?

User: I would tell them to trust their abilities and remember their past achievements.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a supportive perspective! Let’s try to apply that to your own situation. What alternative thinking can you replace “What if I’m just not smart enough?” with?

User: Maybe I could think, “I have succeeded before, and I can tackle difficult topics with effort and support.”

Consultant: That's a much more empowering thought! By recognizing your past successes, you're building a strong foundation. How do you feel about using this alternative thought when those doubts creep in?

User: I feel more hopeful about it. I think it will help me stay focused and motivated.

Consultant: That’s great to hear, Zhang! Now let’s talk about practical steps. What are some specific actions you can take to gradually approach those more complex topics?

User: I could start by breaking them down into smaller sections and setting weekly goals. I can also reach out to my supervisor for guidance.

Consultant: Those sound like effective strategies. Breaking tasks into manageable pieces often reduces anxiety. How about scheduling some time each week to assess your progress and adjust your approach if needed?

User: Yes, that would help keep me accountable for my goals.

Consultant: Perfect! And how do you plan to keep yourself motivated throughout this process?

User: Maybe I can reward myself for completing each section or even share my progress with a friend.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Sharing your milestones with someone can create a supportive environment. It sounds like you’re building a strong plan. How do you feel about the progress you've made so far in this session?

User: I feel more confident and equipped with tools to manage my thoughts better. It's really reassuring.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what strategies you've learned that you might use in the future to maintain this momentum.

User: I will definitely challenge negative thoughts and break down my bigger tasks. Also, sharing my progress with my friend will help.

Consultant: Excellent! Those are solid strategies. Remember, you’ve made great strides, and I’m confident in your ability to continue this journey. If things ever feel overwhelming, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm looking forward to our next session to hear all about your progress. Take care, Zhang!

User: Thank you! I will. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang Tingxia! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty good actually. I am more confident about my thesis now and have managed to collaborate well with my advisor and classmates.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’ve been feeling more confident and that your collaboration has improved. Can you share what specific changes or strategies have contributed to this progress?

User: I’ve been sticking to a more structured study plan and limiting my phone use during study sessions. It’s made a big difference in how I manage my time and focus.

Consultant: A structured study plan sounds like a solid strategy. How has that affected your overall mood and motivation toward your thesis work?

User: I feel less overwhelmed now. Having a plan helps me stay on track, and when I complete my tasks, I feel accomplished, which keeps my motivation up.

Consultant: That sense of accomplishment is really important. It sounds like you are building a positive reinforcement cycle. Have there been any obstacles or challenges that you've faced while trying to maintain this routine?

User: Sometimes I still struggle with distractions. On particularly tough days, I find myself slipping back into old habits, like procrastinating or spending too much time on my phone.

Consultant: It’s natural to experience some setbacks. Let's explore those tough days further. What thoughts or feelings come up for you when you find yourself distracted and procrastinating?

User: I usually feel guilty and frustrated with myself when I don’t stick to my plan. It’s like I’m letting myself down, and that makes me even less motivated.

Consultant: I understand that feeling of guilt can be quite heavy. When you notice those thoughts, do you find that they affect your emotional state and your ability to get back on track?

User: Absolutely! It’s like a vicious cycle. The more I feel guilty, the harder it is to focus, and then I keep getting more behind, which amplifies my anxiety.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult. Let’s take a moment to challenge those thoughts. What evidence do you have that you’re letting yourself down? Are there any positive aspects of your progress that you might overlook in those moments?

User: I guess I've made quite a bit of progress, and my grades are actually good this semester. I just tend to focus on the slip-ups instead of the achievements.

Consultant: That’s a valuable realization! Celebrating your achievements, no matter how small, can really help counteract feelings of guilt. What could be a manageable way for you to acknowledge your successes regularly?

User: Maybe setting aside a few minutes to reflect on what I’ve accomplished at the end of each week could help. I could write them down to remind myself.

Consultant: Writing down your accomplishments sounds like an excellent idea! It can serve as a positive reminder of your progress and keep you motivated. How do you feel about implementing that next week?

User: I think that would really help my mindset. I’m willing to give it a try.

Consultant: Fantastic! You're taking proactive steps, and that’s commendable. As we think about long-term strategies, what other supports can we identify to help you maintain your balance and motivation in the upcoming months?

User: I could reach out to my peers more often when I’m feeling stuck or anxious. Maybe discussing our challenges could be helpful.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Sharing experiences with peers can provide support and perspective. Is there a specific time you’d like to set up to ensure you reach out regularly?

User: Perhaps scheduling a weekly study group would be beneficial—incentives to be accountable to others.

Consultant: Setting up a study group could provide both community support and accountability. It seems like you're building a solid framework to keep your motivation high. Is there anything else you'd like to reflect on before we wrap up today?

User: I feel good about these plans. I think just being aware of my feelings and actions will help me keep moving forward.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. Awareness is a powerful tool, and you've made impressive strides. Before we conclude today, let’s summarize the key strategies you’ll implement moving forward.

User: I’ll keep a journal of my accomplishments, reach out to my peers regularly, and maintain my structured study plan. 

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies. Remember, it’s okay to have off days; what matters is how you regroup and move forward. You're making great progress, and I believe you’ll continue to do so.

User: Thank you! I feel more at ease knowing I have these strategies in mind.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of how far you’ve come. If any challenges arise, remember that I’m here to support you. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. See you next time!
