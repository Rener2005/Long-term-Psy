Consultant: Hello, Yan Yan! I'm really glad you’re here today. I’d love to hear about what’s been on your mind lately. How have you been feeling?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling quite down, to be honest. Since coming to university, I’m finding it really hard to adjust. I feel quite lonely and my parents want me to stay at school, but I just wish I could see them. It’s been tough.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of emotions right now, especially with the feelings of loneliness and the pressure of adjusting to a new environment. Can you tell me more about how this loneliness is affecting you day-to-day?

User: Well, I hardly talk to my classmates, which makes things feel even more isolating. I don’t have the confidence to engage in conversations. Overall, I just feel lost and not really interested in anything.

Consultant: That makes sense—feeling alone and struggling to connect with others can really impact your emotional well-being. If you could describe what would feel different for you in your daily life, what would that look like?

User: I guess I want to actually enjoy my time at college and make friends. I want to feel comfortable talking to people and not feel so anxious all the time.

Consultant: That’s a positive goal! Working on feeling more secure in social situations and reducing anxiety is definitely achievable. Let’s explore what thoughts go through your mind when you’re in these social situations. What do you usually think when you feel nervous about talking to someone?

User: I often think that I might say something silly or they won’t want to talk to me. Sometimes I just freeze up and don’t know how to start a conversation.

Consultant: Those thoughts can certainly contribute to feeling anxious. It seems like there's a fear of judgment involved. If a friend were in your position, how do you think you would encourage them to approach a conversation with someone new?

User: I guess I’d tell them to just be themselves and that it's okay to make mistakes. But I don’t seem to apply that advice to myself.

Consultant: That’s a valuable perspective! You already possess that understanding; we just need to find a way to have you apply it to your situation. What evidence do you have that people would judge you harshly if you made a mistake in a conversation?

User: I don't really have any strong evidence. It's just a fear I have. Most of the time, people are friendly.

Consultant: It seems like there’s a gap between your fears and the reality of how people often behave. Would it be helpful for you to practice some strategies that might reduce this anxiety in conversations?

User: Yes! I really want to try that.

Consultant: Great! One approach could be to start with small interactions. For instance, you could make brief comments or ask questions in a casual setting. How does that idea resonate with you?

User: It sounds manageable. I think I could handle small conversations. I'm just worried about what to say.

Consultant: Understandable! A simple opener, like a compliment or a question about classwork, can work well. What interests do you have that could serve as conversation starters?

User: I enjoy reading and movies. Maybe I could mention a book I've liked or ask about what they’re currently watching.

Consultant: Those are excellent topics! Sharing something you like can draw in conversation naturally. What if you set a small goal for yourself, like starting one conversation per week with a classmate? How does that sound?

User: That actually sounds doable. I think I could try that.

Consultant: Wonderful! You’re making a plan, and that’s a great step toward building your confidence. How about we think of ways to celebrate even small successes when you achieve this goal?

User: I could treat myself to something nice, like a favorite snack or some time off to read.

Consultant: That’s a lovely idea! Rewarding yourself can reinforce your efforts. Have you thought about how you might cope when feelings of anxiety arise, even when you’re trying to connect?

User: I haven't really thought about that. Maybe I could take some deep breaths before approaching someone.

Consultant: Taking deep breaths is an excellent technique! It helps center yourself before engaging. Would you like to try a brief breathing exercise now to practice?

User: Sure, I’d like that.

Consultant: Let’s take a moment. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a count of three, and exhale slowly through your mouth. Let’s repeat this a couple of times. How does that feel?

User: It feels refreshing. I think I could do this before talking to someone.

Consultant: That's great to hear! This is a powerful tool you can use. Let’s keep this practice in our conversations moving forward. Looking ahead, are there any worries you have about trying these new interactions?

User: Just the usual fear of judgment and failure, I guess. I don’t want to embarrass myself.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable; it’s normal to have those worries. Remember, every effort you make is a step toward progress. How would you remind yourself that it’s okay to not be perfect in those moments?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that everyone makes mistakes and that each conversation is a learning experience.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a very nurturing mindset to adopt. By viewing each interaction as a chance to learn rather than a test, you create space for growth and acceptance. 

User: I like that perspective. I’ll definitely try to remind myself of that.

Consultant: Fantastic! I believe you can take these steps and learn from your experiences. As we wind down our session today, what’s one key takeaway you've gained that you would like to remember?

User: I think it’s that it’s okay to not be perfect in social situations and that I can practice gradually.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant takeaway! Carry that with you as you continue your journey. Remember, I’m here to support you. If you ever feel overwhelmed or need to talk, please don’t hesitate to reach out. How are you feeling as we wrap up today?

User: I feel a bit better, actually. I appreciate having someone to talk to about this.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that, Yan Yan. You’ve shown a lot of courage today in sharing your feelings and exploring new strategies. Keep believing in yourself, and I look forward to our next conversation!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yanyan! I'm really glad you're here today. I understand you've been feeling more anxious and questioning your social skills lately. Can you share a bit more about what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been struggling a lot recently. I tried joining some school activities to make friends and feel less lonely, but I just couldn't connect with anyone. It made me doubt my social abilities even more.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like putting yourself out there in those activities didn’t go as you hoped, which increased your feelings of doubt. How did that make you feel about yourself?

User: I felt disappointed and anxious. I thought that maybe I just wasn’t good at socializing, and it’s really frustrating because I want to connect with others and feel accepted.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable, Yanyan. Wanting to connect and feeling frustrated when it doesn’t happen can be really tough. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts run through your mind in those moments of doubt?

User: I often think things like "I’m too awkward," or "Nobody wants to talk to me." These thoughts just make me feel stuck and more anxious.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like those thoughts are quite harsh on yourself. Have you noticed how those thoughts impact your emotions or behaviors in social situations?

User: Yes, when I think like that, I just want to avoid social situations altogether because I feel so anxious. I’d rather stay away than face the possibility of failure.

Consultant: That avoidance can feel like a protective measure, but it often ends up reinforcing those negative thoughts. Let’s think together—is there a different way you might interpret your experiences in social situations?

User: I guess I could try to see it as a learning experience instead of a failure. But it’s hard to change my mindset when I’m feeling anxious.

Consultant: It is indeed challenging, especially when anxiety kicks in. What evidence do you have to support that harsh self-criticism? Are there moments when you've successfully interacted with others?

User: Sometimes I do have good conversations, but I tend to ignore those and focus on the times things didn’t go well.

Consultant: That’s an important insight! It seems like you're filtering out the positive experiences. How about we work on recognizing those moments and balancing them with the negative thoughts? 

User: That sounds like a good idea, but I still find it hard to believe in my strengths. 

Consultant: It’s totally natural to struggle with that. What if we created a list together of your strengths and positive interactions? This might help you challenge those negative beliefs.

User: Okay, I can do that. I know I’m a good listener, but it’s hard to remember that during social events.

Consultant: Great start! Being a good listener is a valuable skill. Perhaps in social situations, you could focus on listening and asking questions, as it might help take some pressure off yourself.

User: That could work! If I’m listening, I won’t have to worry so much about what to say next.

Consultant: Exactly! Engaging with others through listening might help you feel more comfortable. Have you considered any specific social situations where you could practice this?

User: I could try this in study groups since I know I'll have to interact with my classmates, but I still feel a wave of anxiety thinking about it.

Consultant: It's normal to feel anxious about upcoming interactions. Let's take it step by step. How about setting one small goal for that study group, like initiating a conversation with one person?

User: I could try that. Just saying "hi" to someone sounds manageable. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! Starting small can help build your confidence. What do you think you might say to start that conversation?

User: I could ask about the topic we’re studying or if they understand the assignment. 

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a great icebreaker. How do you think you’ll feel after accomplishing that small goal?

User: I hope I’ll feel proud and maybe a bit more confident. It would be nice to feel that way.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing that achievement, no matter how small, is crucial for building your confidence over time. Would you like to plan how to celebrate that success afterward?

User: I could treat myself to something I enjoy, like watching a movie. That would motivate me.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely idea! Associating positive experiences with your achievements can reinforce your confidence. How do you feel about taking these steps?

User: I feel more hopeful. This conversation actually made me realize I can take control of the situation instead of just feeling anxious.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Yanyan! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Let's check in again next time to see how these steps went for you.

User: Thank you! I look forward to it. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! I'm proud of your willingness to tackle these challenges. Remember, this is just the beginning of your journey. Let’s wrap up today, and we can continue to build on this next time. 

User: Yes, I feel good about that. Thank you for your help! 

Consultant: It’s my pleasure! Take care, and I’ll see you next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yanyan! I'm so glad you could join me today. I remember you mentioned feeling anxious about expressing yourself in group activities. How has that been for you recently?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been feeling pretty disappointed. I participated in a group study session, but I didn’t speak up at all. It made me feel even more self-doubtful and I worry about my ability to express myself in front of others.

Consultant: It sounds really tough to feel that way, especially in a learning environment. You want to build your confidence in expressing yourself. Could you share what thoughts went through your mind during the group study session?

User: I kept thinking that if I spoke, people would judge me. I was afraid of saying something wrong, or that no one would listen. It felt safer to stay silent.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s natural to worry about judgment, but it seems like this silence is reinforcing your self-doubt. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit more. What evidence do you have that people would judge you negatively?

User: I guess I don’t have any solid proof. It’s just a fear I have. I know deep down that it might not be true, but it’s hard to shake it off.

Consultant: That’s a strong insight, Yanyan! Recognizing that your belief may not be based on solid evidence is an important step. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about their fears of judgment?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and it’s okay to express opinions. I think most people are just focused on their own thoughts.

Consultant: Exactly! When we put ourselves in someone else's shoes, it often becomes clearer that our fears might not be as valid as they seem. What if we practiced some techniques to help you feel more comfortable speaking up in future group settings?

User: I’d like that! I want to feel more confident. What do you suggest?

Consultant: We could try role-playing situations where you might normally hesitate to speak. This could help you practice how to express your ideas. Would you be open to that?

User: Yes, I think that could be helpful.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start with a simple scenario: imagine you’re in a study group discussing a text. How would you introduce your thoughts about it?

User: I guess I’d start with something like, “I found this part interesting because...”

Consultant: That’s a nice start! It’s friendly and opens the floor for discussion. Now, how do you feel saying that out loud?

User: It feels a bit daunting, but also exciting. It would definitely take some practice.

Consultant: Totally understandable! How about we try saying that out loud together? You could start with that introduction, and I’ll respond as a teammate.

User: Okay, here goes. “I found this part interesting because…” (pauses) I struggled to finish it.

Consultant: That’s alright, Yanyan! Just speaking up shows you’re taking steps towards overcoming that fear. Let’s imagine what the group might respond with—what if they said, “That’s a great point! Can you elaborate on that?”

User: I’d feel so relieved if they responded positively! 

Consultant: Absolutely! Positive feedback can really boost your confidence. Let’s try another scenario where someone might ask your opinion directly. Imagine a colleague says, “What do you think about this topic?” How would you answer?

User: I could say, “I think it’s important because…” I can see how to connect my thoughts better now.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Yanyan! The more you practice, the easier it will become. How do you feel about actively looking for these opportunities in your next group session?

User: I feel more motivated to try. It's helpful to practice and have a plan.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Can we set a small goal for your next session? Perhaps aim to share at least one thought?

User: Yes, I like that idea. Sharing one thought feels manageable.

Consultant: Excellent choice! And I want you to remember all the positive feedback you might receive. It’s a step towards building confidence. How are you feeling about all of this?

User: Honestly, I’m feeling hopeful. It’s nice to practice, and I’m starting to believe I can do this.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization, Yanyan! Building this hope will serve you well. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed and how you can continue to build on this progress.

User: Okay! We talked about my fears and practiced how to express myself in groups. I’m going to aim to share at least one thought next time.

Consultant: Perfect summary! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made today. Remember, each small step will help reinforce your confidence. Take note of the positive responses you receive, and keep practicing. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time!

User: Thank you! I’ll definitely keep you updated.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yanyan! I'm glad to see you today. Last time we talked, you had some positive experiences participating in class discussions. How are you feeling about your studies and social interactions now?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling quite good actually. After speaking up in class and getting positive feedback, my anxiety about studying has decreased a lot. But I still struggle a bit with interacting with others outside of class.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear about your progress in class! It’s a big step to receive positive feedback. Regarding your interactions outside of class, can you tell me more about what makes you struggle there?

User: I think I feel nervous when I try to approach people. I'm afraid they may not respond positively or think I'm awkward. It's easier for me to speak in a structured classroom setting.

Consultant: It makes sense to feel nervous about approaching others, especially when you have a worry about their reactions. What do you think would help you feel more comfortable in those social situations?

User: Maybe if I had some icebreakers or topics to talk about? I get so anxious that I often don’t know what to say.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Having some topics or questions in mind can lessen anxiety. Can you recall a social interaction where you felt more at ease? What happened, and what did you talk about?

User: Well, there was one time when I chatted with a classmate about our favorite movies. It felt natural, and we both laughed a lot. I remember feeling more confident then.

Consultant: It sounds like that conversation flowed well and you felt a connection! What do you think made that interaction different from others where you felt anxious?

User: I guess it was about a topic I’m passionate about, and my classmate was responsive and engaged too. I think when the other person shows interest, it helps me.

Consultant: That's insightful! Engaging in topics that excite you can indeed create a more natural flow in conversations. What if you make a list of a few topics you're passionate about to draw upon when initiating conversations? 

User: That could work! If I practice those topics, I might feel less anxious about what to say.

Consultant: Exactly! It can serve as a comfort zone for starting conversations. Beyond that, how about reflecting on your feelings after successful interactions? Keeping a journal of such experiences might reinforce your confidence.

User: Oh, I like that idea! I can write about what went well and how I felt afterwards. That should help me remember the positives.

Consultant: It’s a fantastic approach! Recording your successes and emotions can help you shift your focus from anxiety to accomplishments. How do you feel about trying this practice in the coming week?

User: I feel excited about it! It sounds like a good way to remind myself that I can do well.

Consultant: That's excellent to hear! Remember, it’s about celebrating your progress, no matter how small. How do you envision starting this journaling practice? 

User: I guess I could set aside a few minutes each evening to write down my thoughts about my day. I could also include any interactions, whether they went well or not.

Consultant: That sounds like a thoughtful plan! Including both positive and challenging experiences will give you a fuller picture of your social interactions. What are you expecting to learn from this reflection?

User: I hope to see patterns in my interactions and maybe pinpoint what helps me feel more confident or anxious.

Consultant: That's a valuable insight to pursue! Recognizing these patterns can help you strategize for future interactions. How do you feel about sharing your reflections with me next session?

User: I’d love to do that! It’ll be nice to talk about my experiences and get some feedback.

Consultant: Perfect! I’m looking forward to hearing about your reflections. Also, do you think there are new social activities you’d like to explore to practice your skills?

User: Yes, I’ve been thinking about joining a club related to movies or books. It would be a nice way to meet people with similar interests!

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Engaging in something you enjoy can ease the pressure and make socializing more enjoyable. What steps can you take to explore this club?

User: I could check out the club fair next week and introduce myself to a few members. It might help to just get a feel of the environment.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach! Starting with introductions can gradually build your comfort level. How do you feel about that?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but mostly excited! It's a good chance to meet people without too much pressure.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel both nervous and excited. Just remember to take it one step at a time. As we wrap up today’s session, what would you say is the most empowering takeaway for you?

User: I believe that I can use my passion for topics to help with social interactions. And I feel more motivated to keep practicing!

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! Focusing on your passions and actively engaging with your experiences will boost your confidence. I’m excited to see how your journaling and club exploration go next time.

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to our next session and sharing my experiences.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Yanyan! Remember, every small step counts. I believe in you, and I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yanyan! I'm glad to see you again. How have things been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to reflect on my social interactions. I attempted to join a club, but it didn’t go as well as I hoped. I felt really out of place and disappointed.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience was quite challenging for you. Feeling out of place can be really tough. What specific feelings came up for you during that interaction?

User: I felt embarrassed and insecure. I thought everyone else was more confident and friendly, while I couldn't find my place.

Consultant: Those emotions are completely understandable. It’s common to feel insecure when facing new social environments. Can you share more about the thoughts that crossed your mind during that moment?

User: I kept thinking that I wasn't good enough to be there and that I would never make friends.

Consultant: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry. It seems like those thoughts really impacted how you felt in the moment. Would you say this kind of thinking happens often when you enter new social situations?

User: Yes, it happens a lot. I often worry that I’ll embarrass myself or that no one will like me.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Yanyan. Let’s explore those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports these beliefs about yourself in social situations?

User: I guess I don't have concrete evidence, but those feelings are so strong that they feel real to me.

Consultant: I understand. Emotions can definitely seem more powerful than the situation warrants. If a friend were to tell you they felt that way about themselves, what would you say to them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has their strengths and that they shouldn’t be so hard on themselves.

Consultant: That’s a kind perspective. Now, let's think about applying that same compassion to yourself. What might be a more balanced way to think about your social skills?

User: I suppose I could remind myself that I have strengths too, and that it’s okay to not click with everyone right away.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about recognizing that social interactions are complex, and not every situation will go perfectly. How does that new perspective make you feel?

User: I feel a bit relieved. It sounds less daunting when I think of it that way.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Let’s build on this relief. Are there any small steps you might be willing to take to practice socializing again in a low-pressure environment?

User: Maybe I could try talking to a few classmates after class, just to get to know them better.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Starting small can help ease the pressure. How would you approach that conversation?

User: I could ask them about their major or what they think of a particular class. That seems simple.

Consultant: Absolutely! Asking about shared experiences is a great icebreaker. How do you feel about putting that plan into action?

User: I’m a bit nervous but also excited. It feels manageable.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset to have! Remember, it’s normal to feel nervous, but you’re practicing resilience by pushing yourself. After you try this out, let’s reflect on how it goes in our next session. 

User: Yes, I’d like that. I hope it goes well!

Consultant: I believe it will go well! Regardless of the outcome, you’re making progress just by taking action. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?

User: I think that's it for now. I feel like we’ve covered a lot.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we wrap up, let’s summarize your progress. You’re beginning to recognize negative thoughts and are now open to trying new actions which is a huge step forward.

User: Yes, I feel like I'm starting to see things differently.

Consultant: Perfect! Keep reminding yourself of your strengths, and remember that you can return to this session whenever you feel overwhelmed or need support. I’m here for you!

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate all the guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Yanyan. I’m proud of the progress you’re making. Looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care!

User: Thanks! I will.
###################
Consultant: Hello Yan Yan! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling much better, actually. I've been getting along well with my classmates and even participated in some joint study sessions. It feels good to socialize without feeling so anxious.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made significant progress in adjusting to your new environment. What specific experiences have made you feel more comfortable socially?

User: I think hanging out with my classmates and working together on assignments helped a lot. I feel like I'm part of the group now, and that really reduces my anxiety.

Consultant: Being part of a group can indeed provide a comforting sense of belonging. How do you feel when you reflect on these new interactions? 

User: I feel relieved and happy. It's nice to have friends I can study with. I used to worry about not fitting in, but now I feel like I actually belong.

Consultant: That's fantastic progress, Yan Yan. You’ve been able to shift your focus from concerns about fitting in to enjoying the company of your classmates. How do you think this shift in perspective has affected your overall well-being?

User: I think it has made a big difference. I’m less stressed about my studies too because I can ask for help and exchange ideas with others.

Consultant: That's a valuable insight. It seems that having a supportive social network has positively impacted your academic stress as well. As we continue discussing your progress today, what are some ways you would like to maintain this positive mindset moving forward?

User: I’d like to keep building those connections and maybe take part in more group activities—like study groups and clubs. I think that would help me stay engaged and less anxious.

Consultant: Engaging in more activities sounds like a great plan! Exploring new opportunities can help strengthen those connections. What specific clubs or activities are you curious about joining?

User: I'm thinking about joining the English debate club or maybe the drama club. I love speaking in English and acting, so it might be a good fit.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful choices! Both clubs would allow you to express yourself while also developing your communication skills further. How do you feel about putting yourself out there and trying these activities?

User: I’m a bit nervous, but I’m also excited. I feel like taking that leap could really help me grow.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous about new experiences, but your excitement is a positive sign. How can you manage that nervousness as you prepare to join these activities?

User: I think if I remind myself of the fun and learning involved, it’ll help. Maybe I can go with a friend for the first meeting to ease into it.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent strategy! Bringing a friend can provide a sense of comfort. As we conclude our session, what reflections would you like to share regarding your journey so far?

User: I feel proud of myself for overcoming my social anxiety and being more open. It feels good to recognize my growth.

Consultant: You should absolutely be proud, Yan Yan! Recognizing your growth is pivotal in reinforcing the positive changes you’ve made. As you continue on this journey, remember to celebrate each step, no matter how small. What’s one action you can take to ensure you stay on this path?

User: I think I can set a goal to attend at least one activity each week and check in with myself about how I feel afterward.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Setting weekly goals keeps you engaged. As we wrap up today, what are your key takeaways from our session?

User: I realized how far I’ve come and the importance of staying connected with others. I want to keep pushing myself to grow.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You've done remarkable work already, and I believe you will continue to thrive. Remember, if challenges arise, just reach out for support. You're capable of managing your feelings and adapting to new experiences. If you ever need help again, don’t hesitate to return. 

User: Thank you so much for your guidance! I really appreciate it.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Yan Yan! Take care, and I wish you all the best with your future endeavors.
