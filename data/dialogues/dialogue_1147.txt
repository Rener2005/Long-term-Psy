Consultant: Hello Zhang! I'm glad to see you again. I know you've been feeling a bit unstable emotionally and have concerns about your future and relationships. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel anxious as graduation approaches. I also have these persistent sexual fantasies that make me feel uneasy and affected my daily life. The thought of starting a teaching job is just overwhelming.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure with graduation and the uncertainties of starting a new job. It's completely normal to feel anxious during such transitions. Let's start by exploring the specific thoughts or feelings that contribute to this anxiety. What comes to mind when you think about your future career?

User: I worry that I won't be good enough at teaching and that I won't connect with my students. It's like I'm always questioning myself, and that just makes me feel more anxious.

Consultant: That self-doubt can be really stressful to deal with. You mentioned questioning your abilities—can you tell me about the thoughts that arise when you think about teaching or connecting with your students?

User: I often think, "What if I'm not engaging enough?" or "What if the students don't like me?" These thoughts make me feel nervous and more anxious about stepping into the classroom.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite overwhelming. Let's take a moment to reflect on them. How strong do you feel the evidence is behind these thoughts? Have there been instances in the past where you connected well with others or engaged them positively?

User: Actually, I have had good experiences during my internship, where students seemed to enjoy the lessons I prepared. But I still hold onto this fear that it was just luck.

Consultant: It's great to hear about your positive experiences! It sounds like you have the ability to engage with students, yet you still doubt your success. Let's challenge that thought. If a friend were in your position, what would you say to encourage them?

User: I would probably tell them that they did a great job and that they have the skills required. Maybe I should try to believe that for myself too.

Consultant: That's a wonderful perspective! By reframing your thoughts, you can start to recognize your strengths. What might it look like for you to practice believing in yourself moving forward?

User: I guess I could remind myself of my successes and maybe even keep a note of positive feedback from others. It might help shift my focus away from doubts.

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping track of positive feedback can help reinforce your confidence. Changing the way you think about your experiences will take time, but it's a valuable step. Is there a specific time when you've felt confident and capable that we could focus on?

User: During my last internship presentation, I felt really good and received positive comments. I wish I could feel that way more often.

Consultant: That sounds like a memorable moment! Let’s work on exercises that can help you channel that confidence into your teaching role. What activities do you enjoy outside of your studies that make you feel good about yourself?

User: I like playing basketball and hanging out with friends. Those moments help me forget my anxieties.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Physical activity and socializing can be great stress relievers. Would you be open to setting a plan to incorporate more of these activities into your routine to help manage anxiety?

User: Yes, that sounds good. I often prioritize my studies over everything else, but I think taking breaks for activities could help me balance things out.

Consultant: It's crucial to strike that balance. Planning specific times for basketball and socializing can provide you with both relaxation and motivation. How about we outline a simple weekly schedule together?

User: That would be helpful! I think if I had a plan, I'd be more likely to stick to it.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start with two days a week for basketball and one day to meet with friends. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds manageable! I think starting small is a good idea.

Consultant: Absolutely! Small steps can lead to significant changes. Moving forward, as you encounter self-doubt, you can use that plan as a coping mechanism. How does that feel for you?

User: It feels a bit reassuring. Having a plan in mind gives me something to latch onto, especially when the anxiety kicks in.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s all about building those coping strategies. As we continue working together, let's also focus on keeping track of your emotions and organizing your thoughts. Would it be okay if we had you jot down any anxious thoughts you recognize during the week?

User: Yes, I can do that. I think writing things down might help me clarify my feelings and see patterns.

Consultant: Exactly! It's a great way to track your journey. Let's also reflect together in our next session on the feedback you gather and any thoughts you've written down. This will help us identify next steps. 

User: I’m looking forward to that. It feels good to have some strategies to work on, but I still need to remind myself to be patient with this process.

Consultant: Yes, patience is key. Remember, it’s okay to have ups and downs as you navigate through this. You're developing new skills and ways of thinking, and it takes time. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel more positive now compared to the beginning. I appreciate that we focused on practical steps I can take.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! You've made progress today just by recognizing your feelings and exploring actionable steps. Remember, it's a journey, and you're not alone in this. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don't hesitate to reach out for help.

User: Definitely, I will. Thank you so much for your support!

Consultant: You’re welcome, Zhang! I’m looking forward to our next session. Take care and remember to celebrate your achievements, no matter how small they may seem.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been quite anxious. This internship has been challenging, especially when it comes to communicating with my colleagues. I just don't feel confident in my abilities.

Consultant: I hear you, Zhang. Feeling anxious about communication during your internship can be tough. Let's explore what specific situations make you feel less confident. Can you share an experience where you struggled to communicate with your colleagues?

User: Sure! There was a meeting last week where I had to present my ideas, but I stumbled over my words. I felt everyone was watching me, and it only made my anxiety worse.

Consultant: That sounds really stressful. It's completely understandable to feel anxious when presenting in front of others. What thoughts were going through your mind during that meeting that made you feel so anxious?

User: I kept thinking that if I messed up, they would think I'm incompetent. It felt like everyone was judging me.

Consultant: That’s a common worry. It seems like those thoughts may have made your anxiety worse in that moment. Let’s take a closer look: what evidence do you have that they were judging you negatively?

User: I guess I don't have any real evidence. It just felt that way when I was under pressure.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. Sometimes, our minds can create scenarios that might not reflect reality. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about those thoughts?

User: I would probably tell them to not be so hard on themselves and that everyone makes mistakes.

Consultant: Exactly! It's important to remember that mistakes are part of learning. Recognizing those thoughts and treating yourself with kindness can be very powerful. How do you think adopting that perspective could affect your confidence moving forward?

User: I think it would help me to feel less pressured and more willing to try, even if I mess up sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Zhang. Now, let's think about some small steps you can take in your internship to practice this new mindset. What could be a manageable situation where you can practice communicating without putting too much pressure on yourself?

User: Maybe I could ask a colleague for feedback on a project. That could help me get used to interacting without the stress of a presentation.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Asking for feedback makes it more of a conversation rather than a performance. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but it seems like a good approach. I want to try.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel nervous. Remember, it’s a conversation, and you're seeking input—this can take the pressure off. After you try this out, how do you plan to reflect on the experience?

User: I think I'll take note of how the conversation goes and what I felt during it, to compare it with how I usually think it will go.

Consultant: That’s a perfect way to gauge your progress! Reflection can help you identify patterns in your thinking and see how you’re evolving. We can check back on this experience in our next session. How do you feel about that?

User: That sounds good! I hope I can see some progress by then.

Consultant: I'm sure you will, Zhang! Building confidence takes time, and each small step counts. Is there anything else on your mind today that you’d like to discuss?

User: Just that I’ve been feeling overwhelmed with academic pressure lately, especially with studies piling up on top of the internship.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed with multiple commitments. Let’s talk about how you can balance internship responsibilities with your studies. What strategies have you tried in the past?

User: I usually just focus on the urgent tasks at hand without a clear plan, which often leaves me stressed.

Consultant: That’s a common approach. Perhaps we can work on creating a more structured schedule together to help you manage both your internship and studies more effectively. How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful! I definitely need some organization in my life right now.

Consultant: Great! We could start by prioritizing your tasks, breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts, and then allocating time for each. What do you think you can prioritize first this week?

User: I think I need to focus on finishing my assignments due next week and also my internship tasks.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan. Let’s set specific time blocks for each task. Maybe we can find at least one time during the day when you can work on assignments without interruptions. Can you think of a suitable time?

User: I’m usually free in the evenings after my internship. I could dedicate a couple of hours then.

Consultant: Excellent! Setting aside dedicated study time in the evenings can really help. Also, remember to include breaks to recharge. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel more optimistic. Having a plan makes it seem less daunting.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, managing your time effectively can have a positive impact on both your studies and your confidence at work. As we wrap up today, what is one key takeaway you have from our session?

User: I think it’s that I need to be kinder to myself when I experience setbacks and take things one step at a time.

Consultant: Absolutely, Zhang. Being compassionate towards yourself can greatly influence your confidence and overall well-being. I look forward to hearing how your practice and planning go next time. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today. 

Consultant: It was my pleasure. You've made great progress today. Remember, I'm here for you whenever you need support. Take care until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Zhang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. Honestly, things have been pretty overwhelming. The pressure from studying for the teacher qualification exam has increased my anxiety significantly. I just feel lost and not sure about my future career.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure and uncertainty. Can you share a bit more about what specific aspects of your studies are making you feel this way?

User: Well, there’s just so much material to cover, and I often find it hard to concentrate. I keep thinking about whether I’ll even be successful in finding a job after I pass the exam.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable to feel anxious when facing such significant challenges. What would help you feel more secure about your future job prospects?

User: I think if I could manage my study time better and feel more confident in what I’m learning, that would help. But right now, it feels impossible to keep up.

Consultant: It seems like managing your study time is a key concern for you. Let's explore that further. What have been some of your typical study habits, and how have they been working for you?

User: Usually, I try to study a lot at once, but then I get distracted or anxious and end up not getting much done. I know it’s not a good strategy, but I don't know how to change it.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize your current strategy isn’t effective. This is a first step toward finding a better approach. Have you thought about breaking your study material into smaller, more manageable parts?

User: I’ve heard about that method, but I struggle to stick to a schedule. I tend to procrastinate until the last minute, which makes everything feel more stressful.

Consultant: Procrastination can definitely add to your stress. Let’s consider how we can build a more structured plan together. What do you think about setting specific goals for each study session, perhaps starting with smaller tasks?

User: That sounds like it could work. If I could see progress in smaller chunks, maybe I wouldn’t feel so overwhelmed. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Seeing progress can be motivating. What would be a realistic daily study goal for you to start with, given your current workload?

User: Maybe I could aim to study for two hours each day, focusing on one subject at a time. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Focusing on one subject at a time might help your concentration too. How do you feel about incorporating some breaks during those study sessions to keep your energy up?

User: I think that would help. I usually just power through, but I often find myself losing focus after a while.

Consultant: Taking breaks can actually improve your overall focus and retention. Would you like to set up a system for breaks during your two-hour study blocks? 

User: Yes, I could try studying for 25 minutes and then taking a 5-minute break. That might help me recharge a little.

Consultant: Perfect! This technique is often called the Pomodoro Technique, and many people find it effective. Let's also touch on how you cope with stress in general. What do you do to unwind after studying?

User: Sometimes I play video games or scroll through social media, but I don’t always feel settled afterward. 

Consultant: That’s interesting. It sounds like those activities might help you temporarily, but they might not be the most fulfilling way to unwind. Would you be open to exploring new relaxation techniques that might offer more satisfaction?

User: Sure, I’ve heard about mindfulness and relaxation exercises, but I haven’t tried them myself. 

Consultant: Mindfulness can be a wonderful way to manage stress. Even simple breathing exercises can significantly reduce anxiety. Would you like to try practicing a short mindfulness exercise together now? 

User: Yes, I’d love that. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment to focus on our breathing. Find a comfortable position, close your eyes if you feel comfortable, and take a deep breath in through your nose… now slowly exhale through your mouth. How does that feel?

User: It feels calming. I've noticed my heart rate slowing down a bit.

Consultant: Wonderful to hear! Incorporating moments like this into your day may help you feel a bit more grounded. Moving forward, how can you remind yourself to integrate this mindfulness exercise into your routine, especially during stressful study times?

User: I could set reminders on my phone to take those breaks and include some mindfulness practice. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Setting reminders can really help reinforce new habits. How about your career goals? How clear do you feel about the direction you’d like to take after your exam?

User: Honestly, I’m still unsure. I want to be a teacher, but the idea of job hunting makes me nervous. 

Consultant: It’s normal to feel uncertain about a career path, especially with everything else going on. What steps could we take together to clarify your career aspirations and alleviate some of that anxiety around job hunting?

User: Maybe listing out the types of teaching jobs I could apply for would help? 

Consultant: Absolutely! Creating a list could help give you a clearer picture and make the process feel less overwhelming. Would you like to brainstorm some potential teaching positions together now?

User: Yes, I'd appreciate that. 

Consultant: Great! Let's start by thinking about the subjects or age groups you feel passionate about teaching. What comes to mind? 

User: I really enjoy working with younger children, so maybe elementary education could be a path for me. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful fit! It’s important to consider what excites you. How does thinking about teaching younger children make you feel about your career?

User: I feel more excited about it! I think I’d really enjoy connecting with kids and helping them learn.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Having that excitement can be a motivating factor. As we wrap up today, what strategies do you feel are the most impactful for managing both your study pressure and your career exploration?

User: I think setting smaller study goals, incorporating breaks, and exploring mindfulness will really help. Plus, focusing on my love for teaching younger kids gives me something to look forward to.

Consultant: You’ve captured some excellent strategies! Remember, taking it one step at a time is key. How can you continue to seek support from your social circle as you move forward?

User: I can talk to my friends about my plans and maybe even study together. I feel like that could help me stay motivated and connected.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent idea! Having support can really boost your confidence and motivation. I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Remember, I’m here for you whenever you need guidance. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit lighter after talking today. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Zhang! You’re making important steps forward. Take care, and I believe in your potential.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, especially after participating in the campus club activities. I felt a sense of support and acceptance there, but I still feel a bit nervous and uneasy. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that you're experiencing some support in the club! It's a positive step. Can you tell me more about what aspects of the social activities made you feel supported, and what situations still make you feel anxious?

User: Well, during the activities, everyone was really friendly, and it felt nice to connect with others. However, I still panic a little when it comes to introducing myself or starting a conversation. I worry that I might say something awkward or that people won’t like me. 

Consultant: That’s completely normal to feel anxious in those situations. Let’s explore that fear a bit more. When you think about introducing yourself or talking to new people, what thoughts come into your mind?

User: I often think that I might embarrass myself or that people will judge me based on what I say. It’s like my brain instantly assumes the worst.

Consultant: I see. Those negative thoughts can create a lot of pressure. Let’s challenge those assumptions together. What evidence do you have that supports those thoughts? Are there any positive experiences from your interactions that could serve as counter-evidence? 

User: Well, when I did talk to someone in the club, they seemed interested and even invited me to join more activities. I guess that’s a good sign, but I still tend to focus more on what could go wrong.

Consultant: It sounds like you had a successful interaction that indicates people enjoy talking to you! Perhaps we can work on shifting your focus from potential negatives to the positives. If a friend were worried like you, what would you tell them to help them feel more confident? 

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay to be nervous and that they shouldn’t worry too much about others' opinions. They should just be themselves, right?

Consultant: Exactly! You have good insight. Now, let’s practice that same thinking for yourself. How can you remind yourself that being yourself is enough, even if you're feeling nervous?

User: I could try to remind myself that everyone gets nervous and that it’s natural. I could also focus on the positives of each interaction instead of the negatives.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Building that mindset can help ease your anxiety. Let’s also think about some small steps you can take to practice those skills in a safe way. What would you feel comfortable doing next in your social environment?

User: Maybe I could try to introduce myself to at least one new person during the next activity. Just a simple “Hi, I’m Zhang.” 

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! A simple introduction can be a great step toward increasing your comfort. How do you feel about setting that as a goal for our next session?

User: I think it’s manageable. I feel a bit nervous just thinking about it, but I want to try.

Consultant: It’s completely okay to feel nervous! Remember, it’s about taking small, manageable steps. What can you do to support yourself leading up to that goal? 

User: I could practice my introduction in front of a mirror or with a friend. It might help me feel less awkward when the moment arrives.

Consultant: Practicing with a mirror or a friend is a fantastic strategy! It builds your confidence. Would you like to set a plan for how you’ll approach your next social event?

User: Sure! I can write down some things I want to say and practice them. Maybe I’ll set a reminder to encourage myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive plan! In our next session, we can talk about how it went and any feelings that came up during that experience. What do you think the most important thing is to remember before you introduce yourself?

User: That I’m allowed to be nervous and that people are generally kind. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Allowing yourself to feel nervous while still taking action is a strong step. Remember, every experience is a chance to learn, so be gentle with yourself no matter the outcome. 

User: Thanks! I feel a bit more reassured talking through this, and it helps that I have a plan now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! This is a positive shift forward for you. As we wrap up today, reflect on what you learned and summarize your main takeaway from our session.

User: I learned that it’s okay to be nervous, and I can focus on positive interactions instead of fearing judgment. Also, practicing will definitely help.

Consultant: Well said, Zhang! You’re making progress. Next time, we can revisit this plan and see how it’s affecting your confidence. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences. 

User: Me too! Thank you for your support today. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you in our next session. Remember, you are doing great work!
###################
Consultant: Hello Zhang! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been doing better, actually. I've been enjoying my time with friends and my confidence has really improved when I'm socializing. 

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! It sounds like you're embracing social interactions more comfortably now. Can you share a bit about any specific experiences that stood out to you?

User: Well, I recently attended a gathering with some classmates. I felt relaxed, and I was able to engage in conversations more openly than before. It was exciting to feel that connection.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Feeling that connection can really boost your confidence. What do you think made this gathering feel different from past experiences?

User: I think I was just more open to connecting with others. I didn't overthink things as much, which usually leads to my anxiety.

Consultant: That's a significant shift! It seems like you're beginning to recognize the role of your thoughts in how you feel during social events. Have you noticed if there are any specific thoughts that pop up when you start to feel anxious?

User: Yes, sometimes I worry whether people will like me or not. I guess that worry has lessened recently. 

Consultant: It's great that you're noticing that shift in your thoughts. Those thoughts can create anxiety, but it sounds like you're starting to challenge them. What would happen if you reframed that thought to something more positive, such as "I am enjoyable to be around"?

User: I think that could help. It feels like a healthier way to think about it instead of always worrying about being judged.

Consultant: Exactly! Challenging those negative thoughts can be empowering. How do you think you can practice this positive thinking in your next social interaction?

User: I could remind myself to focus on being present rather than worrying about how I'm perceived. That could help me enjoy the moment more.

Consultant: That's a fantastic strategy! Being present can certainly enhance your experiences. Looking back, have there been any specific activities or conversations that really helped you build trust with your classmates?

User: Yes, I remember a time when I shared a personal story with them. It really brought us closer and made me feel more part of the group.

Consultant: Sharing personal experiences can greatly strengthen relationships. It creates a more genuine sense of connection. Have you considered continuing to share in future gatherings?

User: I think I might do that! It feels nice to share, and it seems to help build rapport.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Zhang! Building rapport can foster deeper connections. Now, as you approach your graduation, how are you feeling about the changes ahead?

User: I'm excited but also a bit anxious about the transition. I'm not sure what to expect in the next stage of my life.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Transition periods can evoke a mix of emotions. How might you prepare to ease into this new chapter?

User: I guess I could stay connected with my friends and look for ways to make new ones in the workplace. It would be good to have a support system.

Consultant: Maintaining connections will definitely help. It sounds like you're already thinking of strategies for this transition. Are there specific activities or groups you’re considering joining after graduation?

User: I've thought about joining some local meet-up groups. They seem like a good way to meet people with similar interests.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Engaging in shared interests can help you build relationships more easily. How do you feel about the idea of seeking out these opportunities?

User: I feel hopeful! It gives me something to look forward to, and I think it might make the transition smoother.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Hopefulness is a powerful feeling. In your journey toward graduation, how can you remind yourself of the progress you've made so far?

User: I could keep a journal to track my experiences and feelings. It might help me reflect on how far I've come.

Consultant: That's a fantastic approach! Journaling not only helps you process emotions but also allows you to see your growth over time. Would you like to set some goals for your journaling practice?

User: Yes, I think I’d like to write in it at least once a week and focus on my interactions and emotions.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel you've gained from our conversation about your experiences and the transition ahead?

User: I feel more confident about my ability to handle social situations and excited about making new connections after graduation.

Consultant: That’s amazing to hear, Zhang. You've made significant strides in your journey. Remember, it’s normal to feel a range of emotions during transitions, but you’ve developed some great strategies to navigate them. If you ever feel the need to talk again, you’re always welcome to reach out.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! It's great to see you again. Today, we will reflect on your journey and discuss how you can smoothly transition into your new environment. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good overall. Graduating has definitely boosted my confidence, but I'm also a bit anxious about moving to a new city for my teaching job. I don't know what to expect.

Consultant: That’s understandable, Zhang. Graduating is a huge accomplishment, and it’s normal to feel both excited and anxious about new beginnings. Can you share more about what specifically is causing you to feel anxious about the move?

User: I guess it’s the uncertainty. I’m worried about making new friends, adapting to a new work environment, and even living alone. It’s all a bit overwhelming.

Consultant: Those feelings are valid. Transitioning to a new environment can bring about a lot of unknowns. Thinking back to our previous discussions, how do you feel your emotional growth has prepared you for this new chapter?

User: I've learned a lot about managing my emotions, especially those around anxiety, which really helps. But I still think I might struggle a bit when I first get there.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you feel more equipped to handle your emotions. Let’s delve deeper: when you think about the potential struggles you might face, what thoughts come to your mind, and how do they make you feel?

User: I worry that I won't fit in or that I’ll feel alone. Those thoughts make me feel anxious and kind of defeated before I even start.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound pretty heavy. It seems you’re anticipating negative experiences. Let's challenge that perspective—can you think of any evidence or examples from your past that suggest you can successfully adapt?

User: Well, during my college years, I had to adjust to being away from home. At first, it was tough, but I eventually made friends and found my place.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic example of your adaptability! It shows you have the resilience necessary to handle this new situation. What if we framed this upcoming move as another opportunity for growth, just like during your college experience? 

User: I like that perspective. Thinking of it as an opportunity rather than a burden feels empowering.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Now, let’s work on some practical strategies. What activities or hobbies could you engage in to meet new people and feel more integrated into your new community?

User: I could join some clubs or attend workshops related to teaching. That way, I can meet people with similar interests.

Consultant: Absolutely! Engaging in activities that you enjoy is a great way to build connections. How might you initiate conversations with new people in those settings?

User: I guess I could start by introducing myself and asking them about their experiences. 

Consultant: That’s a solid approach! Remember, most people appreciate when someone shows interest in them. As you prepare for this new role, how can you maintain your emotional well-being during the transition?

User: I think I need to set aside time for self-care, like going for walks or meditating. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Self-care will help you manage stress. Which strategies from our previous sessions do you think might be useful in moments of anxiety?

User: The breathing exercises we practiced could be helpful, and I can also write down my feelings to process them better.

Consultant: Those are great tools! How about we set a specific plan for your first week in the new city? What will you aim to achieve?

User: I want to explore the city, maybe check out local cafes, and attend at least one event or class related to teaching.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Exploring the city will not only familiarize you with your new surroundings but also help you feel more comfortable. As we wrap up our session, what do you consider your biggest takeaway today?

User: I realized that I have the skills and adaptability to handle this transition. I just need to reframe my anxiety as a part of the journey.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight, Zhang! You’ve made tremendous progress, and I believe you’re well-prepared for this next step. Should you face challenges in the future, remember the strategies we discussed, and don’t hesitate to reach out for support. 

User: Thank you! This session has really helped me clarify my thoughts and feel more confident about moving.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of all the work you’ve done. Remember to celebrate every small success along your journey. This is our last session together, but know that you have the tools to manage your emotions moving forward. I wish you all the best in your new adventure!

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate all your help. I feel ready for this new beginning.
