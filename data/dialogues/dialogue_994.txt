Consultant: Hello! Welcome to our session today. I’m here to help you with whatever you’ve been feeling lately. Can you share what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious again. My studies are overwhelming me, and I can’t shake this constant worry about my future. It feels like I can't even focus anymore.

Consultant: It sounds really tough right now, and it’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when you’re facing pressure in your studies. When you say you can't focus, can you describe what that looks like for you?

User: Well, I sit down to study, but my mind just keeps racing. I start thinking about all these terrible things that could happen if I don't do well in my exams. Like, what if I fail? What if I disappoint my family?

Consultant: Those thoughts must be really distressing. It seems like you’re caught in a cycle of worry about the outcomes of your exams, which is affecting your ability to concentrate. Can you tell me what specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about failing?

User: I think that if I fail, it means I'm not good enough or that I’ll never succeed in life. It's like I can't escape that mindset of everything being a disaster.

Consultant: It makes sense that those thoughts would cause you to feel anxious. Let’s take a closer look at that idea—how true do you think it is that failing one exam means you won’t succeed in life? 

User: I guess it’s not entirely true. I know plenty of people who have struggled but gone on to do well eventually. But in the moment, it feels very real.

Consultant: Exactly, it’s a common cognitive distortion to believe that one negative event has a lasting impact on everything else. If a friend were in your position, what advice would you give them about their worries?

User: I would probably tell them not to be so hard on themselves and that one setback doesn’t define them. I wish I could believe that for myself.

Consultant: That’s a very compassionate perspective to have for others. Now, what if we experimented with that thought for you? When you start feeling those worries again, how about we create a mantra or a phrase that you can remind yourself of? 

User: That sounds worth trying. Maybe something like “one setback doesn’t mean failure”? 

Consultant: That’s a great start! It’s a positive affirmation that reinforces that setbacks are a part of life and don't define your worth. How would you feel about using that phrase when those anxious thoughts arise?

User: I think it could help. It feels empowering to remind myself that it’s okay to struggle sometimes.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear. Additionally, have you been doing any specific activities to help manage your anxiety, or do you find that hard to engage with right now?

User: Honestly, I haven’t been doing much. I used to go for runs or do some meditation, but I just haven’t had the energy or motivation.

Consultant: It's completely understandable when you’re feeling this way. However, incorporating small activities can really help in managing anxiety. What do you think about setting small, achievable goals to ease back into those activities, like a short run or a short meditation session?

User: That could work if I set very small goals. Maybe just a 10-minute run to start; I used to enjoy that. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Starting small can help you rebuild that motivation. Would you like to create a plan for how and when you could fit that into your week?

User: Yes, I can try to set aside time after classes, maybe three times a week. That feels reasonable.

Consultant: Great! It sounds like a manageable goal. Also, while you’re at it, think about how you can reward yourself for following through on those plans. It could be something simple, like enjoying some time watching a favorite show afterward.

User: That’s a nice idea! I deserve some rewards for my efforts. 

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s important to acknowledge your progress and treat yourself kindly. As we move forward, let’s keep checking in on how you’re feeling and how these strategies are working for you. 

User: I appreciate that. I have been so focused on my worries that I forgot to take care of myself.

Consultant: It’s quite common to get caught up in our thoughts, especially when we’re under pressure. Remind yourself that self-care doesn’t have to be complicated—it can just be small acts of kindness towards yourself.

User: That makes sense. I’ll try to be more mindful of my needs and feelings.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful step! We’ll discuss how this week goes during our next session. For now, let’s take a moment to recap what you’ve learned and how you’re feeling about applying these strategies.

User: I think I’ve learned that my automatic thoughts can be challenged and replaced which is comforting. Acknowledging my need for self-care feels good too.

Consultant: That’s excellent to hear! Remember, change takes time, but you’re already on the path. Do you feel prepared to implement these changes this week? 

User: I do. I’m a bit nervous, but I also feel hopeful for the first time in a while.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful feeling to have. Nervousness is normal, but remember you’re taking constructive steps forward. I’m proud of you for being open about your feelings today. 

User: Thank you! It feels nice to express myself.

Consultant: You're welcome! I appreciate your openness. As we conclude today’s session, what will you take away from all we’ve discussed?

User: I’ll take away the idea that it’s okay to have setbacks, the importance of self-care, and the mantra to remind me of my worth.

Consultant: Those are powerful takeaways! Keep nurturing those positive thoughts. Remember, I’m here to support you whenever you need. 

User: I will do that. Thank you for your help today. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to seeing you again. Take care of yourself this week.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really uneasy. The recent safety incident at school has made me even more anxious about being around people. It's like I don't know how to cope with these feelings anymore.

Consultant: I see. The safety event has intensified your feelings of anxiety and uncertainty. It's completely understandable to feel this way. Can you tell me more about how these feelings are affecting your daily life?

User: I find myself avoiding crowded places. Even in class, I feel this urge to leave if it gets too crowded or if I sense any discomfort. I'm constantly on edge.

Consultant: That sounds very challenging. Avoidance can sometimes feel like a safe option, but it often reinforces anxiety in the long run. What do you think about identifying specific situations that trigger this anxiety for you?

User: Well, I think loud environments and being around unfamiliar people are the biggest triggers. I worry that something bad might happen, and I won't be able to handle it.

Consultant: It's completely valid to have those worries. Let's try to unpack them a bit. When you're in those situations, what thoughts run through your mind? 

User: I often think about worst-case scenarios, like someone getting hurt or something going wrong, even if it's unlikely.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like your mind goes to very extreme outcomes. Can we explore how likely these scenarios really are? What evidence do you have that they might happen?

User: I guess there isn’t much evidence, but the fear feels very real in the moment. It’s hard to push those thoughts aside.

Consultant: That makes sense. Our fears can feel very concrete, even in the absence of supporting evidence. What if we try to consider alternative outcomes? What might be a more balanced or realistic thought in those situations?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that most people are there just to learn and that incidents are rare. But it’s hard to hold onto that thought when anxiety kicks in.

Consultant: That’s a great start! It sounds like you have an idea of what a balanced thought might look like, but it can be difficult to access in the heat of the moment. We could practice some techniques together to help when those anxious moments arise. How does that sound?

User: I'd like to try that. I need some tools to manage these feelings better.

Consultant: Absolutely! One technique could be grounding yourself in the present. Notice your surroundings, focus on your breathing, and remind yourself that you're safe in that moment. Have you tried any self-soothing methods before?

User: I’ve tried deep breathing, but when I’m really anxious, it doesn’t help as much.

Consultant: It’s common for deep breathing to feel less effective when anxiety peaks. We can practice that as well as other grounding techniques together. What about visualizing a safe place or a comforting scenario? 

User: I like that idea. I can think of my room—it’s quiet, and I feel secure there.

Consultant: Perfect! Visualizing your safe room can serve as a trigger for calmness. Let's practice that visualization together. Close your eyes if you're comfortable and picture your room. What do you see, hear, and feel?

User: I see my bed, my favorite books scattered around, and it’s just so peaceful. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Allow yourself to fully immerse in that feeling of peace. How does being in that space make you feel compared to the anxiety you experience in crowded situations?

User: It feels like a refuge. I wish I could feel that way outside of my room.

Consultant: That’s an important insight. We can work on bringing that feeling into other spaces gradually. What if we identify times when you could practice facing those fears a bit at a time while keeping that sense of safety in mind?

User: Hmm, maybe when I feel ready, I could try attending a smaller class or study group first.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical step. By starting with smaller, more manageable situations, you can gradually build your confidence. How do you feel about that plan?

User: I feel a bit hopeful about it. It’s daunting, but I think it might help.

Consultant: That’s a great attitude to have! Remember to give yourself grace during this process. It’s totally normal to feel apprehensive. Do you have any concerns about this step?

User: I guess I worry about panicking if I start to feel overwhelmed again.

Consultant: It’s natural to have those concerns. Would it be helpful to create a mini-action plan for when those feelings arise? 

User: Yes, that would make me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Great! We can outline steps you can take if you start feeling overwhelmed—like taking a break, using your deep breathing, or visualizing your safe place. How does that sound to you?

User: I like it. Having a plan will definitely help me feel more secure.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we wrap up, let’s take a moment to reflect on what you’ve learned today. What do you believe your next steps will be after this session?

User: I think I’ll start visualizing my safe space and try to plan for smaller social situations. I also want to practice my grounding techniques.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, progress takes time, and it’s okay to take small steps. I believe in your ability to manage this. If you need support, I'm always here to help. How are you feeling about everything we've discussed today?

User: I feel a bit more empowered and less anxious. Thank you for helping me see a path forward.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. Keep practicing those techniques, and I look forward to seeing how you progress in our next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. Before we dive in, I want to check in with you about how you're feeling. Can you share a bit about what’s been happening recently?

User: Hi! I've been really anxious lately, especially because I have this leadership role in my club activities coming up. I'm scared I won't be able to handle the responsibility, and it makes me want to avoid it altogether.

Consultant: It sounds like this leadership task is weighing heavily on you. You’re feeling a lack of confidence and fearful of not meeting expectations. Let’s explore that a bit more. What specific thoughts or worries do you have regarding this leadership role?

User: I keep thinking that if I mess up, everyone will judge me and think I'm not capable. I worry that my team will think I'm not a good leader.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem really challenging to deal with. It’s understandable that you'd feel anxious about how others perceive you. Can you recall a time when you had similar worries, and how did it turn out?

User: Yes, there was a time during a class presentation. I was so worried about failing, but I ended up doing fine. Still, I can't shake off the fear this time.

Consultant: It’s good to hear that you’ve had positive experiences in the past. You’ve shown strength before. Let’s take a moment to reflect on that success. What strategies did you use back then that you might be able to apply this time?

User: I think I just prepared a lot and tried to practice speaking. But now, the pressure feels different because I’m leading others.

Consultant: That makes sense. Leading others can feel like a bigger responsibility. How about we work on some practical strategies together? For example, what if we broke down this leadership task into smaller, manageable steps? Would that help ease the pressure?

User: I think breaking it down could help. But I’m not sure where to start.

Consultant: A great first step might be to outline the main tasks you need to accomplish. What are some responsibilities you think you need to tackle as a leader?

User: I guess I need to set up a meeting, organize ideas, and delegate tasks.

Consultant: Those are excellent starting points! How do you feel about scheduling a meeting first? What could be your action plan for that?

User: I could draft an agenda and invite everyone. But what if they don’t take me seriously?

Consultant: It’s normal to have those thoughts. Let’s look at the evidence here. What makes you think they wouldn't take you seriously?

User: I don’t know... maybe it’s just my own lack of confidence. I feel like everyone else is more competent.

Consultant: It seems like your own perception is influencing how you view others' opinions of you. What if we tried to challenge that thought? Imagine if a friend were in your position; how would you encourage them?

User: I think I’d tell them everyone has their strengths, and it’s okay to ask for help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Everyone brings unique qualities to the table. You, too, have valuable strengths. Let’s practice implementing that mindset. Can you think of a recent moment where you successfully contributed something valuable?

User: Well, I helped organize a small charity event last month and it went well. The feedback was positive.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It shows you have the ability to lead and organize. Let’s draw on that experience. How can we remind yourself of that success when you feel doubts creeping in?

User: Maybe I can keep a note of that success or share it with my team to boost my own confidence.

Consultant: That sounds like a strong strategy! Keeping reminders can really help. Now, moving forward, what steps can you take to manage your anxiety as you prepare for this leadership role?

User: I could practice breathing exercises when I feel anxious and also reach out to my team for support. 

Consultant: Those are great approaches! Engaging your team for support can really increase your confidence. How do you feel about setting a regular check-in with yourself to assess how you’re feeling through this process?

User: That could be helpful. I usually don’t take the time to check in with myself.

Consultant: Checking in is key to self-awareness. Let’s establish a simple routine where you reflect weekly on your emotions and progress. How does that sound to you?

User: Sounds good! I think it could really help me stay grounded.

Consultant: Wonderful! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we've worked on. You have outlined steps to take, decided on strategies to manage anxiety, and identified ways to challenge negative thoughts. How are you feeling about these strategies moving forward?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I think breaking things down can really help lessen my anxiety.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about small steps and progress. You’ve already made a positive shift today. Let’s keep building on that momentum in our next sessions. 

User: Thank you! I look forward to our next meeting. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! Remember, you're not alone in this and you’re capable of handling these challenges. Take care, and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately, especially after that conflict with my classmate. I'm worried about how it will affect my relationships with others.

Consultant: I understand that this conflict is weighing heavily on you and contributing to your anxiety about your relationships. Can you tell me more about what happened during that interaction?

User: We were supposed to work together on a project, but we had different opinions on how to approach it. It escalated quickly, and now I'm worried they might dislike me or think I'm a bad team member.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling anxious about their perception of you and the impact this could have on your relationships. Let’s explore what thoughts came to your mind in that moment. What were you thinking after the argument?

User: I kept thinking that if they don't like me, I won't have anyone to work with in future projects, and I might even fail in my studies because of that.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really overwhelming. It seems like you’re anticipating serious consequences from this situation. Can we examine if there’s any evidence to support these thoughts? Is it possible there are other explanations for how they might feel?

User: I guess I don't know how they really feel. I just jumped to conclusions. But I’m still scared they might think less of me.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way, especially when emotions are high. What if we tried to challenge that thinking a bit? Let's think about how you would advise a friend in a similar situation. What would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s normal to have disagreements and that it doesn’t mean everyone will dislike them.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s a common part of working with others, isn’t it? So, what if you applied that same understanding to yourself? Can you find ways to reframe your thoughts in a more compassionate way?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s possible to resolve the conflict and still have a good relationship with my classmate.

Consultant: Absolutely! That perspective allows room for healing and positive interaction. Now, let’s talk about how you might approach your classmate to resolve the situation. What do you think would be a good first step?

User: Maybe I could reach out and apologize for how things went. I could also express that I want to work together and share my ideas.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive way to address it! Using open communication can really help. Thinking of how you want to express your feelings is key. What emotions do you think will be important for you to convey?

User: I want to convey that I genuinely value our teamwork and that I regret how I handled things before. 

Consultant: That’s a great intention! Expressing regret and valuing the relationship shows maturity. How do you think you will feel once you’ve communicated that to your classmate?

User: I think I might feel relieved and more confident, like I am taking charge of my mistakes instead of letting them control me.

Consultant: That sounds like a very empowering step! Building that confidence will help lessen your anxiety too. Are there any skills or techniques you think you could practice before having this conversation?

User: I could practice some deep breathing or even write down what I want to say so I don't get overwhelmed during the conversation.

Consultant: Excellent strategies! Deep breathing can help calm your body and mind. Writing down your thoughts can give you clarity. It's about preparing yourself to express your feelings without fear. 

User: Yeah, that makes sense. I feel more ready to tackle this now.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that you’re feeling more prepared! Let's make sure to reinforce this confidence moving forward. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you think is one key takeaway that you’ll keep in mind as you face this situation?

User: I think I’ll remember that it’s okay to have disagreements and that I can improve my relationships through open communication.

Consultant: That sounds like a powerful takeaway! Focusing on effective communication can definitely help strengthen your connections with others. Remember, every step you take further solidifies your confidence. 

User: Thank you! I feel a lot better after talking about this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of you for taking these steps. Keep practicing those techniques, and I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes in our next session. Take care!

User: I will! Thanks again!
###################
Consultant: Hello! Welcome back to our session today. I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last meeting, especially after your successful public speaking event?

User: Hello! Thank you! I've actually felt a boost in confidence since the event. It was really encouraging to get positive feedback from everyone. But sometimes, I still find myself worrying about trivial things.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you've experienced a boost in confidence from the event, and it's completely normal to have worries sometimes. Can you share more about what specifically tends to cause you to worry?

User: Well, I often worry about appearing unprepared in social situations. Even the thought of meeting new people makes me anxious, as if they will judge me if I say something wrong.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging for you. It's common to feel anxious about being judged, especially in new social situations. What kinds of thoughts go through your mind when you find yourself worrying about meeting new people?

User: I start thinking that I might say something embarrassing or that people will think I'm not smart enough. It feels like my mind goes into overdrive, imagining worst-case scenarios.

Consultant: I hear you. Those thoughts can be overwhelming. Let's try to unpack them a bit. When those thoughts arise, how do they affect your feelings? 

User: They usually make me feel nervous and uneasy. My heart races, and I get shaky. It’s almost like I can’t think straight.

Consultant: It sounds really uncomfortable. When we face these thoughts, they can create physical reactions like racing hearts and shakiness. Have you noticed if these situations tend to lead to any specific behaviors for you, like avoiding certain social gatherings?

User: Yes, definitely! Sometimes, I avoid going out or meeting new people because I fear I'll embarrass myself, which only makes the anxiety worse later.

Consultant: That avoidance can create a cycle of anxiety, making it even harder to engage socially. Let's focus on your recent positive experience. How can we use that success as a stepping stone to challenge these thoughts and fears?

User: I guess I could remind myself that I was able to speak in front of an audience successfully. That should mean I'm capable of handling small social interactions too.

Consultant: Exactly! That's a great connection. Reflecting on your accomplishments, like your successful public speaking, can help reassure you of your abilities. How about we set a small goal for this week to practice engaging socially in less intimidating scenarios?

User: That sounds good. Maybe I could aim to start a conversation with a classmate I don’t know well.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! Starting a conversation with a classmate can be a low-pressure way to practice. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. It will be a good challenge for me.

Consultant: Nervousness is perfectly normal before trying something new, but remember, you're building on the success you've already achieved. How can we prepare you for this conversation to manage the nerves?

User: Maybe I could think of a few topics to bring up beforehand so I don’t feel stuck if there’s a lull in conversation.

Consultant: That's a fantastic strategy! Preparing some topics can really help ease the pressure. What kind of topics do you think you might want to discuss?

User: Perhaps I could ask about their classes or share something about the recent school events. It’s something we could both relate to.

Consultant: Great ideas! Those topics can help establish common ground. As you approach this interaction, try to remind yourself of your strengths and the positive feedback you received from your recent speech. 

User: I will definitely try to keep that in mind. It helps to know I’ve succeeded before.

Consultant: Absolutely! Drawing from past successes can provide a solid foundation. As we wrap up today, can you summarize how you plan to approach this conversation with your classmate?

User: I plan to start by being friendly and asking about their classes, and I’ll try to remember the encouraging feedback I received after my speech. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Your progress is commendable, and I believe these small steps will build your confidence further. How do you feel about discussing our next session and your continued use of these strategies?

User: I feel optimistic! I want to keep building on this confidence. I appreciate having these strategies to rely on.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! We’ll continue to strengthen those strategies in our next sessions. Remember, you’re actively working on your growth, and that’s something to be proud of. 

User: Thank you! This has been really helpful. I look forward to our next meeting.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing with me today. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress. Remember, I'm here to support you whenever you need. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's wonderful to see you again. I'm glad to hear about your involvement in the mental health group. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite stable and satisfied about helping others discuss their experiences. It's rewarding to see them open up and find support.

Consultant: That's really great to hear! Helping others can be a powerful way to reinforce your own well-being. What strategies have you found particularly useful while supporting them?

User: I think just actively listening and sharing my own experiences helps. It seems to create a safe space for them.

Consultant: Absolutely, creating a safe space is essential. How about your own feelings during these interactions? Do you notice any changes in how you perceive your anxiety when you're supporting others?

User: Yes! I feel more confident when I'm listening to others, and it distracts me from my own worries. It's like I can forget about my anxiety for a moment.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive shift. It’s encouraging that these interactions provide you with some relief. Have you thought about incorporating more of these supportive experiences into your routine?

User: I would like to, actually. It helps me feel more connected and less anxious. Maybe I should join more activities like this.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Engaging in activities where you can help others could further enhance your social connections and reduce feelings of anxiety. What are some specific activities you might consider?

User: I’m thinking about volunteering at a local community center or maybe starting a small support group for students like me.

Consultant: Both of those options sound fantastic! They would allow you to help others while also reinforcing your own coping skills. How do you envision setting up that support group?

User: I could gather a few friends and create a safe space where we can share our struggles and help each other out with some coping strategies.

Consultant: That’s an excellent initiative! It not only supports others but also helps you build a routine of engagement. How do you feel about your ability to lead such a group?

User: I feel pretty good about it. I believe I have enough experience to guide discussions, but I still worry about managing the group's dynamics.

Consultant: It's natural to have some concerns, but your experience will definitely be an asset. Remember, you can always reach out for help if you need it. How can you prepare yourself for leading this group effectively?

User: Maybe I could write down some discussion topics or strategies to facilitate conversations. That might give me more confidence.

Consultant: That's a great approach! Preparation can help alleviate some of the anxiety you might feel in those situations. Would you like to discuss any specific topics you’d like the group to cover?

User: I think topics around managing anxiety and sharing coping strategies would be helpful. It's something I still work on every day.

Consultant: Focusing on anxiety management makes sense, especially since it's something you're familiar with. It could create a sense of solidarity among group members. How do you plan to handle your anxiety in those moments when it arises during the group?

User: I guess I could remind myself of the techniques that have worked for me, like deep breathing or taking a moment to collect my thoughts.

Consultant: Those are effective techniques! Incorporating them into your routine can help you stay grounded, especially in group settings. How do you feel about using these techniques in other areas of your life as well?

User: I think it would be beneficial. I just need to remember to practice them more consistently, not just during stressful times.

Consultant: Consistent practice is key. It’s like building a muscle—over time, it becomes easier to access those techniques when you need them. Can you think of a few daily situations where you could consciously practice these techniques?

User: I could practice them during my study sessions or when I’m feeling overwhelmed with schoolwork.

Consultant: Those are perfect opportunities! Integrating these practices into your daily life may help reduce anxiety over time. What else do you think might contribute to maintaining your emotional well-being as you move forward?

User: I’d like to keep reflecting on my progress and maybe set some small goals for myself regularly. Checking in with how I’m feeling would help.

Consultant: That's a solid plan! Regularly reflecting and setting achievable goals can provide you with a sense of direction and accomplishment. How do you feel about revisiting your goals in our future sessions?

User: I think it would be great to assess my progress every time we meet. It will keep me motivated to stay on track.

Consultant: That sounds like a valuable strategy. Tracking your progress can help reinforce the positive steps you're taking. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel has been the most beneficial takeaway for you?

User: I believe it’s the realization that I can use my experiences to help others while also working on my own anxiety. This really empowers me.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Empowerment is a crucial part of building self-confidence and resilience. Remember, you have the tools and support to manage your anxiety moving forward. If you find yourself needing additional help, you know where to find me.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance. I'm looking forward to implementing everything we discussed.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm excited for your journey ahead. Remember, it’s okay to ask for help when you need it. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you next time!

User: Bye! I will definitely keep in touch!
