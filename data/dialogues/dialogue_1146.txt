Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been reflecting a lot on my relationships with my classmates. I still feel quite lonely and often wonder why I can't connect with them more deeply.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you've been thinking about the nature of your relationships and feeling a sense of dissatisfaction. Can you tell me more about what specifically is causing you to feel this way?

User: I think it’s because I have this strong defensive mindset. I find it hard to be open and vulnerable around others, which makes it difficult to form close connections. 

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense, Li. It seems like you’re aware of your defenses, but they’re still making it hard for you to connect. What do you think has contributed to this defensive mindset?

User: I guess I was always encouraged to be independent and to please others. So, I end up focusing more on what others expect rather than on my genuine feelings.

Consultant: It’s great that you can identify those patterns. It sounds like you’re caught between wanting to connect on a deeper level and feeling the pressure to meet others' expectations. How has this awareness impacted your social interactions recently?

User: I notice that even when I am with friends, I feel like I’m only showing them a part of me—like a façade. It’s tiring to maintain it, but I don’t know how to change.

Consultant: It can be exhausting to keep up that façade. It sounds like you’re longing for genuine connections but feel stuck in this cycle. Have there been any moments where you felt you could be authentic?

User: There are rare moments, like when I’m discussing personal things in a small group, but I often retreat back to my safe zone afterward.

Consultant: Those moments are important, even if they are brief. What do you think holds you back from being authentic more often, especially in those group settings?

User: I fear judgment, and I worry that if I reveal too much, I won’t be accepted. It feels safer to just go along with the group.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have fears regarding judgment and acceptance. What if we explored this fear a bit more? Can you think of a specific instance where you felt you could have been more open, but chose not to be?

User: Yes, there was a time when a classmate shared something personal, and I wanted to share my thoughts, but I held back. I felt like nobody would care about my experiences, so I stayed silent.

Consultant: That’s a significant example, Li. It shows a desire to connect but also a fear that keeps you silent. What were the thoughts running through your mind at that moment?

User: I remember thinking that my problems were trivial compared to what others were going through, so why share?

Consultant: It sounds like you might be devaluing your own experiences. What if, instead, you viewed your feelings as valid and worthy of being shared? How might that shift your interactions?

User: I guess I could try to remind myself that everyone has their struggles, and mine matter too. It feels scary, though, to think about opening up.

Consultant: It is a brave step to consider being more open. Perhaps we can explore some small and safe ways for you to express yourself. What do you think about sharing some of your thoughts with one or two close classmates first?

User: That sounds less daunting than sharing in a larger group. I think I could try that.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Setting a small goal can help you gradually open up without feeling overwhelmed. How do you feel about making that plan for your next social interaction?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited. It’s kinda nice to think I might be able to connect better.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you're excited, even if there’s a bit of nervousness. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. What support do you think you might need as you take this step?

User: I guess it would help to remind myself that it's okay to take small steps and that the outcome might not be as bad as I fear.

Consultant: Absolutely! Having that reminder can be powerful. We can also discuss some affirmations or phrases you can use to self-soothe before social interactions. Would that be helpful?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I think it would help ease my anxiety before I try to talk more openly.

Consultant: Great! Let’s brainstorm a few affirmations together. How about something like, “My feelings are valid, and I deserve to be heard”? 

User: I like that! It feels encouraging just saying it.

Consultant: I’m glad you find it encouraging! Let's work on incorporating that into your routine before social situations. As our session is coming to a close, how are you feeling about the steps we discussed today?

User: I feel a bit hopeful, but I still can’t shake the feeling that it might not work out as I hope.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way! Change can be challenging, but the fact that you’re aware and willing to try is a positive step forward. Remember, it’s okay to take your time, and you’re not alone in this process.

User: Thank you! I guess it’s nice to talk to someone who understands.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li! I’m here to support you on this journey. I look forward to hearing how things go in our next session. Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself as you practice these new steps!
###################
Consultant: Hello Li! I'm glad you're here for our session today. I know you've been reflecting on your feelings and the challenges you face in connecting with others. Can you share more about what you've been experiencing lately?

User: Hi. I've been thinking a lot about my relationship with my dormmates. I realize that I often keep them at a distance because of my defense mechanisms. It feels frustrating because I want to be closer to them, but something always holds me back.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a mix of frustration and a desire for connection. Let's dig a little deeper—can you describe a specific situation with your dormmates where you felt your defenses come up?

User: Sure. There was a moment last week when they invited me to join them for a movie night. I wanted to go, but I froze and ended up making excuses not to join. I felt bad about it afterward because I really wanted to be part of the group.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel conflicted in situations like that. You wanted to connect but felt the urge to retreat instead. What thoughts were going through your mind at that moment that made you choose to stay away?

User: I thought that maybe they wouldn't really want me there or that I would just be awkward. It felt safer to avoid the situation than to risk feeling rejected.

Consultant: That makes sense. It sounds like those thoughts gave you a reason to avoid the situation, but also kept you from experiencing the connection you crave. Would you say these thoughts are common for you when facing social situations?

User: Yes, definitely! I often think like that. It's like a loop where I tell myself it's better not to try than to face potential rejection. I know it’s not a healthy way to think, but I can’t help it.

Consultant: Recognizing those patterns is an important first step. What do you think might happen if you challenged those thoughts by allowing yourself to join in?

User: I guess if I let myself go, I might realize people actually enjoy my company. But it’s hard to push those thoughts aside when they feel so real in the moment.

Consultant: That’s totally valid. It feels challenging to push against those ingrained thoughts. Maybe we could work on some strategies together to help you become more comfortable expressing your feelings and trying those social interactions? 

User: That sounds helpful! I want to learn how to open up more and not let those thoughts control me.

Consultant: Great! One approach could be to challenge those negative thoughts. For example, when you feel like you might be rejected, ask yourself, “What evidence do I have that this will happen?” Are you open to trying this technique?

User: Yes, I’d like to try that. It’s just that when I’m in the moment, it feels so overwhelming. 

Consultant: I understand. It can be tough to remember these strategies when emotions run high. Perhaps we could create a small checklist of thoughts to refer to during those moments—something tangible that you can remind yourself of.

User: That sounds like a good idea! I’d like to have something in front of me as a reminder.

Consultant: Next time you find yourself feeling uneasy, you could also connect with a friend beforehand and share how you're feeling. Having someone else aware of your struggles can make it a bit easier. How do you feel about confiding in one of your dormmates? 

User: I’ve thought about it, but I’m worried they might judge me. I really want to be seen as strong and composed.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to fear judgment, but remember that sharing your vulnerabilities can sometimes strengthen those connections rather than weaken them. Playing a role of always being strong can be exhausting, don’t you think?

User: Yes, it is exhausting. I just feel like I'm always on guard.

Consultant: It could be empowering to see vulnerability as a strength rather than a weakness. And it might help you feel less isolated. What would you like to say to a friend if you took that risk?

User: I would want to say that I struggle with letting people in, but I’d like to try and be closer.

Consultant: That’s a brave statement to make! It's a genuine way to connect with others. Maybe you could start by sharing just a little bit at a time—see how they respond. 

User: I could try that. It feels like such a small step, but it sounds manageable.

Consultant: Small steps are key! Each little conversation builds your courage and creates a pathway for deeper connections. How does it feel to think about taking these small steps?

User: It feels a little liberating. I guess I’ve placed so much pressure on myself to change everything at once.

Consultant: It’s important to allow yourself the time to grow. This journey is about progress, not perfection. As we move forward, let's keep reflecting on your experiences and how they shape your feelings towards connection. 

User: I can do that. I appreciate you guiding me through this.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Remember, it’s okay to feel uncertain about this process; it’s all part of growth. Our next step could be to reflect on your experiences and how they evolve through the week. Are you ready to embrace this challenge?

User: Yes, I am ready to try, even though it will be difficult. 

Consultant: Fantastic! As we wrap up today, remember to practice being kind to yourself as you step outside your comfort zone. What’s the one key takeaway for you from our session today?

User: I think it’s the idea of taking small steps instead of trying to change everything at once. That makes it feel possible.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! I believe in your ability to navigate these changes. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. You've made some important steps today, and I'm here to support you.

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to next time too.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've felt a bit frustrated lately. I've been trying to open up more with a classmate, but I'm not sure how to express my true feelings. It seems like my efforts haven't made much progress.

Consultant: I see, it sounds like you're feeling a bit stuck in this process. Can you share a little more about what happened when you tried to express yourself?

User: Well, there was a moment when I thought I could be honest and share something personal, but then I became anxious and ended up saying something very generic instead. I felt so disappointed in myself.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Li. It sounds quite challenging to want to be open but then feel that anxiety take over. Can you tell me how that experience made you feel about yourself?

User: It made me feel like I'll never be able to connect with others. I really want to be a good friend, but I just freeze up when it counts.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way. You want to connect deeply but find yourself facing barriers. Let's explore that feeling a bit more—what thoughts run through your mind in those moments of anxiety?

User: I often think, “What if they don't like me?” or “What if I say something stupid?” It's like my mind just goes into overdrive.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be overwhelming and certainly contribute to your anxiety. Let’s try to recognize them as automatic thoughts. Would you say they are mostly negative or extreme when they appear?

User: Definitely negative. They make me doubt myself. I can’t seem to see things from a different angle when those thoughts come up.

Consultant: That’s a key insight, Li. It's common for these thoughts to create a cycle of anxiety. What if we tried to challenge some of those negative thoughts together? For example, how much evidence do you think supports the idea that someone wouldn’t like you?

User: I guess I don’t really have that much evidence. I mean, there are people who do like me. But in the moment, it feels so real.

Consultant: It's great that you can recognize that. Let's practice imagining that scenario with a friend. If a friend expressed those thoughts to you, what would you say to help them see a different perspective?

User: I would probably tell them that their friends appreciate them for who they are, and that being themselves is enough.

Consultant: Exactly! Now, can we apply that same kind of encouragement to yourself? What might it look like to remind yourself of your worth before entering a social situation?

User: I could remind myself that I do have friends who care about me. Maybe I could even write that down before I meet anyone.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful strategy! Writing it down can help reinforce those positive affirmations. Let's also think about practicing expressing your feelings in smaller, low-pressure situations first. How does that sound?

User: That sounds more manageable. I could try expressing my thoughts to family or closer friends before tackling bigger situations.

Consultant: Yes, starting small can build your confidence! Are there any specific situations coming up where you think you could practice this?

User: I have a family gathering this weekend. I could try sharing my thoughts or feelings about my studies or something personal with them.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! What do you think you might want to share with them?

User: I think I want to talk about how I've been feeling about school and my goals. It feels safe with family.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing that could help you practice articulating your feelings. How do you feel about that idea?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited. I think it’s a step in the right direction.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful attitude! It’s normal to feel both nervous and excited when doing something new. Remember, each small step counts. Would you like to set a goal for how you’ll approach this during your gathering?

User: I think my goal will be to share at least one personal thought or feeling, no matter how small.

Consultant: That sounds like a very attainable goal! I believe you can do it. How will you remind yourself of this goal during the gathering?

User: I’ll write it down in my notes on my phone. I can check it before I go in!

Consultant: Great plan! Having a reminder can help keep you focused. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel you've learned about expressing your true feelings?

User: I’ve realized that it’s okay to feel anxious, but I can challenge those thoughts and practice with people I trust first.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, Li! You’ve made progress in understanding those feelings and developing strategies. As we continue, we'll work on deepening your understanding of what's behind those defense mechanisms. 

User: Thank you! I feel like I've accomplished something today, even if it's just a small step.

Consultant: Absolutely, every step counts! Keep acknowledging your progress, and I’ll be here to support you in your journey. If you need anything, don't hesitate to reach out.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you're here today. I see that you've been making some progress in expressing your true feelings. How have you been feeling about that recently?

User: Hi! I do feel a bit accomplished, especially after sharing my opinions in class. But I still find it challenging to fully open up with others. It’s like there’s this barrier I can’t quite break through.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you feel a sense of accomplishment! Sharing your thoughts in class is a positive step forward. Can you tell me more about what that barrier feels like for you when you're trying to connect with others?

User: It feels like I’m holding back. Even though I want to connect, there's this fear of being vulnerable. I worry that if I show my true self, I might not be accepted or understood.

Consultant: That sounds very tough, and it's completely understandable to feel that way. Many people struggle with vulnerability. What do you think it is about showing your true self that makes you anxious?

User: I guess I fear judgment. I often think about how others perceive me. It’s like I can’t shake off the thought that if I express too much, people might think less of me.

Consultant: You’re expressing a common concern about judgment that many people share. Let's explore that thought a bit more—what evidence do you have that sharing your feelings might lead to negative judgment?

User: Well, I don't have any specific evidence. It’s more of a feeling I have based on past experiences where I felt misunderstood. It makes me hesitant to share.

Consultant: That’s very insightful, Li. It sounds like past experiences are influencing your current feelings. If a friend were in your position, how might you advise them about dealing with fear of judgment?

User: I would tell them that it’s okay to be vulnerable and that not everyone will judge harshly. I think I should remind myself that too, but it’s easier said than done.

Consultant: That's perfectly valid! It’s often easier to give advice than to take it. What if we tried to apply that advice to your own situation? How would you feel if you attempted to view sharing your feelings as a way to connect instead of a potential risk?

User: That sounds like a good approach! Connecting with others is important to me. But I still worry about how they might react when I’m being honest.

Consultant: It's a step-by-step process. Let’s consider trying some experiments where you practice expressing your feelings and notice the reactions. You could start with smaller, safe interactions. How does that feel to you?

User: I think that could work! Starting small seems less overwhelming. I could try being a bit more open with a close friend first.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! As you practice with your friend, how might you prepare yourself to manage any discomfort that arises?

User: I could remind myself that their reaction doesn’t define my worth and that it’s okay if they don’t understand immediately. It’s part of the process.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reminding yourself of your self-worth is crucial. As you practice, notice not only the reactions from others but also how expressing your feelings makes you feel. What are your thoughts about that?

User: I never thought about how I might feel after sharing. I guess if I focus on my feelings, it could lessen my worry about their reactions.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! Focusing on your feelings can indeed shift your perspective. How do you feel about keeping a record of your experiences along this journey? It might help to reflect on your progress.

User: I think that’s a good idea! Writing it down might help me understand my feelings better and see if there’s improvement over time.

Consultant: Yes, tracking your thoughts and feelings can provide valuable insights. Let’s discuss what specific situations you could use as opportunities to practice this emotional expression. Are there any upcoming group activities or discussions where you might try this?

User: I have a group project coming up. I could share my ideas and feelings about our progress and dynamics.

Consultant: Perfect opportunity! Sharing your thoughts in that setting aligns well with your goal. How do you plan on communicating your feelings and ideas during that project?

User: I think I’ll start by expressing my excitement about our progress and then share any concerns I might have. I could even ask my teammates how they feel too.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid approach! Engaging others and showing your enthusiasm can create a supportive environment. How do you anticipate you will feel after sharing your thoughts?

User: I’m a bit anxious just thinking about it, but also hopeful that it might feel rewarding. Connecting with my teammates could be a great experience.

Consultant: That hopefulness is a positive sign! Remember, feeling some anxiety is normal. The key is to focus on your willingness to connect. What strategies can you remind yourself of to stay grounded during the group project?

User: I could use positive affirmations or remind myself that it's a learning experience. Focusing on genuine connection rather than perfection might help too.

Consultant: Wonderful strategies! Positive affirmations can reinforce your confidence. As we prepare to wrap up today, let’s highlight your progress so far. What insights have you gained through our discussion today?

User: I’ve realized that being vulnerable is a process, and it’s okay to take small steps. I appreciate the reminder that my feelings are valid.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Recognizing the validity of your feelings is a significant step. Moving forward, how can you reinforce these insights in your daily interactions?

User: I’ll try to practice being more open and remind myself that not everyone will judge harshly. And keeping a record of my experiences can guide me too.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Li. Remember, every step matters in your journey toward authenticity. Today has been a great session, and I’m proud of your progress. If you ever feel the need for support again, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you so much! I feel encouraged to keep exploring this. I’ll definitely try the strategies we discussed.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! Welcome to our session today. I'm glad we could meet again. Last time, we talked about your feelings and experiences in the team project. How have things been for you since then?

User: Hi! I’ve been trying to express my feelings more openly with my team members. It’s been a bit challenging, but I think I’m getting more comfortable.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like you're taking important steps toward being more authentic in your interactions. Can you share an experience where you tried to express yourself in the team?

User: Well, during one of our meetings, I shared an idea I had for our project. I felt nervous, but I pushed myself to speak up. I was surprised when my teammates actually supported my suggestion!

Consultant: That's a significant achievement! How did it feel to receive support from your teammates after expressing your idea?

User: It felt really good! I realized that they valued my input. However, I still find it hard to open up about my personal feelings, like when I'm stressed or anxious.

Consultant: I can understand that. Sharing personal feelings can be quite vulnerable. What do you think makes it difficult for you to share those feelings?

User: I guess I’ve always been taught to be strong and not show weakness. Part of me worries that if I share my stress, people might see me as less capable.

Consultant: That’s a common concern, but it’s important to recognize that expressing vulnerability can actually strengthen relationships. How might you begin to test out sharing some of those feelings with your team in a safe way?

User: Maybe I could start by mentioning when I’m feeling a bit stressed about our deadlines. I don’t know how they’ll react, though.

Consultant: That sounds like a good starting point! You can frame it in a way that emphasizes collaboration, like saying, “I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed with our deadlines. I’d love to hear if anyone else is feeling the same, and maybe we can brainstorm together.” How does that approach sound to you?

User: That sounds manageable! It feels less like I’m just dumping my feelings and more like I’m opening the door for conversation. 

Consultant: Exactly! You're inviting support rather than just expressing distress. Do you think you could try that in your next team meeting?

User: Yes, I will try that! I feel like it could help me connect better with them.

Consultant: That's an excellent attitude. After you try this, we can discuss how it went. Remember to reflect on both your feelings and your teammates' responses. What goals do you want to set for this week in terms of communication with your team?

User: I think my goal will be to share my feelings at least once during our next meeting. I also want to observe how others respond when I do.

Consultant: Those are clear and actionable goals! Setting a specific target like that can build your confidence. When you achieve this, it could really enhance your engagement with the group. What do you expect to feel after expressing yourself?

User: I hope to feel relief and maybe even a little pride for being brave enough to share.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! Recognizing your courage is key to building confidence. Let’s also think about how you can manage any discomfort that might come up. What techniques could you use to calm yourself beforehand?

User: I could practice some deep breathing or even visualize the meeting going well before it happens.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies. Visualizing success can help reduce anxiety significantly. Also, consider giving yourself a little pep talk, reinforcing that it's okay to be honest about your experiences. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel good about it! It gives me something to work towards. 

Consultant: Wonderful! As we wrap up today, let's take a moment to reflect on the progress you’ve made. How have you grown through our sessions so far?

User: I think I’ve become more aware of my feelings and how to express them. It feels less daunting now to think about showing my true self.

Consultant: That's a valuable insight! It’s great to see you acknowledging your growth. As we move forward, what steps can you take to remind yourself of this progress when faced with social anxiety in the future?

User: I can remind myself of the positive experiences I've had when I’ve opened up and that those moments can foster deeper connections.

Consultant: Absolutely! Holding onto those positive experiences will be vital in reducing feelings of pressure. Remember, your feelings are valid, and sharing them can be quite powerful. I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I feel more optimistic and ready to give this a try.

Consultant: You're welcome, Li! I'm excited for you, and remember, it's all about taking one step at a time. If you need anything before our next meeting, feel free to reach out. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm really glad to see you again today. You mentioned before that you’ve been feeling less social pressure and have started to feel more confident in your interpersonal relationships. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel much better! I've been interacting more naturally with my team members, and it's been a relief. I actually enjoyed working with them.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made significant progress. What specific situations or interactions have you felt more comfortable in recently?

User: Well, in our last team meeting, I contributed more and shared my ideas openly. I even initiated a discussion, which I usually find hard to do.

Consultant: That’s a big step forward! Initiating discussions can be challenging. How did it feel to take that initiative in front of your team?

User: It felt empowering! I was nervous at first, but once I started talking, it felt natural. I realized they actually valued my input.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you felt valued. How do you think this experience might influence your future interactions with others?

User: I think it’ll motivate me to continue being more open. I want to build more connections and trust with others, instead of holding back.

Consultant: Seeking connections sounds like a meaningful goal. What steps can you take to keep nurturing this openness?

User: I guess I could try to initiate conversations more often, even outside of project work. Maybe join a student club to meet more people?

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Joining a club could provide you with a comfortable environment to practice socializing. Are there any specific clubs you've considered?

User: I've thought about joining a psychology club since it aligns with my studies. I might meet others who share similar interests.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect fit! Engaging with like-minded individuals could enhance your confidence further. What might be your first step to take action on this plan?

User: I could check if the club is recruiting new members this semester and attend an introductory meeting.

Consultant: Attending an introductory meeting is a great first step! It allows you to explore the environment and see how it feels. I'd also like to discuss how to deal with any stress that might arise during this process. How do you usually handle anxiety in social situations?

User: Usually, I just try to distract myself or tell myself it’s not a big deal, but I still end up feeling nervous.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel nervous; many people do. Instead of distraction, we could explore techniques to help you manage that anxiety more effectively. Would that be helpful for you?

User: Yes, definitely! I could use some techniques to stay calm.

Consultant: Let’s talk about some breathing exercises and grounding techniques that can help ease anxiety in social situations. Would you be open to trying some of those?

User: Sure! I like the idea of focusing on my breath. 

Consultant: Perfect! Whenever you feel that anxiousness rising, you can take a few deep breaths. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold it for a moment, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Would you like to give it a try now?

User: Okay, let’s give it a go!

Consultant: Great! Take a comfortable position, close your eyes if you feel comfortable, and try inhaling deeply… Hold for a moment... and now exhale fully. How does that feel?

User: I feel a bit more relaxed already! It’s nice to take a moment like this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! These techniques can help ground you in social settings. As you practice, it’ll likely become easier to approach others confidently. How do you feel about incorporating this into your action plan?

User: I think it’ll definitely help! I can practice this before joining the club or interacting with new people.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! It sounds like you’re building a solid action plan. As you continue to engage, let’s also think about setting milestones to celebrate your progress. What achievements can we recognize together over time?

User: I’d like to celebrate completing the club’s introductory meeting and making a few new friends.

Consultant: Those are wonderful milestones! It’s important to acknowledge these steps. Celebrate your growth, no matter how small it feels. How have you felt about the progress you’ve made during our sessions?

User: I feel like I’ve grown a lot in terms of confidence and social skills. I don’t dread socializing as much anymore, which is a relief!

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Recognizing your progress is crucial. As we wrap up today’s session, what insight or reflection stands out to you?

User: I think just realizing that I can be open and enjoy social situations is huge for me. It’s a big change from how I used to feel!

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve worked hard to reach this point, and you should be proud of it. Remember, the skills you’ve learned are tools you can use moving forward. 

User: I will! Thank you for all your help. I feel prepared to take the next steps.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure seeing your progress. Let’s plan to follow up soon to see how things are going. Remember, if you need support, I’m here whenever you need to talk. 

User: I will reach out for sure! Thanks again!

Consultant: Take care, Li! I look forward to hearing about your experiences in the future. Bye for now!
