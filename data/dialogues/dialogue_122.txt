Consultant: Hello! It's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately? 

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious. I don't want to go to school, and I'm scared that I won't be able to handle things there. I feel like my mom is getting frustrated with me.

Consultant: I can see that you're feeling quite a bit of pressure right now, especially with school and your relationship with your mom. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel anxious about going to school? 

User: I just feel really afraid when I think about it. I worry that something bad will happen, like if I have to answer a question in class or if people laugh at me. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It's understandable to feel that way, especially when there’s so much pressure. Could you share what thoughts go through your mind when you think about having to talk in class or being laughed at? 

User: I keep thinking that I’ll say something stupid or that no one will like me. It makes me feel like I want to hide. 

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite overwhelming for you. What feelings do you experience in your body when you have those thoughts? 

User: I feel really tight in my chest and my stomach hurts. Sometimes, I feel like I can’t breathe properly, and I just freeze. 

Consultant: That sounds really distressing, L. It's important to acknowledge how your body reacts to these feelings. Have you noticed if there are specific situations at school that make these feelings stronger? 

User: Yes, especially when the teacher asks a question or when we have to work in groups. I just want to disappear. 

Consultant: I completely understand. Group work can be really intimidating, especially when you're already feeling anxious. Let's think about this together. What would you like to change about how you feel in those situations? 

User: I wish I could just feel normal and confident, like everyone else. I want to be able to speak up without being scared. 

Consultant: That’s a really important goal. Building confidence can take time, but it's definitely possible. Have there been any times, even in small ways, when you felt more comfortable speaking up? 

User: Sometimes, if I’m with my best friend, I can talk a little more. But alone, I feel very different, like I'm not myself. 

Consultant: Having a supportive friend can definitely make a difference. It's great that you feel a little more comfortable around her. How do you think you could use that support to help you in class? 

User: Maybe I could sit near her or try to talk like I do with her when I'm with the others. But I’m still afraid. 

Consultant: That’s a good strategy! You could try practicing speaking up in low-pressure situations, like during lunch or with your friend. How do you think that might help you become more comfortable? 

User: I guess it might help me get used to talking more, so I don’t feel so scared when I have to speak in class. 

Consultant: Absolutely! It could be a great way to gradually build your confidence. Let’s also think about how your relationship with your mom fits into this. How do you feel when she's frustrated with you? 

User: When she gets mad, it makes me feel guilty and more scared. Sometimes, I just want her to help me feel better instead of being upset. 

Consultant: That’s very understandable. It’s hard when someone you rely on is frustrated with you. Have you been able to express how her reaction affects you? 

User: Not really. I just feel like I shouldn’t bother her with my problems, so I keep quiet. 

Consultant: It’s okay to share your feelings with her, L. Sometimes parents don’t realize how their words impact us. Would you be open to talking to her about how you’ve been feeling? 

User: Maybe. But I worry she will think I’m too dependent on her. 

Consultant: It’s natural to have those worries, but it’s also important to communicate your feelings. It could help both of you understand each other better. Would you like to explore how to approach that conversation? 

User: I guess I could tell her I feel scared and ask for her help in a specific way. Maybe that would make it easier. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Asking for help doesn’t mean you’re overly dependent; it shows you want to work on your feelings. What specific thing do you think would be helpful for her to know when you speak with her? 

User: I think I want her to know that I get really scared about school and that I want to try doing things myself but need her support. 

Consultant: That's a clear and honest approach, L. It allows her to see that you're trying to grow while still needing some support. How do you feel about discussing these feelings with her after our session? 

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also like it could be helpful. 

Consultant: It's normal to feel nervous when addressing these feelings, but it sounds like you're on the right track. Before we finish today, what's your main takeaway from our conversation? 

User: I think I’ve realized that I can talk about my feelings more, and maybe start small with my mom and my friend.  

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Remember, it’s okay to take small steps towards feeling more comfortable. I'm here to support you through this process. Thank you for sharing with me today, L. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful now. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! I believe you'll continue to make progress. Remember, you can always reach out if you need to talk again. Take care!

Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I feel a bit nervous still, especially thinking about going back to class. I’m still scared of being called on by the teacher like last time.

Consultant: I understand that this fear of being called on in class can be really overwhelming. It’s normal to feel anxious in situations like that. Can you tell me more about how this fear affects you during class?

User: I feel like all eyes are on me, and I can't think straight. When the teacher asks questions, I just freeze up, and I worry about what others will think if I get the answer wrong.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure in those moments. This fear of judgment can definitely make it hard to participate. Have you thought about what specific thoughts go through your mind when you’re in that situation?

User: I just keep worrying that everyone will laugh at me if I mess up. I think things like, "What if I'm the only one who doesn’t know the answer?"

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite powerful. It's understandable to fear judgment, but let’s try to challenge those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that your classmates would laugh at you? 

User: I don’t have any solid proof, but I just feel like they would. I guess I'm just afraid of looking foolish.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. It’s common to worry about looking foolish, but remember, everyone makes mistakes and learns from them. If a friend was feeling this way, what would you tell them?

User: I would tell them it’s okay to make mistakes and that everyone is learning. But when I'm in class, it doesn’t feel the same for me.

Consultant: That’s an excellent insight. You’re already being kind to someone else in that situation, but it’s harder to extend that kindness to yourself. What if, during your next class, you practiced speaking to yourself as you would to a friend? 

User: That sounds nice, but I still feel scared to try. 

Consultant: Feeling scared is natural, but can we think of small steps you could take towards participating in class? Perhaps starting by answering questions quietly, or even just raising your hand occasionally?

User: I think I could try raising my hand, but I’d still worry about being wrong. 

Consultant: That’s perfectly okay. What if you approached it as a learning experience? Each time you raise your hand could be a step towards getting more comfortable, regardless of whether the answer is right or wrong.

User: That makes sense. I guess I could see it as practice rather than pressure.

Consultant: Exactly! This reframing of thoughts can help lessen some of the fear. How do you feel about identifying specific situations in class where you might feel more comfortable trying to participate?

User: Mmm, maybe I’d feel better answering questions in subjects I’m more confident about, like math. 

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Focusing on subjects where you feel stronger can build your confidence. Would you be open to setting a goal for your next class, like trying to answer at least one question in math? 

User: I could try that! Just one question seems manageable.

Consultant: Wonderful! Now, let’s briefly reflect on how this plan makes you feel. What emotions come up for you when you think about this goal?

User: I feel a bit excited, but also nervous. 

Consultant: Those mixed feelings are completely normal. Excitement shows your willingness to grow, while nerves show that you're stepping out of your comfort zone. With each small step, you’re building resilience. 

User: That’s true. I wouldn’t mind feeling like I’m improving.

Consultant: I believe you are heading in the right direction! Remember to be gentle with yourself during this process. After trying this in class, let’s discuss how it went in our next session.

User: Okay, I’ll do my best! 

Consultant: That’s all I can ask for! Just remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Lastly, do you have any thoughts or feelings you’d like to express before we wrap up for today?

User: I just hope I can remember to be kind to myself. 

Consultant: Absolutely, being kind to yourself is vital. It’s a journey, and you’re not alone in this. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Looking forward to our next session!

User: Thanks! I feel a bit more hopeful now. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad to hear that. Have a great day, and I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, L! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been okay, but I still feel really shy when I try to talk to other kids. I attempted to join some activities, but I just couldn’t engage.

Consultant: I understand that can be tough. It sounds like you really want to connect with your peers, but the shyness is holding you back. What do you think makes you feel shy in those situations?

User: I guess I worry that they won’t want to talk to me or they might think I’m awkward. I just freeze up.

Consultant: That’s a very common feeling, and many people experience similar thoughts. If you could visualize your ideal interaction with your classmates, what would it look like? 

User: I would love to feel confident and actually be able to contribute to conversations without feeling scared.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal, L. Building confidence is key. Have you thought about small steps we could take to help you feel more comfortable in those situations?

User: I suppose I could try saying "hi" to someone first, but it still terrifies me.

Consultant: Starting with a simple greeting is a great first step! Remember, it doesn’t have to be perfect. What if you practiced that greeting at home first? Would that help you feel more ready?

User: Yeah, I could try practicing with my mom. She would help me, I think.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Practicing with someone you trust can ease your nerves. How about set a goal for this week, like saying "hi" to one person during your next class or break?

User: Okay, I think I can do that. But I’m worried I’ll forget or chicken out.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way! To help with this, how about setting a reminder on your phone or writing it down in your planner to reinforce your plan?

User: That might work! It would remind me to at least give it a try.

Consultant: Exactly! And when you do this, I encourage you to note how it goes—what you felt, and how the other person responded. Are you okay with that?

User: Yes, I will definitely write it down. I think that could help me see that it’s not as scary as I think.

Consultant: Great attitude, L! Reflecting on your experiences can offer valuable insights. Can we also brainstorm some conversation starters to help break the ice?

User: Sure! What kinds of things should I say?

Consultant: Simple questions like “What’s your favorite subject?” or “Have you seen any good movies lately?” can work well. What do you think about those?

User: Those are good! They sound easy to say. 

Consultant: I’m glad you think so! It’s all about making it feel natural. You can even practice those with your mom, too. How does that sound?

User: I feel more confident about it now. I think I can give it a shot.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Just remember to be kind to yourself, no matter how it goes. Trying is the most important part. How about we plan to discuss how it went next time?

User: I’d like that! I want to share how I did.

Consultant: I look forward to hearing about your experiences, L! It helps us understand your progress. You’re making strides already by even contemplating this. Is there anything else on your mind today?

User: Not really. I feel good about our plan!

Consultant: Fantastic! You’re taking these steps for yourself, and that’s commendable. Before we end today, let’s recap what you’ll do until our next session. 

User: I’ll practice saying “hi” to someone and using some conversation starters. I’ll also keep a note of how it goes.

Consultant: Perfect! I’m proud of you for setting these goals. Remember, every small step counts. I believe you can do this, L. See you next time!

User: Thanks so much! I feel excited to try it out.
###################
Consultant: Hello, L! I'm really glad to see you today. It sounds like you’ve had a positive experience with your group activity at school recently. How have you been feeling about that?

User: Hi! Yes, I felt really happy during the group activity. It was nice to work together and share ideas. I wish I could do more activities like that.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Working together can be such a rewarding experience. What specifically did you enjoy about collaborating with your peers?

User: I liked that we could help each other with the tasks. It felt like we were all part of a team, and I actually spoke up a few times.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It sounds like you recognized your ability to contribute, which is a big step. How do you think participating in more group activities could benefit you?

User: I think it might help me feel more confident around others and maybe even make new friends.

Consultant: Absolutely, feeling confident in social situations can open doors to new friendships. Let’s reflect on what you experienced in that group activity. What were some moments that made you feel good?

User: I remember when we finished a task and everyone cheered. I felt really included and proud of what we had done together.

Consultant: That cheering must have felt like a great affirmation of your efforts! It shows how valuable teamwork can be. How might you carry that feeling into future activities?

User: Maybe I should remember that it’s okay to join in and that my ideas are helpful. I could try speaking up more next time.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan, L! Remembering that your contributions matter can help you feel more empowered. Is there a specific type of group activity that you’re interested in trying next?

User: I think I’d like to join a club or a team, but I’m a bit scared about meeting new people.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel a bit scared, especially when meeting new people. How about we discuss some small steps you can take to ease into it?

User: Maybe I could start by attending a meeting as just a listener, so I can get to know the group without speaking too much.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach! Being an observer at first can help you feel more comfortable. Once you feel ready, you can start sharing your thoughts. How does that sound?

User: It sounds good! I think that might help me a lot.

Consultant: Great! You’re already taking proactive steps. Beyond that, how can you remind yourself of the positive experience you had during your last group activity?

User: Maybe I can write down what I liked about the group work and read it when I feel nervous.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Keeping a record of your positive experiences will reinforce those feelings. Have you had any conversations with your mom about this experience?

User: Yes, I told her I had fun, and she was really happy for me. I like talking to her about school.

Consultant: It’s lovely that you can share these moments with your mom. What can you do to maintain that connection while also fostering your independence?

User: I could ask her for advice when I'm trying to decide on a club, but I want to make my own choice in the end.

Consultant: That’s a healthy balance! Seeking her advice while making your own decisions shows growth. How are you feeling about becoming more independent in these areas?

User: I feel a bit excited but also nervous. It’s hard to break away from relying on her so much.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel that way, especially when you’ve had such a close relationship. You’re taking a big step towards independence, and it’s okay to feel a mix of emotions. What small action could you take to start feeling more self-sufficient?

User: I guess I could start by preparing my own things for school in the morning instead of asking her to help.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful first step! Preparing for school independently will give you a sense of accomplishment. How do you think that will make you feel?

User: I think I would feel proud of myself and more capable.

Consultant: Absolutely! Feeling proud of your accomplishments can boost your confidence significantly. As we move forward, let’s focus on some specific strategies that can help you feel more comfortable in groups. How does that sound?

User: Yes, I’d like that! What strategies can we use?

Consultant: We can practice role-playing some scenarios where you might interact with others. This way, you can build confidence in speaking up and sharing your thoughts. Would you like to start with an example?

User: Sure! I think that would be helpful.

Consultant: Let’s imagine you’re in a group discussion about a project. How would you introduce your idea to the group?

User: I’d probably say something like, “I think we could do it this way…” but I might feel shy.

Consultant: That’s a great start! You’re expressing your idea clearly. Remember, it’s okay to feel shy, but practicing will help lessen that feeling. Let’s try a few variations of how to introduce your ideas. 

User: Okay! I’d love to practice different ways to say it.

Consultant: Excellent choice! The more you practice, the more comfortable you will feel when the time comes. We can also set some goals for your next group experience. What would you like to achieve?

User: I want to speak up at least once during the meeting and feel part of the team.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, L! Speaking up is a great way to affirm your place in the group. As we wrap up, what key takeaway would you like to remember from our session today?

User: I want to remember that my ideas are important and that I can learn to be more independent.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, L! I’m so proud of the progress you’re making. Remember, every small step counts toward your growth. If you continue to apply these strategies, I believe you’ll see great results. 

User: Thank you! I feel more confident about trying new things now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m excited for you and the journey ahead. If you ever need support, I’m here for you. Enjoy your upcoming adventures!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really happy to see you today. How have things been since our last session?

User: Hi! Things have been okay, but I still feel a little unsure about doing things by myself. I want to be more independent, but sometimes it feels hard.

Consultant: I understand. It's great that you're wanting to be more independent. Can you share what specific activities you'd like to try on your own?

User: Well, I want to start by organizing my school bag myself and maybe even getting ready in the morning without my mom's help.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan! How do you feel about taking those steps? What do you think might help you feel more confident while doing them?

User: I think if I practice it a few times, I might get more comfortable. But I worry that I won't do it right or that I'll forget something.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a bit anxious about these changes. Remember, practicing often can really help you become more confident. Would you like to come up with a simple checklist together for organizing your bag?

User: Yes, that would be helpful. I sometimes forget what to pack for school.

Consultant: Great! Let’s write down the essentials you need in your bag for a day at school. This can help ease your worries. What do you usually take with you?

User: I usually need my books, notebooks, pencil case, and my water bottle. 

Consultant: Perfect! We can start with those items. How about we also add a few extra items in case you need them?

User: That sounds good. Maybe I could add a snack, too. 

Consultant: Excellent idea! Snacks can be very helpful during school. So, what if we set a goal to try packing your bag independently for the next couple of days? How does that sound?

User: I think I can do that. But if I forget something, I’ll feel bad.

Consultant: It's okay! Mistakes are part of learning. If you forget something, you can remind yourself that it's a chance to improve next time. What could you tell yourself when you feel anxious about forgetting?

User: Maybe I could say, "It's okay to make mistakes; I can learn from them." 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful affirmation! Keeping that in mind can help reduce your anxiety. How do you feel about using that when packing your bag?

User: I think it will help. I’ll try to remember that.

Consultant: I'm proud of your willingness to try! Besides packing your bag, is there anything else you'd like to discuss regarding your independence?

User: Yes! I really want to communicate better with my mom, especially after our talk. Sometimes I struggle to express my thoughts.

Consultant: That's a very important aspect of your journey towards independence. How do you think you could practice communicating your thoughts to your mom?

User: Maybe I could write her a note about how I feel or ask her questions after school.

Consultant: Writing a note is a great idea! It gives you the space to gather your thoughts clearly. What kind of things would you want to express in that note?

User: I want to tell her that I appreciate her help but that I want to try doing things myself, too.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! It's great that you want to appreciate her support while asserting your need for independence. Would you like to try writing that note together now?

User: Sure! I could start with "Dear Mom, thank you for always helping me..." 

Consultant: That’s a lovely start! How about we continue from there? What else would you like to say?

User: I want to say that I feel grateful for her but want to learn to do things on my own, like packing my bag. 

Consultant: Wonderful! You're expressing your feelings honestly and positively. This will definitely help strengthen your relationship with your mom. How do you think she will feel when she reads it?

User: I think she'll be happy that I’m trying to be more independent. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Showing her your effort will likely make her proud. After you give her the note, how do you plan to communicate more openly with her?

User: I could ask her about her day every evening; that might help.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Engaging in conversations can improve your connection with her. What do you hope to gain from those daily conversations?

User: I hope we can share more things and understand each other better.

Consultant: That's a wonderful goal! Strengthening your understanding can lead to a healthier relationship. Is there something specific you would like to discuss with her during those conversations?

User: I want to know about her work and what she likes about teaching.

Consultant: That’s an excellent topic to choose! Not only will you learn more about her, but it can also spark conversations about your own experiences. How do you feel about discussing this with her?

User: I feel good about it. It seems like it would be nice to share those moments together.

Consultant: It surely will be. Sharing moments like that will help both of you feel closer. As we wrap up our session today, how has your perspective changed regarding your independence and communication with your mom?

User: I feel more confident that I can manage things on my own and speak to my mom about my feelings. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! You have made significant progress. Remember, it’s okay to take small steps forward. I believe you can achieve your goals. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm here to support you. Keep practicing, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session.
