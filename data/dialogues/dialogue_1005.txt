Consultant: Hello! It’s great to see you today. Before we dive into our session, I’d like to hear about how you’ve been feeling since our last meeting. What’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling a lot of pressure and anxiety. I can't shake off this feeling of frustration, especially with school. I notice I struggle to interact with others, which makes me feel isolated.

Consultant: I really appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like the pressure from school and the difficulty in connecting with others is weighing heavily on you. Can you tell me more about specific situations where you felt this anxiety or frustration?

User: Well, whenever I try to join a conversation or even just talk in class, I feel this wave of anxiety. Sometimes, I can't even get the words out, especially with important phrases like “I want” or “no.” It’s so embarrassing.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly tough. It seems like finding the right words can make social interactions feel overwhelming for you. How do these experiences of feeling stuck make you feel emotionally?

User: It's really disheartening. I often feel like I'm not good enough, which increases my anxiety. I keep worrying about how others see me, and that makes me want to avoid talking altogether.

Consultant: I can see how this triggers a cycle of anxiety and self-doubt for you. Let’s take a moment to explore what thoughts come to your mind when you’re in those situations. What are you thinking just before you struggle to speak?

User: I often think, “Everyone is judging me” or “What if I embarrass myself?” It’s like my mind spirals into these worst-case scenarios.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite challenging to deal with. Let’s examine them together. Do you have any evidence that people are judging you, or is it possible that your mind is creating those fears?

User: I guess I don’t have solid evidence. It’s more of a feeling than a fact. I just assume people think poorly of me.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those feelings, especially after your past experiences. What if we tried to think about a time when someone interacted with you positively? Could that provide a different perspective?

User: Well, there was a time when a classmate helped me with my studies, and they seemed genuinely friendly. I suppose that was nice.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful example! It shows that not everyone is critical. Let’s use that positive experience. When you feel anxious next time, could you remind yourself about that friendly interaction? 

User: I could try that. It makes sense to focus on the positive. But I still worry about talking in groups.

Consultant: That’s completely normal. Group situations can be intimidating. How about we brainstorm some small steps you could take to gradually face these group interactions?

User: Maybe I could start by asking a simple question in class. That doesn’t seem too overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Starting small can really help. How would you feel about practicing what you might say in those instances?

User: Practicing could be helpful. I often rehearse things alone, but it’s hard when I’m actually in front of people.

Consultant: Rehearsing is a good starting point! Let’s think about a specific question you might ask. What topic would you feel comfortable discussing?

User: I think I could ask something about the homework. That’s familiar to me.

Consultant: Perfect! It’s great that you’re identifying familiar topics. How about we practice that question together a few times right now?

User: Sure, I can do that. “Can you explain this homework problem to me? I’m a bit confused.”

Consultant: That was really good! How did saying that feel for you?

User: It felt a little scary, but also empowering. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Feeling scared is natural, but recognizing that you can still express yourself is vital. How can you take this feeling into your next interactions?

User: I suppose I could remind myself that it’s okay to be nervous and that I’ve done it successfully in practice.

Consultant: Yes, exactly! You can acknowledge your nerves while also affirming your readiness to engage. Now, let’s discuss ways to reinforce this positive behavior in the future.

User: Maybe I could set small goals for myself, like speaking up once in each class.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Setting goals helps create a pathway to follow. As we approach our session’s end, let’s summarize what we’ve worked on. What are some strategies you feel confident in moving forward?

User: I’ve learned to challenge my negative thoughts, practiced asking questions, and set small goals for participation.

Consultant: Those are significant steps! Remember, it will take time and practice, but you are making progress. Finally, let’s think about how you can maintain these skills if you start feeling overwhelmed again.

User: I could write down my thoughts and practice my questions to remind myself of what I’ve learned.

Consultant: Perfect! Keeping those tools handy can really help during tough moments. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. I’m proud of the steps you’re taking, and I’m here for you whenever you need support. 

User: Thank you! I feel a little better already, even though it’s still challenging.

Consultant: That’s completely normal. Growth takes time, and you’re on the right path. Keep up the great work, and I look forward to seeing you next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling lately about your interactions with others?

User: Hi. I've been trying to participate more in class activities, but every time I try to speak, I just feel so anxious. It’s like I get stuck, especially with certain words. I feel really self-conscious.

Consultant: I completely understand. It sounds like you’re putting in effort to engage, but the anxiety around speaking is making it difficult. Can you share more about what goes through your mind in those moments of anxiety?

User: When I start to talk, I panic. I think about how everyone is watching me and judging me. I worry that I will stutter and look foolish, which makes me even more scared to say anything.

Consultant: It sounds like there's a strong fear of how others perceive you when you're speaking. This fear can really heighten anxiety. What would it mean for you to feel more comfortable speaking up in class?

User: It would mean a lot. I just want to express my thoughts without feeling so embarrassed. I wish I could participate without it being such a struggle.

Consultant: That’s a valid desire. Feeling comfortable to share your thoughts without fear could greatly enhance your experience. Let’s explore this further—when you think about talking to your classmates, what negative thoughts come to mind?

User: I often think, “What if they laugh at me?” or “What if I can’t get the words out?” These thoughts make me feel paralyzed.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound overwhelming. It’s important to recognize that our minds can sometimes distort reality in moments of fear. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their worries?

User: I’d probably say that it’s okay to make mistakes and that people are usually more focused on themselves than on others. But it’s hard to remember that for myself.

Consultant: Absolutely, that’s a very compassionate perspective. It’s all about giving yourself the same kindness you would offer a friend. Let’s work on challenging those negative thoughts together. Is there evidence that supports the idea that your classmates are judging you harshly?

User: I don’t really have proof. It’s just a feeling I have based on my past experiences.

Consultant: It’s understandable that past experiences influence how you feel now. However, recognizing that these are feelings, not facts, can be liberating. What might happen if you tried to speak up despite those feelings? 

User: I guess nothing terrible would happen. It’s just the fear of the unknown that holds me back.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Facing the unknown can be daunting, but it might also lead to unexpected positive experiences. How about we devise a small, manageable step for you to engage in a conversation in a low-pressure situation this week?

User: That sounds okay. Maybe I could try speaking up in a group where I feel a bit safer, like with a few classmates I trust.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! By starting small, you can gradually build your confidence. How do you feel about setting a specific goal, like sharing your opinion on a topic during a group discussion?

User: I think that could work. If I focus on just one small comment, it feels less scary.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on one comment makes it feel more achievable. Please remember to remind yourself that imperfection is fine. Trying is what matters. How does thinking about this plan make you feel?

User: I feel a bit hopeful, but also worried I might mess it up.

Consultant: Hope is a positive feeling to have! It’s natural to have worries, but try to shift your expectations to learning rather than perfection. Every conversation is a chance to grow. Can you share how you plan to cope if you do feel anxious during that moment?

User: Maybe I can take a deep breath before speaking. I’ve heard that helps.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be very effective in calming your nerves. It's a simple yet powerful tool. How will you remind yourself to use this technique?

User: I could write a note to myself or practice it a few times before I speak up.

Consultant: Writing a note is an excellent idea. It reinforces your plan and serves as a positive reminder. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on your progress so far. What do you think you’ve learned about yourself?

User: I’ve learned that I can set small goals and that I actually want to improve my speaking. It feels good to recognize that.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization, and it reflects your willingness to grow. Remember, the journey is gradual, and it’s okay to take small steps. Looking ahead, what strategies will you carry with you as you face these speaking situations? 

User: I’ll remind myself of my strengths and practice breathing. I’ll also try to focus less on what others think.

Consultant: Those are empowering strategies to keep in mind. It was great talking with you today, and I’m proud of the progress you’re making. Remember, these strategies are tools you can build upon. If you ever need support, don’t hesitate to reach out again.

User: Thank you so much! I feel more confident about trying to talk in class now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling pretty anxious, especially about talking to my classmates. I really want to improve my communication, but I worry I won't be able to express myself clearly.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when you have the desire to connect but feel uncertain about expressing yourself. Can you share more about what you're afraid might happen when you try to communicate?

User: I just fear that they will notice my stutter and judge me. It makes me hesitate when I want to ask for help with my studies.

Consultant: It sounds like you're concerned about being perceived negatively because of your speech difficulties. Let’s dive a bit deeper—what feelings come up for you when you think about approaching your classmates for help?

User: I feel embarrassed and anxious. It's like I want to reach out, but this tightness in my chest keeps me from doing it.

Consultant: That tightness can be quite uncomfortable. You're navigating a mix of desire to connect and fear of judgment. How do you usually cope with these feelings when they arise?

User: I often just avoid talking to anyone, which is probably not the best solution, but it feels safer at the moment.

Consultant: Avoidance can seem like a quick fix, but it might be contributing to your anxiety in the long run. Let's focus on this a bit. Can you think of a specific instance where you avoided speaking up recently?

User: Well, last week, I wanted to ask a classmate about an assignment, but I just turned around and left instead.

Consultant: That sounds tough. In that moment, what thoughts were running through your mind that led you to walk away?

User: I thought about how my voice might crack or how they wouldn't understand me. I just felt so inadequate.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very self-critical. Let’s explore them together. You mentioned feeling inadequate—what evidence do you have that your classmates would react negatively?

User: I guess I don't really know. It's just a fear I have based on past experiences.

Consultant: It’s essential to challenge those fears. If a friend were in your position, would you think they were inadequate for struggling with communication?

User: No, I would probably encourage them to try anyway.

Consultant: Exactly! It might help to reframe how you view your own difficulties. What if, instead of seeing your stutter as a barrier, you saw it as part of your unique journey? 

User: That sounds like a positive way to think about it, but I still worry.

Consultant: That's valid. It's a process. How about we set a small goal for you this week—like starting a brief conversation with one classmate? How does that sound?

User: That sounds manageable. Maybe I could ask them about the assignment?

Consultant: Yes, that sounds perfect! Remember, it's about the effort rather than the outcome. If the conversation doesn’t go as planned, what could you learn from that experience?

User: I could see what worked and what didn't. Maybe I could ask for feedback about my communication.

Consultant: Great idea! Gathering feedback can provide valuable insights. Also, how will you remind yourself to be kind to yourself regardless of how the conversation goes?

User: I could tell myself that it's okay to not be perfect and that I'm trying my best.

Consultant: That's a wonderful affirmation. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. As we wrap up our session today, what is one takeaway you have that you feel you can carry into your interactions?

User: I want to keep in mind that my efforts matter more than how fluently I speak. It's okay to be imperfect.

Consultant: Absolutely! Embracing your journey and being proud of your efforts can make a significant difference in how you view these situations. It’s okay to feel fluctuations in emotions, but with practice, you can grow more confident in social settings. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your support.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm here to help. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Remember, you are making strides in your journey. Take care!

Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today's session. I'm glad you're here. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've been trying to push myself to engage more socially, but it hasn't been easy. I still feel nervous around new people, and when things don't go well, I can get pretty down about it.

Consultant: That sounds like a challenging situation, but it's good to hear you're trying to push through your comfort zone. Can you tell me about a recent experience that you had while trying to socialize?

User: Well, I tried to join a study group, hoping to make some friends and connect with others. At first, I felt okay, but when it came time for introductions, I just froze. I couldn't get certain words out, and I felt really embarrassed.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel embarrassed in situations like that, especially with your history. How did it make you feel afterward when you couldn't express yourself?

User: I felt really deflated. I thought I could handle it, but I couldn’t. It made me doubt whether I should even try to meet new people again.

Consultant: It’s interesting how setbacks can impact our motivation. But remember, setbacks are an essential part of growth. What do you think you can learn from this experience rather than just focusing on the embarrassment?

User: I guess I can learn that not every interaction will go perfectly. But it still hurts when I can't express myself. I just worry that people won't want to be friends with someone who stumbles with words.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, but remember that people often appreciate authenticity. They might actually admire your courage to try despite the challenges. Have there been any moments, even small ones, where you felt like you connected with someone?

User: There was a moment when someone in the group shared a similar struggle with communication. It felt nice to hear that I wasn’t alone, but I didn’t get the chance to say much myself.

Consultant: That’s a significant moment! Sharing a common struggle can create strong connections. How might you use that experience next time you find yourself in a similar situation?

User: Maybe I could remember to share my own experiences. It might help me feel more comfortable. But I’m still scared of how people will react.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. How about we brainstorm some supportive phrases or sentences you can use next time? It might help ease some of that fear.

User: That sounds helpful. I think if I had a couple of phrases ready, I might feel a bit more secure.

Consultant: Great! Let's think of a few. How about starting with, “I sometimes struggle to get my words out, but I’d love to hear your thoughts”? This way, you’re honest and opening the floor for others.

User: I like that! It sounds friendly and straightforward. Maybe I could also say something like, “I might need a moment to find the right words.”

Consultant: Absolutely! Both phrases show that you’re engaging while also taking care of yourself. It’s okay to give yourself that time. Do you feel more confident thinking about trying these next time?

User: Yes, I do! Just having a few phrases as backup makes me feel less anxious about it.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it's all about progress. Every small step counts. You mentioned feeling more confident, how has that shifted your perspective on social interactions?

User: I think it's helping me see that I can take my time without rushing. I used to think I had to be perfect right away, but now I realize it’s okay to take two steps forward and one step back.

Consultant: That’s an excellent realization! Embracing imperfection can allow you to be more open with yourself and others. How do you plan to reinforce this perspective in your next social encounter?

User: I’ll remind myself that everyone has their struggles, and that not every moment needs to be perfect. Plus, I’ll keep practicing those phrases.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! As we continue, let’s reinforce these positive insights together. Each time you practice, you’re building your confidence and resilience. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel relieved and motivated. Talking about this makes it seem less daunting. I can see the potential in trying again.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Let's continue building on this momentum. Remember, you’re making progress, and I’m here to support you in your journey. What would you like to focus on next time?

User: I think I want to explore more situations where I can practice social skills and continue building confidence.

Consultant: Perfect! We’ll work together on that. Remember, it’s all about taking it one step at a time. I believe in your ability to connect and grow. See you next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident, actually. I've participated in a few classroom discussions and got some positive feedback, which felt great!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're making some progress in expressing yourself in class. How did those experiences affect your confidence in social situations?

User: They definitely made me feel a bit better about speaking up. But I still get really anxious when I'm in larger groups or when I have to introduce myself. I worry about stuttering or not being able to say certain phrases.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel anxious in those situations, especially given your past experiences. Let's explore that a bit more. When you're in a group setting and feel anxious, what thoughts come to your mind?

User: I often think that everyone will judge me if I stutter or mess up. It feels like all eyes are on me, and I just want to disappear.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. Those thoughts can create a lot of pressure. Let’s challenge those thoughts together. What evidence do you have that people will judge you harshly for stuttering?

User: Well, I guess there isn’t any real evidence. But I still feel that way. It’s just this nagging worry that won’t go away.

Consultant: It makes sense that those feelings would linger, especially when they've been part of your experience for so long. What if we looked at it from another perspective? If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay to stumble sometimes and that everyone makes mistakes. So maybe I should be kinder to myself?

Consultant: Exactly! Being kind to yourself can be really powerful. Let’s think of some small steps you could take in future interactions to help reduce that anxiety. What would be a manageable goal for you in a group situation?

User: Maybe I could practice introducing myself in front of a mirror or with a friend before I have to do it in class?

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Practicing in a safe environment can help build your confidence. Do you feel comfortable trying that before your next class discussion?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. It feels less daunting when I think of it as practice.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! With practice, you may find that your anxiety decreases over time. In our next session, we can discuss how it went and adjust if needed. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I’m looking forward to that. I want to keep improving.

Consultant: It's great to hear your enthusiasm! Remember to celebrate each small victory along the way. Is there anything else we can work on today to help you along this journey?

User: No, I think we’ve covered a lot. Just reflecting on what I've accomplished so far feels really encouraging.

Consultant: That’s an excellent reflection! Acknowledging your achievements is essential. Before we wrap up, let’s outline some key takeaways from our session today, shall we?

User: Sure! I want to focus on practicing my introductions and being kinder to myself when I feel anxious. 

Consultant: Perfect! And remember, it's normal to feel anxious sometimes, but you're taking the right steps toward overcoming those feelings. I'm proud of the progress you've made. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate that. I already feel more motivated after talking with you.

Consultant: I'm really happy to hear that! Keep that motivation going. If you ever feel overwhelmed, just remind yourself of the positive feedback you've received; it's a reflection of your efforts. 

User: I will, thank you! I feel a lot more equipped to handle social situations now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure discussing your progress today. Let's set a goal to keep building on your confidence and social skills in our upcoming sessions.

User: I’m excited for that! I feel like I have the tools to improve now. 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Keep practicing, and remember, every little step counts. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next meeting.

User: Me too! I’ll make sure to share everything. Thanks again for your support!

Consultant: Of course! You’ve got this. Remember, I’m here whenever you need support. Until next time, take care!

User: Bye! I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I’m really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling surprisingly good, actually. Since taking on the role of spokesperson for our group project, I’ve been more confident in social situations. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re proud of the progress you've made with your social skills. Can you share more about what this increased confidence has felt like for you?

User: It feels empowering. I used to dread speaking up in groups, but now I feel I can express my thoughts more clearly. It’s like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

Consultant: That’s really significant! It’s great that you can recognize this weight being lifted. What do you think has contributed to this change in your mindset?

User: I guess working on my speech issues during our sessions has helped. Also, I try to remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes when speaking. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization! Accepting that mistakes are part of learning can be quite liberating. How have you been practicing this mindset in your daily interactions?

User: I’ve been trying to engage more in conversations with classmates, feeling less afraid of making a fool of myself. It’s still challenging, but I feel more willing to try.

Consultant: It seems like you’re actively stepping out of your comfort zone. Can you recall any particular conversation that stood out to you as a success?

User: Yes, it was during lunch with some classmates. I shared an idea for our project, and they actually seemed interested! I wasn't as nervous as I thought I would be.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic example! Sharing your ideas and receiving positive feedback can reinforce your confidence. How did you feel after that interaction?

User: I felt proud and relieved. It felt so good to be part of the conversation and not just a silent participant.

Consultant: That’s such a positive feeling, isn’t it? Let’s dive a bit deeper. Have you thought about what specific strategies you can use to maintain this momentum in your social interactions?

User: I think setting small goals for myself, like initiating a conversation with someone new each week, could really help. 

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Setting small, achievable goals can lead to gradual but significant growth. What else could support you along this journey?

User: I could continue practicing my speech exercises and maybe keep a journal to reflect on my progress. 

Consultant: Those are great ideas! Reflection can really help solidify your progress and remind you of how far you've come. Have you thought about how you’d celebrate your successes?

User: I hadn’t really thought about that. Maybe treating myself to something enjoyable, like going out with friends or watching a movie, could work.

Consultant: That’s a lovely way to reward yourself! Celebrating your wins, no matter how small, can reinforce your motivation. What are you feeling most excited about as you look ahead?

User: I’m excited about being more active in social settings and continuing to improve on my speech. I want to make the most of my college experience.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful outlook! Embracing new experiences can be incredibly rewarding. What are some upcoming opportunities where you can practice these skills?

User: There’s a club event next week that I’ve been thinking about attending. It could be a good chance to meet new people.

Consultant: Attending that event sounds like a perfect opportunity! How about we brainstorm some conversation starters you could use while you’re there?

User: That would be helpful! I could ask people about their interests related to the club or share my experience working on the group project. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Those are both great conversation starters. Finding common interests can really help ease the flow of conversation. How do you feel about these strategies?

User: I feel more confident about approaching new people now. Just thinking about it makes it less daunting. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Building confidence in these situations takes time, but you’re already making great strides. How might you remind yourself of this confidence in moments of uncertainty?

User: I could keep a note with positive affirmations or reminders of my achievements on my phone. It would help to have that reassurance on hand.

Consultant: That’s a smart idea! Having tangible reminders can be a great source of comfort and encouragement. As we wrap up, let’s summarize some key takeaways from today’s session.

User: Sure. I’ll set small social goals, practice my speech, keep a reflection journal, and carry affirmations with me. 

Consultant: Perfect! You’re creating a strong plan for maintaining your progress. As you continue on this journey, remember to be patient and kind to yourself. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you, I will! I feel so much better after talking today. 

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! You’ve made wonderful progress, and I’m excited for you to continue this journey. This will be our last session for now. Remember, you have the skills to manage your feelings, and whenever you need support, feel free to come back. 

User: Thank you so much for all your help. I really appreciate it! 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I wish you the best in your future endeavors. Take care!
