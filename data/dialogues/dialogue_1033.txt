Consultant: Hello, Xiao Jie! I'm really glad you're here today. I want to create a safe space for you to express whatever's on your mind. What’s been bothering you lately?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really low lately. I think a lot about my parents’ divorce and sometimes I feel like it’s my fault. I can’t shake off this heavy feeling.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve been carrying a lot of emotional weight with you. The feelings of guilt you have about your parents’ divorce can be really tough to navigate. Can you tell me more about what these feelings do to you on a day-to-day basis?

User: Well, when I feel low, I sometimes hurt myself. Like yesterday, I couldn’t stop thinking about my dad wanting to visit the school. I just felt overwhelmed and couldn’t handle it.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It’s understandable that your father wanting to visit might trigger intense feelings. Self-harm is often a way to express pain when we don’t know how to communicate it. How do you usually feel after you hurt yourself?

User: I don’t know... Sometimes it feels like a release, but then I just feel worse afterward, like I’m stuck in this cycle. 

Consultant: That cycle can feel really consuming. It’s important to realize that while self-harm may provide temporary relief, it ultimately doesn’t address the deeper feelings you’re experiencing. Let’s explore what thoughts lead you to that point. What were you thinking right before you decided to hurt yourself?

User: I kept thinking that if my parents hadn’t divorced, I wouldn’t feel this way. Like I’m somehow to blame for everything.

Consultant: That’s a heavy burden to carry, believing that you’re at fault for circumstances beyond your control. Can you think of any evidence that supports the idea that the divorce is your fault? 

User: I guess there’s not really any solid evidence... It just feels that way sometimes.

Consultant: It's really valuable that you recognize that. Our emotions can sometimes distort our perception of reality. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you say to them about feeling responsible for their parents' divorce?

User: I’d probably tell them it’s not their fault and that it’s something adults deal with.

Consultant: Exactly! You possess such insight into how these situations affect others. Let’s try applying that same compassion to yourself. How can we transform those negative thoughts into something more supportive for you?

User: I don’t know. Maybe I can try to remind myself that it's not my fault?

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive start! Replacing those negative thoughts with affirmations of self-kindness can help. We could also talk about other strategies to help manage the emotions when they feel overwhelming. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds okay. I’m willing to try something different.

Consultant: Great! Let’s think about activities that bring you some joy or relaxation. What are some things you enjoy doing that might help lift your mood?

User: I like drawing. It helps me escape a little.

Consultant: Drawing can be a fantastic outlet for expression! It could be helpful to set aside time for it, especially when you’re feeling low. Would you be able to commit to drawing at least a few times a week and notice how it affects your mood?

User: I think I could do that. It might help me feel better.

Consultant: Wonderful! We can take it one step at a time. Also, when feelings of sadness or guilt creep in, try to remember that you deserve kindness from yourself. Would it be okay if we check in about your progress during our next session?

User: Yes, that sounds good. I’d like to see if it helps.

Consultant: Perfect! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we've discussed. You’ve recognized the distinction between your feelings and taking responsibility for your parents' choices. You also found a supportive response to those feelings—reminding yourself it’s not your fault and committing to drawing.

User: Yes, I see that now. It feels good to put it into words.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Xiao Jie. Remember, it’s a journey, and it’s okay to take small steps. I’m proud of you for opening up today. You’re not alone in this, and we’ll work together on it. If you need anything before our next session, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Jie! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a little better, but I still get really frustrated when my mom loses her temper. It often brings me down, and I can't shake off those feelings.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like your mother's outbursts are still affecting your mood significantly. Can you tell me more about how you feel when that happens?

User: Well, when she yells at me and talks poorly about my dad, I feel so upset and helpless. It makes me think that maybe I'm not good enough or that I'm a disappointment to her.

Consultant: Those feelings of helplessness and disappointment sound really tough to manage. It's important to recognize where those thoughts come from. What do you think about the idea that those negative thoughts might not reflect your true worth?

User: I know I shouldn't think that way, but it's hard. I just want her to be proud of me. Sometimes, I feel like I'm just reminding her of my dad's mistakes.

Consultant: It's understandable to want your mother's approval and to feel proud of your accomplishments. Let's explore this further—what would it look like for you to feel proud of yourself, independent of her opinions?

User: I guess it would mean recognizing my achievements in school and with my friends, but I often downplay those because I feel like they're not enough.

Consultant: It sounds like you have some wonderful accomplishments that you are not valuing enough. What do you think helps you feel good about those school achievements or friendships?

User: When I do well in my studies or when my friends and I have fun together, I feel happy. But when I go home, I just feel like I’m walking on eggshells, which ruins it.

Consultant: It seems like home is where you experience a lot of stress that overshadows your achievements. Let's talk about how we can help you create a better balance between your home life and the happiness you find at school. Have you thought about any strategies that might help in managing those tough moments at home?

User: I haven't really thought about it. Maybe I could just ignore her when she gets angry, but that doesn't always work out.

Consultant: Ignoring the situation can be tough, especially when emotions are running high. What if we explored some relaxation techniques you could apply during those stressful moments? It might help ease the emotional load you feel.

User: I suppose learning to relax could help. I just don't know where to start with that.

Consultant: Great! One simple technique you can practice is deep breathing. Whenever you feel overwhelmed, try taking slow, deep breaths—inhale through your nose, hold for a moment, then exhale through your mouth. Would you like to give that a try now?

User: Sure, I can try that. (User practices deep breathing) 

Consultant: How did that feel? Did it help you feel a bit more centered?

User: Yeah, it felt nice to focus on my breathing instead of my thoughts for a moment.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Practicing deep breathing regularly can help create a calming effect, especially when you sense tension building at home. You can also visualize a safe place where you feel relaxed when you do this. Would you be open to trying that over the next week?

User: I think I can do that. Visualizing a nice place sounds comforting.

Consultant: That’s excellent! Along with this technique, I think it’s important to remind yourself of your worth during difficult times. Can we try to identify some affirmations you could say to yourself when you feel down?

User: What do you mean by affirmations?

Consultant: Affirmations are positive statements that can help you challenge and counteract negative thoughts. For example, telling yourself, "I am worthy and enough, just as I am." It can remind you of your inherent value, regardless of external opinions. 

User: That sounds like something I could do. Maybe saying that after I take deep breaths might help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Combining deep breathing with positive affirmations could be very powerful for you. What is one affirmation you feel comfortable starting with?

User: I think I can start with "I am enough." That feels like a good start.

Consultant: That's a wonderful choice! Remember, it’s all about consistency. Try to repeat that affirmation daily, especially when challenging thoughts come up. How do you feel about this plan moving forward?

User: It sounds manageable. I like the idea of having something to hold onto when things get tough.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that, Xiao Jie. As you start practicing these techniques, let’s keep the dialogue open. Check in with how you’re feeling next time we talk. You’ve made some great progress today.

User: Thanks! I’ll try to remember all of this. I really do want to feel better about myself.

Consultant: You’re doing great by taking these steps. Remember, change takes time, and it’s okay to have ups and downs along the way. Looking forward to our next chat!

User: Me too! Thanks a lot for your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Jie. Take care, and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaojie! It's great to see you today. It sounds like you've been doing well at school, especially with the recent award in the writing competition. How are you feeling about everything?

User: Hi! Yes, I felt really proud of winning the award, but when I got home, my mom didn't react at all. It kind of hurt, and now I feel a bit discouraged.

Consultant: I can sense that the lack of response from your mom affected you, especially after achieving something you worked hard for. Can you tell me more about how that made you feel?

User: It just makes me feel like my efforts don't matter. I felt really happy and wanted her to be proud of me, but she seemed indifferent. It's tough to deal with that.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It’s understandable to want validation from your parent, especially after a success. How do you think this experience is impacting your self-esteem right now?

User: I think a part of me feels less valuable now, like winning the award was just a fluke and that it doesn't mean much if my mom didn't care.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel that way, but let’s explore this thought a bit. Do you think your worth is defined solely by your mother's reactions or might there be other factors that contribute to it?

User: I guess there are other things, like my friends and teachers appreciating me. They seem to value me, and that feels good.

Consultant: Absolutely! It sounds like you have support from your friends and teachers, which is something to hold on to. How do you feel when you think about their recognition of your achievements?

User: It makes me feel a little better. I try to focus on that, but I can't help but feel sad about my mom's reaction.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel sadness about that. Let’s think about how you can balance these feelings. What if we looked at your mom's indifference differently? What could be some reasons for her reaction that isn’t related to your worth?

User: Maybe she’s just busy or stressed with her own life. I never really considered that.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It’s possible that her own struggles could prevent her from expressing pride or support. How do you think you can remind yourself of this perspective when those feelings of discouragement come up?

User: I could try to think about what might be going on with her instead of focusing so much on my feelings of disappointment.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive strategy. Additionally, what are some ways you can reinforce your self-esteem and recognize your achievements without waiting for validation from your mom?

User: I could celebrate my wins with friends or even write about them in a journal. That could help me remember my worth.

Consultant: Journaling can be a wonderful way to reflect on your achievements and feelings. It allows you to acknowledge your successes without relying on outside validation. Would you like to set a goal for how often you’ll do that?

User: Maybe I can write once a week about my achievements. That sounds doable.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ve learned. You’ve recognized the importance of your accomplishments and the value of your friends’ support, as well as a new perspective on your mom’s response. 

User: Yeah, I feel like I can handle this better now.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that, Xiaojie. Remember, feelings can be complex, and it’s okay to feel sad sometimes. You have the tools now to reinforce your sense of self-worth. I believe you can integrate these insights into your daily life. Do you have any last thoughts before we conclude?

User: Just that I appreciate our talk today. It helped me a lot.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’re making. Keep practicing your strategies, and remember you can always reach out if you need support. Take care until next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Jie! It's great to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty good, actually. Spending time with my grandparents recently has made me feel really warm and supported. It’s nice to feel that way.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that. It sounds like you've had some positive experiences with your grandparents. Can you tell me more about how that support has impacted your daily life?

User: Well, I think I’ve been more calm lately. I feel like I can handle my emotions better because I know they’re there for me. It just makes me feel secure.

Consultant: That’s wonderful progress, Xiao Jie. Feeling secure can really make a difference in how we approach challenges. Have you considered ways to incorporate that feeling of support into your everyday routine?

User: I haven't thought too much about it. Maybe I could spend more time with them or talk to them more often?

Consultant: Absolutely! Making time for your grandparents could reinforce those positive feelings. What activities do you enjoy doing with them?

User: We like to go for walks together and just chat. They tell me stories about when they were young, and it’s really fun.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely way to connect with them and absorb their wisdom. How do you feel after those walks and talks?

User: I feel happy and even more connected to them. It’s like I leave the conversation feeling lighter.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful feeling to have. It's great that you recognize the value of those moments. Now, let’s talk about how you can maintain that happiness. Have you considered keeping a journal to document those positive experiences?

User: I used to keep a journal, but I stopped. Maybe I should start again?

Consultant: Yes, starting a journal again could be a fantastic way to reflect on those joyful moments and maintain that emotional stability. What do you think you would write about?

User: I could write about my time with my grandparents and how I felt. It would be nice to read back on it later.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Writing down those memories can help reinforce those positive feelings. How do you plan to make this a habit?

User: Maybe I could set a specific day each week to write in it, like Sundays after I visit them.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Setting a specific time can help establish a routine. How do you feel about committing to that plan?

User: I feel excited! It gives me something to look forward to, and I like the idea of having a collection of happy memories.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to feel that excitement! Remember, when you're documenting these experiences, also acknowledge how they make you feel. What emotions do you think you’ll write about the most?

User: I think I’ll write about feeling loved and appreciated. Those are the strongest feelings when I’m with them.

Consultant: Those feelings, love and appreciation, are powerful. Recognizing them can strengthen your self-esteem. Speaking of self-esteem, are there times when you struggle with it?

User: Sometimes, especially when I compare myself to my classmates. I can feel less confident about my academic performance.

Consultant: Comparing ourselves to others can often lead to negative feelings. Let’s explore that—what specific thoughts do you have when you compare yourself to your classmates?

User: I often think they are smarter than me, especially in science. It makes me feel like I’m not good enough.

Consultant: That’s a tough feeling to carry. It’s important to challenge those thoughts. Can you think of any evidence that shows you have strengths, even if they’re different from your classmates?

User: I guess I’m better at languages and writing. My teachers have said I’m creative.

Consultant: Absolutely! Your strengths in languages and writing are valuable and should be celebrated. If you were to advise a friend who felt the same way, what would you tell them?

User: I’d tell them that everyone has their own strengths and that it’s okay to not be good at everything.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! Now, let’s practice applying that to your own self-talk. How can you remind yourself of your strengths when you feel less confident?

User: Maybe I could repeat some positive affirmations about my skills in writing and creativity.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Affirmations can serve as powerful reminders. Can you think of a few affirmations that resonate with you?

User: I am a creative person. I’m good at expressing myself through writing. My strengths are valuable.

Consultant: Those are wonderful affirmations! Try to incorporate them into your journaling practice. Now, as we wrap up, how do you feel about the progress we’ve made today?

User: I feel more confident about my strengths and excited to start journaling again. I think it’ll really help me.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Xiao Jie! Remember, you have the support of your grandparents, and you are capable of amazing things. If you ever need to talk again, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate it, and I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaojie! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling pretty good. I felt really proud of myself when I was recognized as the "Labor Specialist" in our school's community service. It made me feel more confident.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like this recognition really boosted your confidence. Can you tell me more about how that experience made you feel?

User: I felt really happy and appreciated. Like, finally, someone noticed my efforts! It was nice to be recognized for my hard work.

Consultant: That’s a great feeling indeed! Recognition can really validate our efforts. How has this increased confidence affected your interactions with your peers and your family?

User: I feel more comfortable speaking up in group activities at school. I even shared my thoughts during our last class discussion. But I’m still a bit unsure when it comes to talking about my feelings at home.

Consultant: It's fantastic that you're feeling more empowered in school! However, it's understandable that opening up at home might be more challenging. What do you think makes it difficult to express your feelings in your family environment?

User: I think it’s because my mom is really busy and sometimes stressed. It's like I don’t want to add to her worries, so I keep things to myself.

Consultant: That makes sense. You're being considerate of your mom's feelings, but it's also important for you to express your own emotions. What do you think would happen if you shared your feelings with her?

User: I guess she might be supportive, but I worry she wouldn't have time to listen.

Consultant: It's natural to worry about that. Let's try to frame it differently. Imagine you do share your feelings—what kind of support do you hope to receive from her?

User: I hope she would listen to me and maybe even offer some advice. I just want to feel understood.

Consultant: Wanting to be understood is a common need. It could help to think about how you can create a moment where she might be more available to listen. Have you considered setting aside a time for a conversation?

User: I haven't really thought about that. Maybe I could suggest a time when we can sit down together.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive idea! Planning can make both of you feel more comfortable. How do you feel about discussing this plan with your mom next time you see her?

User: I think I’ll feel a bit nervous, but it might be a step in the right direction.

Consultant: Nervousness is completely normal when trying something new. It's a sign that this feels important to you. We can also come up with some phrases you might use to start that opening conversation.

User: That would be helpful! I want to communicate without making it awkward.

Consultant: Absolutely! You can start by expressing how important your relationship with her is and that you’d like to share how you’ve been feeling. Would you like to practice that together now?

User: Yes, I'd like that. 

Consultant: Great! You could say something like, "Mom, I really value our relationship and I’d like to share some of my feelings with you." How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! It feels like a good way to start.

Consultant: I'm glad you think so! Remember, the goal is to create a safe space for both of you to share. How does the idea of having this conversation make you feel now?

User: A bit less anxious! It feels like I have a plan.

Consultant: That’s what we want! Having a plan can help reduce anxiety. In our next session, we can discuss how it went and any feelings that came up for you during the conversation.

User: Yes, I’d really like that.

Consultant: Wonderful! Before we wrap up today, let’s reflect on your progress so far. How do you feel about your overall confidence and your ability to express your feelings now compared to our first meeting?

User: I feel like I've made some big steps. I’m more confident at school, and I’m ready to try at home too.

Consultant: That's an amazing transformation, Xiaojie! You’ve really done well in strengthening your self-esteem. Do you have any strategies in mind to maintain this positive momentum?

User: I think I can keep participating in activities and try talking to my mom more.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Engaging in activities will further boost your confidence, and communicating with your mom will help strengthen your relationship. I believe you have great pathways ahead!

User: Thank you! This has been really helpful.

Consultant: I’m happy to hear that. Remember, you’ve developed some effective strategies today. I'm looking forward to hearing about your conversation with your mom next time. Take care until then!

User: I will! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaojie! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello! I feel much better, actually. I'm pretty proud of how I talked to my mom and grandparents about my feelings. It felt nice to share my thoughts with them.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some meaningful progress in expressing your feelings. How did those conversations go for you?

User: They went really well! My mom was really understanding, and I think she appreciated that I opened up. It made me feel closer to them.

Consultant: That’s great! Building a closer relationship with your family is really important. What do you think has changed for you since those conversations?

User: I feel more connected and less alone. It's nice to know that they care and want to understand me better.

Consultant: It sounds like strengthening those connections has made a positive impact on your emotional well-being. Are there ways you’d like to continue building on this progress?

User: I want to keep talking about my feelings. Sometimes I worry that things will change back to how they were.

Consultant: It's natural to have those worries. Let’s talk about what you can do to maintain these improvements and ensure open communication. What strategies do you think might help?

User: Maybe we could set aside some time each week to talk? Like a family meeting or something.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Regular family meetings could encourage everyone to share their feelings and stay connected. How do you feel about taking the initiative to suggest this?

User: I’d feel a bit nervous, but I think it could help, especially if I frame it positively.

Consultant: Absolutely! You can emphasize that you want to grow closer and support each other better as a family. What specific positive outcomes do you hope to achieve through these meetings?

User: I hope we can talk openly and solve problems together. I want us to feel safe sharing our issues without judgment.

Consultant: That’s a healthy goal! Creating a safe space for sharing can greatly enhance your family dynamics. What are some topics you'd like to address in these meetings?

User: I think it would be great to talk about school, pressures, and just how everyone's doing in life—not just me.

Consultant: Opening up these discussions will allow everyone to share their experiences and support one another. How would you feel if someone in your family had a tough day and wasn’t able to share it immediately?

User: I would want to help them but also worry they might keep things bottled up. 

Consultant: That’s understandable. Cultivating an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing is essential. What could you do to reassure your family that it’s okay to express difficult feelings?

User: I could remind them that I’m there to listen without judgment. Maybe we can make it a rule that we can all express whatever is bothering us.

Consultant: Establishing that rule could significantly lower any fears they might have about sharing. What else do you think might help to reinforce this openness?

User: Maybe having some fun activities after serious talks could help. Like playing games or watching a movie together afterward.

Consultant: Incorporating enjoyable activities sounds like a great approach to balance the serious discussions with positive experiences. What activities would you like to include?

User: We love board games! I think playing some together after our talk could lighten the mood.

Consultant: Board games are a fantastic choice! They foster teamwork and fun, promoting bonding. How do you feel about being proactive in organizing these meetings and activities?

User: I feel excited! I want to take charge and make these changes happen.

Consultant: That excitement is incredibly important! Taking initiative will reinforce your commitment to maintaining these improvements. Before we wrap up, what have you learned about yourself through this process?

User: I’ve learned that I can express my feelings and that it’s okay to need support. Also, I can help my family understand me better.

Consultant: Those are valuable insights, Xiaojie! Recognizing your needs and seeking support is a powerful step. How do you plan to maintain this newfound awareness moving forward?

User: I can remind myself to check in with my feelings and make sure I communicate regularly with my family.

Consultant: That's a wonderful plan! Consistency will help maintain your communication. As we conclude today's session, what will be your main focus in the coming weeks?

User: I’ll focus on suggesting family meetings and staying open about my feelings. I want us to keep communicating well with each other.

Consultant: I believe in your ability to do this, Xiaojie! You've shown remarkable progress. If challenges arise, remember that you can always revisit the strategies we've discussed. I'm proud of you, and I look forward to hearing about your continued success in our next session!
