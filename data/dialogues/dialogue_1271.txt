Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyue! I’m glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite anxious and isolated. University life is not what I expected, and I struggle to connect with my classmates. I feel like I don't belong here.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you’re really facing some challenges in your new environment and feeling a bit out of place. Can you share a bit more about what has been most difficult for you in connecting with others?

User: Well, most of my roommates and classmates are local students, and sometimes I feel like there’s a cultural gap. I can’t help but compare myself to them, and that makes me doubt my abilities and my worth.

Consultant: That’s really tough, Xiaoyue. It’s completely understandable to feel that way, especially in a new environment. When you think about your abilities and worth, what specific thoughts come to your mind that contribute to those doubts?

User: I often think that I’m not as smart or capable as they are. I worry that I won’t be able to keep up with my studies or make friends. It’s like I’m always second-guessing myself.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of negative thoughts about yourself. Can you think of a specific situation where you felt these doubts particularly strongly?

User: Yes, just last week during a group project, I felt lost when they discussed things I didn’t understand. I thought to myself, “I shouldn’t be here. I’m just wasting everyone’s time.”

Consultant: It’s really common to feel that way, especially in new or challenging situations. But let’s explore that thought: how much evidence do you have to support the idea that you’re wasting everyone’s time? Is there another way to look at that experience?

User: I guess I don’t actually have solid evidence. It’s more about how I felt at the moment. But I still can’t shake off that feeling.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. It sounds like your feelings are strongly influencing your thoughts. If a friend were in that situation and said the same thing, how would you respond to them?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has something to offer and that it’s okay to ask questions and learn. 

Consultant: Exactly! Your perspective for a friend is much kinder than the way you’re viewing yourself. How can we carry that compassionate perspective into your own self-talk?

User: Maybe I should remind myself that it's okay to not know everything and that asking questions is part of learning.

Consultant: That’s a great start, Xiaoyue! Let’s build on that. What are some small steps you could take to practice this self-compassion and challenge those negative thoughts in your daily life?

User: I could try to participate more in class discussions and remind myself it’s fine to ask questions. Maybe I could also reach out to a classmate for a study group.

Consultant: Those sound like effective plans! Engaging with others can help you feel more connected and lessen that sense of isolation. What might be a good first step for you this week?

User: I think I’ll start by reaching out to someone in my class for help, maybe about our recent project. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It’s a brave step forward. How do you feel about making that move?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also hopeful. It feels good to have a plan.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel nervous about reaching out, but having that hope is a positive sign. Let’s check in on how that goes next time we meet. In the meantime, what strategies can you use to manage any anxiety that comes up?

User: I might practice some deep breathing or remind myself of the positive things I can bring to the conversation.

Consultant: Those strategies are wonderful! Deep breathing can help ground you. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. How are you feeling about our discussion today?

User: I feel a bit better, honestly. Talking it out helps a lot. I like the idea of challenging my negative thoughts.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Recognizing that you can challenge those thoughts is an important step. I believe you can continue to make progress. How can you apply what you learned today in your daily life?

User: I’ll try to be kinder to myself and take small steps towards connecting with others. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach. You’re building toward improvement! I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Is there anything else you’d like to share today?

User: No, I think that covers it. Thank you for your guidance!

Consultant: You’re welcome, Xiaoyue! I’m proud of you for being open about your feelings. Just remember, change takes time, but you’re on the right track. Take care and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyue! I'm glad to see you again for our session. I remember last time we talked about your desire to improve your social interactions in college. How have you been feeling since our last discussion?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better about myself, but I still struggle with reaching out to others. I’ve joined a couple of clubs, but I just can’t seem to make friends. It makes me feel kind of isolated.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling a bit better, even if it's not fully resolved. Joining clubs is a great step! Can you share a little more about what makes it hard for you to connect with other members?

User: I think it's mostly my communication skills. I get nervous when I try to talk to someone, and then I just freeze up. I don’t want to say the wrong thing or come off as awkward.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. Freezing up when trying to communicate is quite common, especially when meeting new people. Let’s explore those moments when you feel nervous. What thoughts run through your mind at that time?

User: I often think that they won’t like me or that I’ll embarrass myself. It makes me feel anxious, and then I end up overthinking everything.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like you have some negative thoughts about social interactions that might be contributing to your anxiety. Let’s try to identify those thoughts more clearly. What would you say is the most dominant thought when you find yourself in those situations?

User: Probably that I’m not interesting enough to hold a conversation. I always feel like others have better things to say.

Consultant: That’s a tough thought to carry. What evidence do you have that supports that belief? Have there been times when you felt you were able to contribute to a conversation?

User: Well, actually, there were a couple of times when I shared something about a book I liked, and a few people responded positively. But those moments felt so rare.

Consultant: It sounds like you have had some positive experiences in conversations! That’s a great step to recognize. Let’s challenge that thought of not being interesting enough. If a friend felt that way, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably say they have interesting things to share and that everyone has their unique story. They shouldn’t feel that way.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re able to see the value in others, so why not give yourself the same grace? Now, let’s come up with practical strategies to help you feel more confident while interacting. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! But I’m not sure where to start.

Consultant: No worries! We can start with small, manageable goals. How about we plan a simple conversation starter for the next time you’re in a club meeting? What do you think would feel comfortable for you to say?

User: Maybe I could ask someone about their interests? That seems simple enough.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Asking about their interests shows you’re engaged and it takes the pressure off you to come up with something to say. Think of a few specific interests you could ask them about. 

User: I think I could ask about their favorite books or movies, since I enjoy those topics.

Consultant: Perfect! Those topics can lead to meaningful conversations. Now, how do you feel about the possibility of using this starter next time you meet with club members?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited. It feels more manageable, at least.

Consultant: That’s a great mindset! Remember, the goal is to practice and gradually build your confidence. Even if it doesn’t go perfectly, it’s still a step forward. What would you like to focus on for our next session?

User: I’d like to reflect on how the conversations go and maybe work on more strategies to keep improving.

Consultant: Sounds like a solid plan! Reflecting on your experiences will really help you grow. Lastly, let’s talk about your studies. You mentioned feeling a bit tired and unmotivated. Have you had a chance to think about how to improve that part of your life?

User: I want to feel more motivated to study, but I often get distracted or feel too fatigued to focus. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel tired. It might help to explore some strategies to enhance your study habits. Have you noticed any specific times when you study that make it easier or harder for you?

User: I seem to do better in the mornings, but I often end up procrastinating and studying late at night instead.

Consultant: That’s an important observation! Maybe we could establish a routine for your mornings that sets you up for success. What do you think would help you stick to a morning study schedule?

User: Maybe I could set an alarm and have a specific study time planned out? That might help.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Planning can really create a structure that supports your focus. Let’s commit to this morning routine for our next session and see how it goes, okay?

User: Okay, I'll give it a try! 

Consultant: Wonderful! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Remember, it’s all about taking one step at a time. You’re doing great!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoyue! Have a great week ahead, and I’ll see you in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyue! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better socially, but I'm still struggling with my studies. I just can't get myself motivated, and I often feel lost with the coursework.

Consultant: It's great to hear that your social interactions have improved, but I understand that the academic pressure is still weighing heavily on you. Can you tell me more about what's making you feel lost with your coursework?

User: The material is really complex, and sometimes I feel like I’m just not grasping it as well as I should. It makes me doubt whether I can keep up with everything.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging and understandably frustrating. Feeling uncertain about your ability to keep up can definitely affect your motivation. Let's explore this together—what specific subjects or topics do you feel the most challenged by?

User: I’m particularly struggling with my math and science classes. They seem to build on each other, and when I miss a concept, it just gets harder to catch up.

Consultant: It makes sense that if you miss a key concept, it can make the following material feel even more difficult. What strategies have you tried so far to help you catch up or understand the material better?

User: I've tried studying with friends, but sometimes I just end up feeling more confused. I also read textbooks, but it's hard to stay focused.

Consultant: Studying with friends can be really helpful, though it sounds like it might not always work for you. What do you think makes it difficult to stay focused while reading the textbooks?

User: I guess my mind tends to wander, and I sometimes feel overwhelmed by the amount of information. I can't seem to concentrate.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It's common to feel overwhelmed when facing a lot of new information. Let's think about breaking things down into smaller, more manageable pieces. How would you feel about setting up a structured study plan together?

User: I think a study plan could help, but I’m not sure how to start one. I often feel lost at the beginning.

Consultant: Starting is often the hardest part, but it’s great that you're open to it! We can work on creating a simple plan. Let’s take a look at what subjects you need to study and for how long each day. What would be a realistic study time for you each day?

User: Maybe one or two hours. I just need to feel accomplished even if it's a small amount.

Consultant: That sounds like a good start! Focusing on one or two hours can help you feel a sense of accomplishment. What subjects would you like to prioritize during that time?

User: I think I should start with math since I feel the most behind there.

Consultant: Focusing on math first is a smart move. How about we set some specific goals for your math study sessions? For example, mastering one concept or solving a certain number of problems.

User: I like that idea. Maybe I could aim to understand one concept each week?

Consultant: That's an excellent goal! By breaking it down to one concept per week, it feels much more achievable. How will you track your progress on these concepts?

User: I can keep a journal. That way, I will know what I've worked on and what I need to revisit.

Consultant: Keeping a journal sounds like a great way to monitor your progress! Reflecting on what you've done will reinforce your learning. When you achieve a goal, how do you think you might reward yourself?

User: I could treat myself to something fun, like watching a movie or having a snack I enjoy.

Consultant: Rewards can be really motivating! Celebrating small successes can help maintain your positive outlook on studying. How does that make you feel about starting your plan?

User: It makes me feel a little excited, I think! It’s nice to have something to look forward to.

Consultant: That's wonderful! Feeling excited is a positive sign. As you implement your study plan, remember to be gentle with yourself, especially if things don't go perfectly. How do you think you'll handle any setbacks?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it's okay to struggle a bit and adjust my plan if needed.

Consultant: Absolutely. Being flexible with your plan is key. Life can throw curveballs, and adjusting your approach is a strength, not a weakness. Have you thought about how you can maintain your motivation throughout this process?

User: I think setting reminders on my phone to study could help, and I could also share my goals with my friends to keep me accountable.

Consultant: Setting reminders is a practical idea, and sharing your goals with friends can definitely create a support system. How do you feel about seeking help when you need it, either from friends or professors?

User: That could be helpful! I sometimes hesitate to ask for help, but I know I shouldn’t do it alone.

Consultant: Reaching out for help can be a game changer, and it’s perfectly okay to seek support when you need it. As we're nearing the end of our session, let’s reflect a little on what you've accomplished today. What stands out to you?

User: I feel like I have a clear path forward now. Setting a study plan and being open to asking for help feels empowering.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! Seeing the path forward is a big step towards building your confidence. Before we end, let's think about your next steps. How will you implement this plan in the coming week?

User: I’ll write out my study plan tonight and start applying it tomorrow. I feel ready to give it a shot!

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! You've shown great initiative, and I believe you can do this. Just remember to be kind to yourself and celebrate your efforts. If you encounter challenges, we can revisit them in our next session. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaoyue. I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Remember, you have the strength to continue this journey. Take care and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiao Yue! I'm glad to see you for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, to be honest. I finally managed to ask questions in class and even joined a study group. But I still worry about what comes next in my studies and future.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful step forward! It's great to hear you're feeling some achievement from engaging in your classes. Can you share more about what worries you about your future?

User: I'm just not sure what I really want to do after my degree. I sometimes feel overwhelmed thinking about all the possibilities and what would be best for me.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel uncertain about your future, especially when there are so many paths to choose from. Let's explore this together. What are some thoughts that come to mind when you think about your future career?

User: I think about different jobs, but I worry that I may not be good enough for any of them. Like, what if I pick something and end up regretting it? 

Consultant: I understand that fear of making a wrong choice can be quite heavy. Let's take a moment to reflect on this thought—how much evidence do you have to support the idea that you might not be good enough for a job? 

User: I don't know, I guess I just see others excelling, and I feel a bit left behind. 

Consultant: It’s common to compare ourselves to others, but this can distort how we see our own abilities. If you were to advise a friend in your situation, what would you say to help them see their strengths?

User: I would tell them that everyone has their own pace and that it's important to focus on personal growth rather than comparisons.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! Focusing on your unique journey can really help reduce that anxiety. How might you apply this advice to your own situation?

User: I guess I can remind myself that I'm making progress, especially with the steps I’ve taken recently in class. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic realization! Celebrating your achievements, no matter how small, can help you build confidence. What would be a small goal you could set for yourself in the coming weeks regarding your studies or career exploration?

User: Maybe I could look into a couple of different career paths and see which ones interest me or talk to someone who's in a field I might like. 

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Researching different fields and speaking to people can give you valuable insights. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: It sounds manageable. I think it could help ease some of my worries about the future.

Consultant: Absolutely! Gaining more information can help you feel more prepared. As you explore these options, what kind of support can you envision needing from me during this process?

User: I think I might want to discuss my findings and feelings about those careers to see if I’m on the right track.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea. We can work together to explore those feelings and thoughts in our next sessions. For now, how else can you maintain the positive momentum you've built in your studies?

User: Maybe I could set aside some time each week to reflect on my progress and plan any small tasks related to my goals.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Reflecting and planning can help you stay on track. As we wrap up today, what would you say is your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I think it’s that I can focus on my personal journey instead of comparing myself to others. It’s okay to feel uncertain, and I can still make progress.

Consultant: That's a powerful takeaway, Xiao Yue. Remember that it’s perfectly okay to feel uncertain. You are doing well, and your proactive steps are important for your growth. How do you feel about our time today?

User: I feel relieved and a bit more confident. Thank you for helping me see things differently!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've made significant progress. Let's continue to build on this in our future sessions. Remember, you’re capable of navigating your path. If you ever feel overwhelmed, just reach out. 

User: I will! Thank you again. I'm looking forward to our next meeting.

Consultant: You’re welcome! Take care, and I’ll see you next time. Remember to celebrate your successes along the way. 

User: I will! Bye for now!

Consultant: Goodbye, Xiao Yue!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiao Yue! I’m really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately with your studies and social activities?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good actually. The study group I joined has made a big difference. I feel more efficient and enjoy studying with others.

User: Well, I feel less anxious about my workload now. I actually look forward to our study sessions. It’s nice to bounce ideas around and not feel so alone.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It sounds like the study group has really helped alleviate some of that anxiety and has fostered a sense of belonging. How have your other social interactions been since joining the group?

User: They’ve been better too! I’ve met more people and even made a couple of new friends. It feels good to connect with others who are going through the same things.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Social connections can make a huge difference in how we feel, especially during a challenging time like university. What aspects of your social life are you particularly enjoying right now?

User: I think the combination of working together and sharing experiences has made me feel more confident. Plus, I’m learning better by discussing concepts with others.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! Collaboration often enhances understanding and retention. Are there any specific strategies or practices from your study group that you think could help you sustain this positive progress?

User: We’ve been setting goals for each session, which keeps us on track. I think continuing that will help. Also, checking in with each other regularly motivates me.

Consultant: Setting goals is a great strategy! It helps maintain focus and accountability. What would you like to achieve in the coming weeks related to your studies or social interactions?

User: I want to keep improving my study habits and possibly start a small project with my study group to deepen our learning. I think it could be fun and beneficial!

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful initiative! How do you envision this project unfolding, and what role would you like to play in it?

User: I’d like to take on a leadership role, maybe organize our meetings and outline what topics we should cover. I feel more comfortable contributing ideas now.

Consultant: Taking on a leadership role can absolutely enhance your confidence and skills. It sounds like you're ready to embrace more responsibility. How do you feel about balancing this potential new project with your current workload?

User: I’m a bit worried it might be overwhelming, but I think I can manage it as long as I communicate with my group about any stress.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re thinking proactively about communication. Being open with your group can really help manage any feelings of being overwhelmed. If you feel stress starting to build, how might you address it?

User: I could talk to them about it. I might also give myself breaks or adjust our project timeline if needed.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies. It’s important to remain flexible and prioritize your well-being. Have you noticed any specific techniques that help you manage stress when it arises?

User: Taking short breaks and practicing some deep breathing helps. I also like to remind myself of the progress I’ve made, which boosts my confidence.

Consultant: Those are effective techniques! Reminding yourself of your progress can be a powerful motivator. Looking ahead, are there any other areas in your life where you would like to implement positive changes?

User: I think I’d like to focus on self-care. Sometimes I forget to take time for myself when I’m busy with studies and socializing.

Consultant: Self-care is essential for sustaining your energy and motivation. What kind of activities do you enjoy that would help you feel more balanced?

User: I love reading and going for walks. I think setting aside time for those would really help.

Consultant: Those activities sound delightful and can be very rejuvenating. How can you start incorporating them into your routine?

User: I could schedule specific times each week just for reading or walking. That way, it becomes a part of my life again.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Scheduling those moments for yourself can enhance your overall well-being. As we wrap up our session today, what do you feel you’ve learned about yourself and your progress?

User: I’ve realized that I’m capable of balancing my studies and social life, and I’m excited about the future. I just need to keep taking care of myself.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! You’ve made significant strides in your academic and social life, and it’s essential to continue nurturing that balance. If you ever need to discuss your journey again, remember I'm here to help. Thank you for sharing your experiences today, Xiao Yue. I'm looking forward to seeing how you continue to grow and thrive.

###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyue! It's great to see you again. I'm excited to hear about your progress. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: I’m thinking about joining the photography club because I love taking pictures. It would be a fun way to express myself and connect with others who share the same interest.
