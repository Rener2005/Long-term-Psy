Consultant: Hello, Zhang. I'm really glad you've come today. I know things have been challenging for you lately. Can you share with me what’s been on your mind recently?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really lost and anxious. I just lost my housing, and it’s making everything so much harder. I feel like I can't get a handle on my life and I’m struggling with the idea of getting help for my drug use. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Zhang. Losing your housing can be incredibly destabilizing, and it’s understandable to feel overwhelmed. Let’s take a moment to explore how you feel about your drug use and the idea of getting help. What thoughts do you have when you think about that?

User: I know I should stop using, but it feels like a way to cope. When it’s just me, I’m so afraid of what will happen if I really try to quit. And I don’t even know where to start, especially with everything else going on.

Consultant: It makes sense to use something that feels like a coping mechanism, especially during such a chaotic time. You mentioned fear—what do you think you’re most afraid of if you try to quit using drugs?

User: I’m scared that I’ll be completely lost without it. I feel like I’ve lost control, and if I stop using, I won’t know how to cope with everything. 

Consultant: That feeling of losing control can be really frightening, and it’s common to worry about how you’ll manage without your usual coping strategies. Can we look at what staying on this path means for you, especially as it relates to your current living situation?

User: I guess I’m stuck in this cycle. Using makes me feel okay temporarily, but then I feel worse after. Now, without a place to live, I feel even worse, and I'm scared that I'll just keep spiraling down.

Consultant: It’s clear that the cycle you’re in is quite distressing for you. We can work on breaking that cycle together. Let’s talk about what it would look like for you to make a change. How would you feel about finding new ways to cope without relying on drugs? 

User: I really want to feel better and find a way out of this mess. But it’s hard to believe I can actually do it. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel uncertain about change, especially when things feel overwhelming. What if we started exploring some small steps you could take toward feeling more in control? What are some positive things you think you could accomplish, even in a small way?

User: Maybe I could look for shelters or resources to help with housing. I have thought about that but didn’t know where to start. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great first step, Zhang. Seeking support for housing is both practical and can help you feel more stable. Have you ever reached out to any organizations or hotlines for support before? How did that go?

User: I haven’t really tried. I guess I've been too ashamed to ask for help. 

Consultant: Shame can be a heavy burden to carry, and it’s brave of you to consider reaching out despite those feelings. Remember, asking for help is not a sign of weakness; it’s a step towards regaining control. Do you have any ideas about how you could approach finding help for your housing situation?

User: I guess I could start by looking online or maybe asking a friend if they know something. 

Consultant: Those sound like excellent options. Sometimes just reaching out to someone you trust can open up new avenues. How do you feel about setting yourself a goal for who to contact or what to search for this week? 

User: I think that would help. Setting a specific goal makes it feel less overwhelming, I guess. 

Consultant: Exactly! Taking things step by step can make the process feel more manageable. Let’s set a goal—perhaps you can aim to reach out to at least one friend or organization this week. How does that sound? 

User: That sounds doable. I’ll try it. I’m just worried about what they will think of me.

Consultant: It's understandable to worry about others' perceptions, but remember that many people have faced difficult situations. Most will empathize and want to help. Can we explore together what that conversation might look like, so you feel more prepared?

User: Sure, that might help. I just want to make sure I don’t sound too desperate or like I don’t have my life together.

Consultant: It’s great that you want to present yourself well. You can simply be honest about your situation, focusing on what you need help with. You might say something like, “I’m having a tough time right now with housing and could use some support.” How does that feel to you?

User: That doesn’t seem too bad. I could try saying that. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It sounds like you're already thinking proactively about how to communicate your needs. This is a positive step in managing your feelings around your current circumstances. Let’s tackle your feelings about your drug use next—what are some thoughts you have about seeking help for that?

User: I know I need to. I could try taking one day at a time. But the cravings are so intense. 

Consultant: Those cravings can feel incredibly strong, Zhang. Taking it one day at a time is a wise approach. We can discuss some strategies to help you cope when those cravings hit. What do you think might work for you when you feel the urge?

User: I’ve heard about distraction techniques, like going for a walk or listening to music. But it’s hard to remember to do those things when I want to use. 

Consultant: It’s a common struggle to recall healthier coping methods in the heat of the moment. Perhaps we can create a list of distractions that you find enjoyable or calming. You could keep it somewhere visible as a reminder for when cravings strike. What do you think?

User: That could help. I would like to have something to refer to instead of just letting the cravings take over. 

Consultant: That’s a proactive mindset! Let’s work on identifying a few activities you enjoy that can distract you during those moments. What are some things that bring you joy?

User: I like drawing and listening to podcasts. They help me relax, but I haven’t done them much lately. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful activities! Drawing and listening to podcasts can be great outlets for expression and distraction. How about we make a commitment for you to set aside some time for these activities this week when cravings arise?

User: I think I can do that. I’ll try to draw something when I feel the urge to use. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Zhang! Combining your interests with coping strategies can be very effective. I’m proud of you for wanting to take these steps. How are you feeling about your progress so far in our discussion? 

User: A bit hopeful, but I still feel overwhelmed. I guess I’m feeling a mix of emotions. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a mix, especially when thinking about making such significant changes. That’s okay. You’re not alone in this, and it’s about progress over perfection. Let’s keep building on this hope over time. For our next session, I encourage you to reflect on your experiences with these strategies. 

User: Yeah, I’ll do that. I definitely want to keep making progress, even if it feels slow. 

Consultant: That's a great mentality to have! Slow progress is still progress. I look forward to hearing all about your experiences next time. Remember to be patient with yourself, and if you feel overwhelmed, reach out for support. Take care, and I’ll see you soon, Zhang. 

User: Thanks, I appreciate it. I’ll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, it's been tough. I reached out to a friend for help with finding a place to stay, but they refused to help. It made me feel very rejected and alone.

Consultant: I'm really sorry to hear that, Zhang. Feeling rejected can be incredibly painful, especially when you're seeking support. How did that make you feel about reaching out again in the future?

User: I feel like I shouldn’t bother trying anymore. Every time I ask for help, it seems like I just get shut down. It’s discouraging.

Consultant: It sounds like this experience has really affected your belief in others' willingness to support you. Can you share more about how this reflects on your feelings of self-worth?

User: I guess it makes me feel like I'm not worth the trouble. If my friends don’t want to help me, then maybe I don’t deserve help at all.

Consultant: That’s a heavy thought to carry, Zhang. I can see how this situation has impacted your view of yourself. But let’s challenge that thought for a moment—can you think of any evidence that contradicts the idea that you aren’t deserving of help?

User: Maybe... I mean, I’ve had times when people cared about me in the past. But it just feels different now. 

Consultant: It's understandable that you feel differently now, especially given your struggles. It’s important to remember that situations can change. How do you think you could remind yourself of those times when you felt supported in the past?

User: I could try to think about my family, even if they aren't helpful right now. There were moments they were there for me.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step. Reflecting on those moments can help you reframe your current situation. Have you considered other avenues for support, like joining a community group or a support group for people dealing with similar issues?

User: I haven't really thought about that. I guess I don't know if they would accept me, or if I’d even fit in.

Consultant: Feeling unsure about fitting in is perfectly normal, especially when considering new environments. What if we set a small goal for you in this area? Perhaps we could aim for you to research one support group this week?

User: I suppose I could look into it. I just worry it’ll be awkward or I won’t find anyone who understands.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel that way. Many people share those concerns when they begin seeking support. What if we reframe that thought? Instead of thinking "I won't fit in," what if we thought, "I might find people who understand and relate to my experiences"?

User: That makes sense. It could be a chance to connect with someone who really gets it. 

Consultant: Exactly! Taking this step could help you expand your support network and possibly alter your perspective on reaching out to others. How are you feeling about taking that step now?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful about it. I like the idea of finding people with similar experiences.

Consultant: That’s great to hear, Zhang! Remember, every small step counts. How have you been managing your cravings for substances since our last meeting?

User: It’s been challenging. I still feel the urge sometimes, especially when I’m alone.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to have those cravings, particularly in times of stress or loneliness. Have you practiced any of the coping techniques we discussed before?

User: I’ve tried deep breathing a few times but it doesn’t always help when the cravings hit hard.

Consultant: That’s a valuable strategy, and it’s okay if it doesn’t work perfectly every time. Would you like to brainstorm some additional techniques that could be helpful when cravings occur?

User: Sure. I think I need more tools in my toolbox for those moments.

Consultant: Let’s consider some activities that could help distract you when cravings hit. For example, engaging in physical activity, like going for a walk, can be very effective. What kind of activities do you enjoy?

User: I used to like going for runs, but I haven’t done that in a while.

Consultant: Running could be a fantastic way to release tension and improve your mood. How about setting a goal to go for a short run this week? Just a few minutes could make a difference.

User: I think I’d be up for that. Maybe I can start small and build from there.

Consultant: Absolutely! Starting small is key, and every little effort supports your long-term goals. How do you feel about combining that with researching support groups? 

User: That sounds manageable. I think doing both could keep my mind occupied and hopefully help me feel better.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! It’s great to see you taking these steps toward creating a healthier environment for yourself. Now let’s talk about how you can maintain this momentum moving forward. 

User: Right, I guess I need to keep reminding myself I am capable of doing these things.

Consultant: Yes, reaffirming your capabilities is crucial. What are some affirmations or reminders you could tell yourself each day to help maintain your focus and positivity?

User: Maybe something like, “I am worthy of support,” or “I can take control of my choices.”

Consultant: Those are powerful affirmations. I encourage you to write them down and perhaps place them where you can see them daily. How confident do you feel about implementing these strategies over the coming week?

User: I feel more confident now, actually. I think having a plan helps a lot.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! It sounds like you’re making significant progress, Zhang. As we finish today's session, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway?

User: I think it’s realizing that I do deserve help and that it’s okay to reach out. And physically doing something might help with my cravings.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization! It’s important to acknowledge your worth and the power of proactive steps. I believe you can implement these strategies and continue on your path to stability. Remember, I’m here to support you, and we’ll check in on your progress next time.

User: Thank you. I appreciate your support today. It makes a difference.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhang! I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad you're here today. To start, I’d like to hear about your current feelings and any challenges you might be facing lately.

User: Hi. I feel a bit stable now, living in the shelter, but I still have a lot of confusion and anxiety about my future. I just don’t know what to do next. It's overwhelming.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed, especially when you're unsure about what the future holds. Can you tell me more about what specifically feels overwhelming for you?

User: I think it’s the uncertainty. I worry about staying clean and what that would look like in the long term. Sometimes I just feel stuck, like I'm not really moving forward.

Consultant: That feeling of being stuck is really challenging. It sounds like you have a desire to envision a clearer path forward. What does a successful future look like to you, especially concerning staying clean and managing your life?

User: I guess I imagine myself having a job and a routine, maybe going back to school. But then I think about how hard it will be to stay drug-free, and I feel discouraged.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel discouraged when thinking about big changes. Let's break it down a bit. What small steps do you think you could take to start moving towards that vision of yourself in the future?

User: I could probably start by looking for a volunteer opportunity or something to keep me busy. Maybe that could help me start feeling a bit better about myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a great starting point! Volunteering can indeed provide structure and a sense of accomplishment. How do you think volunteering could impact your feelings about staying clean?

User: I think it might help me feel more connected and less isolated. Plus, being around people could keep my mind off things.

Consultant: Social connections are very important, and it sounds like volunteering might help you build some of those. What kind of volunteer work interests you the most?

User: I like working with animals. There are some shelters nearby that always need help. I think that could be fulfilling.

Consultant: Working with animals could be really rewarding! It sounds like it aligns with your values and could contribute positively to your mental well-being. How would you feel about reaching out to one of those shelters this week?

User: I think I could do that. It might just be the distraction I need right now.

Consultant: That's a positive step forward! In addition to volunteering, let’s also consider your long-term goals regarding sobriety. What do you think would help you stay motivated in that area?

User: Maybe setting clearer goals for myself regarding my sobriety would help. Like, aiming to not use drugs for a certain period and then re-evaluating how I feel.

Consultant: Setting clear and measurable goals is an excellent strategy. It provides a sense of accountability and allows you to assess your progress. How about starting with a short-term goal, like one week of sobriety? How does that sound?

User: That sounds doable. I can try to commit to that.

Consultant: Great! It’s a manageable step that you can build on. Now, during that week, how might you handle cravings or urges that arise?

User: I guess I could talk to someone or distract myself with volunteering or hobbies. I need to stay busy.

Consultant: Those are solid strategies! Talking to someone can also help keep you accountable. Would you prefer reaching out to someone you trust or perhaps joining a support group during this week?

User: I think talking to a friend might be more comfortable for me right now. I’ll see if they can help me through it.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea. Having support from a friend can make a big difference. As we move forward, how do you feel about checking in on your progress with these goals during our next session?

User: That sounds good. I would appreciate having someone to discuss it with. 

Consultant: Absolutely! I’m here to support you through this. Before we wrap up today, let’s reflect on the steps we've discussed. What are the key actions you’re committed to taking before our next session?

User: I’ll reach out to a shelter to volunteer, stay sober for a week, and talk to a friend for support.

Consultant: Those are powerful actions, Zhang! It seems like you’re starting to regain a sense of control over your life. Remember to be gentle with yourself during this process. When we meet next, we can celebrate what you’ve accomplished and tackle any challenges you may face.

User: Thank you! I’m feeling a bit more hopeful now. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! It’s great to hear you feeling hopeful. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Keep believing in yourself—you’re capable of making these changes!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang San! I'm glad to see you again. In our last session, we talked about your attempts at part-time work and how it provided you with a sense of accomplishment. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I've been feeling slightly better because of that part-time job. It felt nice to have a purpose, but I still struggle with the anxiety about my future and doubts about my ability to stay clean from drugs.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that the job is giving you some purpose. It's completely normal to still have some anxiety about the future, especially when it involves significant changes in your life. Can you share more about those feelings of doubt you’re experiencing?

User: I just feel like I can't trust myself to stick to the plan. Every time I think about resisting the urge to use drugs, I wonder if I'll really be able to do it.

Consultant: Trusting yourself is a crucial part of this process. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot of fear and uncertainty. Have you noticed any moments recently where you felt more in control or confident about resisting those urges?

User: I guess there were a couple of times when I chose not to use drugs even when I was really tempted. But then I also remember the times I did give in, and that brings back a lot of negative feelings.

Consultant: It’s important to acknowledge those moments of strength when you resisted the urge to use. Let’s reflect on what helped you make those choices. What was going on for you at that time? 

User: I think I was just busy with work and didn’t have much free time to think about using. But it doesn’t change the fact that I still feel like I might fail at any moment.

Consultant: Keeping busy can be an effective strategy for you. It could be valuable to explore ways to fill your time positively. What are some activities or interests that make you feel good and keep your mind occupied?

User: I used to enjoy drawing and playing basketball, but I haven't done those in a while. I guess I could try to get back into those things.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful activities that could help lift your spirits! Engaging in things you enjoy can boost your confidence and help manage anxiety. How do you think starting to draw or play basketball again could positively impact your perspective on staying clean?

User: I think it could help distract me and make me feel like I’m achieving something outside of work, which is important to me.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Accomplishments in other areas can reinforce your self-worth. How about we set a small goal for you to engage in one of those activities this week? 

User: Sure! I’d like to try to pick up drawing again. Maybe I can set aside just 30 minutes each day for it.

Consultant: That sounds like a very manageable plan! Setting aside 30 minutes each day for drawing can provide you with a creative outlet and a chance to feel accomplished. How do you plan to keep track of your progress with this goal?

User: I could write down what I do each day or maybe even keep a little sketchbook to track my drawings.

Consultant: Writing down your progress and keeping a sketchbook is an excellent idea! This can serve as a tangible reminder of your achievements and growth. When you look back at your sketches, it can help you see your progress and boost your confidence. 

User: Yeah, I think seeing my work would make me feel good about myself, especially if I can see improvement over time.

Consultant: Absolutely! Noticing your growth is a powerful way to reinforce positive changes. Remember, these small steps add up. How do you feel about your ability to stick to this drawing goal this week?

User: I feel pretty good. Having a plan makes it seem less daunting, and I’m looking forward to it.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Having a clear plan can really make a difference. It sounds like you’re starting to feel more hopeful. What else do you think you can do this week to support your journey in staying clean and feeling confident?

User: I could talk to some friends who support me and maybe even do some drawing with them. That way, I won't feel alone in this.

Consultant: Engaging with supportive friends can indeed make a significant difference, as it builds your positive support network. Having people around who understand your journey and encourage you is very valuable. What’s your plan for reaching out to them?

User: I could invite them over for a small drawing session! It sounds fun to hang out and create together.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea, Zhang San! Drawing together not only provides support but can also help you bond through shared experiences. How do you feel about taking these steps and moving toward a more positive routine?

User: I feel excited about it. Focusing on drawing and spending time with friends seems like a good way to boost my self-esteem and keep the cravings at bay.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling excited! This positive outlook can be very empowering. As we wrap up today’s session, let's summarize what you've planned for this week. 

User: I’m going to set aside 30 minutes for drawing every day and invite friends over to enjoy drawing sessions together.

Consultant: Excellent! Those sound like solid, actionable steps. Remember, it’s about building on these experiences and recognizing your achievements. How do you feel about taking these steps moving forward?

User: I feel more confident. It's nice to have a plan and direction. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhang San! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. I look forward to hearing how things go in our next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello Zhang, it's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling a bit better, actually. Participating in the community activities has been helpful, and I feel more connected with others who understand my struggles. But I still find it hard to think about completely giving up drugs.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you've found support through community activities. Feeling connected can be very powerful. You mentioned having difficulty thinking about giving up drugs entirely—could you elaborate on that feeling?

User: Yeah, it’s just that sometimes I feel overwhelmed by the idea of it. I mean, it feels like losing a part of me, and I worry about what it would mean for my future.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s understandable to feel a sense of loss when considering such a significant change. It sounds like there are many emotions tied to this process for you. What specific thoughts or fears come up when you think about giving up drugs?

User: I often think about how I won't fit in anymore. I worry about not knowing how to cope with stress without them. I feel like I'm losing my identity.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really challenging. It seems you're fearing both the loss of connection and not having coping mechanisms in place. Let’s take a moment to consider these thoughts—how true do you think they are? Are there alternatives you might consider?

User: I guess I’m being a bit extreme. Maybe there are other ways to cope that I haven’t explored yet? It feels scary to think about, though.

Consultant: It's completely okay to feel scared; that’s a natural response to change. Let’s explore some alternatives together. If you were to imagine a friend who was in your position, what positive coping mechanisms or strategies would you suggest for them?

User: I’d probably tell them to find new hobbies or talk to more people. Maybe take up exercise or something calming, like meditation.

Consultant: Those are great ideas! Engaging in new hobbies and talking to supportive people can help create a fulfilling life outside of substance use. How do you feel about trying to implement some of these strategies in your own life?

User: I think it’s worth a shot. I could try some exercise or join a new class. I just hope it helps me feel better in the long run.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step! Setting small, achievable goals can help you gradually adjust. What’s one small action you can take this week toward those hobbies or activities?

User: Maybe I could start going for walks in the park to clear my head. It won’t be too demanding, and I might actually enjoy it.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Starting with walks can be both refreshing and grounding. How do you think you might feel after taking that action?

User: I think it could help me feel more relaxed. Just to be outside and away from my usual routines might clear my mind a bit.

Consultant: Absolutely! Fresh air and a change of scenery can really aid in relaxation and clarity. Alongside this new action, how do you feel about continuing to lean on your support network?

User: I think I need to keep reaching out. I hesitate sometimes, but I've realized they really do help me feel less alone.

Consultant: That's a valuable realization. Maintaining those connections can strengthen your resilience. Is there a specific person or group you’d like to reach out to this week?

User: I could message a couple of people I met at the community activities. They seem to understand what I’m going through.

Consultant: That’s an excellent choice! Keeping those lines of communication open can provide additional support when times get tough. How do you feel about setting that intention for this week?

User: I feel more confident about it now. I think reaching out could really help me stay on track.

Consultant: That’s great to hear, Zhang! Discussing your goals and intentions can make them feel more achievable. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on some progress you've made. What do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think I’ve realized that I can take small steps toward a healthier life and that it’s okay to feel uncertain about the journey. I’m also grateful for my support network.

Consultant: That's a significant insight, and it highlights your growth. Embracing both the process and your support as you navigate this path is crucial. Moving forward, what strategy can you employ when you start to feel overwhelmed again?

User: I could remind myself of the small steps I can take and reach out to my support. That helps me remember I’m not alone.

Consultant: Perfect! Keeping that perspective can provide strength when you need it most. I’m proud of how far you’ve come, and I believe you have the tools to continue moving forward. For our next session, we can discuss how those actions go and what you've learned about yourself along the way.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I feel lighter just talking about it all.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m glad our conversation has brought you some relief. Remember, you're on a journey, and every step counts. Looking forward to hearing about your progress next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad to see you again for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a lot better, actually. With a stable place to stay and the community support I’m getting, I feel more in control.

Consultant: That's great to hear! It sounds like the stability and support have made a positive impact on your well-being. Can you tell me more about how you’ve been finding the community activities?

User: Yeah, joining those activities has been really helpful. I feel more connected with people and less isolated. It’s encouraging to see others who are going through similar struggles.

Consultant: Connection can be very powerful in recovery. It’s encouraging to hear you've found a supportive community. What kinds of activities have you been participating in?

User: I've been going to support group meetings and also joined a sports club. The exercise feels good, and I enjoy the camaraderie.

Consultant: That sounds fantastic! It's wonderful that you're engaging in both mental and physical activities. How do you feel when participating in these activities?

User: I feel more relaxed and less anxious compared to before. During group meetings, it’s nice to share and listen to others’ experiences.

Consultant: It seems that being part of these groups helps you feel less alone in your journey. Reflecting on your progress, what would you say has been your biggest achievement recently?

User: I think just being able to stay clean for a few weeks has been huge for me. I never thought I could do it, but now I feel proud.

Consultant: Absolutely, that is a substantial achievement! Acknowledging your successes is very important. As we look toward the future, what kinds of support do you think you might need to maintain this progress?

User: I believe keeping up with the community and maybe some regular check-ins with a counselor would be helpful. I don't want to slip back into old habits.

Consultant: That's a wise approach. Staying engaged with your community and having regular support can help reinforce your progress. Do you feel confident in reaching out for this support when needed?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. I’ve started to realize the importance of communication.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you feel more confident about reaching out! Communication with your support network will be crucial as you navigate challenges. Have you thought about specific goals or plans you want to achieve in the near future?

User: I want to find a part-time job. I think being productive will help me stay focused and build my confidence even more.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic goal! Engaging in work can indeed offer structure and purpose. What steps do you think you could take to start looking for a job?

User: I could update my resume and start applying online. I also heard about a job fair happening soon.

Consultant: Excellent plan! Updating your resume and attending the job fair are both proactive steps. Are there any potential challenges you anticipate in this process?

User: I guess I might feel overwhelmed with applications or interviews. Sometimes I doubt myself.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. Doubts can come up, especially when facing new challenges. Let’s explore how you could handle those feelings when they arise. What might help you stay focused on your strengths?

User: I could remind myself of my accomplishments so far and lean on my support system when I feel anxious.

Consultant: That’s a strong strategy! Reflecting on your achievements and leaning on others can provide a solid foundation during challenging moments. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any other concerns you have?

User: I feel pretty good about our discussion. I just want to make sure I keep moving forward.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset! Let’s summarize what we’ve covered today. You’ve made significant progress, and you have supportive plans in place. What are the key takeaways you want to remember from this session?

User: I want to focus on my supports, keep working on my goals, and remember how far I’ve come.
