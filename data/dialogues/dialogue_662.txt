Consultant: Hello! Welcome back to our session. I’m glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi, I've been feeling pretty anxious, to be honest. I still struggle a lot with looking people in the eyes, especially when I have to speak in front of the class. It's really overwhelming.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like the pressure of speaking in front of others is still causing you significant anxiety. Let’s try to explore that feeling together. Can you share what thoughts go through your mind when you find yourself in those situations?

User: Well, I often think that people will judge me if I mess up. It makes me really nervous, and I just want to avoid it altogether.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It seems like the fear of judgment is creating a loop of anxiety for you. When you start to feel that way, what emotions come up for you specifically?

User: I feel really scared and sometimes even embarrassed. I just want to disappear, you know? 

Consultant: It’s tough to feel that way. It sounds like these situations trigger intense feelings of fear and embarrassment. Can you recall a recent event where you felt this way?

User: Yes, there was a class meeting last week where we were supposed to share our experiences, and I just froze up. I didn’t want to speak out loud at all. 

Consultant: Freezing up is a common response when feeling anxious. I wonder, what were your thoughts in that moment? What went through your mind right before the meeting?

User: I kept thinking about how I would embarrass myself, and what if nobody liked what I said? It just felt so stressful.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very intense. It seems that your mind was filled with worries about judgment. If a friend were in that same situation, what advice would you give them?

User: I’d probably tell them to just be themselves and not worry so much about what others think. But I can’t seem to follow that advice myself.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It is often easier to give advice than to take it ourselves. Let’s challenge those negative thoughts. Do you think there’s evidence that supports the idea that people will judge you harshly for speaking up?

User: I guess not really. I haven’t had any major criticism before, but I still worry about it.

Consultant: It’s interesting to note that your fears might not be based on reality. What would happen if you tried to remind yourself of this when you start to feel anxious?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that I have a right to speak and that people might actually be understanding.

Consultant: That’s a powerful thought! Practicing this kind of supportive self-talk could help reduce your anxiety. What’s one small action you could take in your next class to practice speaking up?

User: Maybe I could try answering a question or sharing a small comment. That feels a bit less daunting than a full speech.

Consultant: That sounds like a very reasonable step! Starting small can allow you to build confidence gradually. How do you think you’d feel after attempting that?

User: I think I’d feel proud of myself for trying, even if it’s just a little bit.

Consultant: Absolutely! Feeling proud of your efforts is important. Let’s also incorporate some relaxation techniques you can use before speaking. Would you like to explore a simple technique together?

User: Yes, I’d be open to that.

Consultant: Great! One effective technique is deep breathing. Try inhaling deeply through your nose, holding your breath for a moment, and then exhaling slowly through your mouth. We can practice it a few times now. Ready?

User: Okay, I’m ready. 

Consultant: Let’s do it together. Inhale... hold... and exhale. How does that feel for you?

User: It feels a bit calming. I like the idea of doing this before I have to speak.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Deep breathing can help you manage your anxiety. Now, as you continue to face these situations, what reminders can you give yourself to stay grounded and calm?

User: I can remind myself that it’s okay to be nervous and that I’ve prepared for this. And also to breathe.

Consultant: Exactly! Reminding yourself of your preparation and using your breathing techniques can be powerful tools. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think recognizing that my fears might be exaggerated helps a lot. And practicing breathing sounds manageable.

Consultant: That's a wonderful realization! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made in recognizing these thought patterns. Remember, it’s okay to take small steps. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. 

User: Thank you! I feel a little better about facing class now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep practicing those techniques, and remember, progress takes time. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, He! Welcome back to our session. I’m glad to see you again. Last time, we talked about your feelings of anxiety when called on in class. How have you been since then?

User: Hi. I've been thinking a lot about our last session. I still feel anxious about speaking up in class, especially after that incident where I couldn't answer the teacher. I keep replaying the moment in my head, feeling disappointed in myself.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when a moment feels challenging. Let's talk about those feelings. What thoughts go through your mind when you think about that moment in class?

User: I just keep thinking that I embarrassed myself. I shouldn't have let my nerves get the best of me. I feel like everyone is judging me for it.

Consultant: It makes sense that you would feel embarrassed and think others might judge you. Let's explore that thought—what evidence do you have that others are actually judging you? 

User: I don't know… I just feel like they must think I’m stupid for not knowing the answer.

Consultant: That's a really tough feeling to carry. But is it possible that your classmates are focused on their own concerns rather than judging you? Can we think of times when someone else didn't know an answer, and how you reacted?

User: I guess I didn't think badly of them. I just felt bad for them. But I don't feel like people would extend that same kindness to me.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that perspective. Could it be that your feelings of self-judgment are stronger than the judgments from others? What would you say to a friend who felt the way you do right now?

User: I would tell them it happens to everyone and that it’s okay to not know everything. Maybe I should try to tell myself that.

Consultant: That sounds like a very compassionate approach! Let’s practice that idea. How about you create a few positive affirmations you can tell yourself when you feel anxious about speaking up?

User: I could say something like, "It's okay not to know everything," or "I am learning and growing." 

Consultant: Those are great affirmations, He! Repeating these can help reshape your thinking. Now, can you remember a small situation where you felt comfortable sharing your thoughts? 

User: Last week, I did contribute in a group project, and I felt good about it. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful example! Focusing on what went well can help bolster your confidence. What can we do to build from that experience and encourage you to participate more often in class?

User: Maybe I could start by preparing a little before class, so I feel more ready if I'm called on.

Consultant: That's an excellent strategy! Preparation can indeed make you feel more at ease. Additionally, how about setting a goal to speak once during each class this week? 

User: That sounds doable. I’ll try to share at least once each class.

Consultant: Fantastic! Progress is about small steps. How do you plan to handle it if you don’t get it right the first time?

User: I guess I might just remind myself that it’s okay and try again next time.

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective! Remember, learning is a process. How do you feel about this approach moving forward?

User: I feel a bit better thinking about it as a process. I just hope I can stick to it.

Consultant: I believe you can. Let's also incorporate some relaxation techniques you can use before class to calm those nerves. How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful. What kind of techniques do you suggest?

Consultant: We could try deep breathing exercises or visualization techniques to imagine yourself speaking confidently. Would you like to practice one now?

User: Sure, I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in for a count of four… hold it for a count of four… and release it slowly for a count of six. How did that feel?

User: It felt nice to take a moment. I think I could use that before class.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Combining these strategies should help you feel more confident and prepared. What do you think will be the most helpful for you this week?

User: I think preparing in advance and using deep breathing will be really helpful.

Consultant: Excellent choices! As we wrap up, let’s reflect on your progress. You’re working towards changing your perception of social situations, and that’s a significant step.

User: I just hope I can stay positive about it.

Consultant: Remember, it’s okay to have ups and downs during this journey. What's crucial is that you continue practicing your affirmations and taking small steps. Would you like to share anything else before we end today?

User: No, I think I’m good. Thank you for your help!

Consultant: You're very welcome, He! I'm proud of your willingness to challenge those thoughts and explore new strategies. Remember to be kind to yourself—and I'm looking forward to hearing how things went in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, He! I'm glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling a bit frustrated. I tried to speak up at the club meeting, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. It made me feel really down.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that. It's understandable to feel frustrated when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone. What do you think held you back from speaking up?

User: I guess I was worried about what others would think of me. I found myself overthinking every word I wanted to say.

Consultant: That sounds tough. It seems like your concerns about others’ opinions are making it difficult for you to participate. Can you describe a specific thought you had in that moment?

User: I remember thinking that if I said something wrong, everyone would laugh at me or think I'm stupid.

Consultant: That’s a common fear, and it can be very paralyzing. Let’s explore that thought together. How much evidence do you think supports the idea that others would laugh at or judge you harshly?

User: I don't really know... I mean, I’ve seen people make mistakes and not get laughed at, but when it’s my turn, it feels different.

Consultant: It makes sense that it feels different in your own experience. However, it might help to consider that everyone makes mistakes, and often, people are more understanding than we think. If a friend were in your position, how would you respond to them?

User: I would probably tell them it's okay to make mistakes and that everyone has to start somewhere.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve recognized that what you’d tell a friend can also apply to yourself. Now, let's think of small steps you could take to practice speaking up. What might be one easy way for you to start expressing yourself in a group setting?

User: Maybe I could start by asking simple questions when the group is discussing something I don’t understand.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Asking questions can be a fantastic way to engage without putting too much pressure on yourself. How would you feel about trying that in the next meeting?

User: I think I could do that. It feels a bit less scary than trying to make a big statement.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s important to take small, manageable steps. Let’s also discuss some techniques to help you feel more relaxed when you're anxious. Have you ever tried deep breathing exercises?

User: No, I haven’t. How do they work?

Consultant: Deep breathing can help calm your mind and reduce anxiety. The idea is to focus on your breath, inhaling deeply through your nose and exhaling slowly through your mouth. Would you like to try a few breaths together now?

User: Sure! That sounds good.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in... hold it for a moment... and then exhale slowly. How did that feel for you?

User: It actually feels nice to pause and just breathe for a minute.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear it! You can use this technique whenever you're feeling anxious, especially before speaking up in group settings. As you practice, it might help to ease that anxiety. What are your thoughts on using this technique?

User: I think I’ll try it out before the next meeting! It might really help.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Now, let’s also think about your mindset as you approach these situations. What if you reframe your thoughts about speaking up? Instead of thinking about others judging you, could you think about what you want to say and how it could contribute to the group?

User: I guess I could focus on sharing my thoughts rather than worrying about if they’re perfect.

Consultant: Exactly! Shifting your focus can help you feel more empowered. It’s about sharing your perspective rather than striving for perfection. What can you take away from today’s session regarding this change in mindset?

User: I feel like I can approach the next meeting with a more open attitude, just wanting to share what I think.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic takeaway, He! You’re making great progress. To wrap up today, let’s summarize what you want to work on for next time. You’ll try asking questions and use deep breathing techniques to manage your anxiety, right?

User: Yes, I’ll definitely do that!

Consultant: Wonderful! I believe you’re heading in a positive direction. As we continue, we’ll keep building on your confidence and social skills. Remember, every little step counts. I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session.

User: Thank you! I feel like I have more tools now. I’ll see you next time. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad to hear that. Take care, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, He! I'm really glad to see you again today. It sounds like you’ve had some positive experiences with your social activities recently. How are you feeling about that?

User: Hi! Yes, I've definitely noticed some improvements. I participated in a couple of group activities, and I actually received positive feedback! It felt great, but I still find myself doubting my social skills.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling good about the feedback you received. Doubting your abilities is something many people experience, especially when they start to feel more confident. Could you tell me what those positive experiences felt like for you?

User: Well, it was nice to feel accepted by my peers. I felt involved and part of the group, and that was something I hadn't really experienced before. But then, I worry that it was just a one-time thing and that I’ll struggle next time.

Consultant: I can understand why you might feel that way, especially after experiencing a change. It’s common to fear that future success won’t be the same. Let’s explore that a bit more. What specifically makes you doubt that you can have those positive experiences again?

User: I think it’s because I’ve always been quite shy, and when I think about trying to connect with others, I imagine myself stumbling over my words or not knowing what to say.

Consultant: It sounds like you're anticipating a negative outcome based on past experiences. Those thoughts can really affect your confidence. Have you noticed any specific situations where those doubts come up strongly?

User: Yes, mainly when I’m in a new group or when I have to introduce myself. I just freeze up sometimes, and it leads to a lot of self-criticism afterward.

Consultant: Freezing up in new situations is a common challenge, especially in social settings. It may help to remind yourself of the positive experiences you’ve had recently. What thoughts do you have when you recall your recent successful interactions?

User: I remember feeling happy and relieved, and I want to feel that way again. It’s just hard to shake off the negative thoughts.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like there's a conflict between the positive memories and the negative self-talk. Let’s try a different approach. If a friend were in your situation, what would you tell them about those successful moments?

User: I’d probably remind them to focus on the positives and that it’s okay to make mistakes. Nobody is perfect after all.

Consultant: That’s a really supportive perspective! It’s valuable to extend that kindness to yourself as well. How might you apply that advice to your own experience when you’re feeling doubtful?

User: I could try to remind myself that those positives are real and that feeling nervous is normal. Maybe I should write down those positive experiences to look back on.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent idea! Keeping a record of your positive experiences can serve as a powerful reminder of your growth and capabilities. Would you be open to starting a journal for this purpose?

User: Yes, I think that would help. It could motivate me to engage more in social situations knowing I have successes to reflect on.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflecting on your successes can reinforce your confidence. Let's discuss some specific strategies you can use when you enter new social situations. Are there particular activities or types of interactions you'd like to focus on first?

User: I want to focus on group discussions, especially during class projects. I usually struggle there.

Consultant: Great choice! One approach could be to prepare a few comments or questions in advance for those discussions. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds helpful! I often rely on being spontaneous, but I think having some thoughts ready could ease my anxiety.

Consultant: Having a few prepared thoughts can alleviate the pressure of having to come up with something on the spot. Would you be willing to practice this with a classmate before your next project?

User: Yes, I think that would be a constructive way to build my confidence.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Practicing in a safe environment can really make a difference. As we wrap up today, let’s revisit what you’ve learned. What are the key takeaways for you?

User: I realized I need to be kinder to myself and that my positive experiences count. Writing them down could encourage me, and preparing for group discussions could help reduce my anxiety.

Consultant: Those are powerful insights, He! You're showing a lot of progress in recognizing your strengths and working on strategies to enhance your social skills. How do you feel about continuing this journey in your next sessions?

User: I feel excited! I want to keep building on these experiences and strategies.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! I believe in your ability to further develop your confidence. Today was a fantastic step forward, and I look forward to our next session. Remember, you're making great strides!

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your support. See you next time!

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, He! It's great to see you again. I'm really looking forward to our session today. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I feel really good! I actively spoke in the class meeting, and my classmates gave me positive feedback. It made me feel quite proud of myself.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! It sounds like that experience helped boost your confidence, which is wonderful. Can you tell me more about how it felt to receive that positive feedback?

User: It felt amazing! I've always been shy, so getting recognition from my classmates really motivated me to want to participate more in class and social activities.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that recognition has motivated you! Participating more can definitely help with building confidence. Do you think you’ll carry this momentum into future social interactions?

User: Yes, I hope so. I'm feeling more open to speaking up now, and I want to keep improving in that area.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset. Let's take a moment to reflect on what strategies you used to speak up in the class. What thoughts helped you overcome your initial hesitation?

User: I kept reminding myself that everyone has something valuable to contribute. I also focused on the fact that my classmates were supportive and wouldn’t judge me harshly.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! You were able to shift your focus from fear of judgment to positive reinforcement. How do you think this realization can help you in similar situations going forward?

User: I think I can remind myself of that supportive environment again. It makes me feel less anxious about speaking. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Remembering that supportive environment can reduce anxiety. Are there specific situations coming up where you think you could apply this mindset?

User: Yes, there’s a group project starting next week. I have a chance to lead a part of it, and I want to take that opportunity to express my ideas.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful opportunity! How do you feel about potentially taking on that leadership role?

User: I’m excited but also a bit nervous. It’s a big responsibility, and I worry about not meeting everyone's expectations.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about that. Let's explore those worries. What specific thoughts come to mind when you think about not meeting expectations?

User: I think that if I fail, my classmates will lose respect for me. And I may lose confidence again.

Consultant: Your concerns are valid, and it’s great that you’re identifying them. Let’s challenge this thought. Can you think of any evidence that contradicts the belief that one misstep would lead to losing respect?

User: I suppose my classmates have always encouraged me. They might actually understand if I made a mistake, since we all deal with challenges together.

Consultant: Exactly! Evaluating the evidence can provide a clearer picture. What do you think would happen if you allowed yourself to make mistakes while leading the group?

User: Maybe I'd feel more relaxed about the whole thing. It’s impossible to be perfect, after all.

Consultant: That's a healthy perspective! Allowing for imperfections can relieve a lot of pressure. How about this—let's discuss some steps you can take to prepare for that project while maintaining this relaxed mindset?

User: That sounds good. I could outline my ideas and perhaps even practice sharing them with a friend to build my confidence.

Consultant: Practicing with a friend is a fantastic idea! You’ll not only refine your ideas but also build comfort with sharing them. Would you like to set specific goals for making this preparation as effective as possible?

User: Sure! I’d like to have my outline done by the end of this week and practice with my friend over the weekend.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Keeping those deadlines will help keep you focused. How are you feeling about this strategy? 

User: I feel more empowered to take action! Setting those deadlines helps me stay on track.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Taking action often leads to more positive reinforcement and confidence. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what you’ve accomplished so far.

User: I think I've grown a lot in recognizing my abilities, and I’ve learned to challenge my negative thoughts about social situations.

Consultant: That's very insightful, He! Acknowledging your growth is key to maintaining these positive changes. As you move forward, keep practicing these skills, and remember, I'm here to support you whenever you need it.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I feel more ready to tackle future challenges now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep up the great work, and I’m excited to see how you continue to grow. If anything comes up, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: I will! Thanks again for everything. See you next time!

Consultant: Take care, He! Looking forward to hearing all about your progress in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, He! I'm glad to see you again for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last conversation? 

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling really good lately, especially after my mid-term exams. I got good grades, and my parents have been very supportive, which has improved our home atmosphere.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've experienced significant positive changes recently. Can you share more about how this support from your parents has impacted your feelings and motivation?

User: Yes, their praise has made me feel more confident. I used to worry a lot about my grades, but now I feel more motivated to study rather than stressed.

Consultant: It's great that you're feeling more confident and motivated. How do you think this shift in your mindset is affecting your daily life and interactions with others?

User: I find myself being more open and less anxious in school. I even joined a few clubs, which I wouldn't have done before. It feels liberating.

Consultant: Joining clubs sounds like a significant step forward! What do you enjoy most about these new experiences and interactions?

User: I really enjoy meeting new people and working on projects together. It’s not as scary as I thought it would be. I even made a new friend!

Consultant: That's fantastic! It seems like you're not only gaining skills but also building connections. However, are there still any areas where you feel challenged or stuck?

User: Sometimes, I still worry about meeting expectations, especially if I don’t do as well as before. I fear that I might let my parents down.

Consultant: It’s natural to have those concerns, especially with parental expectations. Let's explore this a bit—how do these worries affect your emotions or behaviors when you’re studying or interacting with others?

User: When I worry, I tend to avoid studying because I feel overwhelmed. It’s like I freeze up instead of tackling things head-on.

Consultant: That sounds challenging. It’s a common reaction to feel overwhelmed and want to avoid what’s causing stress. Have you tried any strategies to help manage that feeling when it arises?

User: I haven’t really thought about strategies. I usually just end up procrastinating, which only makes it worse.

Consultant: Procrastination can often add to the pressure. Let’s discuss some alternatives. What if we worked on identifying those feelings and tried to tackle tasks in smaller steps? How does that sound to you?

User: I think that could help. Breaking things down sounds more manageable.

Consultant: Great! Let’s brainstorm some small steps for you. What’s a study task you often find overwhelming that we could break down together?

User: Preparing for an upcoming presentation. I always dread it and feel like I have to perfect every detail.

Consultant: Let’s break it down. Instead of aiming for perfection, what if we focused on completing one part of it at a time? For instance, what’s the first step you can take right now that feels achievable?

User: Maybe I could start by outlining my main points instead of worrying about the whole thing.

Consultant: That’s an excellent first step! Outlining can help you organize your thoughts without feeling overwhelmed. After creating the outline, how will you feel?

User: I think I would feel relieved, like I have a plan instead of just a big, daunting task.

Consultant: Exactly! Having a plan can significantly reduce anxiety. Let’s ensure you set a specific time for this outlining task. When do you think you can start?

User: I guess I can try to work on it tomorrow after school.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Tomorrow, aim to dedicate a set time to work on your outline. How about we check in on this progress in our next session?

User: Sure! I’ll let you know how it goes. 

Consultant: I’m looking forward to hearing about it! Before we wrap up, let's reflect on the positive changes you've shared today. What stands out to you the most regarding your progress?

User: I think how I've become more social and confident really stands out. It’s nice to see my efforts paying off.

Consultant: Absolutely! You've made great strides. Remember, it’s also important to acknowledge that it's okay to have challenges. You’re not alone in that. Is there anything specific you'd like to carry forward from today into our next conversation?

User: Just to keep working on managing my worries and celebrating my progress, I think.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic attitude! I'm so proud of the progress you've made. As we conclude today, remember that you've built some excellent foundations. If you keep applying these strategies, I believe you’ll continue to thrive. 

User: Thanks! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Keep up the great work, and I'll see you next time!
