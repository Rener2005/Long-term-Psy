Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, especially regarding your speech?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious. Since I moved into the dorm, I share a room with a classmate who also stutters. It's making my own speech issues flare up again, and I'm terrified of facing my classmates and talking in class.

Consultant: It sounds really challenging for you, especially being in such close proximity to someone who shares a similar struggle. Let's delve a bit deeper into how this affects your daily life—when you think about speaking in class, what feelings come up for you?

User: I feel a mix of fear and embarrassment. I'm worried that I might stutter again and that everyone will notice. It makes me want to avoid speaking altogether, which isn't helping with my studies or socializing.

Consultant: That sounds very uncomfortable, Li. It's understandable to have these fears, especially if you've experienced stuttering before. What do you think those thoughts about stuttering are telling you right now?

User: I keep thinking that I’ll embarrass myself and that my classmates will judge me. It's like every time I think about talking, my heart races, and I freeze up.

Consultant: It’s important to recognize that these thoughts can be very powerful. Let’s explore them together. How likely do you believe it is that your classmates will judge you harshly if you do stutter?

User: I guess I feel like they would think less of me. I mean, it’s not something people see every day, right? 

Consultant: I understand that concern. However, it might be useful to consider that most people are more understanding than we assume. What if we viewed your stuttering not as a weakness but as just a part of who you are? How does that idea make you feel?

User: That sounds nice, but it’s hard to believe. I just want to sound normal like everyone else. 

Consultant: I hear you, and it’s completely valid to desire that. Let’s try a different approach. If a close friend was in your position, what would you advise them to think about their own speech difficulties?

User: I would probably tell them to just be themselves and not worry so much about what others think.

Consultant: That’s great advice! What if you could apply that same kindness and understanding to yourself? How could that shift in perspective help you during stressful speaking situations?

User: I guess it could help me relax a bit? I just don’t know how to apply that when I’m actually speaking.

Consultant: That makes sense. One technique we can explore is the use of relaxation strategies before and during speaking. Would you be open to trying a few breathing techniques to manage your anxiety when you feel it creeping in?

User: Sure, I’d like to learn. I just get so overwhelmed sometimes.

Consultant: Absolutely, being overwhelmed is a common reaction. Let’s practice some deep breathing together. Inhale slowly through your nose, hold for a moment, and exhale gently through your mouth. How does that feel to you?

User: It feels calming, but I’m not sure it will help in front of others.

Consultant: That’s a fair concern, but the more you practice, the more natural it will feel. What if we also create a plan for gradually introducing more speaking moments in a low-pressure environment? How does that sound?

User: Yeah, I could try that. Maybe starting with small groups?

Consultant: Exactly! You could start with a few friends. It’s all about taking small steps. Let's brainstorm some specific scenarios where you can practice speaking without too much pressure. 

User: Okay, I think I could read a paragraph in front of my friends. That feels manageable.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start! How about we set a goal for you to do that by next week? What might be a good way to prepare for it?

User: I could practice reading the paragraph out loud a few times before I do it in front of them.

Consultant: Great idea! Practicing in advance can help build your confidence. Let’s also reflect on potential positive outcomes of sharing your speech experience with them. What could happen if they support you?

User: I guess they could be understanding and help me feel more comfortable. 

Consultant: Yes! Their support could be really encouraging. Remember that building confidence takes time, and it’s okay to feel nervous at first. What are some other strategies we could include to help you feel more prepared?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone makes mistakes sometimes. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful reminder! Mistakes are a part of learning and growth. How do you envision reminding yourself of this during your speaking moments?

User: I could repeat it to myself before I speak. Maybe even write it down and keep it with me.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Keeping a note can act as a cue to help manage those fears. Let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today and how you plan to implement these strategies moving forward. 

User: I’ll practice deep breathing, prepare a paragraph to read to friends, and remind myself that everyone makes mistakes.

Consultant: Absolutely! Those are fantastic steps. I’m proud of what you’re doing to face these challenges. Remember, it’s a journey, so be gentle with yourself. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit better about it now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Li! You're making progress, and I believe in your ability to manage these feelings. We can continue working through this together. If you ever feel overwhelmed, you can always come back and talk.

User: I appreciate that. I’m looking forward to practicing and feeling more confident.

Consultant: I’m looking forward to our next session, where we can review how everything went. Remember, you’re doing great. Take care until we meet again!

User: Thanks, see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hi there, welcome back! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been struggling a bit. The fear of stuttering when answering questions in class is still really bothering me. I try to raise my hand, but my heart races and I freeze up.

Consultant: It sounds like that fear is really overwhelming you during those moments. Can you tell me more about what goes through your mind just before you answer a question?

User: I get really anxious and think, "What if I stutter? Everyone will notice, and they’ll think I’m not smart." It makes me even more nervous.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Those thoughts can be quite distressing. Let’s explore how those thoughts affect you. How does that fear of stuttering make you feel emotionally and physically?

User: I feel embarrassed and ashamed. Physically, I get really sweaty, and sometimes my hands shake. It’s like I want to disappear.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It seems like this situation brings a lot of discomfort. Let's look at this fear more closely. What evidence do you have that others will judge you negatively if you stutter?

User: I guess I don’t really have any solid evidence. Most of my classmates are supportive. But I still can’t shake the feeling that they’ll laugh or judge me.

Consultant: It’s common to feel that way, even without clear evidence. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about those thoughts?

User: I’d probably say that everyone has their struggles and that people are usually more focused on themselves than judging others.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective! It sounds like you already have some understanding of this situation. Let’s work on challenging those negative thoughts together. What alternative thoughts could you try to replace the fear of being judged?

User: Maybe I could tell myself, "It's okay to stutter; it doesn't define my intelligence." Or "Most people are kind and understand."

Consultant: Those are fantastic alternative thoughts! Reminding yourself of these can help reduce anxiety. Let’s practice using those thoughts in some role-playing scenarios. How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful! I think practicing could make me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Great! Imagine you’re called on in class. Instead of focusing on the fear of stuttering, try using one of those new thoughts. Would you like to give it a try?

User: Okay, I'll try! "It’s okay to stutter; it doesn’t define my intelligence." 

Consultant: Excellent! Now, picture yourself in that classroom, taking a deep breath and speaking. What do you notice when you focus on that thought instead of the fear?

User: I feel a bit lighter and more confident just thinking about it. It’s nice to remind myself it's okay.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! Confidence can start to grow with practice. What small steps can you take this week to reinforce that confidence in class?

User: Maybe I could start by volunteering to answer easier questions first. That way, I can practice without too much pressure.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent strategy! Starting small can build your confidence. How about setting a goal for how many questions you’d like to answer this week?

User: I think I can aim for two questions. One in each class should be manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like a realistic goal. Remember to focus on your alternative thoughts and celebrate your successes, no matter how small. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel more hopeful. Having a plan makes me less anxious.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Let’s also discuss ways to reinforce your confidence outside of class. Are there any activities you enjoy that could help you practice speaking more freely?

User: I enjoy reading aloud and practicing speeches. I could do that more often.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Regular practice can help you feel more at ease. How about creating a schedule for your reading aloud sessions? 

User: Yes, I could do it a few times a week. It also feels less daunting than speaking in class.

Consultant: Perfect! Aim for a comfortable level. Remember, each time you practice, you’re strengthening your communication skills. As we wrap up today, what do you think has been the most important takeaway from our session?

User: I think it’s understanding that my thoughts don’t have to control me. I can challenge them.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! You’re already making progress. Keep working on those alternative thoughts and practice your speaking. I’m proud of you! 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’ll come back next week to share how it goes.

Consultant: Looking forward to hearing about your experiences. Take care and see you soon!

Consultant: Hello, Li! I'm glad you're back for another session. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I've been a bit better, but I still feel pretty anxious when I think about speaking in social situations. I tried to join in some group activities, but I got really nervous and ended up not saying much.

Consultant: It's great to hear you're making an effort to participate in group activities, even if it feels challenging right now. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel nervous when trying to speak?

User: I just keep worrying about how I might stutter or not express myself clearly. It's like I'm focused on that instead of just enjoying the conversation.

Consultant: I see. That worry about stuttering seems to take away from your ability to enjoy those interactions. What would it mean for you to feel more relaxed and engaged in those conversations?

User: I guess it would mean that I could just talk without constantly worrying about how my words come out. I want to feel more free and confident when I'm with friends.

Consultant: Feeling free and confident is definitely a worthwhile goal. Let's explore what would happen if you allowed yourself to experience those moments, even with the possibility of stuttering. How do you think your friends would react if that happened?

User: I think they would probably be understanding, but I still feel embarrassed about it. 

Consultant: That embarrassment is completely valid. It’s normal to feel that way, especially in social situations. I wonder if we can look at this together: what evidence do you have that your friends would judge you harshly if you stuttered?

User: I mean, I guess they haven't really said anything negative before. They actually seem quite supportive.

Consultant: It's helpful to notice that past experiences haven’t indicated negative judgment from your friends. What if we tried to focus on that support instead? How might that change how you approach conversations?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that they’re rooting for me, and that would help me feel a bit better about speaking more freely.

Consultant: That's a great insight! Focusing on their support could indeed help shift your perspective. Let's also consider a small step you can take to practice this. Could you set up a low-pressure conversation with a friend where you intentionally allow yourself to speak freely, regardless of any stuttering?

User: I could try that. I think I might ask a close friend to just have a casual chat, no pressure.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! As you prepare for this conversation, what thoughts might come up that could make you feel anxious? 

User: I might think about how I might embarrass myself, or that I should be perfect. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those thoughts. How about we challenge those thoughts? Can you think of an alternative belief that you could tell yourself during this conversation?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it's okay not to be perfect and that my friends value me for who I am, not just how I speak.

Consultant: That’s a powerful and constructive reframe! Remembering that your friends appreciate you as a whole can help ease some of that anxiety. What other supportive thoughts could you keep in mind during your chat?

User: I could think about how it’s just a conversation and that it’s more important to share my thoughts than to focus on how I’m expressing them.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective! It’s great to see you developing these supportive thoughts. Let's explore what it might feel like to invite some acceptance of your speech in this situation. How do you feel about potentially embracing the fact that stuttering might happen?

User: Honestly, it feels a bit scary, but I also think it could be freeing to not let it hold me back.

Consultant: That’s a brave step, Li! Embracing that possibility can open many doors for you socially. Perhaps we can visualize how you would deal with a moment of stuttering during your conversation. What strategies can you apply in that situation?

User: Maybe I could take a deep breath and just keep going, or even make a joke about it to lighten the mood.

Consultant: Both of those strategies can be very effective! Using humor can be particularly helpful in easing tension. How do you feel about the idea of practicing this visualization before your chat?

User: I think that could help. Visualizing could make me feel more prepared for everything.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s set some time before your conversation to visualize it. As you do that, remember to focus on enjoying the moment and connecting with your friend. What are your thoughts about this approach going forward?

User: I feel more hopeful about it. I just need to keep reminding myself to focus on the conversation rather than fixating on my speech.

Consultant: That's a fantastic mindset to cultivate! I believe you’re on a great path. As we wrap up today, what will you take away from our discussion that you think will support you?

User: I’ll remember to count on the support of my friends and focus on enjoying conversations, even if I stutter.

Consultant: Those are powerful takeaways! I’m excited for you to apply this mindset and see how it changes your interactions. Let’s check in again soon to talk about how it went. You’ve got this!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially with the upcoming speech competition?

User: Hi. I've been feeling a mix of excitement and fear. On one hand, I want to challenge myself. On the other hand, I'm really worried about my stuttering and whether it will get worse in front of everyone.

Consultant: I understand that feeling. It's completely normal to have both excitement and anxiety about this challenge. Can you tell me more about your thoughts regarding the speech competition and how they make you feel?

User: Well, I keep thinking about how everyone is going to judge me if I stutter. That makes me really anxious, and sometimes I even feel like giving up before I start.

Consultant: That makes sense, Li. It's understandable to feel anxious about judgment, especially given your past experiences. Let’s work together to pinpoint some of those thoughts. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you start to feel anxious about the speech?

User: I often think, "What if I mess up and can't get the words out?" Then I feel embarrassed, and it makes me want to avoid speaking altogether.

Consultant: It sounds like a strong fear of embarrassment is at play. Let’s explore that thought further. How much evidence do you have to support the idea that you will mess up? Has this always happened when you've spoken in front of others?

User: Well, not always. Sometimes I do manage to get through. But when I focus too much on the possibility of messing up, it just gets worse.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, Li. It sounds like there's a cycle where focusing on the fear makes the stuttering worse. What if we tried to challenge that thought? If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I guess I would tell them not to worry so much and to just give it their best shot. Sometimes it’s okay to stumble a little.

Consultant: Absolutely! It's okay to stumble; it happens to everyone. How would it feel to apply that same understanding and kindness to yourself regarding the speech?

User: I think I could try to remind myself that it’s alright if I don’t speak perfectly. But the fear still lingers.

Consultant: That’s a step in the right direction. Let’s practice some strategies to manage that fear. One approach is to visualize a successful speech. Can you imagine yourself giving the speech confidently and smoothly?

User: I can try that. It does sound calming to think about it going well instead of focusing on the worst-case scenario.

Consultant: Great! Visualization can help you create a positive mental image, which might reduce anxiety. Let’s also discuss some self-regulation techniques you can use during the speech. Have you considered any strategies to calm yourself if you start feeling anxious?

User: I haven’t really thought about that. What do you suggest?

Consultant: Breathing exercises can be very effective. For instance, try taking deep breaths before you start speaking to help ground you. Would you like to practice a breathing technique together now?

User: Sure, that would help. I’d like to feel calmer before the speech.

Consultant: Alright, let’s take a deep breath together. Inhale through your nose for a count of four… hold it for a count of four… and exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of four. Let's repeat that a few times. How does that feel?

User: It feels a bit relaxing. I can see how this might help when I’m feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! There’s power in preparation and practice. As we approach the competition, remember to use the positive affirmations we discussed before. What might be a helpful affirmation for you to use during your preparation?

User: “I will do my best, and it’s okay if things don’t go perfectly.” I think that works for me.

Consultant: That’s a great affirmation! Repeating it to yourself can help build your confidence and reduce the anxiety. Before we wrap up today, is there anything else you’d like to discuss that feels important?

User: I think I just want to make sure I stay calm during the competition. I hope to keep reminding myself of everything we talked about today.

Consultant: That’s an excellent intention, Li. Remember, it’s a journey, and you're not alone in this. As we conclude, let’s reflect on how far you’ve come. What are you most proud of achieving in our sessions?

User: I’m proud that I’m trying to face my fears instead of running from them. It feels empowering.

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement! Maintaining that sense of empowerment will serve you well. Remember to be kind to yourself through this process. If you ever need support, I’m here. Good luck with the competition!

User: Thank you! I feel more prepared now and I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You're welcome, Li. I'm confident you’ll do great! Take care and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Li! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since your speech competition?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. Completing that speech was a big boost for my confidence. I was a bit nervous before, but I managed to do it and received a lot of encouragement from my classmates and teachers.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like the encouragement you received has really helped bolster your confidence. What do you think you've learned about yourself through this experience?

User: I learned that I can handle pressure better than I thought. Even though I still stutter sometimes, I realized it doesn't define me or my abilities. 

Consultant: That's an important realization, Li. It seems like you've started to distinguish your worth from your stuttering, which is a big step. How has this change in perspective impacted your daily interactions?

User: I feel less afraid to participate in class now. I used to avoid speaking up, but now I try to share my thoughts more often, even if I'm not perfect.

Consultant: That's a fantastic development! Actively participating can really help improve your speaking skills and boost your confidence further. Have you found any strategies or techniques that help you when you feel anxious about speaking?

User: I've been practicing some techniques I learned in therapy, like taking deep breaths and focusing on what I want to say instead of worrying about stuttering.

Consultant: Deep breathing and focusing on your message instead of the mechanics of speech are excellent strategies. Have you noticed any differences or improvements when using them?

User: Yes! When I remember to breathe and concentrate, I feel more relaxed and my words come out a bit smoother. I guess my mind is less cluttered that way.

Consultant: It sounds like those strategies are really working for you! Let's talk about how you can apply this experience to future speaking situations. Are there any specific scenarios you're anxious about right now?

User: I think upcoming class presentations might make me nervous. Even though I've improved, I still worry about not being fluent enough.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel anxious about presentations, especially when you're striving to improve. What do you think you could do to prepare yourself for those presentations this time around?

User: I could practice in front of a mirror or maybe record myself. That way, I can see how I perform and identify areas to work on.

Consultant: Practicing in front of a mirror or recording yourself can be very beneficial! It allows you to observe your progress and reinforce your techniques. Would you be comfortable setting specific goals for your practice sessions before the next presentation?

User: Yeah, I think that would help. I can set a goal to practice for at least 15 minutes every day leading up to the presentation.

Consultant: That sounds like an achievable and productive goal! Daily practice can really help solidify what you've learned. Can we also outline a few affirmations or positive thoughts to remind yourself of during these practice sessions to counter any negativity?

User: Sure! I could remind myself that my voice matters, and that it’s okay to make mistakes. Everyone speaks differently.

Consultant: Those affirmations are excellent, Li. Acknowledging that everyone has their unique way of speaking can help you feel more at ease. As you prepare, think about how you can celebrate each small success, too!

User: I could reward myself with something I enjoy, like playing a video game after each practice session.

Consultant: A rewarding system sounds like a great motivation! It’s important to celebrate your efforts. Now, how do you feel about the progress you've made so far?

User: I feel proud and determined. Even though I still have moments of doubt, I believe I can keep improving.

Consultant: That's a wonderful mindset to have. Remember, it's a journey, and each step counts. As we wrap up today, what are the key takeaways you’d like to focus on moving forward?

User: I want to keep using my breathing techniques, set up regular practice sessions, and remind myself that it’s okay to not be perfect.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals, Li. You've made significant progress, and I believe you can continue on this path. As we finish our session, remember you’re not alone in this—you have the skills to handle future challenges. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance. I feel more confident about what’s ahead.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Keep practicing and believing in yourself. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Remember, anytime you need support, I'm here for you. 

User: Yes, I will! I'll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li! It's great to see you again. I hope you're doing well. Let's start by talking about how you've been since our last session. What are your current feelings about your speech and social interactions?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good overall. My speech has improved a lot, and I’ve been participating more in group activities. I even joined the speech team at school, which was something I was really anxious about before. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Li! It sounds like you’re making great progress in terms of your speech and getting involved in activities. How has being part of the speech team impacted your confidence in expressing yourself?

User: It's really boosted my confidence. I used to dread speaking in front of people, but now I'm starting to enjoy it more. I still get a bit nervous, but it's manageable. 

Consultant: That’s a significant change! It’s totally normal to feel a little nervous, even when you’re doing well. Can you tell me about any specific moments during your recent activities where you felt particularly proud or challenged?

User: Well, during our last practice, I presented a short speech. I felt nervous at first, but once I started speaking, it felt okay. I was proud that I pushed through and finished it without stuttering much!

Consultant: That’s an excellent accomplishment, Li! It sounds like you’re learning to face those nerves head-on, which is a vital skill. What strategies have you been using to manage your anxiety before and during your speeches?

User: I’ve been doing some breathing exercises before I speak, and I try to visualize myself succeeding. It really helps to calm my nerves. 

Consultant: Those are effective strategies! Breathing exercises and visualization can be quite powerful in managing anxiety. Have you noticed a difference in how your peers react to your speech since you’ve started improving?

User: Yes, definitely. They seem more supportive now. My friends often compliment me, which feels great. It makes me want to keep improving.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Positive reinforcement from your peers can boost your confidence even more. Can you think of a future situation where you might face some challenges, either in speech or social interactions?

User: I have a big presentation coming up, and I’m somewhat scared it might not go well. It’s more formal than my regular speeches.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel apprehensive about a formal presentation, especially with the added pressure. Let’s explore this a bit more. What specifically worries you about this upcoming presentation?

User: I worry about stuttering or forgetting what I want to say in front of everyone. What if I let my team down?

Consultant: It’s normal to have those worries, especially when you care about the outcome and your team. Can we reframe this concern? Instead of fearing what might go wrong, let’s think about what you can control in this situation.

User: I can control my preparation and how I practice. I can also remind myself to stay calm.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on preparation and strategies like staying calm can help manage those fears. What specific steps can you take in the next few days to prepare for your presentation?

User: I can practice my speech with my friends for feedback. I think that will help, and maybe I could do a run-through for my family too.

Consultant: Those sound like great ideas! Practicing in front of supportive people can help ease your nerves. How do you plan to keep track of your progress leading up to the presentation?

User: I could set small goals for myself, like practicing a certain number of times before the day. That way, I’ll feel more ready.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan, Li! Setting small, achievable goals can help you build your confidence gradually. As you prepare, what will you remind yourself of to stay positive?

User: I want to remind myself that I've improved a lot and that my friends and family believe in me. 

Consultant: That’s a very empowering thought! Remember, it’s about progress and growth. How do you feel about the support you have from your friends and family as you approach this presentation?

User: I feel lucky to have their support. It makes me feel less alone in this.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to acknowledge! Having a support system is crucial. Let’s think about how you can utilize this support during the presentation. Perhaps you can involve them somehow.

User: I could tell them about my speech beforehand so they know what to expect and can cheer for me afterward. 

Consultant: Absolutely, involving them like that can create a positive environment for you. It sounds like you’re ready to tackle this challenge, Li. Let’s summarize your strategies before we wrap up. 

User: So, I’ll practice my speech with friends and family, set small goals, and remind myself of my progress and the support around me.

Consultant: Perfect! You have a solid plan. I’m confident you’ll do great in your presentation. Keep these strategies in mind for the future as well. It’s been wonderful speaking with you today. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and guidance. I'm feeling more prepared now.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li! It's been a pleasure to catch up and see how far you've come. Remember, I’m just a message away if you need further support. Good luck with your presentation, and I look forward to hearing how it goes!

User: Thanks! I will let you know. Goodbye!
