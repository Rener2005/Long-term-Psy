Consultant: Hello Wang! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling since our last talk?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious about my adjustment to university life. I often feel overwhelmed and can't sleep well. The atmosphere in the dorm is quite heavy, and I hardly interact with my classmates. It makes me doubt my abilities.

Consultant: I understand that starting university has been quite challenging for you. It's completely normal to feel anxious in such a big transition. Can you tell me more about what specifically has been overwhelming for you?

User: I guess it's just everything at once—new environment, new people. I feel like I don’t fit in at all, and it's hard to find common ground with anyone. I worry that I won't do well academically either.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure from both social expectations and your studies. When you doubt your ability to fit in or succeed, what kind of thoughts go through your mind?

User: I often think that maybe I’m just not smart enough or that everyone else is more capable than me. It's like I keep comparing myself to other students and always come out on the losing side.

Consultant: It seems like those comparisons add to your anxiety and make you feel even less confident. Have you noticed how those thoughts make you feel emotionally or physically?

User: Yes, they make me feel really anxious and sometimes even a bit hopeless. I get headaches and feel so tense; it’s hard to focus on anything.

Consultant: It sounds very tough dealing with those physical symptoms along with your emotional distress. Let’s try to unpack those thoughts a bit more. When you think you’re not smart enough, how would you respond to a friend who said the same thing?

User: I would probably tell them that's not true and remind them of their strengths. It's easier to support someone else, but I can’t seem to do that for myself.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Wang! You can recognize that others have strengths, but it's harder to see those qualities in yourself. What if we tried to identify some of your strengths that can help you in university? What are some positive things about yourself or your past experiences that you can lean on?

User: Well, I did quite well in high school, and I’ve always been organized. I think I'm a good listener too. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful strengths! Being organized and a good listener are valuable qualities, especially in a learning environment. How might you remind yourself of these strengths when you start feeling anxious about your abilities?

User: Maybe I can write them down and keep them somewhere visible. That way, I can see them when I feel low. 

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Keeping reminders of your strengths can help you challenge those negative thoughts. In the meantime, have you thought about small ways to interact with your classmates to ease that social pressure? 

User: I guess I could start with just saying hi to someone or participating in group activities, but it feels scary.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel scared! Taking small steps can be really helpful. What if you set a goal to make one small interaction each day? It could be as simple as a smile or asking a question.

User: That sounds manageable. I think I could try that. But what if they don't respond well?

Consultant: It’s understandable to have that concern, but try to remember that not everyone's response is a reflection of you. You could also view each interaction as a learning opportunity, regardless of the outcome. How does that perspective feel to you?

User: That makes sense. I’ll try to see it that way. I guess it's easier if I don’t put too much pressure on myself.

Consultant: Absolutely! It's about progress, not perfection. As we continue, we can work on strategies to help reduce that pressure. For now, what do you think is a good step to take after today's session?

User: I think writing down my strengths and setting that small interaction goal are good first steps. Also, keeping a journal about my feelings might help.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent strategies, Wang! Journaling can help you process your feelings and observe your progress over time. I’m really proud of you for taking these steps. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. It helps to talk and feel understood.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. It's important to have a safe space to share your thoughts. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect a bit on your journey. How do you feel about the progress you've made?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful, like I can at least try to make some changes. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful feeling to have! Remember, change takes time, and it’s okay to take small steps. For our next session, we can discuss how those interactions went and any feelings that arise. 

User: I look forward to it. Thank you for your help today!

Consultant: You're welcome, Wang! I'm glad we could talk. Remember, you're not alone in this. Until next time, take care and good luck!

Consultant: Hello Wang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling really uncertain about my abilities. My performance in class has been a bit disappointing compared to what I used to achieve, and it makes me doubt myself even more.

Consultant: I understand that experiencing a drop in performance can trigger self-doubt, especially when you are trying to adjust to a new environment. Can you tell me more about what thoughts go through your mind when you compare your current situation to your past achievements?

User: I keep thinking that I used to be smart and capable, but now I feel like I'm just average. It's like everyone else is succeeding while I struggle, and it’s really frustrating.

Consultant: It sounds really tough to feel that way, and it's completely understandable to want to be where you were before. When you think about being "just average," what specific feelings does that bring up for you?

User: It makes me feel anxious and inadequate, like I'm not good enough and I won't be able to keep up in university. 

Consultant: Feeling anxious and inadequate can be really overwhelming. You mentioned you feel like you won't keep up. How often do you feel this way, and do you think there's any evidence to support this belief?

User: Honestly, I feel that way most of the time now. I haven’t done as well in my recent assignments, which reinforces my fear of not being good enough for university. 

Consultant: It's understandable that recent challenges can make you feel like you won't succeed. However, have you considered if there might be times when you've done well, even if it's not reflected in your current assignments?

User: Well, I have had some good results in the past, especially during high school. But now, it feels like those achievements don’t matter anymore since I can’t perform as well now.

Consultant: Those past achievements are still part of your ability. They show that you can succeed and that this phase might just be a hurdle. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them?

User: I guess I would tell them not to be so hard on themselves and that it's normal to have ups and downs. 

Consultant: That’s a compassionate view. I wonder why it's harder to extend that kindness to yourself? 

User: I think I hold myself to very high standards. I just don't want to disappoint my family or myself. 

Consultant: Holding yourself to high standards can be motivating, but it can also be very stressful. It might help to think about what a more balanced view of your performance would look like. How could you redefine success for yourself, knowing that it's okay to have setbacks?

User: Maybe I could focus on doing my best rather than always aiming for perfection. That sounds a bit more manageable. 

Consultant: That sounds like a healthier approach! What specific steps can you take to remind yourself of that when you face challenges in your studies?

User: I think I could set smaller, achievable goals for myself instead of being overwhelmed by the entire semester or course content.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Setting smaller goals can help reduce anxiety and allow for moments of success. Can we brainstorm some specific, smaller goals you might set for this week?

User: Sure! I could devote an hour each day to review class notes instead of trying to study everything at once. 

Consultant: That sounds very achievable! By breaking it down, you're creating a path that's much easier to follow. How do you feel about approaching your studies this way?

User: I feel a bit relieved. It seems less stressful when I think about it this way.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember to celebrate those small wins. As you start to implement these changes, how do you think your mindset might shift about your abilities?

User: I think if I can focus on progress rather than perfection, I might start to feel more confident again.

Consultant: That's an important realization! Confidence often grows from recognizing our improvements. What can you do to keep track of your progress, so you can celebrate it?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal where I write down my daily achievements, no matter how small they seem.

Consultant: A journal is a wonderful tool for reflection and recognition! It not only helps in tracking your progress but also in reinforcing positive self-talk. How do you feel about sharing this process with a friend or family member?

User: I think that would help me stay accountable and maybe get some support too. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Sharing your goals with someone can make them feel more achievable. Before we conclude today, are there any other areas about your social life or interactions that you'd like us to touch upon?

User: Yes, I feel really lonely. I want to make friends, but I’m not confident in my social skills.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel lonely, especially in a new environment. If you're feeling hesitant about making connections, what small steps could you take to start building those friendships?

User: I guess I could join a club or study group where I might meet people with similar interests.

Consultant: Joining a club could be a great way to meet people! It offers a shared purpose and can ease the pressure of starting conversations. How do you feel about that as a potential next step?

User: I feel excited! It sounds like a fun way to meet new people. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! As you prepare to step into these new environments, just remember to be kind to yourself through this process. You're taking significant steps forward! 

User: Thank you for your support! I already feel a bit more hopeful and determined to tackle these challenges.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, Wang! It’s been great to see your positive attitude. Let’s continue to build on this in our next session. Remember, it’s perfectly okay to take your time and find your way.

User: Thank you, I really appreciate you guiding me through this! 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang. I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite lonely. I really want to make friends in college, but I often feel unsure about my social skills. It’s frustrating because I want to be part of a group, but I struggle to connect with my roommates and others.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're feeling a strong desire for friendship, but also a lot of self-doubt about your social abilities. How have these feelings been affecting you lately?

User: They make me feel isolated. Sometimes when I try to talk to my roommates, I freeze up and end up not saying anything at all. I worry that they think I'm weird or don't want to include me.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling like you’re stuck in those moments. Let’s explore that feeling more. When you freeze up, what thoughts go through your mind? 

User: I think they must not like me or that I’ll embarrass myself if I say something wrong. So, I just stay quiet.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. Those thoughts can be quite powerful. Can you think of any evidence that suggests your roommates dislike you, or is there a possibility that they might just be caught up in their own lives?

User: I guess I don’t really have evidence. It’s just a gut feeling. Sometimes they seem distracted or busy.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s common to misinterpret others' behaviors, especially when we’re feeling insecure. What do you think might happen if you were to challenge that thought and give yourself the chance to speak up?

User: I’m not sure. I think I would still feel scared, but maybe if I tried, it wouldn't be as bad as I imagine?

Consultant: That’s a great realization! Testing that thought could help you learn what truly happens. What if we came up with some small ways for you to practice speaking up or participating in conversations?

User: Maybe I could start with a simple question, like asking them about their day. That feels easier than jumping into a big conversation.

Consultant: Absolutely! Starting small is a perfect strategy. What do you think about setting a goal to ask your roommates a simple question this week? 

User: That sounds doable. I’ll try to ask one question when we’re all in the room together.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! How do you think you will feel after taking that step?

User: I think it might help me feel a bit more confident. Even if it doesn't go perfectly, at least I tried.

Consultant: Exactly! Every attempt you make is a step toward building your confidence. Let’s try to reflect on how things go after you’ve made that effort. How might you reward yourself for trying?

User: I could treat myself to some ice cream or something I enjoy afterward. That would feel nice.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely reward! It’s important to acknowledge your efforts. How have you been managing your feelings of loneliness in the meantime?

User: I’ve been trying to keep myself busy with studying and attending a few club meetings, but I still feel really alone.

Consultant: Keeping busy is good, yet it’s also essential to connect with others meaningfully. Why do you think attending club meetings hasn’t helped much with feeling less lonely?

User: I think I haven't really reached out to anyone there. I'm just too shy.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It can be intimidating to reach out. What might happen if you took a small step to introduce yourself to someone new in those clubs?

User: It would be scary, but it might help. I could try saying hi to someone who looks friendly.

Consultant: I love that idea! It can often start a conversation. How would you prepare yourself emotionally for that response, regardless of how it goes?

User: I guess I’d remind myself that it’s okay if it doesn’t go perfectly. Just saying hi is a step forward.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful way to approach it! Remember, each interaction is part of your growth, and it doesn’t define your worth. Since you’ve been working on your self-perception, how has your view of yourself changed recently?

User: I feel a little better about myself. I can see that I have qualities that I like, even if it's hard to show them to others.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Recognizing your strengths is a significant part of boosting confidence. Let’s continue to build on that in our next session. Remember, progress takes time, and you're doing great by facing these challenges.

User: Thanks. I appreciate that. I hope I can keep taking small steps. 

Consultant: Absolutely, and I'm here to support you through it. Before we finish today, what will you take away from our session to help you feel more prepared for this week?

User: I’ll focus on challenging my negative thoughts and remember to take small steps. I’ll try to ask a question and say hi to someone.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Just remember, it’s okay to feel nervous—it’s part of the process. 

User: Thanks for your support. I feel a bit more hopeful now. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Wang. You’re making valuable efforts toward improving your social skills. Keep it up, and I’m looking forward to our next conversation.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad we're meeting today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling a bit better after talking to my family, but I still struggle with feelings of loneliness after our conversations end. 

Consultant: It's great to hear that communicating with your family has brought some improvement. I understand that the feelings of loneliness can come back after those exchanges. Can you share more about what happens when you feel lonely again? 

User: Well, after I finish talking to them, I feel this emptiness. It’s like I’m missing a connection, and then my mind starts racing with negative thoughts about my social life. 

Consultant: That sounds really hard, feeling the emptiness right after having that connection. When those negative thoughts start to race in your mind, what do you usually tell yourself? 

User: I often think that I’m just not good at making friends and that I’ll always be alone. 

Consultant: I see. It sounds like those thoughts are quite powerful for you. Have you noticed how those thoughts make you feel emotionally? 

User: They make me feel really down and anxious about my ability to connect with others. 

Consultant: It makes sense that feeling inadequate in social situations can create anxiety and sadness. Let's explore this further. Can you think of a specific situation where you felt that you weren't able to connect, and what thoughts crossed your mind at that moment? 

User: Sure, there was a moment during a group project where I felt completely out of place. I thought everyone was more interesting than me, and I started to believe they didn’t want me around. 

Consultant: That sounds like a tough experience. When you had those thoughts, how did it affect your behavior in that group? 

User: I just stayed quiet and didn’t contribute, even though I had ideas. I thought I would just embarrass myself. 

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It seems like those thoughts led you to hold back from participating. If you were to challenge that thought—believing everyone is more interesting than you—what evidence do you have that this is true? 

User: I guess, looking back, I don’t really know them well enough to say that about them. It’s just a feeling I have. 

Consultant: That’s an important insight. Sometimes, our feelings can lead us to jump to conclusions without solid evidence. If a friend were in that situation, what would you tell them? 

User: I would probably tell them to just be themselves and that everyone has something to offer. 

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you recognize that everyone has value, including you. How might you change your perspective in future situations to support this belief? 

User: I could try to remind myself that I have unique qualities and that it’s okay not to be perfect. 

Consultant: That’s a great starting point. What would it look like if you began to act on that belief in social settings? 

User: Maybe I could share more of my thoughts and not worry so much about how others perceive me. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! What’s one small step you could take this week to start sharing more of your thoughts with others? 

User: I think I could speak up more in our next group project meeting, maybe share one idea. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic goal. It’s a small step, but it can lead to significant changes. How do you feel about setting this goal? 

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited. It’s good to have a focus. 

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous. Remember, taking that small step could help to shift your perspective over time. How would you like to prepare for that meeting? 

User: I think I’ll write down a few ideas beforehand so I feel more confident when I speak. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Preparing ahead can boost your confidence. Before we finish today, let’s talk about how you can handle the feelings of loneliness when they arise again after talking to your family. 

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s okay to have those feelings and maybe even reach out to friends afterward. 

Consultant: That’s an insightful approach. Reaching out to friends can help maintain connections and reduce feelings of loneliness. How do you feel about reconnecting with friends or classmates? 

User: I think it could really help, especially if I plan some activities with them. 

Consultant: Planning activities can definitely foster those connections. Before we end today, let’s summarize what you've learned and discussed. What do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our session? 

User: I’ve realized that my negative thoughts are just that—thoughts, and I can challenge them. I also learned that I can reach out and take proactive steps to engage with others. 

Consultant: That's an excellent realization, Wang. I'm really proud of the progress you’re making. Remember that this journey takes time, and it’s okay to have ups and downs. I'm confident you'll apply what you've learned. 

User: Thank you! I'm feeling more hopeful about approaching social situations now. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You've done some great work here today, and I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Remember, you can always reach out if you need support. 

User: Absolutely, thank you for your guidance! 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better. I tried to engage more with my classmates during a recent extracurricular activity, and it actually went well. But sometimes, I still feel anxious about initiating conversations.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're experiencing some positive changes! Engaging with your classmates is a significant step forward. How did it feel to receive that positive feedback?

User: It felt really encouraging! I was surprised to see that people responded well when I approached them. But I still worry about whether I'll be able to keep that momentum going.

Consultant: That makes sense. It's normal to have concerns about maintaining your progress. You’ve taken a brave step by initiating conversations. What do you think would help you sustain this positive interaction with others?

User: I guess I could try to set small social goals for myself, like speaking to one new person each week. It sounds easy, but I often feel hesitant.

Consultant: Setting achievable goals is a fantastic strategy! It allows you to gradually build your confidence. What kinds of activities or settings do you think could help you meet new people?

User: I could join a club or start attending more group events on campus. I just need to push myself a little more to take the first step.

Consultant: Joining a club sounds like a wonderful idea! It’s a great way to meet people with shared interests. How do you feel about exploring different clubs or groups that align with what you enjoy?

User: I think that would be fun! I especially want to find something related to arts or music since those are my interests. But then again, I worry about fitting in.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel that way. Remember, everyone else in those groups is likely looking to connect, just like you. Would it help to remind yourself that you have something valuable to contribute?

User: Yes, that does help. I often forget that my interests matter. Maybe I should focus more on what I can bring to the table rather than just fitting in.

Consultant: Exactly! Shifting your focus can make a big difference. Plus, when you remind yourself of your strengths, it might ease some of that anxiety. Can we brainstorm specific actions you can take to start reaching out to potential clubs or events?

User: Sure! I could start by looking online for club meetings next week and see if I can attend one. I could also ask my friends if they know about any events.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Taking those steps will expose you to new people and experiences. How do you feel about committing to this action?

User: I feel excited but a bit nervous as well. It’s a little scary to put myself out there.

Consultant: Those feelings are completely normal! It’s about taking that first step despite the nerves. Remember, you can remind yourself of the positive interactions you’ve had so far. How can you use that previous experience to support your next steps?

User: I guess I can remind myself that I successfully engaged with classmates before. If I do it again, I have a good chance of it going well. That thought lessens my anxiety a bit.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight, Wang! Emphasizing your successes can really help reinforce your confidence. Let’s think about how you can document these positive experiences after each social interaction. Would you find it helpful to keep a journal of your progress?

User: A journal sounds like a great idea! That way, I can reflect on what went well and what I can improve on.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflection is key in this process. Not only will it help you appreciate your achievements, but it will also allow you to analyze and adapt your approach as needed. How often do you think you could write in this journal?

User: I could try to write in it after each social event. That seems manageable for me.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic commitment! Keeping track of your experiences will provide you with insights and a sense of accomplishment. As we wrap up today's session, what would you say is your main takeaway from our discussion?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is the importance of setting small social goals and focusing on my strengths. I feel more motivated to reach out to others and keep expanding my social network.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It sounds like you are heading in a positive direction. Remember, challenges may come, but you have the tools to navigate them. Let’s confirm our next session to check in on your progress and discuss any new experiences.

User: Yes, I’d like that! Thank you for your support. I feel more confident about my social endeavors now.

Consultant: You’re doing great, Wang! And as always, I'm here to support you. I’m looking forward to our next session. Keep up the wonderful work!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wang! It's great to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really good overall. I think I've made some progress in managing my emotions and adapting to university life. But I'm also thinking about what comes next in my personal development.

Consultant: That sounds encouraging! It's important to acknowledge the progress you've made. Can you share a bit about the changes you've noticed in yourself?

User: Well, I feel more confident when handling everyday challenges, and my anxiety has decreased. I used to panic during exams, but now I have better control over my feelings. 

Consultant: That's a significant improvement! It shows that your efforts are paying off. Now, regarding your future personal development, what specific areas are you looking to focus on?

User: I want to build more confidence in social situations and improve my communication skills. Sometimes I still struggle to express myself clearly, especially in group settings.

Consultant: It's great that you want to work on your social confidence and communication skills. Recognizing these areas means you're on the right path. Have you noticed any situations where you've felt challenged in this regard?

User: Yes, during group projects, I often hold back my ideas because I worry they'll be judged or not good enough. I want to overcome that.

Consultant: That makes sense. Many people feel that way in group settings. Let’s explore this further—what thoughts go through your mind when you're in those situations?

User: I usually think that others are more knowledgeable and that my contributions won't matter much. It makes me anxious and I often end up staying quiet.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite powerful for you. Let's think about this for a moment—what evidence do you have that your contributions wouldn't matter?

User: I don’t have any solid proof; it's just a feeling I get. When I do speak, sometimes my classmates respond well, but I still tend to doubt myself.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have self-doubt, but it's interesting that you've received positive feedback at times. What if you challenged that initial feeling of insecurity by reminding yourself of those moments? 

User: I guess that could help. I hadn’t thought about it that way. Maybe I should focus more on the positive responses I’ve received.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on those positives can help shift your mindset. Additionally, what if you tried practicing speaking up in smaller, low-pressure situations? 

User: That's a good idea! I think I could start by sharing my thoughts in smaller study groups. 

Consultant: That’s a perfect plan! Gradual exposure can help build your confidence. What do you think might be a good first step you can take before the next group meeting?

User: I could prepare a few points to share in advance. That way, I won’t feel as anxious about coming up with something to say on the spot.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid approach! Preparing in advance can definitely ease your anxiety. Also, reflect on the successes you’ve had in the past when you’ve shared ideas. 

User: Yes, I will do that! I really want to keep improving and not let my fears hold me back.

Consultant: It's wonderful to see your commitment to growth, Wang. Let's take a moment to look back at how far you've come since we started our sessions. What achievements are you most proud of?

User: I think my main achievement is feeling more balanced emotionally. I've learned to manage my study schedule better and have developed some coping strategies for stress. 

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! You’ve definitely developed important skills throughout this journey. As we wrap up today, what strategies or insights do you feel you can carry forward into the future?

User: I plan to keep reminding myself of my progress and to prepare before contributing in group discussions. I also want to continue working on my self-acceptance.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Remember that personal growth is a journey, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. If you ever feel stuck, you can always reach out. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support and guidance throughout this process. It's been really helpful. 

Consultant: It’s been a pleasure supporting you, Wang. You’ve shown so much determination and resilience. If any challenges arise in the future or you need further guidance, don’t hesitate to come back. 

User: I will, thank you again! I feel ready to move forward with my plans and continue growing.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Best of luck on your journey ahead. Take care, and remember, you have the tools you need to succeed. Goodbye for now!
