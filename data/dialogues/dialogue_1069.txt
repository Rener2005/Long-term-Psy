Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you could make it to our session today. I understand you've been feeling quite overwhelmed lately, especially with the pressures of school. Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been really anxious about my studies, especially since I'm in my final year. There’s so much pressure, and I just can’t seem to focus. I keep thinking about whether I should continue being a class leader or not, and it just makes things worse. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling torn between your responsibilities as a class leader and the pressure from your studies. How have these thoughts affected your daily life and your ability to study?

User: Honestly, I find it hard to concentrate on anything. I keep worrying about letting my classmates down if I quit, but at the same time, the stress is really affecting my sleep. I feel exhausted all the time.

Consultant: That's really tough, feeling exhausted and under pressure from both school and your role as a leader. Let’s delve deeper into the thoughts that accompany this stress. What kinds of thoughts come to your mind when you think about your studies or your role in class?

User: I often think I’ll fail if I don’t keep up the good grades. I also feel guilty when I think about stepping down from the class leadership position. 

Consultant: It seems that you might be experiencing some extreme thoughts, like believing that failure is imminent if you don’t maintain your grades. Can you share more about how these thoughts make you feel emotionally?

User: They make me feel increasingly anxious and worried, like I'm constantly under pressure. I feel frustrated with myself because I know I overthink things, but I don’t know how to stop.

Consultant: I hear you. It’s frustrating to recognize that you’re overthinking but feel unable to change that pattern. Let’s try to acknowledge these thoughts together. Can you recall a specific moment when these thoughts intensified recently? What was going through your mind at that time?

User: Well, when our teacher criticized me for not managing my time well, I felt really small. I thought maybe stepping down was the only way to handle everything, but then I felt bad for abandoning my classmates. 

Consultant: That sounds like a challenging situation. The criticism from your teacher seems to have triggered a lot of self-doubt and guilt. Can we explore those feelings together? What evidence do you see that supports or contradicts the thoughts of needing to be perfect or worried about letting others down?

User: I guess there isn’t really any concrete evidence that I'd fail or that my classmates would be disappointed. They seem supportive, but I still feel like I have to prove myself.

Consultant: It’s insightful that you recognize your classmates’ willingness to support you. What if you considered that they might want you to prioritize your well-being over perfection? How does that thought feel compared to your usual concerns?

User: That does sound comforting, but it still feels hard to let go of the responsibility. I don’t want them to think less of me.

Consultant: Understandably. It’s common to feel that way when we hold ourselves to high standards. Let’s work on some alternative thoughts you can remind yourself of. For instance, could you think of a scenario where stepping back helped you grow rather than diminish your worth?

User: I suppose I could think of times when I’ve helped others while also maintaining my own well-being. It felt good when I could balance everything rather than overstretch myself.

Consultant: That’s a great realization. Balancing responsibilities is important. Going forward, how could you set boundaries that allow you to focus more on your studies while still being there for your classmates?

User: I could communicate with them honestly about how I’m feeling. Maybe I could delegate some tasks or just be more open about needing help with some things.

Consultant: I love that plan! Communicating openly and seeking support can lighten your load. For our next session, how about trying to implement this. Observe how your feelings shift when you share with your classmates. Does that sound manageable for you?

User: Yes, I can certainly try that. It makes me feel a bit relieved just thinking about it.

Consultant: Fantastic! Remember to be kind to yourself through this process. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed. What do you believe is the most significant takeaway for you?

User: I think recognizing that I have a support system and that I don’t have to do everything alone will help a lot. 

Consultant: That's a powerful insight! Moving forward, keep focusing on those supportive thoughts and taking small actions towards openness with your classmates. I believe in your ability to manage this, and I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session.

User: Thank you so much! I feel like I have a plan now, and I appreciate your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember, it’s all about taking those small steps. I’ll see you next time, and we’ll check in on your progress.

User: See you!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. I want to talk about what's been on your mind recently, especially regarding your studies and any stress you've been feeling. How have you been?

User: Hi. I've just been feeling overwhelmed lately. I find it hard to focus on my studies, and I keep worrying about my future. It’s frustrating because I know I need to change my mindset, but I don’t really know how.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure and uncertainty. Can you tell me more about what specifically distracts you when you try to study? 

User: I get distracted by small things. Like, I start thinking about other homework, or my friends, or even random thoughts about what I'm going to do after school. It's like my mind won't settle down.

Consultant: I understand. It must be quite exhausting to have your thoughts racing like that. What do you think it would feel like if you could focus better and not get swept away by those distractions?

User: It would feel so much better! I could actually get through my study material. I just want to feel more in control of my time and my thoughts.

Consultant: That’s a great realization. Can you think of a time when you managed to concentrate well? What was different about that situation?

User: I remember times when I was in a quiet space, and I really focused on one thing at a time. But lately, it feels like I can't replicate that.

Consultant: So, it seems that your environment plays a big role in your focus. What do you think you can change in your study environment or routine to help recreate that focus?

User: Maybe I could try studying in a quieter place or set specific times for each subject instead of doing everything at once. But I’m worried that it won't change anything.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel skeptical about trying new approaches. But remember, experimenting with your study habits might lead to positive changes. Would you be open to trying a structured study plan this week?

User: I guess I could try that. I just hope it will make a difference. 

Consultant: That's the spirit! Let’s break it down into steps. What if you set aside certain times for each subject and also include breaks to help refresh your mind? 

User: That sounds manageable. I can try to stick to a schedule. 

Consultant: Excellent! Now, while you're setting this schedule, let’s also think about any negative thoughts that might come up while you're studying. When you find your mind wandering, what kind of thoughts do you notice?

User: Sometimes I think, "I'm not going to do well on the exam," or "I should have studied more." It just feels like I’m not good enough.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem very heavy and discouraging. Can we look at them together to see if there's a different way to think about your situation? 

User: Sure, I guess I should try to see things differently.

Consultant: Let's start by questioning those thoughts. What evidence do you have that supports those feelings of inadequacy? 

User: Well, I did struggle with some subjects, but I’ve worked hard too. I guess I have also done well in the past.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a mix of experiences. What might you say to a friend who feels the same way you do? 

User: I’d probably tell them to focus on their hard work rather than just the results. 

Consultant: Exactly! You can be your own cheerleader too. When those negative thoughts emerge, remind yourself of the effort you put in, regardless of the outcome. Would that be something you could practice?

User: Yeah, I can try to remind myself of my efforts. 

Consultant: Perfect! It’s really about changing that inner dialogue. Now, while practicing this new way of thinking, can you think of some small successes you can celebrate this week? 

User: I could celebrate sticking to my study plan or completing a chapter in a book. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Celebrating those small victories can really reinforce positive thinking. What do you think would be a good way to reward yourself?

User: Maybe treat myself to a movie or some snacks after studying. 

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It gives you something to look forward to. As we continue, remember to reach out if those negative thoughts become overwhelming. I’m here to help you through this process.

User: Thank you! I appreciate that.

Consultant: Of course! Reflecting on today's conversation, what are the key takeaways you want to hold onto? 

User: I want to remember to focus on my efforts, try the structured study plan, and reward myself. 

Consultant: Those sound like solid strategies. You're definitely on the right path. As your thoughts around studying and exams progress, don’t hesitate to share any concerns. 

User: I will. I'm still worried about how things will go, but I feel a bit more prepared after talking about this.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel anxious about exams. You've made important steps toward managing your focus and mindset. Just remember, practice makes progress.

User: Thanks. I do feel slightly more hopeful after our chat. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! As we wrap things up for today, keep applying what we discussed. I believe you can enhance your performance and adjust your thinking. 

User: I will. Thanks for your support!

Consultant: You're most welcome! Remember, I’m here whenever you need to talk. Take care, and good luck with your studies!

User: Thank you! I’ll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you could make it to today's session. How have you been feeling lately with regard to your studies and the upcoming exams?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really anxious. With exams approaching, I can't seem to focus on my studies. I just sit at my desk but don’t make much progress. It’s really frustrating.

Consultant: I can see how that would be quite difficult for you. It sounds like you'd like to feel more in control and productive when studying. What specific thoughts are running through your mind when you try to sit down and study?

User: I keep thinking about how I need to get good grades, but then I feel overwhelmed. I'm worried I won't meet my own expectations, which makes me anxious and can't concentrate.

Consultant: That pressure to achieve can create a heavy burden. It’s important to recognize those thoughts. Let’s dig a little deeper: when you think "I won't meet my expectations," how does that make you feel?

User: It makes me feel really stressed. I almost panic when I think about failing. 

Consultant: Stress can be quite overwhelming. It seems like you’re experiencing some strong feelings about the possibility of failure. Could you share how you typically react when these thoughts and feelings arise?

User: Usually, I just try to ignore them, which doesn’t help. I end up procrastinating instead of studying, and that just makes everything worse.

Consultant: Procrastination is a common response to anxiety. Ignoring the feelings might seem like a solution, but it often leads to more stress. Let's try to identify a specific moment when you felt that anxiety most strongly. What happened during that time?

User: Just last week, I was trying to study for a test. I opened my books, but the moment I saw the material, I felt sick to my stomach and closed everything again.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable to feel that way when faced with a daunting task. Let's explore what was going through your mind at that moment. What thoughts ran through your head when you felt that sickness?

User: I thought about how much I didn’t understand the material and how I might fail. It just spiraled into a cycle of negativity.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts quickly became overwhelming. It’s common for our minds to create a cycle of negativity. I'd like to challenge those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that suggests you will fail if you don’t understand everything right away?

User: I suppose there’s not much proof. I’ve done well in the past…

Consultant: Exactly! You have a history of success. It might help to remind yourself of that. If a friend was in your position, what would you tell them about facing challenges and not understanding everything immediately?

User: I’d probably tell them it’s okay to take things one step at a time and that they should ask for help when needed.

Consultant: That’s a wise approach! Remembering to take things step by step can reduce that overwhelming feeling. How about we brainstorm some small steps you can take when studying to ease your anxiety? 

User: That sounds good. I think if I break things down into smaller tasks, it might help.

Consultant: Great! Let’s start with the upcoming material. What if you set a specific, achievable goal for each study session instead of trying to tackle it all at once?

User: I could focus on just one chapter at a time. That feels less overwhelming.

Consultant: Absolutely! That's a solid plan. Alongside this, we can also work on relaxation techniques to help you manage anxiety before and during study sessions. Would you be interested in learning some?

User: Yes, I'd really like that. I could use some coping techniques.

Consultant: Wonderful! One technique is deep breathing, which can help calm your mind. Would you like to try it together right now? 

User: Sure, I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Okay, let’s take a deep breath in through your nose, hold for a moment, and then slowly exhale through your mouth. Let’s do this a few times together. Inhale… hold... and exhale slowly. How does that feel? 

User: It feels calming. I can focus more now, but I still feel hesitant about exams.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel hesitancy. Remember that these feelings don’t define your ability. We can create a routine for you that incorporates both study and relaxation. How does that sound?

User: That sounds like it could really help me. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we move forward, let's incorporate some simulated exams into your preparation. This way, you can gradually expose yourself to the test environment and practice coping strategies.

User: That makes sense. I guess I need to get used to the pressure.

Consultant: Exactly! Gradually facing that pressure helps build your confidence. What do you think about planning one simulated exam this week?

User: I think I can manage that. It sounds like a helpful idea.

Consultant: Fantastic! As we prepare for this, remember to celebrate every small achievement, whether it's finishing a chapter or completing a practice exam. It’s all part of your progress. 

User: I like that idea. Focusing on the little wins can help.

Consultant: Yes! Let's also discuss how you can maintain this positive mindset. What strategies can you employ to remember your past successes and reinforce your confidence while studying?

User: I could keep a journal to track my progress and achievements. That way, I can remind myself of what I've accomplished.

Consultant: That's a brilliant idea! It’ll serve as a great reminder of your capabilities. As we near the end of our session today, let’s review what steps you've decided to take moving forward.

User: I will work on my study goals by chapters, practice deep breathing, and plan a simulated exam while keeping a progress journal.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I'm really proud of the progress you've made today. You’ve learned some effective strategies to manage your anxiety. Remember, you're not alone in this.

User: Thank you. I feel a bit more confident now! 

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! As we wrap up, make sure to practice these strategies, and remember to reach out whenever you feel overwhelmed. You've got this!

User: I will, thank you for your support! 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'll see you at our next session, and we'll build on the progress you've made. Take care!

User: You too!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been doing a bit better with my study techniques, but I still feel this heavy pressure when I think about exams. It’s like I'm stuck in this loop of anxiety.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear there's been some improvement, even though you're still feeling pressured. Let’s talk more about that anxiety. What are the specific thoughts that come to mind when you're preparing for your exams?

User: I keep thinking that if I don’t do well, it’ll confirm my fears that I’m not good enough. It’s like this overwhelming fear of failure. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough. The fear of not being good enough can be quite intimidating. How does this thought affect your feelings and behaviors when you sit down to study?

User: When I think like that, I feel really anxious and I can’t focus. I start to avoid my desk altogether, which makes me feel worse because I know I need to study.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. Avoiding situations that make us anxious often seems like a natural reaction, but it can make the anxiety worse in the long run. Have you noticed any specific moments when you feel this heaviness the most?

User: Yes, it usually hits me a few days before an exam. I just freeze up and think about everything that could go wrong.

Consultant: That freezing up before exams makes sense given the pressure you’re feeling. If we were to break this down, can you share what thoughts come to mind just before you study or take an exam?

User: I start thinking things like, “What if I fail this test?” or “Everyone will judge me if I don’t perform well.” 

Consultant: Those thoughts seem very intense. Let’s explore them further. What evidence do you have that you would actually fail, or that others would judge you severely?

User: I don’t have concrete evidence, but it just feels real in the moment. It’s like my past experiences amplify that fear.

Consultant: It’s common for past experiences to shape our feelings in the present. If a friend expressed those same thoughts, how might you help them see the situation differently?

User: I’d probably tell them not to worry too much and that one exam doesn’t define their worth. 

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective. Now, let’s try to apply that same kindness to yourself. What would it look like to treat yourself with that same understanding and reassurance?

User: I guess I could remind myself that I’ve prepared and that one exam won’t change who I am. 

Consultant: Exactly! What if you created a positive affirmation for yourself to use before studying or taking an exam? 

User: That sounds like a good idea. Maybe something like, “I am capable and I can handle this.” 

Consultant: That’s a great affirmation! Let’s think about how we can help you use this affirmation regularly. How might you integrate it into your study routine?

User: I could say it to myself before I start studying and also before I enter the exam room. That would help calm my nerves, I think.

Consultant: That's an excellent strategy! Let’s also identify some activities outside of studying that help you unwind and reduce anxiety. What do you enjoy doing in your free time?

User: I like listening to music and going for walks. These activities help me relax.

Consultant: Those sounds like wonderful ways to relieve stress. How about scheduling some time each day to do these activities, especially during exam periods?

User: Yes, I could set aside some time in the evening after studying to go for a walk or listen to music.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy balance. Let’s also review some techniques to handle unexpected moments of anxiety that might arise during your studies or exams. How do you currently cope when anxiety strikes?

User: Usually, I just try to push through it, but it doesn’t always work well.

Consultant: Pushing through can be exhausting. Would you be open to trying some mindfulness techniques when you feel that anxiety creeping in?

User: I’d be willing to give it a try. What kind of techniques are you thinking of?

Consultant: Simple deep breathing exercises can be very effective. When you feel anxious, take a moment to focus on your breath—inhale deeply through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth. Would you like to try practicing that together?

User: Sure, let’s try it.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in… hold it… and slowly let it out. How did that feel?

User: That actually felt calming. I think I could use this technique often.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Using these breathing exercises alongside your affirmation and enjoyable activities can really strengthen your mental resilience. How do you feel about your progress so far?

User: I feel more hopeful about handling my exam anxiety. I have some strategies now, and it feels good.

Consultant: That’s wonderful progress! Let’s summarize what we've achieved today. You now have affirmations, coping strategies, and ways to manage your time and activities. How will you continue to reinforce these strategies moving forward?

User: I’ll keep practicing my affirmation, set aside time for my hobbies, and use the breathing techniques before I study.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, it’s okay to have ups and downs, but you have the tools to manage your feelings. What do you feel is your biggest takeaway from today’s session?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is that I can be kinder to myself and that I have the ability to manage my anxiety. 

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve made significant strides, and I believe you can maintain this progress. As we wrap up today, how confident do you feel about approaching your studies and exams now?

User: I feel much more confident. Thank you for your help today!

Consultant: It's my pleasure! Remember, you can always revisit these strategies. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hi there! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been okay, I guess. I feel like I've been managing my emotions a bit better in certain situations, but there are still moments when I overthink things.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've been able to manage your emotions more effectively at times. Could you share an example of a situation where you felt you handled it well, and what strategies helped you?

User: Sure! Last week, I was really anxious about a group project at school. Instead of spiraling into overthinking, I used the breathing techniques we talked about and took a short break. It helped me refocus.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic approach! Using breathing techniques to take a step back and then refocus is an excellent tool. How did you feel afterward when you returned to the project?

User: I felt much calmer and more in control. I think it made a big difference in how I contributed to the project.

Consultant: I'm really pleased to hear that! It sounds like you're recognizing how some of the strategies can help you in real-life situations. Are there any challenges you still face when it comes to managing your emotions?

User: Yes, I still struggle sometimes, especially when I think about the future and what might go wrong. It leads to a lot of anxiety and self-doubt.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way, especially with so many uncertainties about the future. Let’s explore the thoughts that arise during those moments of anxiety. What kinds of thoughts typically come to your mind?

User: I often think things like "What if I fail?" or "What if I disappoint everyone?" It can be overwhelming.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite distressing, and it makes sense that they would lead to anxiety. Can we take a moment to challenge those thoughts? What evidence do you have that supports those beliefs, and what evidence suggests they might not be true?

User: Well, I guess I've done well in school so far, so failing seems like a worst-case scenario. My teachers and friends have always been supportive, even when I struggled at times.

Consultant: That’s a valuable realization! It seems there’s a pattern of support around you, and you have a track record of success. Given that, can you think of a more balanced thought to replace the “What if I fail?” belief?

User: Maybe I could think, “I’ve succeeded before, and I can ask for help if I need it.” That feels a bit more realistic.

Consultant: That’s exactly the kind of balanced thinking we want to cultivate! It’s about recognizing that while challenges may arise, you also have resources and strengths to draw from. How does that new perspective make you feel?

User: A bit relieved, actually. It’s nice to think that I don’t have to face everything alone.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Building that sense of support and self-reliance is important. Moving forward, how might you remind yourself of this perspective when anxiety starts to creep in again?

User: I could write it down somewhere, maybe on a sticky note or in my planner. Seeing it might help me remember during tough times.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Visual reminders can be very effective. Also, keeping a journal to reflect on your thoughts and feelings could help you track your progress. How would you feel about starting that?

User: I think that could be helpful. Writing things down helps me process them better.

Consultant: Exactly! It allows you to externalize your thoughts and look at them more objectively.  How about we set a small goal for you this week focusing on these techniques and reflections? 

User: That sounds good. I could try writing in my journal every day, even if it's just a few sentences.

Consultant: Perfect! Writing daily can help you notice patterns in your thoughts and emotions. Let’s also think about at least one positive thing that happens each day that you can record. What do you think?

User: I like that! It’ll be nice to focus on the positives instead of just the negatives.

Consultant: Absolutely, cultivating awareness of positive experiences can really help shift your mindset over time. Before we wrap up, do you feel ready to take on this challenge for the week?

User: Yes, I do! I’m feeling more confident about it now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember to be gentle with yourself, and it’s okay to reach out if you ever feel overwhelmed. In our next session, we can discuss how it went and any adjustments we might want to make. 

User: Sounds good! Thanks for your help today. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. I appreciate you coming back for another session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident lately. The last time we spoke, I started to really work on my study strategies, and I feel like I'm handling my responsibilities better.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made some progress. Can you share more about what strategies have been the most helpful for you?

User: Sure! I’ve been using a planner to manage my time better, breaking my study sessions into smaller chunks, which makes it less overwhelming. It feels good to check things off as I complete them.

Consultant: That's a great approach! Breaking tasks into smaller, manageable parts can really help reduce anxiety. How has this change impacted your feelings about studying and exams?

User: I feel less stressed about studying now. I used to dread it entirely, but now, I find it a bit more enjoyable and have noticed I'm able to focus better. 

Consultant: That's a significant shift in your mindset! I'm glad you’re finding enjoyment in your studies again. However, are there any lingering concerns or challenges you still face?

User: Well, even though I’m feeling better, I still have moments where I get overwhelmed, especially when I think about upcoming exams. There’s this lingering pressure to maintain my grades.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel some pressure, especially with exams approaching. When those feelings of overwhelm arise, what thoughts usually come to your mind?

User: I tend to think that if I don't perform well, I’ll let myself down and disappoint my parents. It's like this constant fear of failure.

Consultant: That fear of failure can be quite burdensome. Let's explore that thought a bit further. What do you think are some realistic outcomes if you don’t achieve the grades you hope for?

User: I guess it wouldn't be the end of the world. I would be disappointed, but I could always retake the exams or try again. My parents might be upset, but they would still understand.

Consultant: It’s insightful that you can recognize those alternatives. Do you feel that reminding yourself of this could help lessen your anxiety when the pressure builds?

User: Yes, I think it could… I just need to remember not to be so hard on myself.

Consultant: Absolutely! Being kinder to yourself is an important part of managing anxiety. How can we practice that self-kindness when you start feeling overwhelmed?

User: I could try talking to myself positively, maybe keep reminding myself that it’s okay to not be perfect. I could also take breaks when I feel too stressed.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Incorporating breaks and positive self-talk can greatly assist in managing feelings of stress. What can you do to ensure you take those breaks during your study sessions?

User: Maybe I could set a timer? Like after 30 minutes of studying, I take a 5-minute break. That way, it’ll remind me to step away even if I feel guilty about it.

Consultant: Setting a timer is a fantastic idea! This way, you can build those breaks into your routine and alleviate that guilt. As we reflect on your journey, what do you believe has contributed the most to your improvements?

User: I think it’s the combination of planning and just being more open about my feelings. I’ve learned to express what I'm going through rather than keeping it all to myself.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that communication has helped you. Sharing your feelings can truly lighten your emotional load. Before we wrap up, are there any final thoughts or concerns you’d like to address?

User: I just want to make sure I continue to manage my stress, especially with exams coming. I don't want to fall back into old habits.

Consultant: That's a valid concern. How about we set some ongoing strategies for you to maintain your progress as we conclude our sessions? This way, you'll have tools to manage stress and keep building on what you've learned.

User: That sounds good! I’d like to write down some affirmations and keep using my planner. I also think checking in with a friend might help too.

Consultant: Those are excellent steps! Writing affirmations and staying connected with a supportive friend will reinforce your progress. As we conclude today’s session, I want to highlight how far you’ve come. You can manage your emotions and tackle stress effectively!

User: Thank you! I feel really encouraged. I appreciate all your help throughout this process.

Consultant: You’ve done all the hard work, and I’m glad to hear you feel encouraged. Remember, you can always reach out if you need support in the future. Best of luck with your exams; I believe in you!

User: Thank you, I’ll definitely keep that in mind. Goodbye!

Consultant: Goodbye! Take care of yourself, and remember to be kind to yourself as you continue this journey.
