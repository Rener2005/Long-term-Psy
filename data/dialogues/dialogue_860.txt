Consultant: Hello Xiaotong! I'm glad to see you today. How are you feeling right now with everything going on at home and school?

User: Hi. Honestly, I feel really sad and anxious. It's hard to focus on my studies, and I feel like my parents are always disappointed in me because of my grades.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a heavy weight from both your studies and your parents' expectations. Can you tell me more about how their expectations make you feel?

User: I just feel like I'm never good enough for them. They always talk about how much I need to improve, and it feels like I'm letting them down. Sometimes I wish I could just be someone else.

Consultant: I can understand why that would be so tough for you. It must be really upsetting to feel like you're letting them down. Have there been any specific moments recently that made you feel this way?

User: Well, there was this time when my mom yelled at me about my grades again. Then I overheard her talking to my dad about how worried she is about my future. It made me feel even worse.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly difficult, and it's understandable that you'd feel anxious after hearing that. It seems like there's a lot of pressure on you. How did that conversation affect your feelings about yourself?

User: It made me feel like I'm a failure. I even thought about running away for a bit just to escape. I don’t want to disappoint them, but it feels like I can’t meet their expectations.

Consultant: I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It’s important to recognize those feelings of disappointment and the desire to escape. Can you tell me what you think caused this pressure—both from your parents and within yourself?

User: I guess I just want to be better, but I don't know how. My friends often tease me at school too, and that doesn’t help. I just feel low about everything.

Consultant: It sounds like you're facing difficult challenges from multiple directions—school, friends, and home. When your friends tease you, how does that impact your self-esteem?

User: It really hurts. I feel like they don’t see me for who I am. They just call me names, and it makes me feel even more lonely.

Consultant: Feeling misunderstood and lonely is really hard, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. Have you had a chance to talk to anyone about how their comments make you feel?

User: No, I haven’t. I'm too shy to share these feelings. I usually just keep it to myself.

Consultant: I completely understand. It can be really tough to open up, especially when you're already feeling vulnerable. How would it feel for you to express your feelings to someone you trust?

User: I think it might help a little, but I'm scared they wouldn't understand or would just make fun of me too.

Consultant: Those fears are completely valid, and it's normal to worry about how others might react. Let’s explore that a bit—what would be a safe way for you to share your feelings, even just a little?

User: Maybe I could write a note to a friend instead of talking? That feels less scary.

Consultant: Writing a note sounds like a great start! It can provide you with a way to express yourself without feeling overly exposed. After you share, how do you think that might change how you feel?

User: I think it might make me feel lighter, like I’m not holding everything in. But I’m still nervous about it.

Consultant: It's perfectly natural to feel nervous. Would you like to think about some positive affirmations you could remind yourself of, to help you along the way? 

User: Positive affirmations? I’m not sure what those are.

Consultant: Positive affirmations are short, encouraging statements you can tell yourself. They can help shift negative thoughts into more positive ones. For example, saying "I am enough, just as I am" can help combat feelings of not being good enough. How does that sound to you?

User: That could be nice. I like the idea of reminding myself it's okay to be myself.

Consultant: Absolutely! Embracing who you are is very important. I’d like you to think of a few affirmations that resonate with you. We can also explore how to communicate with your parents about your feelings. What do you think?

User: Talking to my parents sounds hard, but I think I need to try. I hope they’ll listen.

Consultant: It’s a brave step to consider talking to them. Would it help if we practiced together on how to approach that conversation?

User: Yes, that would help. I’m not sure how to say it without upsetting them.

Consultant: Let’s think about expressing your feelings calmly. You might start with how much you appreciate their support and then share your feelings about the pressure you feel regarding your grades. How do you feel about that approach?

User: I think that’s good. I can let them know that I'm trying my best, even if my grades aren't where they want them to be.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful way to express your feelings! It’s crucial that they understand you are doing your best. Remember, feelings of pressure and anxiousness do not define your worth. How can we continue to build on this approach in our next session?

User: I’d like to work on how to handle my feelings and maybe come up with some affirmations. It feels good to talk about this.

Consultant: I'm pleased to hear that, Xiaotong! We'll explore more affirmations and continue working on your discussions with your parents. Remember, you're taking significant steps to understand yourself better. It's okay to have ups and downs in this process. 

User: Thank you! I feel a little better just talking about it.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm glad to hear that. Remember, it's okay to feel how you do, and we will keep working through this together. Before we finish today, what’s one thing you want to take with you from our session?

User: I want to remember that I am not my grades, and I can talk to someone about how I feel.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic takeaway, Xiaotong! You are so much more than your grades, and you can reach out for support whenever you need it. I’m looking forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaotong! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling quite anxious because my parents have been arguing a lot lately. I can’t help but think that it's my fault.

Consultant: I understand how troubling that must be for you. You seem to feel a lot of pressure from the situation at home. Can you tell me more about what you think your role is in their arguments?

User: I feel like if I did better in school, they wouldn’t argue so much. It's like I'm the reason for their stress.

Consultant: It sounds like you believe that your academic performance is linked to their relationship troubles. Let’s explore that belief together. What evidence do you have that suggests you're the main reason for their fights?

User: Well, every time I get a bad grade, they start arguing about it. It feels like I’m always letting them down.

Consultant: That must feel really heavy on your shoulders. But let’s think about it—are there other factors that could be contributing to their disagreements that might not directly involve you or your grades?

User: I guess they’ve been under a lot of stress with work and everything. But I still think it would help if I just tried harder.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. However, sometimes the problems in a relationship can be more complex than just one person's actions. How do you think your parents might be feeling during these arguments?

User: I think they’re frustrated and maybe they don’t know how to communicate well with each other anymore.

Consultant: That’s an insightful observation, Xiaotong. It seems like your parents are experiencing their own challenges. How does that realization affect the way you view your own responsibility in their arguments?

User: I suppose it helps a little. I mean, it’s not all about me. But I still worry about how they feel.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. It shows your caring nature. But remember, you're not responsible for their feelings or their relationship. How would you feel about separating your feelings from what’s happening between them?

User: That sounds kind of hard, but I see what you mean. I think I should focus on my own feelings and not take their arguments personally.

Consultant: Exactly! Let’s practice that. Imagine your friend was in your position—what would you tell her about her role in her parents’ arguments?

User: I’d tell her it’s not her fault and she has her own life to live. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful perspective! Now, let’s think about how you can apply that to your situation. What are some ways you can remind yourself that their problems are separate from you?

User: Maybe I can write down positive affirmations or talk to a friend about it.

Consultant: Those are great ideas, Xiaotong. Writing things down can help clarify your thoughts, and talking to someone can provide support. How do you feel about taking those steps?

User: I feel a bit relieved. It’s good to know I can do something about my feelings.

Consultant: That’s a positive step forward! As we continue to explore this, how can we help you build your confidence in separating your feelings from your parents' issues?

User: Perhaps I could set some specific goals for myself in school without tying them to their arguments?

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! What kind of academic goals would you like to set for yourself?

User: I’d like to aim for a certain grade in each subject and maybe start a study routine.

Consultant: Setting those goals is a proactive way to focus on your own growth. How do you think achieving those goals might help you feel in light of everything happening at home?

User: I think it might make me feel more in control and less anxious about their arguments.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight! Feeling in control can really help reduce anxiety. Let’s recap what we’ve talked about today. You’ve recognized that your parents' issues are not your fault and that you can take steps to care for yourself.

User: Yeah, I see that more clearly now. It feels freeing.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up our session, what would you say is the biggest takeaway for you from our time together today?

User: Understanding that I can focus on myself and not just their issues is really important for me.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful takeaway, Xiaotong. Remember, you’re learning to set healthy boundaries, which is a great strength. If these feelings come up again, how might you use the strategies we discussed today?

User: I can remind myself to separate my feelings and focus on my own goals.

Consultant: Absolutely! You have the tools to cope with this. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out for help. Keep practicing what we've discussed, and I look forward to hearing about your journey next time.

User: Thank you! I feel better about things now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m glad I could support you today. Remember to take care of yourself, and I’ll see you at our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaotong! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been reflecting a lot on my family dynamics lately. It feels like I’ve understood some things better, like how my parents are struggling because of financial pressure and their different ideas about education.

Consultant: That's a valuable realization, Xiaotong. It sounds like you’re starting to see your parents' difficulties from a different perspective. How does this new understanding make you feel about the arguments that have been happening at home?

User: I guess I feel a bit less responsible for their arguments. I used to think it was all my fault, but now I see that they have their own issues too.

Consultant: That's a significant shift in your thinking. It’s important to recognize that family conflicts often stem from various sources. With this new perspective, what do you think about how you can respond to these situations differently?

User: I think I might not take their words so personally anymore. It's hard, but I want to focus on understanding instead of feeling guilty.

Consultant: That's a great approach, Xiaotong. Developing empathy for your parents can help ease some of that guilt. When you empathize, you're allowing yourself to understand their struggles without carrying the weight of blame. Have you had any moments where you felt you could apply this new understanding?

User: Yes, actually. I tried to listen to their arguments without getting upset. I think it helped me feel calmer.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Listening calmly is an important skill. It not only helps you stay grounded but can also make the environment less tense. What about your interactions with your classmates? How have those been lately?

User: I don’t talk to them much, to be honest. I've been feeling shy since they made fun of me.

Consultant: I understand, Xiaotong. Social situations can be challenging, especially when you feel uncomfortable. How do you feel when you think about engaging with your classmates?

User: I feel scared and anxious, like they won’t accept me. 

Consultant: That’s completely normal to feel anxious in those situations. What do you think is the worst that could happen if you tried to reach out to them in a small way?

User: I guess they could ignore me or laugh at me again.

Consultant: That possibility can be scary for sure. However, what if we consider some positive outcomes? Can you imagine a scenario where they might respond differently?

User: Maybe they could surprise me and be nice! It’s just hard to think that way.

Consultant: It absolutely can be challenging. One way to begin is to take small steps that feel manageable. What would it look like for you to say just a simple greeting or join a group activity, even if it feels uncomfortable?

User: Hmmm, maybe I could try saying hi to one person I know a bit.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic first step! Starting with just one person can help build your confidence. How would you feel about doing that?

User: I think I can manage that. It feels a little exciting but also scary.

Consultant: That mix of excitement and fear is completely normal. Remember, it’s okay to feel nervous. What strategies could you use to calm yourself before trying to reach out to them?

User: Maybe I could take a few deep breaths and remind myself it’s okay if they don’t respond well.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a great technique! Also, giving yourself permission to feel anxious can reduce that pressure. You’re doing wonderfully, Xiaotong. How does it feel to think about these actions you can take?

User: Honestly, it feels like a relief. I didn’t think I could do anything until now.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You have the ability to take these small steps towards a more positive social experience. Now, as we move forward, let’s look at how you can continue to build on this progress after our session today.

User: I think I want to keep practicing and maybe talk to my parents about how I feel too.

Consultant: Talking to your parents about your feelings could be very beneficial, and it demonstrates your growing confidence. What do you hope to achieve in those conversations?

User: I want them to understand that I feel pressured and maybe they could help lighten that up.

Consultant: That’s a great intention, Xiaotong. Being open with them might help them see things from your perspective. What are some phrases you could use to express your feelings to them?

User: Maybe I could say, "I feel really stressed about school and sometimes it feels like too much."

Consultant: That’s an excellent start! Clear communication can help your parents understand what you’re going through. As we wrap up, let's reflect on what you’ve learned today and how you can carry these insights forward.

User: I’ve learned that it’s important to understand my parents’ struggles and to try to communicate with them, as well as with my classmates.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve taken significant steps in understanding both family dynamics and your social interactions. How do you feel about your progress today?

User: I feel more hopeful and ready to take action.

Consultant: That’s inspiring to hear, Xiaotong! Remember, you can always come back to discuss your experiences and progress. You're making great strides, and I believe in you.
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaotong! I'm glad you're here today. It sounds like you've had some important realizations lately regarding social interactions. Can you share with me how you’ve been feeling since that team activity in your class?

User: Hi! Yes, I really enjoyed the team activity. It felt nice to work with others, and I noticed that I wasn't as anxious as I usually am when interacting. But sometimes, I still feel nervous about talking to my classmates or even my parents.

Consultant: It's great to hear you felt more comfortable during the activity! Building those social connections can definitely boost your confidence. When you think about talking to your classmates or parents, what specific thoughts come to mind that make you feel nervous?

User: I sometimes think they might not want to hear what I have to say or that I'll embarrass myself. It makes me want to stay quiet instead.

Consultant: I completely understand how that can make you want to withdraw. It’s often tough when we believe our voices don’t matter. Can you think of instances where your thoughts about what others might think held you back from expressing yourself?

User: Well, during the activity, I hesitated to share my ideas because I thought my suggestions weren’t good enough. I ended up just following what others were saying.

Consultant: It’s common to doubt ourselves in those situations. Let's explore that thought a bit. You mentioned feeling your suggestions weren’t good enough. How much evidence do you have to support that belief? Have you ever received positive feedback on your ideas?

User: I guess I don’t have a lot of evidence. There were times when my classmates seemed to appreciate my input, but I tend to focus on the bad moments more.

Consultant: That’s an important insight! Your mind may be emphasizing the negative experiences over the positive ones. We can work on balancing that perspective together. How would you feel about trying to challenge those negative thoughts the next time they arise?

User: I think I could try. It might help if I remind myself of the good moments.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remembering those positive experiences is key. We could also create a small plan for practicing expressing yourself more often in a comfortable setting. For instance, how about setting a goal to share at least one idea in class this week?

User: That sounds manageable! I think I could do that.

Consultant: I believe in you! This step feels smaller, but it can help build your confidence. Besides sharing ideas in class, are there other social situations where you’d like to feel more comfortable?

User: I wish I could engage more with my friends outside of school. I often feel left out during lunch.

Consultant: It’s understandable to want to connect with your friends outside of class. What if we brainstorm some fun activities you could suggest to them, making it easier for you to engage and build those connections?

User: I could invite them to play a game or watch a movie together - that sounds fun!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Creating those opportunities can strengthen your friendships. Would you be comfortable reaching out to them to make those plans?

User: I think I might be able to text them. It’s just that I sometimes worry they’ll say no.

Consultant: That fear is quite common, but it’s also a chance for you to practice being brave! Plus, even if they say no, it doesn’t reflect your worth or your value as a friend. Would you like to role-play how you might ask them?

User: Sure! I could say something like, “Hey, do you want to hang out this weekend?” 

Consultant: That sounds great! Simple and direct. Remember, the worst that can happen is they might be busy. How would you feel if they say yes?

User: I’d be really happy! It would feel nice to hang out and know they want to spend time with me.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Focusing on the potential joy of connection can help counterbalance that fear. As we wrap up today, what skills or strategies do you think you’ll carry into your social interactions this week?

User: I will try to remind myself of positive moments, practice expressing my thoughts in class, and reach out to my friends. 

Consultant: That sounds like a strong plan, Xiaotong! You’re building a great toolkit for yourself. As you practice these skills, you’ll likely feel more confident over time. Remember, I’m here to support you, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time we meet!

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about talking to my classmates and friends now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm so proud of the steps you’re taking. Just keep practicing, and remember that small progress counts too. Until next time, take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaotong! It’s great to see you again. I’m excited to hear about your recent experiences. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a lot more confident lately. Participating in the reading group made me realize I can express my ideas better. It felt nice to be acknowledged by my classmates.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like the reading group was a positive experience for you. What specific moments from the group made you feel particularly proud of yourself?

User: When I shared my thoughts on a book, my classmates actually listened and agreed with me. It made me feel like my opinions matter.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic feeling! It’s important to feel like your voice is valued. How do you think this newfound confidence in sharing your opinions could carry over into other parts of your life, like at home?

User: I think I could maybe talk to my parents about how I feel about school and my grades. I haven't really done that much before because I was scared they would be disappointed.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Xiaotong! Talking to your parents could help them understand your perspective better. What do you feel might be the hardest part about having that conversation with them?

User: I guess I worry they might get angry or say something that makes me feel bad. They're really focused on my grades right now, especially with the recent arguments.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel anxious about that, especially given the tension at home. We could try some role-playing to prepare you for that conversation. How would you feel about practicing together?

User: I’d be willing to try that! It might help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Great! Let’s imagine you’re sitting down with your parents. How would you start the conversation? What would you want to say first?

User: I might start by telling them that I want to talk about school, and explain how I feel when they focus so much on my grades. 

Consultant: That sounds like a good start! You’re opening the conversation calmly, which is key. How do you think they would react, based on what you know about them?

User: I think they might listen, but my mom might get defensive about my grades. She really cares about them.

Consultant: That’s very insightful. What if you reassured her that you are trying your best and that you value her support? Could that help ease the conversation?

User: Yes, I think that would help. If I express that I appreciate their concern too, it might reduce the tension.

Consultant: Absolutely! Showing that you value their support can indeed diffuse some defensiveness. Now, how do you envision the conversation progressing after you express your feelings?

User: Maybe I could ask them for their advice on how I can improve, instead of just feeling pressured.

Consultant: That’s a proactive approach, Xiaotong! Asking for their advice could turn the conversation into a collaborative effort. What advice do you think you’d seek from them?

User: I could ask how I can manage my time better so I can study effectively without feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: That sounds like a productive topic to bring up! Time management strategies can really be helpful in reducing stress around studies. How confident do you feel in having this conversation with your parents now?

User: I feel a bit more confident after our practice. I think I can do it!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Building up this confidence is key. Remember, it’s about expressing your feelings and finding common ground. Have you thought about when you might try to have this discussion with them?

User: I think I’ll try to talk to them this weekend when we’re all home together. 

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan! It’s great that you’re thinking ahead. Before our session ends, let’s summarize what we talked about today and how you’ll approach the conversation.

User: Okay! I’ll start by talking about my feelings around school, then ask for their advice on improving my studying habits.

Consultant: Excellent summary, Xiaotong! Make sure to remind them how much you value their input. Do you have any additional strategies in mind to stay calm during the conversation?

User: I might take a few deep breaths before I start to help me relax.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful technique! Breathing can really help calm your nerves. I’m proud of all the progress you’re making. How do you feel about what we've accomplished in today's session?

User: I feel really good! I have a plan now and I believe I can manage this conversation better.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’ve come a long way, and I believe in your ability to express yourself. Before we finish, is there anything else you want to discuss or any questions you have?

User: No, I think we covered everything. Thank you for helping me feel more prepared!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaotong! I’m really proud of you. Remember, I’m here to support you whenever you need. Good luck with your conversation this weekend, and I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello Xiaotong! I’m really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling lately with the support you’ve been getting from your parents?

User: Hi. I've been feeling much better, actually! With my parents being more supportive, I feel more confident about myself and my studies. It's a relief to not have that constant pressure on me.

Consultant: That sounds great to hear! It seems the changes in your family dynamics are really having a positive impact on you. Can you tell me more about how this support has changed your daily life?

User: Well, I don’t feel as stressed about my grades anymore. I can study more calmly and even chat with my parents about my schoolwork without feeling scared they'll be disappointed.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you can communicate more openly with them. Reflecting on our previous sessions, what strategies have you found most helpful in managing your thoughts about school and your family?

User: I think the breathing exercises we practiced really help me calm down when I feel anxious, and also reminding myself that it’s okay to ask for help. I’m trying to focus on progress rather than perfection.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! It’s important to focus on progress. How do you think you can continue to use these strategies as you move forward?

User: I think I can keep doing the breathing exercises before studying or when I start feeling overwhelmed. I also want to remind myself that my worth isn't just about my grades.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s about the overall growth and confidence you develop. Let’s also talk about some future goals. What would you like to achieve in school or at home in the coming months?

User: Honestly, I want to maintain my grades but also feel less stressed about them. I’d like to join a club or something, maybe make some friends without worrying too much about schoolwork all the time.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful goal! Joining a club can really help build connections and reduce stress regarding your studies. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I’m a bit nervous about meeting new people, but I really want to try. It would be nice to have friends to hang out with.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel nervous about new experiences. Remember those breathing techniques? They can help calm those nerves before you go to a new club meeting. Would you like to role-play how you might introduce yourself to new friends?

User: That sounds helpful! I usually don't know what to say.

Consultant: Let’s practice. You could start with a simple greeting and maybe share a little about what you enjoy in school. How about trying it out?

User: Okay, um... “Hi, I’m Xiaotong. I like reading and I’m trying to be better at math.” Does that sound okay?

Consultant: That sounds perfect! It’s simple and gives others a chance to relate to you. You can also ask about their interests. How does that feel?

User: It feels less daunting when I think about it like this! 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. You're making great progress. What's one step you can take this week towards joining a club or meeting new people?

User: I think I’ll ask my teacher about the clubs available and check them out. I can do that!

Consultant: That’s a great step forward! I believe you can do this. As we wrap up our session today, let’s reflect on how far you've come since we started our consultations.

User: I feel different! I can talk about my feelings more openly and try new things.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiaotong! You’ve learned to manage anxiety and built confidence in expressing yourself. Remember to keep using those strategies and always reach out for support when you need it.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help throughout this process.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember that you have the tools to handle challenges. This is our last session for now, but you can always come back if you need more support. Keep shining and believing in yourself!

User: I will, thank you! I feel ready for the future now.
