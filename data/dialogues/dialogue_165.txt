Consultant: Hello, Qing! I'm really glad you've come for this session. I understand that you've been feeling misunderstood and ignored lately. What would you like to talk about today?

User: Hi. I just feel really frustrated. My parents criticize me a lot about my grades and my gaming. It feels like they don't understand me at all. And then I got called out by my teacher at school for playing games too much, and I felt so embarrassed.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure from both your parents and your teacher. That must be really tough for you. Can you share a bit more about how those experiences made you feel?

User: I feel really angry and isolated. Whenever my parents yell at me about my grades, I just want to shut down. I don't even know how to talk to them anymore.

Consultant: I hear you. It seems like you're feeling stuck and not sure how to communicate your feelings to your parents. What do you wish your parents understood about your situation?

User: I wish they could see that I only play games because I'm bored. I don’t feel like they pay attention to me at all. I feel like they're only focused on my grades.

Consultant: That sounds really frustrating. You want them to recognize your feelings and not just focus on your performance in school. How do you think you could express this to them?

User: I don’t know... Whenever I try to talk to them, it just turns into an argument. They just don’t get it!

Consultant: It sounds like past conversations haven’t gone well. What if we explored some ideas on how you could approach the conversation differently next time?

User: Maybe... but I just feel so overwhelmed. I don't want them to get mad again.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. How about we brainstorm some ways you can start the conversation in a calm manner? What if you begin by sharing your feelings instead of mentioning the games right away?

User: I guess I could try that. Like, telling them I feel stressed about school and I sometimes play games to escape?

Consultant: Yes, that’s a great start! Sharing your feelings might help them understand your perspective better. What do you think you could say to express how stressed you are?

User: I could say something like, "I feel really stressed about my grades and sometimes I play games because it helps me relax." But I'm scared they might not be receptive.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel scared about how they might react. We can create a plan together that makes you feel more prepared. Would you like to practice how you could say that?

User: Sure, that would help. 

Consultant: Let's go through it. You could begin with, “Mom, Dad, I wanted to talk about how I've been feeling…” then share your feelings about the stress. How does that sound to you?

User: That actually sounds okay. It feels less confrontational.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about sharing rather than blaming. How are you feeling about trying this approach? 

User: A bit more hopeful, I guess. But still nervous.

Consultant: That’s completely normal. It's a step towards opening up. Besides talking to your parents, what else do you think could help you manage your feelings of frustration?

User: Maybe focusing more on my friends? They make me feel understood, unlike my parents.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Connecting with friends can help you feel less lonely. Are there specific friends you feel comfortable sharing your thoughts with?

User: Yes! There’s one friend who plays the same games. I can talk to her about what I’m going through.

Consultant: That sounds like a supportive relationship. Sometimes having someone who understands can relieve a lot of pressure. How do you plan to reach out to her?

User: I could just send her a message and see if she wants to hang out or talk about it.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Connecting with her could be a good way to feel supported. And remember, it’s okay to express how you feel with her. 

User: Yeah, I feel like I can do that.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. As you think about our conversation today, what’s one thing you’d like to take away from it?

User: I think I want to try expressing my feelings without being defensive. It’s hard, but I see it might help.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway, Qing! Recognizing that is an important step. Now, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed and look ahead to your strategy with your parents and friends.

User: Sure, I like that idea.

Consultant: You’ll try opening up about your feelings with your parents and seek support from your friend. As you move forward, remember to be gentle with yourself. It’s a journey of learning.

User: Thanks! I feel a bit more confident about these steps.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe you've taken significant steps towards understanding yourself better. If you ever need to revisit these strategies or talk about anything else, I’m here for you.

User: I really appreciate that. 

Consultant: It’s my pleasure! Remember, you have the ability to navigate these feelings, and I’m excited for your journey ahead. 

User: Thank you! I’ll try my best. 

Consultant: You’re doing great, Qing. I look forward to hearing how things go next time. Until then, take care!

Consultant: Hello Q, I'm glad you're here for this session. You've expressed a desire to find ways to improve the communication with your parents. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more accepted at school since my classmates are noticing my gaming skills. It's nice to feel liked, but I still feel alone and misunderstood at home.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing mixed emotions. On one hand, the acceptance from your peers brings you joy, but on the other hand, you still feel overlooked by your parents. Could you share more about the interactions you've been having with them lately?

User: Well, they keep complaining about my grades and all I want to do is play games after school. We often end up arguing, and it just makes me feel even worse. 

Consultant: I can understand how frustrating that must be for you. You’re finding comfort in your gaming, while your parents are focused on your academic performance. Have there been specific moments recently that led to these arguments?

User: Yes, just the other day, I was playing a new game and they came home and started yelling about how I'm wasting my time. I just lost my temper and yelled back that they don’t understand me.

Consultant: Losing your temper in those moments makes sense. It seems like your parents' concerns feel very overwhelming to you. How do you feel after these arguments?

User: I feel terrible afterward, like I just can't communicate with them. I want them to get that games make me happy, but they just see the bad grades.

Consultant: It’s important for your parents to know what makes you happy, and it can be hard to communicate that. What do you think might help you express your feelings to them without it turning into an argument?

User: Maybe if I try to show them how much I enjoy gaming and how it helps me relax… but I just don’t know how to start that conversation.

Consultant: That’s a great starting point! Let’s explore how you might initiate that conversation. You could tell them how gaming makes you feel, and perhaps also mention the positive attention you've received from your peers. How would that feel to you?

User: It feels a bit scary to think about it, but I suppose it might help. I could also mention how I feel stressed about my grades and that gaming is my way to cope with it.

Consultant: You’re being very thoughtful about this. Sharing your feelings of stress and explaining why gaming is important to you might open the door for a better conversation. Would you like to practice how you might say this to them?

User: Yes, that would be helpful! I want to sound calm and not just defensive.

Consultant: Let's role-play this. Imagine you sit down with your parents. You might start with, "I know we've been arguing about my grades, but I would like to share how gaming really helps me unwind and connect with my friends." How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds okay. I like the idea of being honest and showing them I'm not trying to ignore my responsibilities.

Consultant: Exactly! Being honest and showing you care about their concerns while sharing your perspective can make a difference. Let’s think about how they might respond. What do you think they could say?

User: They might still insist I need to do better in school… but maybe they will listen if I explain how gaming also gives me a break.

Consultant: Right! If they react that way, you could reassure them that you’re also committed to improving your grades. How would it feel if they acknowledged your feelings while still discussing your performance?

User: I think I would feel heard. It would help a lot if they could understand where I'm coming from.

Consultant: It certainly would! Feeling heard is essential for you in these conversations. We can also discuss ways for you to meet their expectations while still making time for gaming. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I want to find a balance so I don’t feel overwhelmed all the time.

Consultant: Let's create a plan together. We can start by setting some small goals for your schoolwork and scheduling your gaming time. How much time do you think is reasonable for both?

User: Maybe I could study for an hour and then have an hour to game? 

Consultant: That sounds like a sensible approach! Two hours for academic focus is reasonable, especially if you can reward yourself with gaming afterward. How do you think your parents would feel about this plan?

User: I think they would like that, especially if they see I'm trying.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset. It's about showing them your effort. As you practice this, keep in mind how you can communicate your feelings and ensure it’s a two-way conversation. What are your thoughts on our progress today?

User: I feel more hopeful! I have some ideas now on how to talk to them.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, building this communication is a process. It may take time, but expressing yourself is a step toward improvement. For our next session, let’s discuss how your conversation with them went and how you felt afterwards. How does that sound?

User: Yes! I’ll try my best to have that conversation. Thanks for guiding me!

Consultant: You’re doing great, Q. I look forward to hearing about your experience. Until next time, take care!

Consultant: Hello Qing! I'm really glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better. Participating in the science interest group really helped boost my confidence, but I still struggle with talking to my parents. 

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you've gained some confidence from the school activity! However, I'm sorry to hear that communication with your parents remains a challenge. What do you think is holding you back when it comes to talking to them?

User: I don't know... I feel like they just won't understand or listen to me. It makes me frustrated, and then we end up arguing.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable to feel frustrated when you believe your thoughts and feelings aren’t being heard. Can you share a specific recent situation where you wanted to talk to them but it didn't go well?

User: Yeah, last week, I wanted to tell them how much I enjoyed my science project and how proud I felt. But my mom was just focused on my grades again, and I felt like she didn’t care about my feelings.

Consultant: It sounds like you were really looking to share something positive with them, but it felt like they missed that opportunity to connect. How did that made you feel at the moment?

User: I felt really disheartened and angry. I wanted to share my success, but it felt like they only see my failures.

Consultant: I can see how that would be really disappointing for you. It’s important to feel acknowledged and supported, especially when you’re experiencing success. What would you wish for your parents to understand about you in moments like these?

User: I just want them to see that I'm trying hard, even if my grades aren't great. I need them to recognize my efforts, not just the results.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Qing. It sounds like recognition and encouragement from your parents would really help you feel more supported. Do you have any ideas on how you might express these feelings to them in the future?

User: Maybe I could write them a note or something? I’m not sure if talking will work because I get too emotional.

Consultant: A note sounds like a great idea! It's a way to express your feelings without the pressure of an immediate response. Additionally, what if you practiced some sentences ahead of time, to help you feel more prepared when you communicate with them?

User: That might help. I could write down what I want to say, so I don’t get lost in the moment.

Consultant: Exactly! Writing down your thoughts can empower you and give you the confidence to express your feelings. Let’s try to create a few sentences together that highlight your efforts and need for recognition. What could you say?

User: I could say something like, “I appreciate how much you care about my education, but I hope you can also see the effort I'm putting in, even if the grades aren't perfect.”

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start! You're clearly articulating your feelings and needs. How does it feel to express that in words?

User: It feels good! I think it might help me not feel so lost when I talk to them.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It sounds like you're becoming more proactive in expressing your thoughts. As you prepare, what are some other strategies you could use to manage your emotions during these conversations?

User: I could take deep breaths beforehand. I sometimes just panic when the conversation gets heated.

Consultant: Deep breathing is an excellent strategy to help you stay calm and grounded. We can also practice some relaxation techniques together next time if you'd like, to help you manage those feelings. 

User: Yes, I think I’d like that! I want to feel less anxious when I talk to them.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan. Remember, it’s all about gradual steps toward building a better communication space with your parents. I’m proud of the progress you're making. 

User: Thanks! It feels nice to hear that.

Consultant: You deserve to feel proud of yourself, Qing. As we wrap up today, can we recap what you’ve learned? What will be your next step?

User: I think my next step is to write that note and practice what I want to say. 

Consultant: Excellent! That’s a strong step towards better communication. How do you feel about the progress we've made today?

User: I feel hopeful! I believe I can improve our communication.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, taking these steps takes courage, and I'm here to help you along the way. Keep reflecting on your feelings and let's keep working together on this. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm excited to see how these changes will impact your relationship with your parents. Until next time, take care and remember to celebrate your progress!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Qing! I'm really glad you’re here today. I know that your family has been making some changes recently. How are you feeling about those changes?

User: Hi! I feel a little better since my parents started spending time with me on weekends. It's nice to have them around, but I'm still a bit worried it won't last.

Consultant: It sounds like you appreciate the effort your parents are making, but there’s still some caution on your part. Can you share more about what specifically worries you about this situation?

User: Well, I feel like they might just be doing it to avoid fighting. I’m not sure they really care about my feelings. I’ve just been hurt too much before, you know?

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s understandable to feel uncertain when there’s been conflict in the past. Trust takes time to rebuild. What do you think would help you feel more secure in your relationship with your parents now?

User: I guess if they keep showing they care even when we’re not just doing activities together, that would help. Like if they check in with me when they’re busy or just ask how I’m feeling.

Consultant: That’s a great point, Qing. Feeling connected outside of scheduled activities can really help build trust. Have you considered sharing this desire with your parents? 

User: I haven’t really talked to them about it. I’m afraid it might sound like I’m complaining, or they might get defensive.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way. However, expressing your feelings is important, and it could help them understand you better. How do you think you could approach them in a way that feels comfortable for you?

User: Maybe I could write them a note? That way, they can read it and think about how they respond without feeling pressured.

Consultant: Writing a note sounds like a thoughtful approach. It gives them the chance to reflect on your feelings without immediate pressure. What would you want to say in that note?

User: I’d probably tell them that I appreciate what they’re trying to do, but I also want them to understand I still feel a bit uneasy about things. I just want to feel like they’re really there for me.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful message. You’re balancing appreciation with honesty, which is very important. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think it might help. I want to make things better between us.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel nervous, but it shows great strength that you want to improve your relationship. How about we set a goal for next time? We can talk about how your parents responded and how it felt for you.

User: That sounds good! I would like to see how they react to the note.

Consultant: Perfect! It’ll be a nice step forward. In the meantime, how are you feeling about your self-worth and recognition within the family? 

User: I think I'm starting to feel a bit more valued, especially with how they’re trying to spend time with me. But sometimes I wonder if they really see me for who I am.

Consultant: It’s great to hear you're feeling recognized. You mention wanting them to see you—what aspects of yourself do you wish they understood better?

User: I want them to see that I’m trying my best at school, even if my grades aren’t good. I just get overwhelmed sometimes with everything.

Consultant: Your effort really matters, and it's important they recognize that. Have there been any moments recently where you felt proud of what you’ve accomplished, no matter how small?

User: I finished a book for school, and I felt pretty good about that. It wasn’t easy for me to stick with it.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful achievement, Qing! Completing a book can be quite a challenge. Acknowledging that progress is important. How could you remind yourself of this when you’re feeling overwhelmed?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal of the things I accomplish, even the small ones. 

Consultant: A journal sounds like an excellent idea! It’s a helpful way to visually track your progress and build a more positive self-image. When you look back, it can remind you of your capabilities. 

User: I like that idea! I’ll start doing it.

Consultant: Fantastic! Having a written record can really help boost your confidence. As we wrap up, what’s one thing you’d like to focus on before our next meeting?

User: I want to write that note to my parents and start my journal. I think those could help me feel better.

Consultant: That's a great plan! I believe these steps will contribute positively to your relationship and self-esteem. I'm proud of you for taking these initiatives. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help and support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Qing. You've made significant progress today, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Remember, you’re doing great! 

User: Thanks! I feel a bit more hopeful now. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Hope is an important feeling. Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Qing! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve felt pretty good, actually. I think I’ve my value recognized by others, especially at school, which makes me feel more confident.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It’s great that you’re feeling more confident because of the recognition from others. Could you share more about the moments that made you feel valued?

User: Yes! During class activities, I was elected as the leader for a group project. My classmates listened to my ideas, and we worked really well together. 

Consultant: That sounds like an amazing experience! It’s fantastic that your peers value your ideas and leadership. How did that make you feel about yourself?

User: It made me feel really proud. For the first time, I felt like I could contribute positively and that I wasn’t just a quiet girl in the back of the class.

Consultant: That’s a huge achievement, Qing! It seems like you’re starting to see yourself in a more positive light. How does this newfound confidence affect your thoughts about your studies and your relationship with your parents?

User: Well, it does help a bit. I still have some issues with my parents when they complain about my grades, but I’m trying not to let it get to me as much. 

Consultant: It’s understandable that you feel that way. Working on confidence can definitely make it easier to manage those tough conversations with your parents. What strategies do you think you could use when they bring up your grades?

User: Maybe I could explain to them how I’m working on my leadership skills and how I’m trying to balance things better. I hope they’d understand that I'm growing in other areas too.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Communicating your growth in leadership and balancing responsibilities can help them see the bigger picture. What are some specific short-term goals you’d like to set for yourself moving forward?

User: I want to keep improving in school and maybe set a specific time for studying. I also want to spend less time on my phone with games.

Consultant: Setting a specific study schedule and reducing game time sounds like a productive plan! What time would you like to dedicate to studying each day?

User: I think I can manage about an hour and a half after school. I’d like to finish my homework first before enjoying any game time.

Consultant: That sounds balanced! Prioritizing your homework before game time is a wise choice. How do you think you’ll keep yourself motivated to stick to this schedule?

User: I might reward myself with some gaming time after I finish my homework. That could keep me motivated to study.

Consultant: Good idea! Rewarding yourself can be a strong motivator. You mentioned earlier about feeling more recognized; how can you remind yourself of that when you’re feeling tempted to skip studying?

User: Maybe I could write down what I like about leading my group and how good it felt. Reading that could help motivate me.

Consultant: Excellent strategy! Keeping a reminder of your positive experiences can help reinforce your commitment. As we wrap up, can you summarize some of the key insights or growth points from our conversation today? 

User: Sure! I realized that my confidence is growing through my leadership experiences, and I'm planning to set a study schedule while balancing my gaming. Also, I’m learning to handle discussions with my parents better. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Qing! You've made significant progress in recognizing your strengths and setting clear goals for yourself. How do you feel about all the strategies and insights we've discussed today?

User: I feel really encouraged and excited to put them into practice. It’s nice to talk about my growth!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. If you ever feel overwhelmed, you can always reach out again for support. You've done an amazing job today, and I’m proud of you!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Qing! Keep believing in yourself, and I wish you all the best in reaching your goals. 

User: Bye! See you next time!

Consultant: Bye, Qing! Take care!
