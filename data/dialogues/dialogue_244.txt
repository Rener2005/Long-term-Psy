Consultant: Hello, Xiaofu and Xiaocheng! I’m glad to see both of you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling really overwhelmed. My parents' divorce is still affecting me a lot, and I just can't seem to cope with everything. Sometimes, I feel like hurting myself to express my pain. 

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty in sharing that with me. It's important to talk about these feelings. Can you tell me more about what emotions come up when you think about your parents' divorce?

User: I feel sad and really alone. It’s like nobody understands what I am going through. I just wish they could see how much it hurts. 

Consultant: It sounds like you feel a deep sense of loneliness and emotional pain. It's understandable to feel this way during such a challenging time. How does that loneliness affect your daily life and studies?

User: It's hard to concentrate on my studies. I often feel anxious and find myself just scrolling on my phone instead of doing my homework. I know I'm not being responsible, but I can't help it. 

Consultant: You’re recognizing that your anxiety is impacting your studies, and that’s a crucial step. Can you identify any specific thoughts that come to mind when you avoid your work?

User: I think things like "I’m never going to get through this" or "what’s the point?" It’s like I’ve given up. 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite daunting, and it's no wonder they’re making you feel worse. Let’s explore those thoughts. What evidence do you have that it’s true you’ll never get through this?

User: I guess I don’t really have any evidence. It just feels like I can’t handle it all. 

Consultant: It’s often easy to believe these negative thoughts when we’re feeling overwhelmed. Can you think of a time you faced a difficult situation and managed to push through?

User: Well, I did manage to study for my exams last term despite feeling stressed. I did okay in the end. 

Consultant: That’s a great example! You proved to yourself that you can handle difficult situations. How can you remind yourself of that strength when those negative thoughts arise?

User: Maybe I can write it down or talk to Xiaocheng. She’s been supportive.

Consultant: Talking to Xiaocheng sounds like a wonderful idea. Having support can really help ease feelings of loneliness. How do you feel about discussing your emotions openly with her?

User: I think it would help. I’m just scared that I’ll burden her with my problems.

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry about burdening friends, but true friendship often involves sharing struggles. Remember, supporting each other can strengthen your friendship. What if you both shared something vulnerable during your next conversation?

User: We could maybe do that. It sounds like a good way to connect. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Building that connection can also help you both feel less alone. When it comes to handling your emotions, what are some healthier ways you might express yourself instead of self-harm?

User: I used to write poetry, but I haven’t in a while. I think I could try that again.

Consultant: Poetry can be a powerful way to express your feelings. It allows you to convey your emotions in a safe way. How would you feel about setting aside some time each week to write?

User: I like that idea! It feels a bit less pressure than studying. 

Consultant: That sounds great! Finding balance is key. Could we set a small goal together, like writing one poem this week? 

User: Yes, I can do that! 

Consultant: Wonderful! Now, as we move forward, I’d like you both to think about this: if feelings of sadness or anxiety come back, how can you remind yourselves that you're not alone and that you have tools to cope?

User: I guess reminding myself of what we’ve talked about today and talking more openly to Xiaocheng. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan. Remember, it’s a process, and it's okay to seek support when needed. As we wrap up, let’s summarize. You’ve identified your feelings, recognized some negative thoughts, and found healthier expressions through poetry and friendship. Does that feel like a good starting point for you both?

User: Yes, it does. I feel a bit more hopeful.

Consultant: That’s encouraging to hear! Remember, it's crucial to focus on progress. As we conclude today, keep those tools in mind, lean on each other, and continue expressing your feelings in constructive ways. If you need anything, I'm here for you. 

User: Thank you! I feel like I can share more with Xiaocheng now. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. Let’s keep working together to find even more helpful approaches next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, little Fu and little Cheng! I'm glad you're here today. It sounds like both of you have been navigating some challenging feelings lately. Can you share how you've been feeling and what you hope to get out of our time together today?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really anxious because my parents are going through a divorce. One week I'm with my dad and the next week with my mom. It feels so unstable, and I just want to feel secure again.

User: I understand how you feel, little Fu. I’ve also been struggling lately. I’ve been hiding my wrist due to some self-harm I did. I worry that if anyone finds out, it could hurt my friendships and impact my studies.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, little Fu and little Cheng. It must be tough to manage those feelings of instability and anxiety, especially when you're also dealing with self-harm and worries about friendships. Let’s talk about the emotions you're experiencing. Little Fu, what emotions come up for you when you think about your parents' divorce?

User: I often feel sadness and anger. It feels like everything in my life is changing too fast, and I don’t know how to cope with it.

User: I can relate. I feel ashamed about my self-harm, and I don't know how to express what I'm going through to my friends. It's like I'm trapped in this cycle of pain.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way, considering the circumstances. Acknowledging your feelings of sadness, anger, and shame is an important step. How do you both currently cope when those feelings become overwhelming?

User: I usually just isolate myself. I try to study, but I can't focus when I'm upset. 

User: I sometimes turn to self-harm as a way to release my emotions. I know it’s not healthy, but it's the only thing that seems to help in the moment.

Consultant: It sounds like both of you are looking for healthier ways to cope with what you're feeling. Little Fu, let's explore some alternate coping strategies together. What activities make you feel even slightly better when you're feeling down?

User: I used to enjoy drawing, but I haven't done it in a while. 

User: I like writing poetry when I'm feeling overwhelmed. It helps me to express my feelings, even if I keep it to myself.

Consultant: Those are wonderful activities! Drawing and writing poetry can be great outlets for your emotions. How about we create a plan for both of you to engage in these activities regularly as a way to manage your feelings?

User: That sounds good. I think setting aside some time to draw might help me find some peace.

User: Writing poetry regularly could also be a good idea. Maybe I could start sharing it with someone I trust.

Consultant: Sharing your poetry could help build connections and create more support in your life. Little Cheng, have you thought about how you might open up to your friends about your self-harm and what you’re experiencing?

User: I’m scared they won’t understand or will judge me. But I think if I express my feelings through my poetry, it might help bridge that gap.

Consultant: That's a great insight! Using poetry as a way to communicate your feelings can definitely help. You could start by sharing how your experiences have made you feel, rather than focusing on the self-harm itself. How does that feel to you?

User: That feels a bit less daunting, actually. 

User: Yeah, that sounds like a good approach!

Consultant: Excellent! Now let's think about creating a safe space for each of you to express your feelings. Perhaps you could set up regular check-ins with each other to share how you’re feeling and what you’re doing to cope?

User: Yes! I would like that. It feels good to have someone who understands.

User: I would really appreciate that too. It can be hard to talk to anyone else right now.

Consultant: It's wonderful to see you both supporting one another. This mutual support will be a valuable resource as you navigate these feelings. As we move forward, let’s talk about how you can remind yourselves to engage in your coping activities and check in with each other.

User: Maybe we can set reminders on our phones for drawing and writing?

User: That’s a great idea! We could check in at the end of each week to discuss what we’ve created.

Consultant: Perfect! It sounds like you both have a solid plan in place. As we continue, what do you hope to feel or achieve by implementing these changes?

User: I hope to feel less anxious and more in control of my emotions.

User: I want to feel more connected to my friends and less ashamed about what I’ve gone through.

Consultant: Those are insightful goals. Remember, it’s okay to feel uncertain about the future. What matters is that you're taking steps to manage these feelings positively. Let’s take a moment to summarize what we’ve discussed today.

User: We talked about drawing and writing to cope, and creating a support plan between us.

User: We’re going to try to share our feelings through art and have regular check-ins!

Consultant: Exactly! I believe you both have the strength to navigate through this. Remember, reaching out and expressing yourself is a significant step forward. How are you feeling about everything we discussed today?

User: I feel more hopeful and less alone.

User: I feel relieved to have a plan. Thank you for guiding us through this.

Consultant: You’re both very welcome! Remember, it's okay to have ups and downs as you move forward. I'm here for you, and I can’t wait to hear about your progress next time. Please take care of yourselves, and I look forward to our next session.

Consultant: Hello, 小傅 and 小程! I'm glad to see you both today. I know that you want to work on improving your overall satisfaction in life and your emotional experiences. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. My communication with my parents has improved a little, but I still have some worries lingering. 

Consultant: It's great to hear that there's been some improvement in your communication with your parents, 小傅! What specific worries are still on your mind?

User: I guess I'm just worried about their relationship and how it might affect me. Sometimes, I feel caught in the middle.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, 小傅. Being caught in the middle can be overwhelming. 小程, how about you? How have things been for you?

User: I've been feeling supported by my teachers, which is nice, but I still struggle with my self-confidence in social situations. 

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you feel supported by your teachers, 小程! That support can be crucial. Can you share a specific situation where you felt your self-confidence was challenged recently?

User: Well, at a recent class meeting, I felt like I didn’t contribute enough. I kept doubting my ideas, and then I just went quiet.

Consultant: That experience sounds tough. It's common to doubt ourselves in such situations. Let’s reflect on that moment. What thoughts were running through your mind when you felt like you didn’t contribute enough?

User: I thought maybe my ideas weren't as good as others, or that I would say something stupid.

Consultant: I see. Those thoughts can be quite discouraging. How do you think those thoughts affected your feelings and actions in that situation?

User: They made me really anxious and I just stopped participating. 

Consultant: That's understandable. Let’s think about this, 小程. If a friend of yours had those same thoughts, what would you tell them?

User: I would tell them that their ideas are valid and that everyone has something valuable to share.

Consultant: Exactly! You’d encourage them. Remember that it’s okay to share your voice, just like you would support a friend. 小傅, do you sometimes find yourself doubting your value or contributions?

User: Yes, sometimes. I feel like I have to do everything perfectly, and if I don’t, I worry what others will think.

Consultant: That pressure to be perfect can be really heavy. Let's challenge that thought together. What evidence do you have that you must always be perfect? 

User: I guess there's no real evidence; it just feels like if I’m not perfect, I’m failing.

Consultant: It’s a common feeling, but perfection is often unattainable! What alternative thought could you have that might ease that pressure?

User: Maybe I can think that doing my best is enough, even if I make mistakes.

Consultant: That sounds like a much healthier perspective! Remember, making mistakes is part of learning. Now, let’s shift focus a bit. What activities do you both enjoy that bring you satisfaction outside of school?

User: I like painting and drawing a lot. It helps me relax.

User: And I enjoy playing basketball with friends; it’s fun and a great way to connect.

Consultant: Those sound fantastic! Engaging in activities you enjoy can heighten your sense of self-worth. How can we integrate these activities into your routines more often?

User: I could set aside time each week for painting.

User: And I can make plans to play basketball on weekends with my friends. 

Consultant: Both great ideas! Setting clear times for these activities can help you feel more balanced. As you reflect on your experiences, keep a journal noting your emotions before and after these activities. How does that sound to both of you?

User: That sounds like a helpful plan!

User: Yes, I think I’d find that interesting.

Consultant: Excellent! Noting your emotional highs and lows will help you identify patterns and triggers. As we wrap up today, let’s think about what you both want to focus on until our next session.

User: I want to practice that new thought about doing my best and not being perfect.

User: I’d like to work on being more confident in sharing my ideas, especially in front of the class.

Consultant: Those are great focuses! Remember, each small step counts. If challenges arise, think about how you can use the strategies we discussed today. I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful.

User: Yes, thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re both very welcome! You've made wonderful steps today. Remember, I’m here for you whenever you need support. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, you two! I'm glad you're here today. How have you both been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I think I've been a bit better about understanding my parents after that week with them. There seems to be some tension still, but it feels like we’re able to communicate a little more.

User: Same here. I've been feeling more confident in group projects at school. I’m trying to take on more responsibility, although sometimes it still feels a bit overwhelming.

Consultant: That’s great to hear that there’s some improvement in communication with your parents, and it’s wonderful that you’re taking on more leadership in your schoolwork! How do you both feel about the changes you’ve experienced recently?

User: I feel hopeful, but I sometimes worry that things might fall apart again. Balancing everything is tough.

User: I’m a bit concerned about whether I can keep this up. I want to keep being seen as responsible, but it’s stressful to hold myself to such high standards.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. When expectations are high, it can feel overwhelming at times. What do you think would help in managing those worries about falling back or not meeting your own standards?

User: I guess it would help to remind myself that it’s okay to not be perfect all the time. I just need to believe that I can make mistakes without everything going wrong.

User: Yes, I think it would be helpful to be more forgiving of myself. Sometimes I feel like I have to be the best in everything, and that’s exhausting. 

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent insight! Recognizing the need for self-forgiveness is a big step. What small changes could you both make to practice being kinder to yourselves in moments of stress?

User: I could set more realistic goals for my projects and deadlines instead of expecting everything to be flawless.

User: Maybe I could give myself permission to take breaks, or ask for help when I need it instead of trying to do it all alone.

Consultant: Those are wonderful ideas! Setting realistic goals and recognizing the importance of support and self-care can significantly help reduce stress. How might you both incorporate these ideas into your routines this week?

User: I’ll try to outline my project tasks better and include breaks. I think that will keep things manageable.

User: I could start by checking in with my group members more frequently. Collaborating might ease some of my pressure.

Consultant: Great strategies! Also, how do you both feel about the feedback you've been receiving from your parents or teachers since you've been working on these relationships and responsibilities?

User: My parents have been more communicative, and I think they appreciate my efforts. It feels nice to see them try too.

User: Yes, I feel like my teachers are noticing my effort in group work and have been encouraging me. It makes me feel valued.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you both are receiving positive feedback! This acknowledgment can reinforce your motivation. In what ways can you build on this encouragement to foster better self-acceptance moving forward?

User: I could remind myself that their support is a sign that I’m doing well, even if I don’t feel perfect.

User: Yes, I could try to reflect on my accomplishments more often, instead of just focusing on mistakes or the stress of what’s next.

Consultant: Those are powerful strategies! Reflecting on accomplishments and recognizing external support can help you cultivate a more positive self-view. How can you both implement a moment of reflection in your daily routine?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal where I write one good thing that happened each day.

User: I could do a quick end-of-day recap with myself, just to celebrate even the smallest wins.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Journaling and daily reflections can really anchor your progress and boost your emotional wellness. It seems like you’re at a great place to take personal responsibility for your growth. Are there any fears about moving forward that you’d like to address before we wrap up?

User: I’m just worried about slipping back, but I know I can keep practicing these things.

User: My concern is about maintaining this momentum with my responsibilities while ensuring my well-being.

Consultant: Those fears are very valid. Remember that growth is a process with ups and downs; it’s okay if everything isn’t perfect all the time. Keeping those reflections and self-kindness in mind will help you navigate through challenges. What steps will you both commit to in maintaining this progress from today's session?

User: I’ll make it a goal to be more self-reflective and less harsh on myself.

User: I’m excited to remind myself of my strengths and seek help when I need to. It feels good to have a plan.

Consultant: That’s an excellent commitment! Remember, change takes practice, and it’s essential to celebrate every step you take toward your mental wellness. I believe you’re both capable of wonderful growth. If you encounter challenges, don’t hesitate to revisit these strategies. 

User: Thank you! I feel more at ease and hopeful about moving forward.

User: Yes, I appreciate this! I feel like I’m more equipped to handle what’s ahead.

Consultant: I’m thrilled to hear that! It’s been great working with both of you. Remember, you have the tools and awareness to continue improving. I look forward to seeing the progress you’ll make. Take care!

User: Thank you!

User: Thanks!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you for this session, Xiao Fu. It sounds like you've been doing some great work on your mental health. How are you feeling today?

User: Hi! I'm feeling a bit better. I’ve been trying to focus more on my studies and manage my emotions. It’s been a bit of a rollercoaster, especially with everything that’s happened at home.

Consultant: I hear you, it can definitely feel overwhelming at times, especially with the recent changes in your family. It’s great that you’re making an effort to focus on your studies and manage your feelings. Can you tell me more about what’s been going well for you in this process?

User: Well, I feel like I'm more aware of my thoughts now. When I notice myself getting anxious, I try to pause and think about what I’m really feeling. It helps a bit.

Consultant: That’s an important skill to develop! Being aware of your thoughts and feelings is a big step. Can you share a specific situation where you used this awareness recently?

User: Sure! Last week, I was really nervous about a group presentation. Instead of panicking, I reminded myself that I had prepared well and that my classmates would support me. I think it helped me do a better job.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you challenged those anxious thoughts quite effectively. How did you feel during the presentation compared to before?

User: I felt more confident than I expected. I didn’t realize I could manage my anxiety like that. But afterwards, I also felt a bit relieved and exhausted.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel a mix of relief and exhaustion after successfully facing your fears. You've shown great resilience. As you reflect on that experience, what do you think contributed most to your success?

User: I think reminding myself of my preparation helped a lot. Also, my classmates’ support made me feel less alone.

Consultant: Support from others is incredibly valuable. It's impressive how you're recognizing the role that preparation and support play in your success. Moving forward, how do you plan to use this experience to handle future situations?

User: I want to keep reminding myself that I am capable and that I can lean on my friends when I'm feeling anxious. I think I can create a reminder or something to help me with that.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Creating reminders can reinforce your positive self-talk. What kind of reminders are you thinking about? 

User: Maybe sticky notes with encouraging phrases or quotes. Something to look at before important events.

Consultant: Sticky notes are a practical and effective strategy. What kind of phrases do you think you would write on them?

User: I might write things like “You’ve prepared for this” or “It’s okay to ask for help.” 

Consultant: Those are excellent phrases! They not only remind you of your preparation but also acknowledge the importance of seeking support. How does thinking about using these reminders make you feel?

User: I feel more motivated and less anxious just thinking about it! I think this will really help me.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! It's empowering to take charge of your thoughts like this. Now, let’s talk about any challenges you foresee when implementing these reminders or facing future situations.

User: I worry that in stressful moments, I might forget to look at my reminders or get too caught up in my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. In those moments, having a plan to reinforce your reminders can be helpful. Would it be useful to think about specific actions you could take when you start feeling overwhelmed?

User: Maybe I could take a deep breath first and then remind myself to look at my notes. That might help me regain focus.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Deep breathing can ground you and give you a moment to collect your thoughts. How would it feel to practice this technique regularly leading up to stressful situations?

User: I think it would help me develop more consistency. I’m just a bit unsure how to start practicing it.

Consultant: Starting small is key! You could set aside a few minutes each day to practice deep breathing. Even just taking a few deep breaths whenever you remember can gradually build this habit. 

User: That makes sense. I can do that. 

Consultant: Excellent! Keep it simple initially, and build up from there. This will help you feel more prepared when challenges arise. As we get closer to wrapping up our session today, how do you feel about the progress you've made?

User: I feel like I’ve gained some useful tools to handle my anxiety better. I’m feeling more equipped to face future challenges.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Let’s take a moment to summarize what you’ve learned today. You’ve identified your strengths in managing anxiety, created helpful reminders, and developed a plan to implement deep breathing techniques. How would you feel about maintaining these practices moving forward?

User: I’m definitely committed to trying them out! It feels reassuring to have a plan.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that. As you move forward, keep in mind the progress you’ve made. Do you have any final thoughts or questions before we conclude today's session?

User: No, I think I’ve covered everything! Thank you so much for your guidance. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiao Fu! It’s been a pleasure to work with you. Remember, you can always reach out if you need further support. Keep practicing those skills, and take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you both back for this session. I'm eager to hear about how you've been doing lately. Can we start by discussing any recent experiences that stood out to you?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really positive lately. I believe my self-worth has improved since our last session. I feel more confident in my abilities.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's fantastic to hear that you're feeling more confident. What specific events or activities do you think contributed to this boost in your self-esteem?

User: Well, I've been participating actively in family gatherings, and I've really felt my parents' support. That makes me feel valued.

Consultant: That's such a beautiful development. Family support can play a crucial role in our sense of worth. How did it feel for you to be actively participating in those gatherings?

User: It felt good, actually. I enjoyed connecting with them, and it reminded me that they care about me, despite all the changes. 

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that. It seems like this connection has reinforced your sense of belonging. Would you say this has also affected your interactions outside of family?

User: Yes, definitely! I've noticed I'm more comfortable speaking up in class. I even volunteered to lead a group project last week.

Consultant: That's impressive! Leading a project shows a lot of initiative and confidence. How did that experience go for you?

User: It went really well! I felt a bit nervous at first, but my classmates were supportive, and it turned out to be fun.

Consultant: How wonderful! It sounds like you received a positive response from your classmates, which likely helped ease your nerves. Did you notice any thoughts or feelings you experienced while leading?

User: I did feel anxious at times, but I kept reminding myself that I’m capable. It helped me push through those feelings.

Consultant: You did a great job recognizing those anxious thoughts and countering them with positive affirmations. How does that make you feel about managing challenges in the future?

User: I feel more prepared! I think I can handle similar situations better now. I just want to keep this momentum going.

Consultant: That's a great mindset to have. Maintaining that momentum can really solidify your progress. Are there any challenges or concerns you’ve encountered that we could discuss today?

User: Sometimes I worry about slipping back into negative thinking, especially when under pressure with schoolwork.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, and it’s normal to worry about it. Let’s explore some strategies to help you cope in those high-pressure moments. Would you be open to discussing some techniques?

User: Yes, I’d love that! I want to learn how to manage it better.

Consultant: One effective strategy is to practice mindfulness. This can help you stay grounded during stressful times. Have you tried any mindfulness exercises before?

User: Not really. I’ve heard of it but never practiced it.

Consultant: Mindfulness can be as simple as taking a few minutes to focus on your breathing or noticing your surroundings without judgment. Would you be interested in trying a short mindfulness exercise together during our session?

User: That sounds interesting! I’d like to try it.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a deep breath in… and out. Focus on how your breath feels. If any thoughts arise, acknowledge them, and gently bring your focus back to your breath.

User: This feels calming. I can see how it helps to clear my mind.

Consultant: Absolutely! Regularly practicing this can enhance your self-awareness and help manage negative thoughts. How do you think you could incorporate mindfulness into your daily routine?

User: I think I could set aside a few minutes each morning to do it. It might help start my day on the right foot.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Increasing this awareness from the start can really set a positive tone for your day. Is there anything else you feel you’d like to strengthen or explore?

User: I’d like to find more ways to reinforce my self-confidence, so I don’t slide back into old patterns.

Consultant: Building a strong foundation of self-confidence is key. We can work on setting small, achievable goals that will gradually build up your self-esteem. Is there a particular goal you have in mind?

User: I’d like to try taking more leadership roles in group activities at school.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic goal! Taking on more leadership will certainly help reinforce your confidence. How about we develop a plan for incremental steps to achieve that?

User: Yes, that would be very helpful!

Consultant: Let’s outline a few actions you can take. Perhaps you can start by volunteering for smaller roles this month and gradually aim for bigger responsibilities. How does that sound?

User: I like that! I can take small steps at first, then build up to bigger challenges.

Consultant: Exactly! And remember to celebrate your accomplishments, no matter how small they might seem. It’s important to recognize your progress. How do you feel about continuing to track your growth together?

User: That sounds great! I want to keep assessing my progress.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. Regular assessments will help reinforce the positive changes you're making. Before we wrap up today, do you feel you’ve received the support you were looking for in this session?

User: Definitely! I feel more positive and equipped to handle challenges.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, you’ve made significant progress, and I believe you’ll continue on this positive path. If you encounter any obstacles or need support in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate all the help and guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing more about your progress in our next session. Take care and keep up the great work!
