Consultant: Hello Hamid! It's great to see you today. I understand that you've been feeling quite angry and confused, especially after the recent conflict with your mother. Can you share a bit more about what’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. Yeah, I've just been really irritated and on edge, and I keep thinking about that argument with my mom. It feels like everything is just piling up on me, and I can’t concentrate on school at all.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Hamid. It seems like you're dealing with a lot of anger and frustration from that situation with your mother. What specifically about the conflict has been bothering you the most?

User: I don't know, it just feels like she doesn’t understand me at all. I try to explain how I feel, but it always ends up in a fight. I just want her to see my perspective.

Consultant: It makes sense that you'd feel frustrated when you don’t feel heard. That must be really exhausting. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come to mind when you think about these conflicts?

User: I guess I just think that she doesn't care about my feelings. I feel like I’m all alone in this and it makes me even angrier.

Consultant: Feeling alone can intensify those emotions. When you say she doesn’t care, is there a particular situation that led you to feel that way?

User: Well, the other day she just brushed off my concerns about school. I wanted to talk to her, but she was too busy with her work. It felt like I wasn’t important.

Consultant: I hear you. It’s hurtful to feel dismissed, especially when you’re trying to share something important. How do you think this impact your ability to focus on your studies?

User: It’s really hard for me to focus when I’m this angry. I just feel stuck, like every time I sit down to study, my mind starts racing with thoughts about how I’m feeling.

Consultant: It sounds really overwhelming. When those racing thoughts come up, do you notice any physical sensations along with them, like tension or restlessness?

User: Yes, I get really tense, and my heart starts racing. It’s like this knot in my stomach that won’t go away.

Consultant: That sounds uncomfortable. When you feel those sensations, what do you usually do to cope with them, if anything?

User: I usually just try to push through and ignore it, but it just makes everything worse. Sometimes I just end up snapping at my family or my friends, which makes me feel guilty afterward.

Consultant: It’s understandable that you’d want to push through those feelings, but it can lead to those outbursts. It seems like that guilt just adds to your frustration. What do you think would help you cope with those feelings differently?

User: I don’t know. Maybe if I could somehow calm down or distract myself? But it’s hard to stay focused on anything else when I’m feeling like this.

Consultant: That’s a good idea—finding ways to calm yourself might help. Have you ever tried any relaxation techniques before? Something simple like deep breathing or taking a short break?

User: I’ve heard of deep breathing, but I’ve never really tried it. I think I just forget to do things like that when I'm upset.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be really helpful in moments of anger. It’s a way to give your body a chance to relax. Would you be open to trying a simple breathing exercise together now?

User: Sure, I guess I could try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in together… hold it for a moment… and now breathe out slowly. You can do this a few times, focusing only on your breath. How does that feel?

User: It feels a bit calming, actually. I can feel the tension in my shoulders easing up a little.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Hamid. Breathing can be a really effective tool. We can practice this more in our sessions and even talk about how to use it when you start feeling angry or overwhelmed.

User: That sounds helpful. I’d definitely be open to that.

Consultant: Excellent! Recognizing these emotions is the first step. Let’s also discuss how to express your feelings to your mom more effectively. What do you think might happen if you tried to share your feelings with her using “I” statements, focusing on your experience rather than what she is doing?

User: I see what you mean. Instead of saying “You never understand me,” I could say “I feel misunderstood when…” That might help.

Consultant: Yes, that’s right! Framing it that way can reduce defensiveness on her side and open up a space for dialogue. How do you feel about trying this out the next time you talk to her?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think it could work. I just hope she listens.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous. Remember that you can control your own communication and responses, regardless of how she reacts. What’s important is that you express yourself. 

User: Yeah, I get that. I’ll try to remember that. 

Consultant: I’m proud of you for being willing to try, Hamid. As we move forward, let’s keep practicing both the breathing techniques and effective communication. This will help you manage your emotions and hopefully improve your relationship with your mom.

User: Thank you, that makes me feel a bit better. I like having some strategies to work on.

Consultant: Absolutely! I’m here to support you through this. Let's check in on your progress next time we meet. How are you feeling about everything we discussed today?

User: I feel like I have a bit more clarity. I want to work on my communication and managing my anger. 

Consultant: That’s a great mindset to have! Remember, it’s a journey, and I’ll be here to guide you along the way. Looking forward to hearing how it goes in our next session! 

User: Thanks again! I appreciate it. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Hamid. Take care and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Hamid! It's great to see you today. I want to check in with you about what’s been going on lately. How have you been feeling?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’ve been feeling really frustrated. I got criticized by my teacher for not completing my homework, and it just makes me feel like I can't do anything right in school.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like that criticism has really impacted your self-esteem and left you feeling incapable in your studies. Can you tell me a bit more about how that made you feel in the moment?

User: I just felt really angry and confused. It’s like no matter how hard I try, I always end up disappointing someone, and I don’t know what to do anymore.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially when you feel like you're putting in effort but not seeing progress. You mentioned feeling angry and confused—can you identify any specific thoughts you had while feeling that way?

User: I guess I thought to myself, “I’m such a failure” or “Why can't I just be better at this?”

Consultant: Those thoughts must be very challenging to deal with. It seems like you're being quite hard on yourself. Have you noticed how these thoughts affect your emotions when you’re in class or working on assignments?

User: Yes, when I think like that, it makes me even more stressed, and then I struggle to concentrate in class. It’s like I freeze and can’t absorb anything.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that, Hamid. Recognizing that connection between your thoughts and feelings is a significant step. Let’s explore those negative thoughts. What evidence do you have to support the idea that you’re a failure?

User: I mean, sometimes I do feel lost, and I can't keep up with my classmates. But, maybe I’ve done well in other subjects in the past.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to remember those past successes. What do you think has contributed to your achievements in those subjects? 

User: I guess I just found them interesting, and I worked harder at them. Maybe I need to find something about my classes that I can connect with.

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive approach. Finding something engaging in your classes can definitely help shift your perspective. How about setting a small goal for yourself this week? Maybe something that will allow you to explore what interests you in a particular subject?

User: I could try to ask a question in class or talk to someone about a topic I find interesting. That might make me feel better.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea, Hamid! Engaging with others can really enhance your understanding and confidence. How do you think you might feel after taking that step?

User: I think it could help me feel more involved, and maybe reduce my anxiety a bit.

Consultant: Absolutely! Taking that step can certainly build your confidence. Also, how do you feel about your relationships with your classmates? Is there something specific you wish to improve?

User: I find it hard to talk to them because I feel awkward a lot. I want to make friends, but I don’t know how to start a conversation.

Consultant: That’s a common feeling. Building friendships can sometimes feel intimidating. Are there any instances where you’ve had a positive interaction with your classmates?

User: Um, there was a time when I worked on a group project. We managed to get along, but it was just for that project. I think it was the shared work that helped.

Consultant: That’s a great sign! It indicates you can connect with others when you share a common goal. Maybe you can look for opportunities to engage in group activities again, as that might help ease starting conversations.

User: Yeah, that could work. I do like working in groups rather than alone.

Consultant: Perfect. Remember, taking small steps is key. You can start by initiating a conversation during group studies or asking a classmate how they approached a recent assignment. How does that sound?

User: It sounds less scary when I think about it like that. I'll give it a try.

Consultant: That's the spirit! And it's okay to feel uncertain as you take these steps. Remember to celebrate each small win and reflect on how you felt afterward. How do you plan to keep track of your progress?

User: I think I’ll keep a journal of my feelings and the interactions I have. That might help.

Consultant: Maintaining a journal is an excellent way to process your feelings and reflect on your interactions. It can also help you see your growth over time. As we wrap up today, what’s one takeaway you have from our session?

User: I feel like I have some ideas on how to be more positive and engage with my classmates. I guess I’m starting to see that I might not be a failure after all.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization, Hamid! You’re capable of much more than you give yourself credit for. Remember, it’ a journey, but I believe you can manage it well. When we meet next, we’ll look at how those conversations went and further explore your feelings. How does that sound?

User: Sounds good! Thank you for today. I feel a bit lighter now.

Consultant: You're welcome, Hamid! I'm glad to hear that. Take care, and I look forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Hamid! I’m glad to see you today. How are you feeling about your interactions with your classmates lately?

User: Hi. I'm feeling a bit uncertain. I had a positive experience working on a project with a classmate, but I'm still not sure how to maintain that connection. I don’t want to mess it up.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel uncertain after a positive experience. Let's explore what went well during that project for you. What did you enjoy about working with your classmate?

User: I liked that we could share ideas and help each other out. It felt good to have someone to collaborate with, but then I worry that I might annoy him or that he won't want to work with me again.

Consultant: Those feelings of worry are understandable. It seems like you're concerned about how your behavior might affect your relationships. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel like you might annoy him?

User: I guess I’m just afraid of talking too much or not being interesting enough. Sometimes, I think they may find me annoying or boring.

Consultant: That sounds tough, feeling like you might not be engaging enough. Let’s challenge that thought a bit. What evidence do you have that you’re annoying or boring to him?

User: I don’t know. Maybe it’s just my own negative thoughts. I often feel like I’m not as interesting as others.

Consultant: It’s common for us to compare ourselves to others, which can lead to negative thinking. How do you think you would react if a friend shared similar doubts about themselves?

User: I would probably tell them they’re being too hard on themselves and that everyone has something valuable to share.

Consultant: That’s a kind perspective! Maybe you can apply that same logic to yourself. What do you think you bring to the table in your interactions with others?

User: I guess I can be funny sometimes and I have good ideas for projects. I just need to remind myself of that.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing your strengths is an important part of building confidence. What small step do you think you could take to feel more comfortable when interacting with your classmates?

User: Maybe I could start by sharing a funny story next time or asking them about their interests. It might lighten the mood.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan, Hamid! Engaging in light conversation can help ease some of that tension. What do you think might happen if you took that step?

User: I think it might go well. It would make things feel more relaxed, and maybe we could connect better.

Consultant: Exactly! Creating a relaxed atmosphere can really help strengthen relationships. As you move forward with this, what do you think could help you combat the anxiety about reaching out?

User: Writing down some things I could talk about might help me feel prepared. I could also remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Preparing topics and being kind to yourself will definitely help. How can you remind yourself to practice self-compassion in those moments?

User: I might create a little reminder note to keep with me or set a goal for how I want to approach conversations each day.

Consultant: That sounds effective! Keeping a physical reminder can be a great tool. How do you feel about setting that goal for our next session?

User: I feel good about it. I think having some goals might motivate me to step out of my comfort zone.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Goals can be powerful motivators. What else can you do between now and our next session to reinforce these positive interactions?

User: I could try talking to a few more classmates casually and see how it goes. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Trying out your new skills in different contexts will help build your confidence. How do you think you would feel after trying those interactions?

User: I think I’d feel more accomplished and hopefully more comfortable, depending on how it goes.

Consultant: That sounds promising! Remember, each experience is a chance to learn, and progress takes time. Do you feel prepared to take on these challenges?

User: Yes, I actually feel a bit more excited about it now. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Hamid! I’m glad to hear that. Remember, you're doing your best, and that’s what matters. Make sure to reflect on your progress, whether it’s big or small. 

User: I will! I appreciate your support. I look forward to seeing how it goes.

Consultant: I look forward to hearing about your experiences as well! You've got this, and I'm here if you need to talk again. Take care until next time.

User: Thanks! I will. See you next session!
###################
Consultant: Hi Hamid! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello. I feel a bit better, but I still have doubts. I want to maintain this positive feeling from our recent group activities, but I'm worried that it won’t last.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have some doubts after experiencing a positive change. Can you tell me what specifically makes you feel worried about not being able to maintain this state?

User: I guess I’m afraid that if I go back to feeling angry or isolated, it will all just fall apart again.

Consultant: That fear can be quite overwhelming. So, maintaining your progress feels crucial to you. Have you noticed any specific triggers that lead you to feel angry or isolated?

User: Sometimes, when I argue with my mom or feel pressured at school, those feelings come back quickly.

Consultant: Those situations sound really difficult. It’s completely normal to feel a shift in your emotions during stressful interactions. How did you manage to enjoy those recent group activities despite these pressures?

User: During the group activities, I felt connected to others, and it was fun to actually cooperate with my classmates. It was nice to and forget about the stress for a bit.

Consultant: That sounds like a lovely experience! It seems like those positive connections really helped you. How can we build on that sense of connection to ease your concerns about returning to negative feelings?

User: Maybe I could try to focus on what felt good during those activities and remind myself of that when things get tough?

Consultant: Absolutely, focusing on those positive moments can be a great strategy. Can we work together to identify some specific thoughts or actions that made those group activities enjoyable for you?

User: I felt less judgment from others, and we were all just having fun. I guess I didn’t feel so pressured.

Consultant: It sounds like the absence of pressure allowed you to relax and connect. How might you recreate that kind of atmosphere in more challenging situations, like at school or home?

User: I think I need to remind myself that it’s okay to relax and not take everything too seriously. But sometimes, I don’t know how to do that in the moment.

Consultant: That's a great insight. Let's talk about some relaxation techniques that you can use when you start to feel that pressure again. Would you be open to trying some strategies to help you in those moments?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I think I need something to help me ground myself.

Consultant: Excellent! One technique is deep breathing. When you feel overwhelmed, take a moment to breathe in deeply through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. How does that sound to you?

User: I haven’t really tried that. I usually just feel like I need to keep things inside.

Consultant: That’s understandable, but taking a moment to breathe can help create space for your thoughts and feelings. Would you be willing to practice this technique when you start feeling pressured?

User: I can try, but I hope it works. 

Consultant: That’s a positive approach! Progress can take time, and it’s all about trying and adjusting. What’s one situation where you might want to practice this breathing technique soon?

User: Maybe when I have to discuss something tough with my mom again. It tends to get heated.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect scenario to practice. Before any discussion, take a few moments to breathe. This might help you approach the conversation with a calmer mindset. How do you feel about that idea?

User: It seems helpful. I think I can remember that.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let's also consider how you can remind yourself of the fun and connection you felt in group activities. What might be a good way to keep that in mind before facing a stressful situation?

User: Maybe I can take a note or a reminder on my phone to look at before I go into situations that make me anxious.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Creating visual reminders can be very effective. What would you write in that note to encourage yourself?

User: I could write something like, “Remember to breathe and have fun. It's okay to relax!”

Consultant: That sounds perfect! It emphasizes both relaxation and the joy you experienced. Do you feel ready to put this plan into action?

User: Yes, I think I can try both the breathing and the note. 

Consultant: Fantastic! It’s all about taking small steps towards emotional resilience. As we start to wrap up today, can we talk about how you feel about your progress so far?

User: I feel a little more confident. I think I have some tools to use when I need them.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Hamid! You’re developing the ability to manage your emotions and build connections, which is a huge step forward. How do you envision using these tools in your daily life?

User: I think I can use them in school, especially when I feel anger building up. Instead of reacting, I can try to take a breather.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! By taking a breather, not only do you give yourself a moment to calm down, but you also allow space for better responses. 

User: Yes, I can see how that could help.

Consultant: Great! And remember, it’s also okay to seek support from friends or activities when it feels overwhelming. As we conclude this session, what’s one takeaway you’ll carry with you?

User: Focusing on my breathing and remembering to enjoy the moments with others. 

Consultant: That’s a strong takeaway, Hamid. You’ve made great progress, and I’m proud of you. If you need more support, just know you can reach out anytime. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re welcome! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Hamid! I'm glad to see you today. I recall that you've started practicing regular exercise and meditation. How have those activities been going for you?

User: Hi! Yeah, I think they’ve helped a bit. I’ve started to feel some benefits, especially when I meditate. It feels nice to calm down and just breathe.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re beginning to notice some positive changes. Can you tell me how you feel right after you finish your meditation or exercise?

User: After I meditate, I feel more relaxed, like my mind is clearer. When I finish exercising, I feel energized, but sometimes the anger comes back quickly.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re experiencing relaxation and energy from these activities. The return of anger is something we can explore further. Let's think about what triggers those feelings after your moments of calm. What situations tend to bring that anger back for you?

User: Usually, it’s when I try to talk to my mom or when I'm around my classmates. There’s always tension, and I just can't handle it.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like interactions with your mom and classmates are really challenging for you right now. How do you tend to react in those moments when you feel that tension building up?

User: I usually get angry and say things I don’t mean. Then I feel guilty afterward, but I can’t help it at that moment.

Consultant: That’s a tough cycle to be in, feeling anger in the moment and then guilt afterward. Let’s think about your thoughts when you start feeling angry. What are some of the thoughts that go through your mind in those situations?

User: I often think that nobody understands me or that they are being unreasonable. It makes me feel like I have to defend myself.

Consultant: Those thoughts can indeed escalate the feelings of frustration. It's understandable to feel defensive when you think that way. Let’s challenge that a bit. Is there a way you might interpret those situations differently? What if you assumed they might not be trying to upset you?

User: I guess I haven’t really considered that. I just feel attacked and respond with anger. But maybe if I tried to think they’re not being mean on purpose, I could react differently.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Hamid! Recognizing that assumption can help create space for a different response. The next time you feel that tension, could you practice pausing for a moment and reminding yourself of this perspective?

User: Yeah, I could try that. I just need to remember to do it in the moment, which is usually the hardest part.

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s all about practice. Along with trying to shift your perspective, perhaps we can work on some strategies to help you pause and breathe before reacting. How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful. I just want to be able to control my emotions better.

Consultant: Aiming for better emotional control is a worthy goal! We can create a simple routine or cue to help you remember. For example, when you notice your anger rising, maybe you can take three deep breaths and count to five before responding. Would you be open to trying something like that?

User: I think I could, but I might forget when I’m really angry. 

Consultant: It’s common to forget in the heat of the moment. Perhaps we can establish a reminder—in the form of a sticky note or a phone reminder—so when you start your day, you have that prompt. Would that be feasible for you?

User: Yes, I can try using my phone for reminders. That might help me remember.

Consultant: That’s excellent! Technology can be a wonderful ally. Let’s also talk about reinforcing your motivations for these changes. What do you hope to gain from managing your anger better?

User: I just want to have better relationships and not feel so frustrated all the time. I don’t want to keep pushing people away.

Consultant: Those are meaningful goals. Focusing on improving relationships can be very motivating. Picture how it would feel to interact calmly with your mom or classmates. How would that change the dynamic for you?

User: It would feel much better. I’d probably feel less lonely if things weren’t so tense with them.

Consultant: That’s a positive visualization! Maintaining this focus on connection can help encourage you to practice your new skills. How about we set a goal for the upcoming week? You could aim to implement breathing exercises whenever you feel anger starting to rise.

User: That sounds doable. I’ll try to remember to use the breathing technique when I feel angry or worked up.

Consultant: Wonderful! As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what we’ve covered and your goal for next week. You’re focusing on using your breathing technique to manage anger and improve your relationships. How does that feel for you?

User: It feels good. I think having a plan will really help me. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a learning process, and it's okay to take it one step at a time. You have made significant progress already. If you find it tough, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today. I’m feeling a bit more hopeful.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Hamid! I'm proud of the effort you're putting in. Let’s continue building on this in our next session. Take care, and I look forward to seeing how you implement those skills!

User: See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Hamid! I'm really glad to see you here today. It sounds like you've been making some positive progress recently. How are you feeling about everything that's been happening?

User: Hi. Well, I feel better than before, but I still have some lingering frustration, especially with my teachers and classmates. I really want to improve my relationships, but I find it hard to communicate without feeling angry.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling better overall! It’s perfectly normal to still experience some frustration when trying to improve relationships, especially after recent conflicts. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes communication difficult for you?

User: I think I just get overwhelmed when talking to them. They say things that irritate me, and I react without thinking. I want to stay calm, but it’s hard.

Consultant: I can see how that could be frustrating for you. When you're feeling overwhelmed and that irritation arises, it makes sense you'd react quickly. Let's explore what kinds of thoughts are going through your mind in those moments. What do you usually think just before you feel that irritation building?

User: Usually I feel like they’re not listening to me or that they don't care about my opinions. It makes me angry and want to just shut down or yell sometimes.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It seems like you’re feeling undervalued in those interactions. When those thoughts pop up and you feel that anger, what emotions do you experience physically and mentally?

User: I guess I feel tight in my chest and I often get really hot-headed. It's like I'm ready to explode, and my mind just races with negative thoughts.

Consultant: It's understandable to physically feel those emotions, especially during intense interactions. Those symptoms can make it significantly harder to focus on a constructive conversation. Let's try to challenge those feelings a bit. What evidence do you have that supports the feeling that they don’t care about your opinions?

User: Well, they often interrupt me or don’t really validate what I say. It just feels like they don’t respect me.

Consultant: I see. It can be hurtful when we feel interrupted or invalidated. But maybe we can also think about times when someone did listen or showed respect. Can you recall any recent interactions where you felt heard? 

User: There was a time in class when one of my teachers actually asked for my feedback on a project. I felt good then, but it’s really rare.

Consultant: That’s a really positive example, Hamid! It shows that there are moments where you are acknowledged. Perhaps we can use that as a strategy to guide you in tougher situations. If you remind yourself of that experience, it might help soften those intense feelings. How does that sound?

User: Yeah, I think that would help. It’s just that in the moment, it’s hard to remember those good times.

Consultant: Absolutely. It’s normal to forget those moments when emotions run high. Let's consider a practical approach—what if you set a mental cue or mantra for yourself that you can recall when you start feeling that anger rise? It could help you pause and reflect.

User: That sounds like a good idea. Maybe something like “Stay calm” or “They might be listening?” 

Consultant: Those are perfect! Simple and effective. You could even write them down somewhere as a reminder. Would you feel comfortable trying that out in your classes this week?

User: Yes, I could do that. I really want to try and not let my anger control me.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset, Hamid. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to have ups and downs. After you implement this strategy, let's catch up and see how it went. How do you anticipate your next class interaction will be with this new approach in mind?

User: I hope it’ll be better. I don't want to react negatively, but I fear I might slip back into old habits.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. It takes time and practice. If you do find yourself slipping, it’s okay—just take a moment to breathe and remind yourself of your new strategies. It’s part of learning. What do you think you can do if you sense anger starting to build again?

User: Maybe... I could excuse myself for a moment to calm down. That might help.

Consultant: Great idea! Taking a brief break can really make a difference. So, as we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize. You have recognized the cycle of thoughts and feelings, challenged some of the negative beliefs about others, and created practical strategies for your interactions. How does that feel to have this plan moving forward?

User: It feels good! I really needed a plan to manage my emotions. I feel more prepared to handle my relationships better.

Consultant: I'm so proud of you, Hamid! You’ve made significant strides. Remember, the journey continues, and growth comes with time and practice. If you face challenges, just recall your strategies, and we can discuss them in our next session. I'm excited to hear how it goes!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’m going to put this into practice.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Hamid! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress. Take care, and see you next time!

User: Bye!
