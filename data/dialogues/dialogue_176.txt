Consultant: Hello, C! I'm really glad to see you today. Let's take some time to talk about your feelings. I understand you're going through a tough time lately. Can you share what’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I’ve just been feeling really overwhelmed and anxious. My parents are worried about my eyesight getting worse, and they talked about sending me to a blind school. I can't stand the thought of that. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough, C. It’s understandable to feel anxious about the idea of going to a blind school, especially when you’ve put in so much effort into your studies. Can you tell me more about how this makes you feel?

User: It makes me feel helpless and scared. I’ve worked hard in school, and I feel like if I go to that school, all my efforts will be wasted. It’s just so upsetting. I’ve been crying in class lately, and I don’t know how to handle all of this.

Consultant: I can see how distressing this situation is for you. It’s okay to feel upset, especially when facing big changes. Have you had a chance to talk to your parents about how you feel regarding this situation? 

User: No, not really. I just cry, and they get more worried. I don’t think they understand how I feel. I wish I could communicate better with them.

Consultant: Communication can be really hard, especially when emotions run high. It’s important that they hear your thoughts and feelings. How do you think they would react if you explained to them why you don’t want to go to the blind school?

User: I don’t know. I’m scared they’ll just think I’m being stubborn. But I really don’t want to go there. I just want to keep studying and do well.

Consultant: It sounds like you genuinely want to continue your studies and you have a strong determination. What do you think are the main reasons you want to stay at your current school?

User: I like my friends and the teachers here. I feel like I’m learning a lot. If I go to a new school, everything will change, and I might not be able to keep up.

Consultant: Those are very valid points, C. Friendships and a supportive learning environment are crucial for your development. Would you be open to exploring ways to express these feelings to your parents? 

User: Yeah, I think that would help. But I’m just not good at talking to them about my feelings.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way. We can practice together. How about we identify some key thoughts you want to share with them? What would you want them to understand about your situation?

User: I want them to know that I feel anxious and that I love my school and friends. I want to make them see that sending me away will just make things harder for me.

Consultant: That’s a great start, C. You’ve already articulated your feelings well. We can formulate this into a message. How about saying something like, “I love my current school, my friends, and learning here, and I feel worried that moving to a different school will make my anxiety worse”? 

User: Yeah, that sounds good. I can say that.

Consultant: Perfect! You can add how their support is important for you during this time. It might help them understand you're truly struggling and need their support. 

User: That makes sense. I’ll try to bring it up.

Consultant: Excellent, C. Remember, it’s about sharing your feelings, not just the problems. It’s expressing your need for understanding and support which is important. 

User: I really want them to support me more. Sometimes I feel so alone in all of this.

Consultant: Feeling alone can be really challenging, but you’re not alone in this. Speaking up will let them help you. Also, how are you managing your emotions during school with all this pressure? 

User: Not very well. I just cry when I can’t handle the pressure. It’s hard to focus on studying when I feel like I’m going to break down at any moment.

Consultant: It’s completely okay to cry. Crying can be a natural release of emotions. We can work on some strategies together to manage the pressure and find healthier outlets for your emotions. Would you be willing to try some techniques?

User: I think so. I just want to feel better about everything.

Consultant: One technique is to set aside a few minutes each day for reflection. You could journal about your day or practice deep breathing exercises when you feel overwhelmed. Have you ever tried journaling?

User: No, I haven’t. I’m not sure it would help, but I can try.

Consultant: It can be very helpful for many people. Writing down your thoughts allows you to express yourself without pressure. It can also clarify your feelings. Want to set a goal to try journaling for a few days and see how it feels?

User: Yeah, I can try that! Maybe it will help me get my thoughts out.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan. Additionally, you could set small, achievable study goals each day to help alleviate the pressure while keeping focus on your school work. 

User: That might help me a bit to break it down into smaller tasks. I’ll give it a try.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Each small step is a part of your progress. Before we wrap up today, how are you feeling about our conversation and the strategies we've discussed?

User: I feel a bit better. Talking about my feelings is hard, but I feel like I have a plan now.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, C. You’ve taken a significant step today by expressing your feelings and considering how to communicate with your parents. Just remember, it’s okay to take one step at a time. 

User: Thank you for helping me. I appreciate it a lot.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of you for being open about your feelings today. Remember, it’s okay to reach out when you need support. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.

Consultant: Hi there! I'm really glad to see you today. Let's start by talking about how you've been feeling lately regarding your studies and your relationship with your parents. 

User: Hi! I feel a bit more relaxed after talking to you last time, but I’m still really stressed about my studies. It seems like there’s so much pressure from my parents about my grades, and I’m scared I won’t be able to keep up.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling some relief, but the pressure around your studies is still quite heavy. What are some specific thoughts you have when you think about your grades or your parents’ expectations? 

User: Well, I often think that if I don’t get good grades, my parents will be disappointed in me. It makes me really anxious, and sometimes I wonder if it's worth all the stress. 

Consultant: I can see how that thought could create a lot of pressure for you. It must feel overwhelming. Do you ever find yourself thinking about what “good grades” really means or how your parents might actually feel if you communicated your struggles with them?

User: I guess I always just assume they will be upset. Last time, they asked me about my vision and how it affects my studies, but it was a bit awkward to explain. I worry they won't understand how hard it is for me. 

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. It can be tough to express our challenges, especially when we fear it won't be understood. Have you considered any ways to share your feelings with them? 

User: Not really. I feel like I might just end up crying or it would end up being an argument. I want to do well in school, but I also just want them to listen to me.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially if you're worried about their reaction. What if we explored some ways to communicate your feelings to them without feeling overwhelmed? 

User: I would like that. Something simple that doesn’t make it too emotional would help.

Consultant: Great! We can brainstorm ways to phrase what you want to say. Also, I'm curious—what are some strengths or interests you have outside of school that you enjoy? 

User: I like drawing and sometimes I write little stories. I feel a bit more confident when I’m creating something.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful outlets! Would you be open to focusing a bit more on those interests alongside your studies? It might help balance out the pressure. 

User: Yes, that sounds nice. I haven’t really had time for drawing lately, and I miss it.

Consultant: Let's think of a plan to include some drawing time into your week. How does setting aside even just 15-20 minutes a few times a week for your drawing sound? 

User: That could work! It would be nice to have a break to do something I enjoy.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it's important to give yourself that time to recharge. Now, returning to your schoolwork, can we explore any specific moments when you felt particularly confident or successful in your studies? 

User: I did well in a math test recently, which made me feel good, but it doesn’t always happen! 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic achievement! Let’s celebrate that success. When you think about that moment, what thoughts come to your mind? 

User: I thought I could keep up with my classmates and wasn't that far behind. 

Consultant: That's a positive thought to hold onto. How can we remind you of that feeling when you face challenges in the future? 

User: Maybe I could write it down or something? 

Consultant: Writing it down sounds like a great idea. It gives you something tangible to look back on. Do you think you could create a small note with that encouraging thought and put it somewhere visible?

User: Yes, I could do that. I’ll make it colorful too, so it stands out!

Consultant: I love that idea! It's fantastic to express positivity creatively. Lastly, as you prepare to talk to your parents about how you’re feeling, remember to keep your message clear and focused on your needs. How are you feeling about that? 

User: A bit nervous, but I think I can manage it. I really want them to understand me better.

Consultant: That’s a courageous step to take! It’s okay to feel nervous; just take it one step at a time. As we wrap up today, what are the most important things you feel you've taken away from this session? 

User: I think I’ve learned that it’s okay to share my feelings and that I have strengths outside of school. I want to try to balance things out.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful takeaway! Remember, taking those small steps is key. You're doing great, and I'm here to support you along the way. If you ever feel overwhelmed, come back and we can work through it together. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help and suggestions. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Keep nurturing your interests and practicing self-compassion. I look forward to seeing you again. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, C! I'm really glad you’re here today. I understand that you’ve made some positive changes and are looking to navigate this new social environment. How have you been feeling about your recent experiences with your peers?

User: Hi! I've been trying to join some club activities at school, which is a big step for me. But sometimes, I still feel a bit anxious when I meet new people and worry about whether they'll like me.

Consultant: It’s great to hear you’re stepping out of your comfort zone by joining clubs! It makes sense that meeting new people can cause anxiety. Can you describe a specific situation where you felt that anxiety?

User: Well, last week, I went to my first club meeting. I was really nervous, and I didn’t know what to say to the others. I just sat there and listened, but I felt like I missed a chance to connect with them.

Consultant: That sounds like a challenging situation for you. It’s understandable to feel that way when you’re in an unfamiliar environment. What thoughts were going through your mind when you were sitting there?

User: I kept thinking that I wouldn't fit in or that everyone would see how shy I am and not want to talk to me.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. Let’s explore them together. Do you think there’s any evidence to support the idea that others would reject you?

User: I guess not really. I mean, they didn’t seem unfriendly, but I just kept imagining the worst-case scenarios in my head.

Consultant: It’s common to have those worst-case thoughts, but they often don’t reflect reality. If a friend were in your position, what might you tell them to help them see it differently?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone is there to have fun and they shouldn't worry too much about fitting in.

Consultant: Exactly! You have a supportive view that could help you counter those negative thoughts. Let's try to apply that perspective to your experiences. Could you think of a small way to initiate a conversation next time?

User: Maybe I could ask someone about what they enjoy doing in the club. That sounds simple enough.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! Asking about their interests is an excellent way to start a conversation. How do you think you might feel if you were to try that?

User: I think I’d feel a little less anxious if I had a question ready. It would give me something to focus on instead of worrying.

Consultant: That’s a really constructive approach! Focus on the question you want to ask, and it might help shift your attention away from the anxiety. What else can you do to prepare for the next meeting?

User: I could practice what I might say or think of a few more questions in advance. That way, I won’t feel so lost when I get there.

Consultant: Great idea! Preparing in advance can build your confidence. As you prepare, it might help to remind yourself of the positive interactions you’ve had before. Have there been moments in the past when you felt good about talking to someone?

User: Yes, there was a time when I talked to a classmate about a project we were working on. I felt really good afterward because we connected over something we both liked.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful experience to hold onto! Reflecting on those positive moments can reinforce your confidence. What can you do to ensure you remember those experiences before you enter a new social situation?

User: I could write them down or think about them before going to the meeting. That might help me feel more positive overall.

Consultant: Absolutely! Creating a list of positive past experiences could serve as a great reminder of your abilities in social situations. Last time, we also talked about recognizing your improvements. Have you noticed any changes in how you interact since our last session?

User: I think I've been trying to participate more, even if it’s just smiling or greeting others. It feels good to be more involved.

Consultant: Those small actions are significant steps towards building connections! It shows your effort and willingness to engage. How do you perceive your progress so far in adapting to this new environment?

User: I feel like I’m trying harder, but I still get scared. I often question if I'm doing well enough or if people actually want me there.

Consultant: Those feelings of doubt are completely valid. It’s part of the process. Remember, it’s okay to have those doubts but try not to let them define your worth. You are actively participating, which is a victory in itself! Let’s work on a strategy to remind you of your worth and to counter those doubts when they arise.

User: Maybe I could repeat some positive affirmations to myself each day. That could help reinforce my self-belief.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Affirmations can help shift your focus and build a positive self-image. What kind of affirmations do you think would resonate with you?

User: I could say things like, “I am worthy of friendship” and “I can connect with others.” Those sound good.

Consultant: Those are powerful affirmations! Consider saying them each morning or whenever doubts creep in. Let’s summarize our session today; you’ve worked on preparing for social situations, engaging with positive experiences, and using affirmations. How do you feel about what we’ve accomplished?

User: I feel good about it! It’s nice to have a plan and strategies to work on. It makes me feel a bit more prepared.

Consultant: I’m really proud of you for taking these steps! As we wrap up, remember that it’s a journey, and every step counts. How would you like to keep track of your progress until we meet again?

User: I’ll keep a journal to note down my experiences and feelings after each meeting. It could help me see how much I’ve grown!

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! Keeping a journal can provide valuable insights. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Remember, you are capable, and I’m here to support you. Until next time, take care, C!

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident after those activities at school, but I still sometimes doubt my abilities. It's frustrating because I want to be good at organizing things.

Consultant: I'm really happy to hear that you've felt some confidence boost! It’s completely normal to have doubts, especially when you're stepping into new roles. Can you tell me more about what you've experienced in your recent activities?

User: Well, during the club activities, I discovered that I really enjoy organizing things. The feedback from my peers was positive, and it felt good to contribute. But then I question if that was just luck or if I'm really good at it.

Consultant: It's wonderful that you've found something you enjoy and received positive feedback. Let’s explore those doubts further. What specific thoughts go through your mind when you start to question your abilities?

User: I often think things like "What if I make a mistake?" or "Maybe they were just being nice." It’s like I can't accept that I did well.

Consultant: I see. Those thoughts of doubt can be very strong. When you say, "What if I make a mistake?" how does that make you feel in the moment?

User: It makes me really anxious, and I just want to hide or avoid situations where I might fail.

Consultant: That anxiety can be quite overwhelming. Let's try to challenge those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that suggests you might make a mistake, versus the evidence that you did well?

User: I guess the fact that I received praise and people seemed happy with my work. But I just keep focusing on the fear of messing up.

Consultant: It’s understandable to focus on the fear—it’s something many people experience. Let’s work on balancing that thinking. If a friend were to tell you they were afraid of making a mistake after doing something well, what would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on the positive feedback and that everyone makes mistakes sometimes.

Consultant: Exactly! You already have the tools to support someone else, and now it’s time to turn that kindness towards yourself. Can we try to rewrite that negative thought into a more positive and supportive one?

User: Maybe I could say, “I did well and even if I make a mistake, it’s a part of learning.”

Consultant: I think that’s a fantastic thought! It acknowledges your success while also accepting that mistakes are part of growth. How does that feel when you say it out loud?

User: It feels a bit reassuring; it’s nice to remember that it’s okay to not be perfect.

Consultant: That’s a great realization, and it’s a step toward self-acceptance. Let’s build on this newfound perspective. Have you thought about how you want to apply this thinking to your next group activity?

User: I think I should remind myself of this positive thought before starting. It might help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Setting that intention can make a big difference. How about we also identify a few specific actions you can take to reinforce your self-acceptance while participating?

User: I could write down the positive feedback I've received and keep it nearby for reminders. Also, maybe I can practice some team-building exercises, so I feel prepared.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Keeping reminders of your achievements can help boost your confidence, and practicing can help you feel more secure in your abilities. What else do you think could help maintain this positive mindset?

User: Talking to my friends about my progress and asking for feedback might help, too. I could use that to keep building my confidence.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Connecting with supportive peers can reinforce your skills and achievements. How do you feel about being able to approach them for that support?

User: I feel pretty good about it! I think it would help me a lot, especially since I tend to keep my thoughts to myself.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Opening up can be a powerful step toward feeling more secure in your abilities. Before we conclude, let’s take a moment to reflect on what you’ve learned today. What stands out to you?

User: I think recognizing my progress and being kinder to myself is really important. It's okay to have doubts, but they shouldn't control what I do.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve made significant strides today. Embracing both your strengths and uncertainties will help you grow. Moving forward, how do you plan to maintain this improved mindset?

User: I’ll continue to remind myself of my achievements and seek support from my friends when I feel doubtful. I can see that it helps.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy to keep your positive momentum going. You've worked hard to reach this point, and I believe you'll continue to do amazing things. Our time today has been really productive. If you ever feel you need support again, know that I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate our sessions and all the help. I feel ready to embrace my potential in the club and beyond!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of your progress, and I’m excited for the journey ahead. Take care, and remember to celebrate your successes!

Consultant: Hello, C! I'm so happy to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, especially after our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. I’ve been participating in more activities at school and I think it’s helping me connect with others better.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Engaging in activities can really help in building connections. What kinds of activities have you joined?

User: I started joining the art club and I even participated in a school competition. It was fun, and I felt proud of myself for trying something new.

Consultant: That's fantastic, C! It’s great to hear you’re trying new things. How did it feel to compete in the school competition?

User: I was really nervous at first, but once I started, I felt more confident. I even managed to make some friends there.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience was both challenging and rewarding for you! Making friends through shared interests can be really beneficial. How have these new friendships affected your feelings about school or yourself?

User: I feel less lonely and more included. It’s nice to have people to talk to and share things with. I actually find myself smiling more.

Consultant: That’s a great improvement! It seems like your social interactions are having a positive impact on your mood. What do you think has been the most important change for you?

User: I think it’s just being more open to trying new things and not being afraid. I feel like I’m slowly becoming more confident in myself.

Consultant: That’s an important realization, C! Building confidence can really help in facing challenges. When you think about future challenges, do you have any specific strategies in mind to maintain this confidence?

User: I want to keep pushing myself to join more groups and not shy away from new opportunities. That’s my plan!

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Facing new opportunities head-on can really help solidify your confidence. Is there anything you feel might challenge that confidence moving forward?

User: Sometimes I worry that if I fail at something, it’ll make me feel bad. I don’t want to go back to how I felt before.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to have those fears, C. How about we explore ways to cope with those feelings in case you face a setback? 

User: That would be helpful. I don’t want to feel discouraged again.

Consultant: Let’s discuss the strategies that have worked for you before. What have you done in the past to help yourself when you felt down?

User: I used to talk to my grandma when I felt bad. She was really good at listening and helping me see things differently.

Consultant: That’s a lovely strategy! Having someone to talk to can make a big difference. Would you consider reaching out to her again if you felt down in the future?

User: Yes, I think I would. She always knows how to make me feel better.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! And aside from talking to your grandma, we can also think of some self-soothing techniques together. What activities help you feel relaxed?

User: Drawing really helps me. When I draw, I can forget about everything else for a while.

Consultant: Drawing is a wonderful tool for self-expression and relaxation! How about setting aside time each week to focus on your art? 

User: Yes, I’d love that! I’ll try to make it a habit.

Consultant: Perfect! Creating a routine can really aid in maintaining your mental well-being. Before we wrap up, let’s summarize the progress you’ve made. How do you feel about your journey so far?

User: I feel really proud of myself. I’ve opened up and tried new things, which is a big step for me.
