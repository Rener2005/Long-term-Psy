Consultant: Hello Brenda! I'm glad you could make it today. I remember from our last session that you've been experiencing some distressing auditory hallucinations. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi. Well, it's been tough. I still hear those voices, and they keep telling me awful things. It's really frightening. Sometimes I feel like I'm losing my mind.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly distressing, Brenda. It's understandable to feel scared when you're experiencing something like that. Can you share more about what these voices say to you?

User: They often say that I'm worthless and that I'm alone. It makes me feel so helpless and trapped. 

Consultant: Those messages from the voices sound very harsh and painful. It’s normal to feel overwhelmed by them. Let's explore that a bit—what kind of emotions do you feel when you hear those voices?

User: I feel anxious and sometimes even a bit angry for no reason. I just wish they would stop.

Consultant: I can only imagine how frustrating that must be for you. You mentioned feeling anxious. Can you identify any thoughts that come up when you’re experiencing those emotions? 

User: I often think about how alone I must be and that maybe I deserve this. 

Consultant: It’s really tough when those kinds of thoughts arise. Let’s take a closer look at that thought: "maybe I deserve this." What kind of evidence do you have that supports that belief? 

User: I don't know... sometimes it just feels true when I listen to the voices.

Consultant: It’s a common response when dealing with distressing experiences. But let’s think critically about it. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them? 

User: I would tell them they don’t deserve to feel this way, that it’s not their fault. 

Consultant: Exactly, Brenda. It’s important to apply that same compassion to yourself. Since the voices are telling you negative things, it's possible they are not a true reflection of your worth. How does that realization make you feel? 

User: It feels a bit comforting, but then I worry that the voices might be right after all.

Consultant: It's understandable to have doubts, especially when the voices feel so real. Let’s challenge that fear—what are some positive things about yourself that you know to be true? 

User: I’ve spent my life helping others as a teacher, and I have a family that loves me. 

Consultant: Those are significant points, Brenda. Your contributions and the love of your family are valuable, and they don’t change because of the voices. Can we agree that those things have merit regardless of what the voices say? 

User: Yes, that makes sense. 

Consultant: Great! Now, when the voices come back, how could you remind yourself of those positive aspects? 

User: I could think about my family and maybe even repeat some positive affirmations to myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach! Affirmations can help dampen the impact of negative thoughts. Let's think of some you can use. What’s one phrase you could say to remind yourself of your worth? 

User: "I am loved and I have value." 

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation, Brenda. Whenever you hear those voices, try repeating that to counter their messages. Let’s also consider some coping strategies when you feel overwhelmed. What have you tried so far?

User: I usually just try to distract myself with TV or reading.

Consultant: Distraction can be helpful in the moment. What about activities that engage both your mind and body? Have you thought about going for a walk or trying a new hobby?

User: I haven't done much physical activity lately. A walk might help clear my mind.

Consultant: Absolutely! Physical activity can have a lasting impact on mood and clarity. Let’s plan at least a short walk into your routine this week. 

User: I think I can do that. It’s just hard to make myself go outside sometimes.

Consultant: It’s understandable. Perhaps we can set a small goal, like stepping outside for just five minutes? Once you start, it may feel easier to continue.

User: That sounds doable. 

Consultant: Wonderful, Brenda! Also, as we progress, remember to keep tracking how you feel during these walks and after facing the voices. It’s a valuable way to reflect and understand your emotional patterns.

User: Okay. I’ll try to do that.

Consultant: Great progress today, Brenda! Before we finish, let’s summarize what you’ve learned. You’ve identified some key thoughts and a positive affirmation to combat the negative voices, and you’ll also incorporate walks. How are you feeling about all this?

User: I feel a little more hopeful, but I still wish I could make the voices stop for good.

Consultant: It's normal to hope for full relief, and acknowledging that it's a process is important. We can continue to work on it together. Remember, it’s okay to feel what you’re feeling, and you're not alone in this journey. 

User: Thank you. That means a lot.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Brenda. I look forward to hearing how things go in our next session. Take care of yourself, and see you soon!

Consultant: Hello Brenda! It's great to see you today. I know we’ve been exploring the topic of your auditory hallucinations in our previous sessions. How have you been feeling about that recently?

User: Hi. I've been having some wavering feelings. On one hand, I know the sounds aren’t real, but they still frighten me. I find myself questioning their validity more than before.

Consultant: It sounds like there’s a mix of understanding and fear. It's a challenging space to navigate. What specific thoughts or experiences have made you question the validity of these sounds lately?

User: Sometimes, they seem to say things that align with my fears or worries. For instance, I’ve heard something that makes me feel like my family is upset with me.

Consultant: Hearing something that resonates with your worries can be really distressing. Can you recall what exactly those voices said that alarmed you, and how they made you feel at that moment?

User: They mentioned that my family thinks I’m a burden, and it made me feel very lonely. I tried to brush it off, but it sticks with me.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel lonely after hearing something like that—those thoughts can really weigh us down. Let’s explore that thought for a moment. What evidence do you have that your family feels that way about you?

User: They’ve never outright said it, but sometimes I catch them looking at me with concern, and I wonder if it has to do with me needing help.

Consultant: It’s common to interpret concern as a negative judgment, especially when we’re feeling vulnerable. If you stepped outside of those feelings for a moment, how might your family actually feel about you and your situation?

User: I think they actually care for me. They often reach out to check on me, but sometimes I just get lost in my worries.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! It seems like there’s a part of you that recognizes their care. When you hear those voices, you have the chance to challenge that concern with the facts of their actions. How does that perspective feel to you?

User: It feels a little comforting when I think about it that way. But it’s still hard in the moment when I hear those voices.

Consultant: That makes sense. It can be very tough in the moment. Would you be open to exploring some strategies to remind yourself of this perspective when those thoughts arise again?

User: I’m open to that. I want to feel more in control.

Consultant: Great! One technique could be to create a brief statement to remind yourself of your family's love and support. Can you think of something positive they’ve said or done that can counter the negative voice?

User: My daughter always tells me how much I mean to her and that I brought her up well. I could use that.

Consultant: That sounds like a beautiful reminder! Creating a positive affirmation based on that could help ground you when the voices arise. Would you like to try formulating one now together?

User: Sure! Maybe something like, "My family loves me and appreciates everything I've done for them."

Consultant: That’s perfect! You can repeat that to yourself whenever you hear the negative voices speaking. It can serve as a counterbalance. How do you think you’ll feel when you use this affirmation in those moments?

User: I hope it helps me focus on the reality rather than the fear.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! With practice, it can become a powerful tool for shifting your focus. Would it help to talk about any situations when you might want to use this affirmation?

User: Yes, like when I'm alone at home and the voices come. I tend to feel the strongest fear then.

Consultant: It’s great that you identified a specific situation. Would it be useful to set a little reminder for yourself? Perhaps a note where you can see it often to reinforce that positive message?

User: Yes, I could put a note on my fridge. That way, I see it every day.

Consultant: That sounds like an effective plan! It reinforces your support system regularly. Over time, being consistent with this practice can help decrease the emotional weight of those voices. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good. I feel a bit more hopeful about it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s a process, and it’s perfectly normal to take it one step at a time. Are there any other thoughts or feelings you’d like to address today regarding the hallucinations?

User: I think that's all for now, but I appreciate discussing the affirmation. I feel more empowered.

Consultant: You’re doing wonderfully, Brenda. It's crucial to recognize your strength and progress. As we wrap up, how can you maintain this newfound empowerment in your day-to-day life?

User: I will practice the affirmation daily and remind myself of my family’s love.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Let’s continue to build on that in our future sessions. Remember, I’m here to support you as you navigate these feelings. You can always discuss your experiences in the next meeting. How do you feel about our conversation today?

User: I feel relieved and more open than before. Thank you for helping me.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Brenda! I look forward to hearing more about your progress. Take care, and remember to be gentle with yourself.

Consultant: Hello Brenda! I'm glad to see you today. I remember that last time we talked about your experiences with hearing voices and how important it is for you to share this with your family. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi. I've been trying to open up more to my children about the voices I've been hearing. It feels both scary and relieving to talk about it, but sometimes I'm not sure how to bring it up.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're making progress in sharing your experiences. It's normal to feel uneasy about discussing sensitive topics. Could you tell me more about what specifically makes it difficult to bring it up with them?

User: I worry they might think I'm losing my mind or that they won't understand. I don't want to add to their stress or worry them too much.

Consultant: That’s a very valid concern, Brenda. It sounds like you care deeply about how they perceive you and their feelings towards your situation. What would make you feel more comfortable discussing it with them?

User: I think if I could explain the voices more clearly and share how it affects my daily life, they might understand better. But I'm still unsure about the right words to use.

Consultant: That’s a thoughtful approach. Perhaps we could work on some strategies to help you articulate your feelings and experiences. How do you usually feel when you hear the voices?

User: It can be really overwhelming. Sometimes it feels like they are talking directly to me, and I get anxious because I don’t know if what I hear is real or if I’m just imagining things.

Consultant: I understand that it must be incredibly disconcerting for you. Let’s take some time to identify the emotions tied to those experiences. When the voices come, what thoughts do typically accompany those feelings of anxiety?

User: I often think that I must be going crazy or that something is really wrong with me. It creates a cycle of fear and confusion in my mind.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really challenging and can certainly create that cycle you’re describing. Would you be open to exploring some other possible explanations for those voices, perhaps separating the reality from your fears?

User: Yes, I think that would help. I want to understand if there's a different perspective I could take.

Consultant: That's a wonderful mindset! Let's start by questioning those thoughts. What evidence do you have that suggests you are losing your sanity? Have you noticed any patterns in when the voices occur?

User: I notice they often come when I’m feeling lonely or when it’s quiet at home. I guess that makes sense, but I still freak out sometimes.

Consultant: It seems loneliness might be a trigger for you. Acknowledging that can be significant. If a friend was experiencing similar thoughts, how would you encourage them to look at this?

User: I’d probably tell them it’s okay to seek help and share what they’re going through. I wouldn’t want them to feel alone.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective, Brenda. You’re already providing yourself wise advice. Let's work towards applying that same kindness toward yourself. What small step could you take to communicate with your family about your experience?

User: Maybe I could write down my thoughts first. That way, I can organize what I want to say clearly before talking to them.

Consultant: Writing down your thoughts sounds like a great strategy. It can help you feel more prepared and less anxious. How do you feel about approaching them with this written note?

User: I think it might make it easier. I can express myself without the immediate pressure of a conversation.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach, Brenda. You’re giving yourself the space to communicate your feelings on your own terms. How do you think they would respond to you sharing your feelings in this way?

User: I hope they’d be understanding. They've always been loving and supportive, so I think it could go well.

Consultant: It sounds like you have a strong support system with your family, and it's clear they care about you deeply. Would you like to discuss how to handle any potential negative reactions, just in case?

User: Yes, that would be helpful. I want to be prepared for any doubts they might have.

Consultant: That’s a wise consideration. One way to prepare for their doubts is to reassure them that what you’re experiencing feels real to you, even if it seems unusual. How does that sound to you?

User: That resonates with me. I can explain that just because they don’t hear it, it doesn’t mean it’s not real for me.

Consultant: Exactly, Brenda! You are highlighting the importance of your experience and validating your feelings. I believe this approach will bring you closer to your family. 

User: I feel more confident about discussing this. I also realize I need to be patient with them in understanding.

Consultant: That's a great realization, Brenda. Patience is essential in these conversations. Would you like to set a timeframe for when you might feel ready to have this discussion?

User: Maybe by the end of this week? I think I could write down what I want to say before then.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! By the end of the week you will have had time to reflect and prepare. Remember, it's okay to take your time. 

User: Thank you. This makes me feel more at ease about the whole idea of sharing my feelings.

Consultant: You're doing a wonderful job, Brenda. I want you to remember this feeling of progress and confidence. How will you remind yourself to stay positive as you approach this conversation?

User: I might keep a little reminder in my notebook to encourage myself. Maybe something like “Your feelings matter” or “It's okay to seek support.”

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Keeping those affirmations close can help you manage any anxiety that arises. You’re not alone in this process; your family wants to support you.

User: Thank you for helping me feel understood and for giving me tools to manage this better.

Consultant: It’s truly my pleasure, Brenda. I'm so glad to have this opportunity to support you. Remember, you have made significant strides today. Do you have any lingering thoughts or feelings before we wrap up?

User: I just feel grateful for being able to talk this through. I appreciate your guidance and understanding.

Consultant: I appreciate your openness and commitment to this journey, Brenda. You've made incredible progress. Whenever you're ready, I look forward to our next session. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello Brenda! I'm really glad to see you again. It sounds like you've been gaining some valuable insights from your support group recently. How are you feeling about everything?

User: Hi! Yes, I’ve felt more comfortable sharing my experiences with my peers. They really understand what I'm going through with the hallucinations, and it’s been quite reassuring.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Having a supportive group can make a significant difference. Can you share what specific aspects of this understanding from your peers have made you feel more at ease?

User: Well, just knowing that I'm not alone in this makes a big difference. When someone else shares their experiences with similar issues, I feel more validated. It helps to know that there are others who have faced the same challenges.

Consultant: It sounds like connection and validation are key elements for you. How does this change your perspective on your own experiences with hallucinations?

User: I’ve started to think of my hallucinations as less terrifying because others have spoken about their strategies for dealing with them. It feels like I have tools now—it's not just something I have to suffer through alone.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift! Using the insights gained from others can indeed empower you. What strategies have you heard about that you find particularly helpful or that you’d like to try?

User: One person spoke about grounding techniques, like focusing on their breathing or identifying objects around them. I think I’d like to practice that more regularly.

Consultant: Grounding techniques can be very effective. It’s about bringing your attention back to the present moment. Let’s explore how you can incorporate that into your daily routine. What times in your day feel most challenging for you when these hallucinations arise?

User: Usually, it’s in the late afternoon or evening when I’m alone at home. That’s when the thoughts become louder, and it’s hard not to feel anxious about it.

Consultant: I see. Those times can be quite isolating. Let’s think about creating a plan for those specific times. How about setting reminders to practice breathing exercises or grounding techniques during those periods? 

User: That sounds like a good idea! I could set alarms on my phone to remind me to focus on my breathing.

Consultant: Excellent! Having those reminders in place could make a big difference. Also, it could be helpful to incorporate some of the positive experiences from your support group into those moments. Would you feel comfortable reaching out to a group member during those times?

User: Yes, I feel like I could definitely do that. It’s nice to think I wouldn't be alone if I reached out.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea, Brenda. Connecting with someone when you feel overwhelmed can provide immediate support. How do you think this approach will help in managing your feelings?

User: I think knowing I can express my feelings and hear someone else's voice could calm me down. It puts me back in a more positive mindset.

Consultant: That’s great insight! Let’s keep working on reinforcing this support system you’re building. How about we set some goals for the week? 

User: Sure! Maybe I can aim to practice my breathing techniques each day and check in with a group member at least twice this week.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! It will be beneficial to track your feelings before and after these practices. Do you have a way to keep a small journal about your experiences?

User: I have a notebook that I could use for that. I can write down my thoughts and how I feel before and after using the techniques!

Consultant: Perfect! Journaling can provide valuable insights into your progress and also serve as a tool for reflection. What do you feel is the most significant thing you've experienced since joining the support group?

User: I think the biggest change for me is feeling less shame about my condition. Sharing my experiences makes me feel more normal, and I know others are rooting for me.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful realization, Brenda. Shame can often exacerbate feelings of isolation, but your openness is fostering support and understanding. How do you want to build on this progress as you continue?

User: I think I want to keep being open about my experiences and encourage others to share too. It feels good to create that environment of trust.

Consultant: That’s an inspiring outlook! Your willingness to share can significantly impact not only your journey but also your peers’. As we wrap up today, what’s one takeaway you want to focus on moving forward?

User: I want to focus on using my coping strategies and continuing to foster connections with others. It’s nice to feel empowered to handle my situation.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic takeaway! You've done great work, Brenda, and I believe in your ability to manage your experiences. Remember, it’s okay to reach out for support whenever you need it. Looking forward to hearing how your week goes in our next session!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I feel more hopeful about the future now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care, and I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello Brenda! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hello! I've been feeling better, actually. It seems like my daily routine is more stable now. The auditory hallucinations have also been less intrusive lately.

Consultant: That's encouraging to hear! It sounds like you've been establishing a positive structure in your life. Can you share more about how your daily activities have contributed to feeling more in control?

User: Well, I've been participating in online activities, which keeps me engaged. I’ve also made it a habit to follow a routine that includes exercise and reading. These activities seem to help.

Consultant: It's great that you are involved in activities that bring you joy and structure. How does participating in these activities affect your experience with the auditory hallucinations?

User: I think keeping busy has distracted me from the hallucinations. When I'm focused, I notice them less and they don't bother me as much.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. It seems that when you are engaged in fulfilling activities, the hallucinations hold less power over you. Can you tell me what you think is happening during those moments when you feel more in control?

User: During those moments, I feel that I can direct my attention as I wish. It’s like I have a choice to ignore what I hear, which is a relief.

Consultant: Having that sense of agency is essential, Brenda. It sounds like you are developing effective coping strategies. Are there moments when you still struggle with the hallucinations despite your routine?

User: Sometimes, especially when I'm by myself in the evening. That's when I feel more vulnerable, and the sounds can become overwhelming.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. It’s important to recognize those triggers. How do you usually respond when the hallucinations become overwhelming during those quieter times?

User: I usually try to distract myself with music or a book, but sometimes it doesn’t work, and I end up feeling anxious.

Consultant: I see. It’s understandable to feel anxious in those moments. Let’s explore those situations further. Can you identify any specific thoughts that cross your mind when you start to feel anxious in the evening?

User: I often think things like “What if this never goes away?” or “Why is this happening to me?” It makes it hard to stay calm.

Consultant: Those thoughts can indeed create a loop of anxiety. What evidence do you have that supports those thoughts? Are they based on past experiences or more on fear of the unknown?

User: I guess they are more fears than anything. I’ve managed so far, but it’s hard to remember that in the moment.

Consultant: You're recognizing an important pattern here. It’s common for our minds to turn to worst-case scenarios, especially when we feel vulnerable. What might change if you were to challenge those thoughts, perhaps by reminding yourself of your successes so far?

User: That could help, I think. If I remind myself that I’ve coped with these symptoms for a while, it might make the fear feel less intense.

Consultant: Absolutely. It sounds like an empowering approach. We can also try some strategies to gradually engage with those feelings of fear, reducing their intensity. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds useful. I’d like to try that. I want to be more in control of my responses.

Consultant: That's a wonderful goal! We can develop a plan for those evening times when you feel more anxious. What would you be willing to try when the feelings start to arise?

User: Maybe I could set aside specific quiet time for meditation or mindfulness exercises. That might help center me.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent idea, Brenda. Mindfulness can help anchor you in the present. Would you be open to practicing this technique together to build your confidence?

User: Yes, I think that could be very beneficial. I could also practice it during the day to prepare.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let’s structure a simple mindfulness exercise you can use. You can start with focusing on your breath—taking a deep breath in and slowly out. How does that sound as a starting point?

User: That sounds doable. I’ll give it a try and see how I feel afterward.

Consultant: Great! Remember to be gentle with yourself during this process. It's okay to have ups and downs. This mindfulness practice is about building a toolkit for those challenging moments.

User: Yes, I appreciate that. I have a lot to think about, but I feel more hopeful after discussing this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear you feel hopeful! It’s a significant step forward. Let’s also plan to review how this practice is going in our next session. How does that sound to you?

User: That works for me. I’ll write down my experiences and we can talk about them.

Consultant: Perfect! I look forward to hearing about your experiences. Before we end today, is there anything else on your mind that you'd like to discuss?

User: No, I think we’ve covered everything important. Thank you for your guidance!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Brenda! It's been a pleasure talking with you today. Remember, you’re making great progress—trust in your journey. I'll see you next time!

User: Thank you! I’ll see you then!
###################
Consultant: Hello Brenda! It's wonderful to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite stable, actually. The support from my family has been really helpful, and I've noticed that the occurrences of my auditory hallucinations have decreased. 

Consultant: That's great to hear, Brenda! It sounds like you're experiencing a positive shift in your emotional state. What do you think contributed the most to this improvement?

User: I believe the changes I've made in my daily routine and having my family by my side has made a big difference. They help me stay engaged and distracted from negative thoughts. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Maintaining a positive support system can have a huge impact. Can you share a bit more about the specific changes or activities that you found helpful?

User: For instance, I've started taking short walks in the park every afternoon. It's calming, and it gives me a chance to enjoy nature. I also try to spend more time with my grandchildren, which really brings me joy.

Consultant: Walking in the park and spending time with your grandchildren sound like wonderful strategies for enhancing your mood. How do these activities influence your experiences with the auditory hallucinations?

User: They distract me from the hallucinations. When I’m engaged with my family or focused on my surroundings during walks, I tend to think less about the sounds I hear.

Consultant: That's a valuable insight. Engaging in activities and spending time with loved ones can certainly help in managing those experiences. Have you noticed any specific times when the hallucinations tend to appear more frequently?

User: They usually come when I'm alone or feeling particularly stressed. However, I’m noticing that it's happening less often now.

Consultant: It sounds like you're becoming more aware of the triggers. That’s an important step! When you do experience these hallucinations, what strategies have you implemented to cope with them?

User: I try to remind myself that they are not real and focus on my breathing to stay calm. Talking to my family help too, if they are around.

Consultant: Those are effective techniques, Brenda. Grounding yourself through deep breathing and reality-checking your experiences can make a significant difference. As we look ahead, are there any specific areas you feel you might need further support with?

User: I think I still need some guidance on how to handle those moments when my family isn’t around. It can feel overwhelming at times.

Consultant: That’s a very valid concern. Developing self-soothing strategies could be beneficial for those moments of solitude. Would you be open to exploring some additional coping techniques together today?

User: Yes, I would like that. I want to be more prepared for those situations.

Consultant: Excellent! One technique we could explore is progressive muscle relaxation. This involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups, which could help ease tension when you feel anxious or overwhelmed. Would you like to give it a try?

User: I’ve never heard of that before, but I’m willing to try. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s walk through it together. First, find a comfortable position—maybe sit or lie down. Once you're settled, take a deep breath in… and let it go. How are you feeling so far?

User: I feel a little relaxed just thinking about it.

Consultant: That’s a good start! Now let’s take it step by step. Start by tensing the muscles in your feet for a few seconds. Really engage those muscles. Do you feel the tension?

User: Yes, I do.

Consultant: Excellent! Now, relax those muscles completely and notice the difference. How does that feel?

User: It’s a nice release. 

Consultant: Perfect! Now let’s move on to your calves. Tense them, hold for a moment, and then release. Just focus on how it feels to let go of that tightness. 

User: Okay, I'm doing that now. 

Consultant: Great job! Just remember, you can do this with any muscle group, and incorporating it whenever you feel the onset of stress can be very helpful. Does this technique feel manageable to integrate into your routine?

User: Yes, I think I can definitely fit this in, especially when I'm alone.

Consultant: Wonderful to hear! As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on your progress. What do you see as your main achievements since we began our work together?

User: I feel more in control of my emotions, and I’ve learned to manage the hallucinations better. I also appreciate the support from my family more than before.

Consultant: That’s an incredible realization! It sounds like you’ve made significant strides in both emotional regulation and your perspective on support. As you move forward, what do you think will be essential to keep this momentum going?

User: Staying active and engaged with my family, and practicing the techniques we discussed.

Consultant: Absolutely! Continuing these positive behaviors will be key to maintaining your progress. It’s been a pleasure working with you, Brenda. Remember that you have the skills you've developed, and you can always reach out if you need additional support in the future.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care and enjoy the moments with your loved ones. Until next time!
