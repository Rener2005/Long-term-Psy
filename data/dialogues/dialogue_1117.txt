Consultant: Hello, Amei! I'm glad you're here for our session today. I know you've been feeling lost and struggling with a sense of worth lately. How have you been feeling since our last talk?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling pretty overwhelmed. I still feel like I don’t have any direction, especially with school pressure and my uncertainty about the future. I just wish I could feel better about my life.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really grappling with these feelings of being overwhelmed. Let's dive a bit into what specifically feels overwhelming for you right now. What aspects of school or your future are weighing on your mind the most?

User: I just feel like everything is piling up—the coursework is tough, and I keep thinking about what I want to do after graduation. I often find myself asking if I can even make the right choices since my parents never really made any plans for themselves.

Consultant: That must be really challenging, feeling pressure from both your coursework and uncertainty about the future. It's understandable to question your decision-making abilities, especially considering your background. What thoughts run through your mind when you contemplate your future?

User: I think about how I'd like to have a fulfilling life or career, but then I get stuck. I feel like I don't have the skills or the right guidance to figure things out. Sometimes, I just wish I could escape from these thoughts.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way, especially during such a pivotal time in your life. You mentioned wanting to escape those thoughts—do you notice any specific situations or thoughts that trigger those feelings most intensely?

User: Yes, it usually happens when I’m studying or trying to plan my schedule. I freeze and think I’m not cut out for this. I sometimes even feel like I should just give up and do something simple, but then I regret that.

Consultant: I see how distressing that can be, feeling stuck in a cycle of negative thinking. Let's try to identify the specific thoughts that come up during those moments. Can you recall any automatic thoughts you have when you feel like giving up or when you think you’re not good enough?

User: I often think things like “I’ll never succeed” or “I don’t have what it takes to move forward.” Those thoughts make me feel even more lost.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very heavy and negative. Let’s challenge those a bit—what evidence do you have that supports those thoughts? And conversely, is there any evidence that might suggest you *do* have what it takes?

User: Well, I did manage to pass my exams last semester, and there have been times when I was able to help others with their studies. But that doesn’t seem to matter to me when I feel this way.

Consultant: It’s great that you were able to recognize those accomplishments! Often, we focus so much on our doubts that we overlook our successes. If a friend felt how you’re feeling right now, what would you advise them?

User: I’d probably tell them to focus on their strengths and not to be too harsh on themselves. I don’t know why I can’t apply that advice to myself.

Consultant: It can be tough to extend the same compassion to ourselves that we so easily give to others. Let’s work on that! How would it feel to start recognizing and affirming your strengths more often? 

User: It might help, but it’s hard to break that habit of self-criticism. 

Consultant: Absolutely, it takes time. We can create a small practice that helps you acknowledge your strengths daily. This could be as simple as keeping a journal where you write down one positive thing about yourself each day. Would you be open to trying something like that?

User: That sounds doable! I think I can manage to write one thing each day. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Also, let’s think about setting small, achievable goals for your studies or future plans. What’s one small step you’d like to take this week that could help in your studies or provide some direction?

User: I think I want to organize my study schedule better, maybe break it down into smaller tasks instead of just one big pile of work to tackle.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Breaking tasks into smaller steps can make them feel much less daunting. How can I support you in setting up that schedule?

User: Maybe you could help me brainstorm how to prioritize what I should study first? 

Consultant: Of course! Let's think about your subjects and the deadlines coming up. Is there one subject that feels more urgent or more challenging than the others?

User: I have a big paper due for history and a few readings for literature. History feels more pressing since the due date is closer. 

Consultant: Focus on that history paper first then! Let’s outline a plan for breaking it down into smaller parts. What are the steps you need to take to start working on it?

User: I need to gather my notes, write an outline, and then start drafting. 

Consultant: Great! Those are clear steps. How about setting a goal to gather your notes today and create an outline this week? That gives you a structure to work with.

User: Yes, I can do that! 

Consultant: Fantastic! As we continue to work together, it's important to recognize these small achievements. Over time, they can help you rebuild your confidence and direction. How are you feeling about everything we’ve talked about? 

User: I feel a bit lighter and more hopeful than when we started. It feels good to have a plan.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that, Amei! It’s a significant step forward. Reflecting on your progress and planning for small achievements helps build momentum. Remember, it's perfectly okay to ask for help when you need it. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate that reminder and I’ll definitely try to focus more on my strengths from now on. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! It’s my pleasure to support you. Let’s continue this journey toward finding direction and value in your life together. For now, take some time to process what we've discussed today, and I look forward to our next session!

User: Thanks so much! I feel hopeful about our future talks. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Amei! I'm proud of you for taking this step today. Until next time, take care! 

User: Goodbye!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Amei! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling quite lost lately. I recently talked to my parents on the phone, and my dad showed little interest in my future plans, which really upset me. It made me question my decisions and path.

Consultant: I can see how that would be really disheartening, especially when it feels like your family's support is lacking. Let's talk about that a bit more. What specific thoughts or feelings came up for you during that conversation?

User: I felt ignored and unimportant. It’s like my dreams don’t matter to them. I started to doubt myself and feel unsure about my future choices.

Consultant: Those feelings of doubt and lack of importance can be really challenging to cope with. What do you think your father's indifference means for your own decision-making capabilities?

User: I guess it makes me feel like if he doesn’t care, maybe I shouldn't care either. It's like I shouldn't have any confidence in what I want to achieve.

Consultant: It sounds like your father's response is deeply influencing how you view your own goals and abilities. Do you think this is an automatic thought that you have, or is it something you've reflected on over time?

User: It's definitely an automatic thought. I didn’t consciously realize how much his opinion affected me until now. I just always assumed I should prove them wrong or something.

Consultant: It's understandable to have that instinct to prove others wrong, but it can also lead to pressure and frustration. Have you considered what you truly want for yourself, independent of your father's opinion?

User: I want to be successful in my studies and maybe even explore a career that I find fulfilling, but I just don't know how to start feeling confident about it anymore.

Consultant: It’s great that you have a vision for yourself. Let’s work on finding ways to foster confidence in those aspirations. What small steps do you think you could take towards achieving those goals, despite how your parents feel?

User: Maybe I could set specific study goals or look into career options that interest me. I just fear that if I don’t get their approval, it won’t be worth it.

Consultant: It’s understandable to seek approval, but it's also important to recognize your own desires and values. What would it look like for you to set a small, achievable study goal that feels manageable right now?

User: I suppose I could aim to finish a chapter of my textbook this week and maybe reward myself afterward. That sounds doable.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Setting a clear and attainable goal can definitely help to rebuild your confidence. As you work on that, remember to celebrate your achievements, no matter how small. 

User: Yeah, I should focus more on my progress rather than my parents' opinions. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on your own progress can help shift your perspective. How do you think you will handle any feelings of doubt that might come up during this process?

User: I’ll try to remind myself that everyone's path is different. Just because they don’t understand my choices doesn’t mean they aren’t valid.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight. Reminding yourself of your unique path can reinforce your self-worth. What do you think would be an effective way to remind yourself of this when self-doubt creeps in?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal where I write down my achievements and positive affirmations. 

Consultant: A journal sounds like an excellent idea! It can help document your progress and reinforce your thoughts. Have you ever used a journal before for your feelings or thoughts?

User: I've never really done it seriously. I guess I always thought it wouldn’t help, but now I’m willing to give it a shot.

Consultant: That’s a great attitude! Writing can provide clarity and serve as a safe space for expressing your thoughts. What else do you think you might need to support you as you start this journey?

User: I guess just reminders to keep pushing through even if I feel uncertain. Maybe talking to friends about my goals might help too.

Consultant: Engaging with friends could be really helpful! It can provide a sense of community and support. Do you have anyone in mind that you feel comfortable sharing your goals with?

User: I have a couple of close friends who understand what I'm going through. I could talk to them about my studies and plans.

Consultant: That sounds like a supportive avenue to explore. It can be beneficial to share your ambitions with people who care about you. As we wrap up today’s session, how do you feel about the steps we’ve discussed?

User: I feel more hopeful today. I think focusing on myself instead of their opinions could really help me. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Amei! It’s a significant step to prioritize your own desires and self-worth. Remember, this is a journey, and it’s perfectly okay to take it one step at a time. 

User: Thanks! I’ll reflect on our conversation and start writing in my journal tonight.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! I'm looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. You're doing great, Amei. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! Remember, you're not alone in this, and I’m here to help you whenever you need it. Take care, Amei! 

User: Bye! See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Amei! I'm glad you're here today. I understand you've been feeling anxious about your social skills and your ability to perform in public situations. Can you share a bit more about what you've been experiencing lately?

User: Hi. Yes, I've been really nervous about how I present myself in front of others. I participated in a school event recently, and I felt like I couldn't communicate properly. It made me doubt my social abilities even more.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, Amei. It’s completely normal to feel anxious in social situations, especially when we want to make a good impression. How did that experience affect your confidence overall?

User: It definitely knocked my confidence down. I keep thinking that I might mess up again the next time I have to speak or interact with people. It just feels like I'm stuck.

Consultant: I can see how that would feel discouraging. You want to feel more confident in these situations. Let’s explore a bit deeper—what specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about speaking or interacting in public?

User: I often think that people will judge me or find me awkward. Sometimes, I even convince myself that I don't have anything interesting to say.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really tough to deal with. It seems like you’re caught in a cycle of thinking negatively about yourself when it comes to social interactions. Have you ever tried to question those thoughts? For example, do you have any evidence that people judge you in the way you fear?

User: I don't really know, honestly. I guess I just imagine they think I'm boring or awkward without any real proof.

Consultant: That’s a very common experience. Many of us tend to assume what others think without concrete evidence. If you were to look at this from a different perspective, what might be an alternative thought that feels more balanced or reasonable?

User: Maybe I could think that not everyone is paying attention to me as much as I believe they are? Or that it's okay to not be perfect?

Consultant: Yes, that’s a wonderful shift in thinking! Let’s practice that mindset. What would happen if you approached a social situation, reminding yourself that it’s fine not to be perfect and that others might not be focused solely on you?

User: I guess it would take some pressure off me. It might help me relax and actually enjoy the conversation.

Consultant: Exactly! Relaxation can open the door for better communication. Now, let’s think about some practical steps. Can you recall a recent situation where you felt uncomfortable socially? How could you apply this new perspective in the future?

User: At the last event, I could’ve reminded myself that I wasn’t the center of attention and that everyone was there to enjoy themselves. I could have engaged in conversation without worrying about making mistakes.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! To further prepare for next time, we can practice some conversational techniques through role-playing. Would you be comfortable trying a little exercise now?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful.

Consultant: Great! Let’s pretend we are at an event, and I’m a fellow participant. You can start a conversation with me. I’ll provide feedback afterward.

User: Okay, um, hi! I noticed you have a really interesting bag. Where did you get it?

Consultant: Hi, Amei! Thanks for asking! I actually got it from a local market. How about you? What kind of style do you like?

User: I like more simple designs. I usually go for practicality over style, to be honest.

Consultant: That was a nice start! You asked a question, and you also shared a bit about yourself. How did you feel during that exchange?

User: I felt a bit nervous, but it was also nice to share my preferences. 

Consultant: Exactly! Feeling nervous is normal, but you did well by showing interest in me. Each time you practice, it will become a bit more comfortable. What other situations do you think you could apply this practice in?

User: Maybe in group discussions during class or even when meeting new people at events.

Consultant: Yes, those are perfect opportunities! We can continue to work on this in our upcoming sessions too. For now, how would you feel if we wrapped up today’s session and discussed what you've learned about yourself through this practice?

User: I think I’ve learned that it's okay to relax and not put too much pressure on myself. Talking to people can be enjoyable if I change my mindset a bit.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight, Amei! Remember, with each interaction, you're building your confidence. As we continue, we’ll explore how to apply these experiences to other areas of your life. Have you thought about how you might use your reading experiences to fuel your confidence outside of social settings?

User: I haven’t thought about that yet, but I do enjoy the stories in novels. Maybe I can use what I learn from them as inspiration for interactions.

Consultant: Absolutely! Books can offer a lot of valuable perspectives. We can work on integrating those insights into your daily life. For now, remember the techniques we've discussed today, and don't hesitate to practice them in small ways. I'm here to support you through this journey.

User: Thank you so much! I feel a bit better about approaching social situations now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Amei! You’ve made some great progress today. Remember, your feelings of fulfillment and growth can extend beyond just social interactions. If you ever feel overwhelmed or need to talk, I'm just a message away. Take care, and I look forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Amei! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling quite different, actually. I've recently started reading some classic literature, and for the first time in a while, I feel a glimmer of motivation. It's like I've reawakened a thirst for knowledge.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful, Amei! It's great to hear that reading has sparked some motivation in you. Can you tell me more about how this experience has affected you?

User: Well, while reading, I often feel a sense of satisfaction and tranquility. It makes me reflect on my life and aspirations. I wish I could carry this feeling into other areas of my life, especially my studies.

Consultant: It seems like reading has given you a sense of fulfillment. Let's explore how we can translate this feeling into motivation for your studies. What specific areas in your life do you feel could benefit from this motivation?

User: I think my academic life needs a boost. I often feel lost about my future and don't have a clear direction. I hope to channel the excitement I feel from reading into my schoolwork.

Consultant: I understand that feeling lost can be difficult. It’s great that you want to turn that excitement into action. What steps do you think you could take to blend your love for reading with your studies?

User: Maybe I could set some goals related to my readings and connect them to my school subjects. I also want to join some groups or clubs where I can discuss literature with others.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan, Amei! Setting specific goals and engaging with others who share your passion for literature could really help you. Let's break that down a bit further. What kind of goals do you envision for yourself?

User: I think I could start by reading more books related to my coursework and participating in discussions. I want to make reading a habit and use it to help me understand my studies better.

Consultant: That's a fantastic approach! By reading books that complement your coursework, you can enhance your understanding while enjoying the process. How do you feel about committing to a certain amount of reading each week?

User: I think committing to a couple of hours each week sounds doable. It feels less overwhelming this way, and I can enjoy it without stressing about deadlines.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you’re finding a manageable plan. Remember, enjoying the process is key. How about considering ways to track your reading progress? This could help reinforce your motivation as you see your achievements.

User: Tracking my progress might help me stay on course. I could maybe jot down my daily readings in a journal or log. It would be nice to look back and see what I’ve accomplished.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea, Amei! Keeping a journal can provide both accountability and encouragement. How do you feel about sharing your insights with others, perhaps in a book club?

User: I’d love that! I think sharing thoughts would enhance my understanding, and it would also be nice to connect with others who enjoy literature.

Consultant: Connecting with others could provide a strong sense of belonging and motivation. What steps can you take to find or initiate such a book club?

User: I could start by checking if my school has any literature clubs. If not, I might consider starting one myself with friends or classmates who are interested.

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive approach! Taking that initiative shows great leadership and can be fulfilling. What are some qualities you hope to find in a book club or in the people you connect with?

User: I hope to find members who are open-minded and passionate about literature. I want to discuss ideas freely and explore different perspectives.

Consultant: Those qualities can create an enriching environment for discussion. How about thinking of some topics or books you’d love to explore in these discussions? 

User: I’d like to discuss themes in classic literature and how they might relate to our lives today. It would be fascinating to hear different viewpoints.

Consultant: That’s an exciting direction! Exploring those themes can deepen your understanding of both the literature and yourself. As you think about these potential discussions, how does it make you feel looking forward to connecting with others?

User: I feel excited and hopeful. It’s nice to think that I could create a space where we learn from each other while enjoying our passions. 

Consultant: That sense of excitement is wonderful to hear. We can work on strategies to help nurture that hope and strengthen your social skills as well. Are there any specific concerns you have about connecting with others in such a setting?

User: I sometimes worry about not fitting in or feeling shy around new people. I tend to be introverted, so putting myself out there can be intimidating.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel shy in new situations, Amei. Perhaps we can think of gradual steps to ease into these interactions. What would make you feel more comfortable in initiating these conversations?

User: Maybe starting with smaller groups or one-on-one discussions before moving to larger gatherings. That way, I can build my confidence slowly.

Consultant: That sounds smart! By taking small steps, you can gradually build your confidence. How do you feel about setting a timeline for initiating these connections?

User: I think that would help me stay focused. I could aim to attend the first club meeting in a month. That gives me time to prepare.

Consultant: Setting that timeline can help make it feel more real and attainable. How do you plan to celebrate your progress as you move forward with these goals?

User: I could reward myself with some new books or maybe just take time to enjoy a good read after accomplishing my set tasks.

Consultant: Celebrating your successes, no matter how small, can strengthen your motivation and joy. As we work together, reflecting on your growth will be important too. Before we wrap up today, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I feel empowered to take steps towards connecting with others through literature and to stay committed to my readings. It’s reassuring to have a plan.

Consultant: I’m glad you feel empowered, Amei! Remember, you’re not alone in this journey, and reaching out can be incredibly rewarding. I believe you can do it, and I’m here to support you. Looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Amei! It's great to see you today. I'm eager to hear how you've been since our last session. What’s been going on with you?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling quite good lately. Joining the reading club has really helped me meet new friends who share my interests. I feel like I belong somewhere, which is nice.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Feeling a sense of belonging is so important. Can you share more about your experiences in the reading club? What activities have you enjoyed the most so far?

User: We've been discussing various novels and even started some small group readings. I was nervous at first, but the discussions are really engaging, and my friends are supportive.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve found a welcoming environment. How do these discussions make you feel, especially when you share your thoughts with others?

User: I feel more confident when I speak about the books. I used to worry that my opinions wouldn't matter, but now I realize they do. It’s a nice feeling.

Consultant: That's an important realization. Recognizing the value of your contributions can be empowering. Have you noticed any changes in how you approach other social situations since joining the club?

User: Yes, I've been more open to talking to people outside of the club too. It's still unfamiliar, but I'm trying. I even struck up a conversation with someone in my class!

Consultant: That's fantastic progress, Amei! It sounds like you’re building on that sense of belonging. What emotions come up for you when you think about reaching out to others?

User: I feel a mix of excitement and fear. I’m excited to make new friends, but I still worry that I might say the wrong thing.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel both excitement and fear in social situations. Let’s focus on those worries. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that lead you to feel like you might say something wrong?

User: I often think, "What if they don’t like my opinion?" or "What if they judge me?" It keeps me from speaking up sometimes.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be very limiting. Let’s challenge them a bit. What evidence do you have that supports those fears? Have you had experiences where you felt judged?

User: I haven’t really been judged in the club, actually. Everyone seems to appreciate different viewpoints. But I guess I still hold onto past experiences where I felt ignored.

Consultant: It’s insightful that you recognize this pattern. How about reframing your thoughts? Instead of fearing judgment, what if you considered the possibility that others might value your perspective?

User: That makes sense. I guess it’s possible they’d appreciate what I have to say, especially since we all love reading!

Consultant: Exactly! And it’s good to remember that everyone has insecurities. How might this new perspective change the way you approach conversations?

User: I could remind myself that we’re all here to share and learn from each other. I think that might help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: Yes, and practicing this mindset can really help build your confidence. What can you do to reinforce this when you’re in a social setting?

User: Maybe I could set small goals for myself, like trying to contribute at least once in each discussion. That could help push me to speak up.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Setting manageable goals can make the process less daunting. How confident do you feel about implementing this plan in your next club meeting?

User: I feel quite motivated! I think I can do it, but I might need a little reminder to keep those positive thoughts in mind.

Consultant: Let’s create a little mantra you can repeat to yourself, something like, “My thoughts and ideas matter.” How does that sound to you?

User: I love that! I’ll remember to say it to myself before discussions. 

Consultant: I’m glad you like it! Besides the reading club, are there any other activities or interests you’re thinking of exploring?

User: I’d like to try joining a writing workshop. I enjoy writing, but I’ve been hesitant to share my work.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Sharing your writing can also enhance your confidence. How do you feel about the prospect of joining such a workshop?

User: A bit nervous, but I’m excited too. It could be great to get feedback and grow as a writer.

Consultant: That’s the right mindset! Remember, everyone in those workshops is there to improve and learn, just like you. How can you prepare for this new challenge?

User: I could start writing a few pieces and maybe even share them with a couple of friends first to ease into it.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Sharing with friends can help you feel more comfortable. As we wrap up today, what are your takeaways from our session?

User: I feel more confident in my abilities and how to approach conversations. I'm excited about trying new things and making connections.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Amei! You've made great strides, and I’m proud of you. Remember, socializing is a skill that can be developed. I look forward to hearing how these new experiences go for you. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I’m looking forward to our next meeting!

Consultant: You're very welcome. I'm here for you every step of the way. Take care and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, A Mei! It’s great to see you again. I’m really glad to hear about your recent positive experiences in the club activities. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. The praise I received from the club leader really boosted my confidence. I feel like I’m starting to see some value in myself, and I want to keep that going.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Feeling a sense of value is really important for your self-esteem. What specific goals or plans do you have in mind to maintain this positive momentum?

User: I’ve been thinking about setting some long-term goals for my studies and perhaps exploring some career options. But I’m still a bit unsure about what exactly I want to pursue.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel uncertain about career paths, especially at your age. Let's explore your interests together. What subjects or activities excite you the most in your studies?

User: I really enjoy literature and writing, but I also like psychology. I find people’s thoughts and behaviors fascinating. 

Consultant: Those are fantastic interests, A Mei. Literature can help you understand human experiences, and psychology can deepen that understanding even more. Have you considered how you might blend these interests into a potential career?

User: I haven’t really thought that far ahead. Maybe something like a writer or a psychologist, but I don’t know if I'm good enough for those fields.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re exploring these options. Remember, it’s okay to not feel completely confident right now. All of us have to start somewhere, and exploring your options is a key part of the journey. What steps do you think you could take to explore those fields further?

User: Maybe I could take some online courses in psychology or join a writing workshop? That might help me figure out what I enjoy more.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Taking courses or workshops can provide you with valuable insights and skills. It also allows you to see what resonates with you. Would you like to set some specific goals for when you might start these activities?

User: I think I’d like to aim for starting one of the courses next month if I can find something suitable. That gives me some time to look around.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Setting a timeline like that can help keep you motivated. Along the way, it’s also essential to recognize your achievements, no matter how small. How do you think you can celebrate your progress as you move forward?

User: I could reward myself with a nice treat or perhaps spend some time hanging out with friends when I complete a course or reach a goal. 

Consultant: I love that idea! Celebrating your achievements with activities you enjoy can really boost your motivation. Now, thinking ahead, what potential challenges do you see that might arise as you work towards these goals?

User: I’m worried I might feel overwhelmed or lose motivation if it gets tough, which often happens with long-term projects.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, A Mei. It’s common to face obstacles on the journey toward our goals. What strategies do you think you could use to help manage feelings of overwhelm or maintain your motivation?

User: Maybe I could break down tasks into smaller steps and set short deadlines for those steps. That way, I wouldn’t feel like everything is piling up at once.

Consultant: Absolutely! Breaking tasks into smaller, manageable steps is a great way to diminish feelings of overwhelm. It can also give you a sense of accomplishment along the way. How does this approach make you feel about tackling your goals?

User: It makes me feel more in control! If I take it step by step, I think I can handle it better.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization, A Mei! Feeling in control is empowering. As you move forward, remember to keep checking in with yourself. Are there any other support systems or people in your life that you can lean on when you need motivation or encouragement?

User: I have some friends from my club who are really supportive. I think I can talk to them when I need a boost.

Consultant: That’s perfect! Having a support network can make a significant difference. You can share your goals with them and maybe even encourage each other along the way. How do you feel about sharing your journey with them?

User: I think it would be nice. It might motivate all of us to stay on track!

Consultant: Definitely! Being accountable to friends can be a powerful motivation. As we wrap up today’s session, could you summarize what you’ll focus on moving forward?

User: I’ll look for online courses in psychology and writing, break down tasks into smaller steps, and celebrate my achievements with friends!

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan, A Mei! You’ve set yourself up for success. Remember, the skills you’re developing now will help you face future challenges. I believe you have what it takes to continue this positive journey. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance. I feel more hopeful about my future now.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Always remember that you can return if you need further support. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. 

User: Goodbye, and thank you again!
