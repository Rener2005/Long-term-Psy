Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for today's session. Let's begin by discussing how you've been feeling lately. You mentioned having strong feelings of aversion towards school, particularly with your physics studies. Can you tell me more about that?

User: Hi. Yeah, I just can’t stand physics. It feels like no matter how much I try, I just can’t understand it. I feel so lost and it makes me not want to go to school at all.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds really frustrating to feel lost in a subject that many others seem to grasp. Can you share what specific thoughts go through your mind when you're faced with physics assignments or classes?

User: I think things like "I’m never going to get this," and "Why do I even have to learn this?" It just makes me feel hopeless.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really discouraging. It seems like they're contributing a lot to your aversion to school. When you think, "I’m never going to get this," how does that make you feel in the moment?

User: It makes me feel really anxious and overwhelmed. I just want to shut down and avoid it altogether. 

Consultant: That makes sense. Avoiding what makes us anxious is a common response. I'm curious, have you noticed any situations at school or at home that make that anxiety worse for you?

User: Well, my dad has been away a lot more for work, and now I’m spending more time with my uncle. It feels like there's no one really there to support me with my schoolwork or anything.

Consultant: It sounds like the lack of support at home is adding to your feelings of isolation and frustration at school. How do you think that impacts your ability to connect with your classmates?

User: I guess it makes me feel more alone, and then I just don’t want to reach out to anyone. I feel like they wouldn't understand anyway.

Consultant: It’s tough feeling alone. Those feelings can lead us to withdraw even more. If you could change one thing about your school experience or your interactions with your classmates, what would it be?

User: I wish I could just feel more confident and not be so worried about what they think of me. It would be nice to make a friend or two.

Consultant: Building that confidence is a great goal. What if we look at some strategies that could help you express yourself better and connect with others? How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I really want to try to feel better, but I just don’t know where to start.

Consultant: A good starting point could be to challenge those negative thoughts about yourself and school. Let's brainstorm some alternative thoughts for your belief, "I'm never going to get this." Could there be a more balanced way to look at that?

User: Maybe something like, "I can improve with practice" or "It’s okay to struggle sometimes"?

Consultant: Exactly! Those are much more encouraging thoughts. Practicing them can take the pressure off, and help you see that it's alright to be on a learning journey. What do you think might help you remember to focus on these positive affirmations?

User: Maybe I could write them down or talk to myself when I'm feeling down?

Consultant: Those are great ideas! Writing them down can make them feel more real, and talking to yourself positively can really shift your mindset. Are there any specific situations coming up where you think you might need to remind yourself of these new thoughts?

User: I have a physics quiz next week. I’d probably be really anxious about it.

Consultant: That’s a perfect opportunity to practice! How about we plan a quick review session before the quiz where you remind yourself of these affirmations? Could that help ease your anxiety?

User: Yeah, that would help a lot. It would feel less overwhelming if I had a plan.

Consultant: Absolutely! Having a plan can help reduce feelings of anxiety because you’re taking proactive steps. Besides the quiz, are there any opportunities to interact with classmates that you might consider?

User: There’s a group project coming up. I’m kind of worried about that, though.

Consultant: Group projects can be intimidating, but they're also great chances to connect. How might you approach your classmates to make that experience easier for you?

User: I guess I could just be honest about needing help and see who wants to work together. Maybe just stepping forward could help.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid approach. Being honest about needing help can actually help break the ice with your peers. As we wrap up today, what insights do you feel you’re taking away from our conversation?

User: I think I realized that I can change my thoughts about school. I have to work on my confidence and just try to reach out more.

Consultant: That's a profound realization! Working on your confidence and reaching out are crucial steps. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to take it one day at a time. As we continue, we can explore more about practical steps and strategies. I look forward to our next session and seeing the progress you make.

User: Thank you. I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it’s about taking small steps forward. You’ve got this, and I’m here to support you. Take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello there! It's great to see you today. Before we start, how have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed, especially after my recent exam results. I didn't do as well as I hoped, and now I'm questioning my abilities.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure and feeling uncertain about your academic abilities. Let's talk about that feeling of doubt. What specific thoughts have come up for you since the exam?

User: I keep telling myself that I'm just not good enough. It feels like no matter how hard I try, I still can't succeed.

Consultant: That’s a really tough position to be in. It’s common to feel that way after setbacks, but let’s dive deeper—what evidence do you have that supports this thought of “not being good enough”?

User: Well, I failed a couple of tests recently, and that just reinforces the idea that I’m not cut out for school.

Consultant: It sounds like those failures have had a significant impact on your self-view. But let’s challenge that thought a bit. Can you think of any times in the past when you've succeeded, even if they were small achievements?

User: There were times when I completed assignments on time or helped a friend with their homework. But those feel minor compared to my exam results.

Consultant: Those achievements are absolutely important! Completing assignments and helping others shows that you have the ability to succeed. How might you feel about your abilities if you were to focus on those positive experiences instead?

User: I guess I would feel a bit more confident, but it’s hard to ignore the tests that went poorly.

Consultant: Understandable. It’s important to acknowledge those feelings, but also to challenge any all-or-nothing thinking. Instead of viewing your abilities based solely on test results, what other aspects could you recognize that demonstrate your skills?

User: I suppose I enjoy participating in class discussions, and I do get good feedback from teachers sometimes.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! Active participation in class shows that you understand the material and can express your ideas. Let’s work on shifting your focus to those strengths. Would you like to explore how you can actively use those strengths to engage with your schoolwork?

User: Yes, that sounds helpful. I want to feel more involved in school.

Consultant: Excellent! Getting involved is a great way to build confidence. Let's explore some activities or groups at school that interest you. Are there clubs or teams you might consider joining?

User: There’s an art club I've thought about, but I’m not sure if it’s for me since I haven't done art seriously before.

Consultant: Exploring interests like an art club could be a fantastic way to meet new people and express yourself, even if you haven’t done art seriously before. Everyone starts somewhere! What if you approached it as a fun way to discover something new rather than a pressure to excel?

User: That makes sense. I just worry that I'll be judged if I'm not good at it.

Consultant: It's natural to worry about judgment, but remember, everyone in that club is likely there to learn and enjoy themselves just like you. If you don’t mind, let’s think about how you can reframe those fears. What if you viewed this as an opportunity for personal growth instead of a performance?

User: I could see it as a way to challenge myself. That does make it seem less intimidating.

Consultant: Absolutely! Embracing challenges for growth is powerful. Let’s also think of some small steps you can take to attend the first meeting or try a few projects at home. How does that sound to you?

User: I think I could try attending one meeting, just to see what it's like. 

Consultant: That's fantastic! Just taking that first step will help ease your worries. It’s all about building confidence gradually. How else can we support your engagement with school and with your peers moving forward?

User: I guess I could also think about reaching out to classmates more, but I've been feeling a bit isolated lately.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when you’re questioning your place among peers. Let’s explore some ways you might initiate conversation or participate more actively. Would it help to set up small, achievable goals for connecting with classmates?

User: Yeah, maybe I could start by just saying hello to someone I usually don’t talk to.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant idea! Starting with a simple greeting can open the door to larger conversations over time. What do you think might be a good first step for you this week regarding those goals?

User: I’ll try to make a point to say hi to at least one person every day.

Consultant: That’s an excellent plan! Each small interaction will help you build your comfort level. Let’s recap what we've discussed today. We focused on recognizing your strengths, exploring new opportunities, and taking meaningful steps towards engaging more with your school community. 

User: Yeah, I feel a bit better about it now. I just need to keep reminding myself of these steps.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember, each step forward is progress. Next time, we can check in on how those interactions and involvement are going. You’ve gained some valuable insights today, and I believe you have the resources to face these challenges. 

User: Thanks! I’m looking forward to seeing how this goes.

Consultant: I’m excited for you too! Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support along the way. You're doing great, and I'm here for you.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately regarding your school activities and social interactions?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling pretty isolated. There was this major learning event at school recently, and I felt completely ignored. I don’t really want to participate in anything.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you’re feeling overlooked and disconnected from your peers at school. Can you tell me more about what that experience was like for you during the event?

User: Well, it was just… I saw everyone else engaging and having fun, but I felt like I didn’t belong. It made me want to just stay away from everything.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way when you perceive that sense of exclusion. How did that make you feel about yourself?

User: It just made me feel really low. Like I’m not good enough to be part of that group. I started thinking maybe it’s better to not even try to connect with them.

Consultant: Those feelings of inadequacy can be very hard to deal with. It seems you’re in a tough position where you want to connect but feel discouraged. What do you think would help you feel more included?

User: I think maybe if I tried to talk to someone first or joined a group activity, that could help. But it feels really daunting.

Consultant: Trying to engage with someone or participating in activities sounds like a good idea. What do you think is making it feel daunting for you?

User: I guess I worry that they won’t want to talk to me or that I’ll say something stupid. It just makes me anxious thinking about it.

Consultant: It's common to feel anxious about initiating conversations, especially when you’re unsure of the reaction you’ll get. How do you usually cope with these anxious feelings?

User: I usually just avoid it. I’d rather stay alone than feel embarrassed. 

Consultant: Avoidance can feel like a safe option, but it often leads to feeling more isolated. Let’s try to challenge that thought—what evidence do you have that they wouldn’t want to talk with you? 

User: I don’t know… Maybe it’s just what I think. I don’t really have any proof that they wouldn’t.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It sounds like there is an assumption that might not be based on reality. What do you think might happen if you did reach out to someone and they were friendly?

User: I guess it might feel nice to connect. It could change how I feel about school, maybe.

Consultant: Exactly! Reaching out could create new opportunities for connection. What small step could you take this week to initiate that interaction?

User: Maybe I could say hi to someone in my class or ask about the homework? It feels small, but it’s something.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect starting point! It’s a small but meaningful action. How does the idea of doing that make you feel?

User: It still feels a bit scary, but I think it’s better than just avoiding everything.

Consultant: It’s completely okay to feel scared, but taking that small step can help reduce that fear over time. Would you like to set a goal for when you might try this out?

User: Maybe I could try it tomorrow before class. Just a simple hello or question.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! Let’s also discuss what you might do if the interaction doesn’t go as well as you hope. How could you handle that?

User: I guess I could remind myself that not every interaction has to be perfect, and I can always try again later.

Consultant: Yes, that’s a very constructive way to look at it. Recognizing that not every interaction defines your worth is important. How do you feel about setting this as your practice going forward?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful now. I didn’t think I could actually try talking first, but it might be worth it.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that you’re feeling hopeful! As you work on connecting with classmates, it might also help to reflect on how you felt about each interaction. What do you think?

User: Yeah, keeping track of how I feel afterwards could help me see if things improve.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflecting on your experiences will provide valuable feedback for you. Let’s set aside some time during our next session to discuss how it went. Would that work for you?

User: That sounds good. I’m looking forward to sharing how it goes.

Consultant: Great! Remember, it’s a process, and every step counts. Before we wrap up today, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any other strategies you think could help?

User: Not really, but I appreciate the encouragement. It feels like I have a little plan now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Having a plan can help reduce anxiety, and I believe you’re capable of making these connections. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support before our next session.

User: Thanks, I will! This session has helped a lot.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! I look forward to hearing about your progress and what you’ve learned next time. Take care, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you today. I want to start by acknowledging the challenges you've been facing at home. Can you share how you're feeling about your situation recently?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really overwhelmed by everything. My dad and I had another argument about my studies, and it's just stressful. I feel like I can't talk to him without it turning into a fight.

Consultant: It sounds like the tension with your dad is really heavy on you right now. You're feeling stressed and unable to communicate effectively. What do you think is at the heart of these arguments? 

User: I think it's mostly that he doesn’t understand how I feel. He wants me to perform well in school, but I just feel so lost and pressured. I can't keep up with the studies like he expects.

Consultant: That must be really frustrating, feeling misunderstood and pressured at the same time. It’s common for students to feel lost when facing these expectations. Can you tell me more about how this pressure affects you emotionally?

User: Well, it makes me anxious, and sometimes I just want to give up. I have trouble focusing on my studies, and then I feel guilty for not doing well. It just feels like a cycle I can’t break.

Consultant: You're caught in a tough cycle of anxiety and guilt, which can be really draining. Let's try to break it down. What specific thoughts run through your mind when you're feeling this way?

User: I keep thinking that if I don’t do well, my dad will be disappointed in me. It's like I have to be perfect to earn his approval.

Consultant: That’s a heavy thought to carry, feeling you have to be perfect to gain approval. Let's explore that idea. How realistic do you think it is to expect perfection from yourself?

User: I know it’s not realistic, but it still feels that way, especially when I see my friends doing better. It makes me feel even worse about myself.

Consultant: It makes sense that comparing yourself to your friends would heighten those feelings. It can be tough to see others succeed when you're struggling. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts this pressure to be perfect?

User: I mean, I do have some good grades, but I usually focus on the one negative comment my dad made instead. I guess I tend to remember the bad stuff more.

Consultant: It’s very natural to cling to negative feedback. It can overshadow the positives, even when they exist. Can we try thinking about the positive things you've achieved lately, no matter how small?

User: I did complete a project that my teacher praised, and my friend said I helped him a lot with his homework. But those moments somehow pale in comparison to my dad’s expectations.

Consultant: Those are fantastic accomplishments, and they reflect your strengths! Let’s shift focus a bit. What would change for you if you allowed yourself to celebrate those achievements instead of just focusing on your dad's expectations?

User: I guess I would feel a bit lighter and maybe even more motivated to keep going. But I still worry about disappointing him.

Consultant: That’s an important insight! Letting yourself celebrate even small wins could help you build confidence. Now, what do you think is one small step you could take to balance your responsibilities with celebrating your achievements?

User: Maybe I could set aside time to relax and do something I enjoy after finishing my homework? Like playing video games or hanging out with friends.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Finding time to relax and have fun can help reduce anxiety and make studying feel less burdensome. How do you think your dad would react if he saw you managing your time like that?

User: He might be surprised, but I think he’d be happy if he saw I was more relaxed and actually enjoying my time. He often tells me to take breaks.

Consultant: It's encouraging to think about how he could respond positively! Let’s talk about how to communicate these changes to him. What would you want to say to him about how you're managing your studies and your well-being?

User: I would like to tell him that I’m trying my best and that I need to balance work and relaxation. Maybe I could suggest setting a specific study schedule together?

Consultant: That’s a constructive approach! Collaborating with your dad on a study schedule could not only show him you're committed but also open up a dialogue about your needs. How do you feel about proposing that to him?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think it could help relieve some tension between us. Maybe we can work together instead of arguing about it.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s great to see you taking the initiative. Being open like that might strengthen your bond with your dad. Remember, it’s okay to express your feelings and needs. How else can you support yourself during this time?

User: Maybe I could talk more openly with some friends about what I'm going through. I always bottle things up, and I think it would help just to share.

Consultant: Talking to friends can be a powerful way to offload your feelings. It can provide support and make you feel less alone. What do you think about reaching out to someone this week?

User: I think I will! I have a friend who has been supportive. I just need to be honest with him.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Honesty can really strengthen friendships. As we wrap up our session, let’s reflect on what you've learned today. What stands out to you?

User: I’ve realized that I need to celebrate my achievements, communicate better with my dad, and lean on my friends for support. These steps might really help me cope better.

Consultant: You’ve made significant insights today! Remember, taking small steps toward positivity can make a big difference. When we meet again, we can explore how these strategies are working for you. You’re doing great!

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful and ready to try these changes.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Just take it one day at a time. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're here today. I noticed you've been involved in some volunteering activities at school recently. How has that been for you so far?

User: Hi! Yeah, it’s been surprisingly good. I initially thought it would just be more stressful, but I actually feel happy being around others. It’s different from how I usually feel at school.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like these activities have allowed you to experience some joy and connection with your peers. What specific parts of the volunteering have you enjoyed the most?

User: I enjoyed working together with other students on projects. It feels nice to contribute and feel like part of a team. I even started chatting with a few of them, which I hadn’t done in a long time.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re really starting to connect with others, which is a great step! How does it feel for you to engage in conversations with your classmates now compared to before?

User: It's definitely easier now. I used to feel embarrassed and worried about what to say, but now I’m less anxious. I still have moments of doubt, though.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! Recognizing your improvements is important. Can you share more about those doubts? What thoughts go through your mind when you start to feel anxious in social situations?

User: Sometimes I think that they won’t like me or that I’ll mess up the conversation. I get worried if I’m saying the wrong things.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really tough to deal with. It sounds like you might be assuming the worst-case scenario. How likely do you think it is that your classmates are genuinely judging you negatively?

User: You’re right. I’m not sure it’s as bad as I think it is. I guess I just automatically go to those thoughts.

Consultant: That’s a common reaction, and it shows how powerful our minds can be in creating anxiety. What if we considered some alternative thoughts? If a friend were to feel the same way, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably say that everyone makes mistakes and that they shouldn’t worry too much about what others think.

Consultant: Exactly! That compassionate perspective is important, not just for others but for yourself too. How might it feel to apply that same kindness to your own interactions?

User: I think it would help me relax. I should remind myself that everyone is just trying to get along. 

Consultant: That’s a great realization! Balancing your internal dialogue can make a significant difference in how you feel. What would be a small step you could take to practice this self-compassion during your next social interaction?

User: Maybe I could set a goal to just enjoy the conversation without stressing over what I should say. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! Focusing on enjoyment rather than pressure can help ease your anxiety. How do you think you could remind yourself of this goal while you’re in the moment?

User: I could think of it like a game, where the point is just to connect and have fun, not to worry about being perfect.

Consultant: I love that approach! Gamifying social interactions could really change your perspective. As you practice this, how do you see it impacting your confidence in social settings over time?

User: I think it would make me more confident. If I focus on having fun and connecting, I might not feel so nervous.

Consultant: Absolutely! Each positive experience builds your confidence. Lastly, how can you celebrate your small successes in these social interactions to reinforce this growth?

User: I could keep a journal, noting down the good conversations or moments I have. That way, I can remind myself of the progress I’m making.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Reflecting on positive experiences will help you internalize your growth. As we wrap up today, what has been the biggest takeaway for you in our conversation?

User: I think it’s that I can challenge my negative thoughts and that it’s okay to just be myself without worrying too much. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight! I’m really proud of you for recognizing that. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. I’m looking forward to hearing about your next experiences and how you continue to develop these social skills.

User: Thanks! I feel more motivated now. I’m looking forward to the next volunteering event!

Consultant: Great! Remember, each step forward is an achievement. Take care, and I’ll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Y! I'm really happy to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I'm actually feeling a lot better! Being a group leader in that class activity really boosted my confidence. The teacher praised my work, which was nice.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful to hear! It’s great that you’re feeling more confident and that your responsibility as a leader was recognized. How has this experience influenced your relationships with your classmates?

User: I think it helped a bit. I felt more connected during the activity. But outside of that, I still feel distant from most of them.

Consultant: It’s encouraging to see positive changes in your confidence, but I understand that some feelings of distance still remain. What do you think is causing that distance with your classmates?

User: I guess I just haven't built those connections yet. It's like I don’t know how to reach out or make friends.

Consultant: That's a common feeling, especially after a change like taking on a leadership role. Let’s explore this together. What thoughts come to mind when you think about reaching out to others?

User: I often think they won't want to be friends with me or that I'm not interesting enough.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be pretty discouraging. Let’s break that down—what evidence do you have that they wouldn’t want to be friends with you?

User: I don’t really have any solid proof. I guess it's just how I feel sometimes.

Consultant: It sounds like you're recognizing that those feelings might not accurately represent reality. If you could change that thought to something more positive, what might that look like?

User: Maybe I could think that if I approach them, they might be open to it. After all, I did lead the group successfully.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic shift in thinking! Recognizing your capabilities as a leader is a great foundation for connecting with others. What would be a small step you could take towards building those friendships?

User: I could start by talking to a few classmates more, maybe asking them about their interests or what they think about school.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Engaging them in conversation about shared experiences can help break the ice. How does that idea make you feel?

User: It makes me feel a bit nervous, but also excited. It’s a step forward.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel both nervous and excited! Let’s work through that nervousness together. What specific aspects make you feel nervous about starting those conversations?

User: I worry that the conversations might not flow well or that I’ll get awkward silence.

Consultant: Those fears are understandable. Perhaps we can think of some topics or questions ahead of time to help keep the conversation going. What do you find interesting that might be easy to discuss with them?

User: Maybe I could talk about our classes or share thoughts about the school events. Those are common interests.

Consultant: That's a great idea! Focusing on common interests can help keep the dialogue comfortable. How have you experienced conversations around those topics in the past? 

User: I think I've had some good discussions about school events before, so it might work again.

Consultant: That’s encouraging! Reflecting on past positive interactions can remind you that you are capable of connecting with others. As you prepare to reach out, how can you reassure yourself that it’s okay to feel a little awkward initially?

User: I guess I could remind myself that everyone feels awkward sometimes, and it’s a part of getting to know each other.

Consultant: Exactly! Embracing those initial awkward moments as part of the process can help ease some pressure. What do you hope to gain by reaching out to your classmates?

User: I want to feel more included and maybe even make some friends that I can rely on.

Consultant: That's a wonderful goal, Y. Building reliable friendships can significantly enhance your school experience. As we reflect on that, let’s discuss how you could sustain your leadership growth in school—maybe focusing on areas that excite you about being a leader.

User: I’d love to learn more about how to lead effectively. I sometimes feel unsure of my abilities.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel unsure, but remember, you’ve already taken significant steps. What qualities do you admire in leaders that you would like to develop in yourself?

User: I admire leaders who communicate well and make everyone feel included. I would like to be that kind of leader.

Consultant: That's an admirable quality to aim for! We can definitely explore skills and strategies that can help you become more effective in communication and inclusion. How do you think improving these skills could help you further connect with your classmates?

User: I think it would make them feel valued and appreciated. I’d feel more confident too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Making others feel valued is a key part of effective leadership. Let’s consider some specific strategies you can practice to enhance your communication skills.

User: Maybe I could practice active listening and asking open-ended questions to encourage others to share more.

Consultant: That's an excellent strategy! Active listening and open-ended questions are powerful tools for fostering connection. When could you start applying this in your interactions at school?

User: I can try it in our next group discussion or when I talk to classmates after class.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! As we wrap up today’s session, how are you feeling about your plan to connect with your classmates and develop your leadership skills?

User: I feel excited and a little nervous, but I think it’s a step in the right direction. I appreciate the help!

Consultant: I’m happy to hear that, Y! Remember, taking small steps is key to growth. Each interaction brings you closer to your goals. Keep practicing, and we can continue to discuss your progress in our next session. 

User: Thanks! I’ll do my best and let you know how it goes.

Consultant: Sounds great! I look forward to hearing about your experiences. Take care, and I’ll see you next time!
