Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you could make it today. Before we dive in, I'd like to hear about how you've been feeling recently. What seems to be on your mind?

User: Hi. Lately, I've been feeling increasingly anxious about eye contact. I avoid looking at my students and colleagues, and it's affecting my teaching. I feel so overwhelmed and don't know how to cope with it anymore.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing significant discomfort with eye contact, and it's impacting your work as a teacher. That's a tough situation to be in. Can you share a little more about what happens when you try to make eye contact?

User: When I attempt to look at someone, I feel a rush of panic. My heart races, and I just want to look away. It's like I'm scared they will judge me or see something wrong with me.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It seems like there's a fear of judgment associated with the eye contact. Have you noticed specific thoughts that go through your mind when you're in these situations?

User: Yes, I often think that if I look at them, they'll see how anxious and unqualified I feel. It feels like a spotlight is on me, revealing all my insecurities.

Consultant: I can see how overwhelming that must be. It sounds like those thoughts create a cycle of anxiety for you. If we look at this from a different perspective, what evidence do you have that people actually perceive you that way?

User: Well, I guess I don’t have solid proof. It's just a feeling I can't shake. But I've noticed that when I avoid eye contact, I feel a bit safer, even if it hurts my teaching.

Consultant: It makes sense that avoiding eye contact might provide some temporary relief. However, it sounds like it's not helping in the long run. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about how to deal with this fear?

User: I would probably tell them to face their fears gradually and that it's okay to feel anxious. Maybe taking small steps could help.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Facing fears gradually can indeed be effective. Let's think of a small step you could try. Perhaps making eye contact with just one student at a time during class? How does that sound to you?

User: That feels a bit daunting, but I think I could give it a try. Maybe just one student at the beginning could work.

Consultant: That's a wonderful start! Focusing on just one student can make it feel more manageable. How do you think you might feel after trying that?

User: I guess it would depend on how it goes. If it goes well, maybe I'll feel a bit more confident. But I'm also worried it might backfire and make the anxiety worse.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those worries. Remember that any anxiety you feel is just part of the process of facing those fears. After trying it, we can reflect on what you experienced together. Would you be open to that?

User: Yes, I would appreciate that. Maybe talking about it afterward would help me process it.

Consultant: Absolutely. Reflecting on your experiences is a key part of learning and growth. Now, while we discuss further steps, are there any other thoughts you're feeling about this eye contact challenge?

User: I think just understanding that it’s not just me—that many people struggle with this—helps a bit. But sometimes I still feel so isolated.

Consultant: That’s a common feeling when dealing with anxiety. It can be isolating, but you're taking a courageous step by seeking support. Would it help to talk about some strategies to manage those feelings of isolation when they arise?

User: Yes, I think that would be good. Knowing I have some tools could help me feel less powerless.

Consultant: Perfect! We can develop those together. One strategy might be to remind yourself that you're not alone in this. You could even focus on some grounding techniques or breathing exercises before interacting to help ease the anxiety.

User: Breathing exercises sound simple enough. I could try doing that before class.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Deep, slow breaths can truly help. It prepares your mind and body to handle anxiety more effectively. How about we set a goal for this week regarding eye contact and breathing exercises?

User: Okay, by next session, I could try making eye contact with one student and practice breathing beforehand.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal! It feels challenging yet achievable. How will you measure your progress? Perhaps jotting down how you felt before and after could be helpful.

User: Yes, writing down my feelings will help me see the difference, I think. I might be surprised by the outcome.

Consultant: Absolutely, keeping a record can provide valuable insights. It's been great discussing these strategies with you today! Remember, it’s all about small steps and self-compassion along the way. 

User: Thank you! This conversation was really helpful. I feel a bit more hopeful now, even with the anxiety.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, progress takes time, and you’re doing well by acknowledging your feelings and taking action. For our next session, let’s review your experiences and continue building from there. 

User: Sounds good! I look forward to it. 

Consultant: Me too! Take care of yourself, and I believe in your ability to manage this. See you at our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hi there! I'm glad you're here today. I remember from our last session that you were starting to realize how deep your fear of eye contact goes. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hello. Yes, I've been thinking a lot about our last conversation. I still feel quite anxious about looking at people, especially after the family gathering where I felt so uncomfortable. I find myself avoiding situations where I have to make eye contact.

Consultant: I can see that the discomfort has had a significant impact on you. It must feel isolating to want to connect but to feel this fear holding you back. What do you think makes these situations so overwhelming for you?

User: I think it’s the fear of judgment. I worry that if I look someone in the eye, they will see my anxiety and think poorly of me. It's like I'm trapped in my own head, constantly worrying about how I'm perceived.

Consultant: That fear of judgment can be really paralyzing. It sounds like your thoughts around eye contact create a cycle of anxiety and avoidance. Let’s explore that a bit. Can you recall a specific thought that came to you during the family gathering that made you feel anxious?

User: Yes, I remember thinking that everyone was watching me and assessing me. It made me feel lightheaded and that I needed to escape the situation.

Consultant: That thought of being watched seems to amplify your anxiety. It’s quite common to have those feelings, but we can work on challenging that mindset. What evidence do you have that supports that everyone was actually judging you?

User: I don’t know…maybe it was just in my head. They were probably just focused on themselves, but my thoughts made it feel real.

Consultant: It’s good to recognize that! It sounds like there’s a gap between what you perceive and the reality of the situation. Let’s try to reframe those thoughts. If a friend shared a similar worry about being judged in a social setting, how might you suggest they approach it differently?

User: I would probably tell them that people are more understanding than they think and that most people are likely dealing with their own issues.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective! Now, let’s apply that to yourself. Instead of assuming everyone is judging you, what if you approached them with the expectation that they are generally supportive or preoccupied with their own feelings? 

User: That sounds like a better way to think about it. It might take some pressure off me!

Consultant: Exactly! To help you practice this shift in thinking, we can start with gradual exposure to eye contact. What if we set a small goal for the week where you make brief eye contact with a person in a safe environment, like a family member or a close friend? 

User: Hmm, that sounds challenging but doable. Maybe I can try that during dinner with my family. 

Consultant: That’s a great plan! After you try it, I’d love for you to jot down your feelings about the experience. It’ll help us assess how it went and reinforce those positive outcomes. 

User: I will do my best. I think writing it down will help me process my emotions afterwards. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Processing those emotions can provide valuable insights. Remember, it’s okay to feel anxious. What’s most important is that you’re taking a step forward. 

User: Yes, I’m trying. I still feel nervous just thinking about it, but I want to improve. 

Consultant: I believe in your willingness to face this challenge. Accepting that anxiety is part of the process seems to be a crucial step. The more you face those situations, the more confident you will become. 

User: I hope so. It's just tough sometimes feeling this way.

Consultant: That’s absolutely understandable. Change takes time, and it's okay to feel uncertain. We can work together to help you build those skills gradually. 

User: I appreciate your support! 

Consultant: I’m honored to be part of your journey. Before we end our session today, do you have any remaining thoughts or feelings you'd like to share?

User: I just hope I can build up the courage to try this eye contact thing. I guess I'm still a bit skeptical about how effective it might be.

Consultant: Your skepticism is valid, and it's a natural part of this process. Often, our growth involves navigating those doubts. Remember, every small step counts, and you’re not alone in this. 

User: Thank you. I think I needed to hear that. 

Consultant: Of course! I’m here to support you. Let’s continue to explore these feelings as you practice. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time.

User: Yes, me too! I’ll see you next session. 

Consultant: Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself as you try these new strategies. See you soon!

Consultant: Hello, Mù. I'm glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session? 

User: Hi. I've been trying to interact more during group activities as we discussed, but I still feel a lot of pressure. Sometimes I feel really anxious when I'm being looked at.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you are trying to participate more! I’d like to explore this pressure you're feeling. Can you share a specific moment where you felt anxious about being observed?

User: There was a recent group meeting where I was supposed to share my thoughts, but as I spoke, I could feel everyone's eyes on me. It made me very uncomfortable, almost like I wanted to disappear.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, Mù. Feeling overwhelmed in those situations is not uncommon. What thoughts went through your mind when you noticed the attention on you?

User: I kept thinking that I might embarrass myself. I worried they would judge what I said.

Consultant: It’s understandable that you would feel that way. Let’s take a closer look at those thoughts. How realistic do you think they are? Is there any evidence to suggest that they would judge you negatively?

User: I suppose there isn't much evidence. They seemed engaged. But I still can't shake off that fear.

Consultant: It’s good that you're recognizing that the fear might not be grounded in reality. Let’s challenge that thought a bit more—what would you say to a friend who felt the same way in a similar situation?

User: I would encourage them to be themselves and remind them that everyone makes mistakes. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective. It seems you have the ability to be kind to others, so let's apply that same kindness to yourself. What if you allowed yourself to just express your thoughts without the pressure of perfection?

User: I guess it could help. I just don’t know how to stop worrying about others' opinions.

Consultant: It’s a process, Mù. One effective strategy is to practice gradual exposure. What if we role-play a scenario where you share an idea with the group, and I can provide you with some supportive feedback afterward?

User: That sounds interesting. I could try that.

Consultant: Great! When you’re ready, imagine you’re in that meeting again. You might start by saying your idea out loud. How would you begin?

User: Okay, I would say something like, "I think..." and then I would share my thoughts.

Consultant: Perfect start! Let’s visualize you saying that. As you speak, what do you feel in your body, and what are the thoughts in your mind?

User: I feel my heart racing and I keep thinking about everyone looking at me. 

Consultant: Acknowledge that racing heart; it’s a natural response. Remember that it doesn’t define your ability to communicate. What’s another thought you could have instead of fearing their judgment?

User: Maybe I could think that they are listening because they value my input.

Consultant: Yes, that’s a much more positive and realistic thought! How might that change your experience in the moment?

User: I think I might feel more relaxed and confident if I think that way.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on the possibility of positive engagement can help ease that tension. How do you feel about practicing this in an upcoming social situation?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also hopeful. I want to try approaching it that way.

Consultant: That’s a great step forward, Mù. It’s normal to feel both nervous and hopeful. Let’s create a plan for that scenario; what might be some small steps you could take to prepare for it?

User: Maybe I can rehearse what I want to say in front of a mirror or with a friend first.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Rehearsing can help build your confidence. Would you consider noting down any positive feedback you receive, no matter how small?

User: Yes, keeping track of positive feedback sounds beneficial. I often forget the good moments.

Consultant: It can indeed be easy to overlook the positives. Let’s also plan to reflect on these experiences in our next session. What goals do you think would be realistic to focus on before we meet again?

User: I want to participate in at least one group discussion and remember to be kind to myself.

Consultant: Those sound like fantastic goals! You’re aiming for progress, even if it’s small. How motivational do you feel about making these changes?

User: I feel encouraged, but I still have some doubts about my ability to follow through.

Consultant: That’s completely normal, Mù. Doubt can be part of the journey. Remember, every small step you take adds up to significant progress. It’s about learning and growing. I believe in your ability to do this!

User: Thank you for the encouragement! I really appreciate it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here to support you. When we meet next, we can discuss how those interactions went and what you learned from them.

User: I’m looking forward to that. I’ll try my best to tackle this!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Take your time, and remember to celebrate even the small victories. I'm excited to hear about your experiences!

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more ready to face these situations now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Mù. Remember, you’re making progress, and that’s what matters most. See you next time!

User: See you!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've been trying to be more social, as you suggested, but I still feel a bit nervous in gatherings. However, I think I’m slowly getting used to it, even though I still question my ability to manage those situations.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you’re making efforts to be more social, even if it feels challenging at times. Could you share a specific instance where you felt anxious but managed to push through?

User: Well, last weekend, I went to a friend’s birthday party. I felt really anxious about being around so many people, especially when it came to conversing with others. But I ended up engaging in small talk, which I think was a big step for me.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant achievement! Engaging in small talk can be daunting, but you did it. How did you feel during and after the conversation?

User: During the conversation, I was really nervous, but I felt a bit proud of myself afterward. It was nice to connect with friends, but I can't shake off the feeling that I might embarrass myself or say something wrong next time.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way, especially when you're stepping out of your comfort zone. Let's explore those fears a bit. What specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about possibly embarrassing yourself?

User: I often think that if I say something silly, people will laugh at me or judge me. I worry that I won't know how to continue the conversation and that it will just go awkwardly.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite powerful and can contribute to your anxiety. Let’s challenge those beliefs together. What evidence do you have that people would actually laugh at you or judge you? Have you experienced this in your past interactions?

User: I don’t really have strong evidence. I guess it's just a fear I have. In fact, I’ve had some positive experiences where people were very kind and supportive. 

Consultant: That’s a crucial realization! It’s important to remind ourselves of those positive experiences when negative thoughts arise. What if, instead of fearing judgment, you focus on the positive connections you can create? How might that change your approach in social settings?

User: I suppose if I focus on the good moments and the people who appreciate me, it could take some pressure off. I could try to remind myself that most people are understanding and forgiving.

Consultant: Exactly! Shifting your focus to those positive connections can help reduce anxiety. Let's think of a few affirmations or reminders you can tell yourself before entering social situations to reinforce this perspective. What feels supportive for you?

User: Maybe something like, “It’s okay to be myself, and I deserve to enjoy these moments.” That could remind me to relax a bit.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful affirmation! It emphasizes self-acceptance and enjoying the moment. How do you feel about using this affirmation before your next social event?

User: I feel like it could really help. I will definitely try it out.

Consultant: Fantastic! I'm proud of you for doing this. Let’s also think about some social skills you can practice that might help you feel more at ease in conversation. What kind of situations do you find most challenging?

User: I often struggle with keeping the conversation flowing. I sometimes run out of things to say, and then it gets awkward.

Consultant: Keeping the conversation flowing can indeed be tricky. How about preparing a few topics or questions in advance? That way, you can feel more confident in contributing to discussions. What topics do you find interesting?

User: I enjoy discussing movies and books. Maybe I could ask people about their favorites or recent recommendations.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Asking about interests is a good way to keep the conversation engaging. You could even share your own favorites to create a combined dialogue. How do you feel about incorporating this strategy?

User: I feel more prepared to engage in conversations now that I have some ideas. It makes social situations feel less intimidating.

Consultant: That's an excellent shift in perspective! Preparing topics can act like a safety net that allows you to navigate conversations more easily. As you practice these skills, let's discuss how you can recognize your progress. What signs will indicate you’re improving?

User: I think if I notice myself feeling less anxious and if conversations feel more natural, that would be a sign. If I also get positive feedback from friends, that would definitely help.

Consultant: Those are solid indicators! Positive feedback and feeling comfortable in conversation show your growth. Remember to celebrate these small victories. Celebrating them helps reinforce your self-worth. How do you feel about acknowledging your progress regularly?

User: I think I should do that. I usually downplay my successes, but I realize now that recognizing them is important for my growth.

Consultant: Absolutely! Acknowledging your achievements, no matter how small, boosts your confidence and motivation. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the steps we’ve discussed and the progress you’re making?

User: I feel encouraged. I have some strategies to work on and I’m starting to feel more hopeful about social situations.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Remember, it's all about gradual progress, and you’re already making strides. Keep practicing affirmations and conversation topics, and let’s aim to revisit your experiences in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support and guidance. I really feel more positive about this now.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Your openness to change and willingness to try new approaches is inspiring. I look forward to hearing about all the progress you make. Take care until we meet again!

Consultant: Hello, Miao! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling better, actually. The feedback I received from my students and colleagues after the open class really boosted my confidence. But I still feel a bit anxious when it comes to eye contact. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling more confident! It's wonderful that you received positive feedback. You mentioned experiencing some anxiety with eye contact. Can you tell me more about those feelings?

User: Sure. I feel this overwhelming fear when I make eye contact, as if everyone is judging me. It makes me want to avoid situations where I have to interact with others, even though I know I shouldn't feel that way. 

Consultant: That sounds tough, Miao. It’s understandable to feel that way, especially in a teaching environment. Let's try to explore those feelings together. What specific thoughts go through your mind when you find yourself needing to make eye contact?

User: I often think that people will see my anxiety and that they'll think I'm a bad teacher. It's like this voice in my head is constantly criticizing me.

Consultant: It sounds like that inner voice is quite harsh on you. Let's take a moment to identify those thoughts. How would you rate the evidence that supports the idea that others are judging you? Is it possible that there may be other explanations for their reactions?

User: I think I have little evidence actually. My colleagues and students have been supportive, and I received positive feedback. But when I feel anxious, I automatically jump to negative conclusions. 

Consultant: That's a great insight, Miao. It’s common for anxiety to skew our perception of reality. Now, if you were advising a friend in the same situation, what would you tell them about their thoughts and feelings?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on the positive feedback and remind them that everyone gets anxious sometimes. They shouldn’t be too hard on themselves. 

Consultant: That’s valuable advice! It's great that you can extend compassion to others. How might you apply that same compassion to yourself when you feel anxious about eye contact?

User: Maybe I should remind myself of the positive feedback more often and allow myself to feel anxious without judging it too much.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing self-compassion can really help. Now, let’s think about some practical steps. Can we brainstorm a few ways to expose yourself to situations requiring eye contact, gradually and comfortably?

User: Yes, I think starting with small interactions, like greeting colleagues or making eye contact during brief conversations could work. 

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! Starting small can make a big difference. What do you think would be a reasonable goal to set for practicing eye contact in the next week?

User: I could aim to make eye contact with at least one colleague each day when I say hello.

Consultant: That sounds achievable, Miao! Each small step is progress. Alongside that, would you be interested in learning some relaxation techniques to help calm your mind before these interactions?

User: Yes, I think that could really help. I often feel overwhelmed just thinking about making eye contact. 

Consultant: Let’s explore a simple relaxation technique. One effective method is deep breathing. You can try inhaling deeply for four counts, holding for four counts, and exhaling for six counts. Does that sound feasible for you to practice?

User: Yes, I can try that. It sounds easy enough to remember and do.

Consultant: Perfect! Practicing this regularly can help manage your anxiety before situations that require eye contact. Let’s summarize what we discussed today. What are the key takeaways for you?

User: I will focus on my positive experiences, practice making eye contact with colleagues, and use deep breathing to help calm myself.

Consultant: That’s an excellent summary! As you move forward, remember that progress takes time and patience. How do you feel about the steps we outlined today?

User: I feel hopeful! I’m excited to try out these techniques and see how they work for me.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It's important to maintain this positive momentum. Before we conclude, what strategies do you think could help you sustain the progress you've made?

User: I think keeping a journal of my experiences and reminders of the positive feedback could help me stay motivated.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Reflecting on your journey will help reinforce your progress. Remember, you are capable of facing these challenges. I'm proud of what you've accomplished. If you need any support in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your guidance and support. I feel much more confident tackling this.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Miao! I'm confident you'll continue to improve. Take care and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, M! I'm glad to have you here for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling much better, actually. My fear of making eye contact has really improved, and I've even started speaking up in faculty meetings. It feels like a huge step for me!

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear, M! It sounds like you're making significant progress. Can you tell me a bit more about how speaking up in meetings has impacted you?

User: Well, I still feel some nerves before I speak, but once I start talking, it feels empowering. I've received positive feedback from my colleagues, which boosts my confidence.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that the feedback has had such a positive effect on you. How do you feel when you receive that affirmation from your peers?

User: It makes me feel validated and like I actually have something to contribute. It's a nice change from how I used to feel.

Consultant: That sense of validation is important, especially in fostering your confidence. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that arise when you're about to speak in those meetings?

User: Sometimes I think, "What if I mess up?" or "What will they think of me?" But I try to push those thoughts away.

Consultant: Those thoughts are quite common, especially when stepping outside of our comfort zones. What strategies do you use to push those thoughts aside?

User: I remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s okay to not be perfect. I also try to focus on my message rather than on how I am being perceived.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy, M. Shifting focus from self-evaluation to the message can help you feel more at ease. How do you think you can continue to build on this progress moving forward?

User: I guess I could set small goals, like speaking up more often in less formal settings as well. That might help build my confidence further.

Consultant: Setting small and achievable goals is an excellent idea! What kinds of settings can you think of where you might practice this?

User: Maybe during casual team lunches or with friends outside of work. It wouldn't feel as pressured.

Consultant: Those sound like great opportunities! How do you think practicing in these casual settings will help you in the more formal ones?

User: It should help me get used to speaking up without the pressure, which might make it easier when the stakes are higher, like in meetings.

Consultant: Exactly! The more you practice in a comfortable environment, the more your confidence will grow. Would you like to discuss any potential challenges you foresee in this process?

User: I worry that I might backslide if I don’t keep practicing consistently.

Consultant: It's understandable to have that concern. Establishing a consistent practice can certainly be challenging. How might you keep yourself accountable to maintain this practice?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal to track my experiences and how I feel each time I speak up. That might help me see my progress.

Consultant: A journal is a fantastic tool for reflection and accountability! It can help you recognize improvements and also identify areas you'd like to work on. Would you set a plan for regular check-ins with your journal?

User: Yes, I could dedicate a few minutes each week to write in it. That would keep me focused.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! As we summarize your progress today, what would you say has been your biggest takeaway from our sessions?

User: I think it’s realizing that I can overcome my fears, and that practice really helps. I have more faith in myself now.

Consultant: That is a powerful realization! You're right—practice and belief in yourself go hand in hand. As we move forward, what strategies do you think you might use to prevent any potential setbacks?

User: I could remind myself of how far I've come and that it’s normal to have ups and downs. Maybe discussing any setbacks in future sessions could help too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reminding yourself of your progress is key, and I'm always here to help you process any challenges you face. You're doing an incredible job, M. How are you feeling about wrapping up our sessions for now?

User: I feel good about it. I’m actually excited to keep moving forward on my own. It feels like I've got the tools I need now.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! You've developed a lot of practical skills and insights during our time together. Remember, if you ever feel the need for extra support, I'm just a call away. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate all your help throughout this journey.

Consultant: You're very welcome, M! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Take care, and I wish you all the best in your continued growth.
