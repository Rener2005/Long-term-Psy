Consultant: Hello Li Ming, welcome to today's session. I’m glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi. To be honest, I’ve been feeling really anxious and overwhelmed. The project failure still haunts me, and I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about it. It's as if nobody around me understands what I'm going through.

Consultant: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden right now, feeling that people don’t understand your situation. Let's start here. Could you tell me more about what thoughts go through your mind when you think about the project failure?

User: I keep thinking that I’ve let my team down and that I don't belong in my job. It feels like I’m not cut out for this, and I worry that I'll never recover from this.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite intense and discouraging. It’s understandable to feel this way after a setback. How does thinking that you don’t belong in your job make you feel emotionally?

User: It makes me feel worthless and anxious, like I’m stuck in a spiral that I can't get out of. It’s as if I can’t see a way forward.

Consultant: I can see how those feelings of worthlessness and anxiety can be so overwhelming. Let's take a moment to identify if there's a pattern to your thoughts. For instance, do you sometimes notice that you might be thinking in extremes—like all or nothing—about your work situation?

User: Yes, definitely! I often think that if I'm failing at one project, then I'm failing at my job entirely. It’s like I can't separate the two.

Consultant: That’s a common distortion known as 'all-or-nothing thinking.' It tends to exaggerate our mistakes. If you were to step back and look at this situation more objectively, what might be a more balanced perspective?

User: I guess I could think that one failure doesn’t define my entire career. I have had successes too, but it’s hard to see that when I’m feeling down.

Consultant: Exactly! Recognizing your past successes can help to balance those negative thoughts. Can you recall a specific success that you felt proud of in your job?

User: Yes, I remember successfully leading a marketing campaign last year that generated a lot of interest and engagement. It felt great!

Consultant: That's a fantastic accomplishment, Li Ming! Focusing on that success can help remind you of your capabilities. How could you remind yourself of that success when negative thoughts start to creep in?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal or a list of my achievements to look at when I'm feeling low. That might help me stay grounded.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful strategy! Keeping a record of your achievements can certainly serve as a reminder of your strengths. Let’s also discuss your relationships. You mentioned feeling a bit distanced from friends. How have you been handling those connections lately?

User: I’ve just been too wrapped up in my own thoughts to reach out. I feel embarrassed about the project failure, so I avoid talking to them.

Consultant: It's natural to feel hesitant, but avoiding those connections can worsen feelings of loneliness and anxiety. What might happen if you were to reach out to a friend, even just to chat?

User: I suppose it could help me feel less alone, but I’m worried they won’t understand what I’m going through.

Consultant: It can be daunting to open up, but many people find that expressing themselves helps. Is there a friend you feel might be more open to listening, or perhaps someone who has faced similar challenges?

User: Yes, I think my friend Jenny has been through some tough times at work too. I could talk to her.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Sharing your feelings with someone who can relate can be very comforting. How do you feel about making a plan to reach out to her?

User: I’d like to. I think I’ll send her a message tonight. It might be nice to just connect without diving into all the issues right away.

Consultant: That’s a lovely approach, Li Ming. Just a simple catch-up can pave the way for deeper conversations later. As we wrap up today’s session, what are some key takeaways or strategies you've found helpful for addressing your anxiety and reconnecting with friends?

User: I think recognizing my thought patterns and keeping track of my successes will help, along with reaching out to Jenny. I need to remind myself that setbacks are part of the journey.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset to adopt! You’re recognizing that setbacks don’t define your worth or abilities. We’ve made good progress today, and I encourage you to practice these strategies until our next session. Remember, it’s okay to take one step at a time.

User: Thank you, I really appreciate your support today. I feel a little less anxious just talking about everything.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Li Ming! You’re making important strides, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences with these strategies next time. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Li Ming! I'm glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been struggling with the aftermath of the project failure. I still feel anxious and helpless, especially when it comes to interacting with my colleagues. I hope we can work on my confidence today.

Consultant: It sounds like the project failure has really impacted your self-esteem and relationships at work. Let's explore that a bit deeper. Can you tell me more about the thoughts you have when you feel anxious about interacting with your colleagues?

User: Well, whenever I think about talking to them, I worry that they will judge me for the project's outcome. I can't help but feel that they see me as a failure.

Consultant: I can see how those thoughts would contribute to your anxiety. It’s tough to feel judged, especially when you're already under pressure. Can you recall a specific instance where you felt this way, and what thoughts were running through your mind at that moment?

User: Yes, there was a meeting last week where I felt completely out of place. I thought everyone was looking at me, waiting for me to mess up again.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly uncomfortable. It seems like that thought of being judged made you feel even more anxious. What emotions did that trigger for you?

User: I felt a wave of panic and started to sweat. I just wanted to disappear.

Consultant: That makes sense. Experiencing panic in those situations can be overwhelming. Let’s try to examine that thought about being judged. What evidence do you have that your colleagues were actually judging you?

User: In hindsight, probably none. I guess I was projecting my fears onto them. 

Consultant: That's an important realization, Li Ming. Recognizing that these judgments might be more about your own fears than reality can help reshape your perspective. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you advise them to think about?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and it's part of learning. They shouldn’t be so hard on themselves.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective to have for others. Now, let's apply that same kindness to yourself. What if you viewed your situation as a learning opportunity rather than a failure? How might that change your feelings?

User: I suppose it would help me feel less trapped by my mistakes. Maybe I can use this to grow instead of seeing it as the end.

Consultant: Exactly! Shifting your perspective can empower you to take control of the narrative. How do you feel about trying to approach your next interaction with colleagues from this learning mindset instead?

User: I think I could try that. It sounds like a healthier way to think. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Now, let’s discuss some practical steps you could take in your interactions to build your confidence. Have you thought about how you could prepare for your next conversation with a colleague?

User: I could outline some points I want to discuss and maybe even practice them a little before the meeting.

Consultant: Practicing is a fantastic approach! It might also help to visualize a positive interaction. What would that look like for you?

User: I imagine being able to share my thoughts clearly and feeling a sense of ease during the conversation.

Consultant: That’s a great visualization. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. What small steps can you take to approach this conversation with confidence?

User: I could remind myself of my skills and past successes before going into the meeting. 

Consultant: Perfect! Reinforcing your strengths is an excellent strategy. How about we set some realistic goals for your upcoming week to practice this approach?

User: Sure! Maybe my goal could be to initiate at least one conversation with a colleague about work, without overthinking it. 

Consultant: That’s a realistic and achievable goal. Initiating one conversation is a wonderful way to practice. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel more hopeful now! It seems manageable. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up our session today, let's summarize what we've discussed. You have identified negative thoughts, worked on reframing them, and developed a concrete goal to enhance your interactions. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds like I'm actually making progress. 

Consultant: Definitely! And remember, it's okay to feel anxious—that's a natural emotion. With practice, you will gain more confidence. Do you have any last thoughts or questions before we end today?

User: No, I think I'm good! Thank you for your guidance. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li Ming! I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Remember, it's a journey, and every step counts. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Li Ming! It's great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to work on my confidence, especially during high-pressure situations. I still feel a bit nervous, but I think I'm starting to accept that I don't have to be perfect all the time.

Consultant: That's a positive step, acknowledging that perfection isn’t necessary. Can you share a recent situation where you felt that pressure and how you managed it?

User: Well, I had a team meeting last week. I felt pretty anxious at first, but I managed to express my ideas more clearly than before. Still, I could sense my heart racing when I was called on by my manager.

Consultant: It sounds like you made significant progress by sharing your ideas. It’s completely normal to feel anxious when being put on the spot. What do you think contributed to your ability to express yourself during the meeting?

User: I think it was because I prepared some points ahead of time. Knowing I had something to say helped ease my anxiety a bit.

Consultant: Preparation can indeed boost confidence! Let's explore how you can implement this strategy further. In upcoming stressful situations, do you have specific plans to prepare?

User: I plan to jot down some notes before meetings or social events. I think it helps me feel more in control.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! As you prepare, it might also help to visualize yourself successfully navigating these situations. How do you feel about that idea?

User: I like that! Imagining success could definitely help reduce my anxiety.

Consultant: Excellent! Let's practice this visualization technique together. Imagine a scenario where you're in a meeting. What do you see yourself doing?

User: I see myself confident, speaking clearly, and engaging with my colleagues.

Consultant: That’s wonderful imagery! Now, think about the emotions associated with that image. What do you feel when you visualize that?

User: I feel proud and accomplished, and a bit more relaxed too.

Consultant: Perfect! Holding onto those feelings can be very powerful. When you're in a high-pressure situation, remember that visualization to guide your emotions. Have you had any recent social invitations where you could apply these techniques?

User: Yes, I was invited to a friend's gathering this weekend. I’m a bit nervous but excited at the same time.

Consultant: That's a great opportunity to practice what we've discussed! How would you like to prepare for this gathering?

User: I think I can prepare a few topics to discuss with my friends. Maybe even practice some small talk to ease my nerves.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Practicing small talk can definitely help you feel more at ease. Is there anything specific you’re worried about regarding this gathering?

User: I'm worried I might get stuck in silence or not know how to jump into conversations.

Consultant: That’s a common concern. Let’s consider some strategies to manage those silences. One option is to ask open-ended questions or share a funny story. Would you like to brainstorm a few topics or questions that you could use?

User: Sure! I could ask about their recent vacations or share a story about a funny incident at work.

Consultant: Those are both excellent ideas! By preparing those, you’ll have some icebreakers ready to go. As you head into the gathering, what will be your main focus?

User: I want to focus on enjoying the moment and being present instead of overthinking.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset! Focusing on the experience rather than the outcome can significantly reduce pressure. How do you think you will remind yourself to stay in the moment during the gathering?

User: Maybe I can take a few deep breaths before entering the room to ground myself.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a powerful tool! That pause can help center your focus. If you find anxiety creeping in, remind yourself of the confident image we visualized earlier. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! I’ll definitely try that before I enter.

Consultant: Great! After the gathering, I encourage you to reflect on what went well. Write down your experiences and how you felt. This reflection can reinforce your progress. How does that resonate with you?

User: I think journaling about it will help me see how I'm improving. I’ll try to note down my thoughts right after the event.

Consultant: Absolutely! That reflection will serve as a reminder of your growth and successes. As we wrap up, do you feel more confident in using these strategies for your upcoming gathering?

User: Yes, I feel more prepared and optimistic about it now. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m excited for you and look forward to hearing how it goes. Remember, you’re building your confidence step by step. I believe in you!

Consultant: Hello, Li Ming! Welcome to today's session. I'm pleased to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better about social situations. I think I’m starting to accept myself more, but I still get nervous when I face criticism or doubts from others.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling more self-acceptance. Facing criticism can indeed be quite challenging. Can you tell me more about a recent situation where you felt this nervousness due to criticism?

User: Sure, just last week at work, I presented an idea to my team. Some colleagues were supportive, but one person questioned my approach, and I felt my confidence waver.

Consultant: That sounds like a tough experience. It's wonderful that you received support, but it's understandable that criticism can shake your confidence. What thoughts went through your mind when you encountered that criticism?

User: I kept thinking that maybe I shouldn't have shared my idea or that I must be better prepared next time. I felt embarrassed.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like those thoughts led to a lot of self-doubt. Let's explore those thoughts a bit. Do you notice any patterns in how you react to criticism?

User: Yes, I tend to focus on the negative feedback and forget the positive responses. It’s like I only see the one negative comment.

Consultant: That’s quite common—negative comments often stick out more than positive ones. What if we tried to reframe that situation? Can you think of a more balanced way to view the feedback you received?

User: I guess I could remind myself that not everyone will agree with my ideas and that it’s normal to have differing opinions. Plus, there were others who liked it.

Consultant: That's a great realization! Recognizing that differing opinions are normal can help you maintain your confidence. How would it feel to focus on the positive feedback rather than just the negative?

User: It would definitely make me less anxious. I think I need to practice that more often.

Consultant: Practicing this can be really beneficial. To reinforce this strategy, could we simulate a situation where you receive feedback? Imagine a colleague just expressed a critique about your work—what constructive thoughts could you tell yourself in that moment?

User: I could tell myself that one person's opinion doesn't define my worth, and that I can learn from feedback without taking it too personally.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a healthy way to approach criticism. This type of cognitive restructuring helps you challenge negative thoughts. How hopeful are you feeling about handling criticism in social situations now?

User: I feel more hopeful. I can see how I could shift my perspective and not let criticism become so overwhelming.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It sounds like you’re building a solid approach. Just to strengthen this further, what are some scenarios where you can practice these coping strategies?

User: I suppose I can practice during team meetings and try to remind myself of the positive feedback I receive, no matter the criticisms.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Let’s also think about some specific steps you can take if you start to feel overwhelmed again. What could you do in the moment to help ground yourself?

User: I think deep breathing could help, or maybe reminding myself of the positive affirmations we talked about.

Consultant: Deep breathing and positive affirmations are excellent techniques! It's important to have these tools ready for when you feel those nerves creeping back in. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds good! I feel more equipped now.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment to review what we’ve covered today. You've identified ways to reframe criticism and practice maintaining a positive mindset. How do you feel about your progress so far?

User: I feel positive about it! Recognizing the support from my colleagues and focusing on their feedback makes me feel stronger.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Li Ming. As we wrap up, can you think of a strategy you’d like to commit to in the coming weeks to reinforce these skills?

User: I want to keep a journal to note down positive feedback from colleagues, so I can remind myself of it when I feel down.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Keeping a record can really help reinforce those positive feelings and give you a boost when you need it. Remember to celebrate those moments! 

User: Thank you! I'm really grateful for your guidance.

Consultant: You're very welcome! You've made fantastic progress, and I believe you can continue to build on this strength. This will conclude our session today. If you ever need support again, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care!

User: Thank you! I will definitely keep that in mind.

Consultant: Hello, Li Ming! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling good, actually. I've been participating in more social activities and even started planning some team events. It feels great to take on more leadership!

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear you're stepping into a leadership role. How has this new experience been for you overall?

User: It's been quite rewarding, but I still worry about how others perceive my efforts. I often find myself getting anxious when receiving feedback, especially if it's not entirely positive.

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel sensitive to criticism, especially when you're putting yourself out there. Can you share an example of a time when feedback affected you recently?

User: Well, during a team meeting, I suggested an idea, and while some people liked it, others seemed a bit skeptical. I couldn't shake off that skepticism afterward, and it made me doubt my own idea.

Consultant: I can see how that would be challenging for you. It's understandable to feel insecure when faced with differing opinions. What thoughts ran through your mind after that feedback?

User: I immediately thought that maybe my idea was stupid or that I shouldn't have spoken up at all. I just felt embarrassed.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem quite critical of yourself. Let's take a moment to reflect on them. What evidence do you have that supports those thoughts? Is there any other way to view the situation?

User: I guess, looking back, it wasn't a stupid idea. Some liked it; I just focused too much on the negative feedback. I also remembered that I was brave to share it in the first place.

Consultant: That's an important realization! It's common to focus on the negatives while overlooking the positives. How do you feel about the idea of challenging those critical thoughts when they arise?

User: I think it's worth a try. I definitely want to feel more confident in my contributions.

Consultant: That's a great attitude! We can work on reframing those thoughts into something more realistic and positive. Instead of thinking "my idea was stupid," you could say, "Not everyone will agree, but some liked my idea, and that matters." How does that sound?

User: That sounds more balanced. I could remind myself that differing opinions are just part of collaboration.

Consultant: Exactly! Collaboration often involves a variety of perspectives. It's great that you're recognizing this. What are some other strategies you think might help maintain your confidence during these situations?

User: Maybe I could practice self-affirmations before meetings to remind myself of my strengths. 

Consultant: Self-affirmations could be very beneficial. Affirming your strengths can help quiet that inner critic. Which strengths would you like to affirm specifically?

User: I want to focus on my creativity and willingness to lead. Those are things I genuinely believe in.

Consultant: Excellent choices! Building a routine around those affirmations can strengthen your confidence. How do you envision incorporating this into your routine before social or work events?

User: I could take a few minutes to reflect on my accomplishments and say positive things to myself before each meeting or event.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Reflecting on your achievements can really help boost your self-esteem. Have you noticed any patterns in your interactions that you want to address further?

User: I often find myself being too hard on myself if things don’t go perfectly during these events. 

Consultant: It's completely understandable to have such feelings, especially when you care about your performance. Let's explore why perfection matters to you. What do you think drives this need for perfection?

User: I guess I fear letting my team down or that others might think I'm not capable if I make mistakes.

Consultant: It sounds like you're placing a lot of pressure on yourself to meet expectations. Can we consider that making mistakes is a normal part of growth and learning?

User: You're right. Mistakes can teach us things. I just need to remind myself of that when I feel anxious.

Consultant: Absolutely. Adopting a growth mindset can be very helpful. Next time you feel anxious about making mistakes, what could you tell yourself instead?

User: I could say, "It's okay to make mistakes; they can help me improve." That sounds more encouraging.

Consultant: That's a great affirmation to practice! It's all about re-framing those thoughts. As we wrap up today, let's summarize the progress you've made and explore future strategies. How do you feel about what we've discussed?

User: I feel more equipped to handle feedback and my reactions to it. I definitely want to keep working on my self-talk!

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! You're making significant strides. As we continue this journey, I encourage you to embrace your growth and stay mindful of your affirmations. How do you plan to maintain this positive momentum moving forward?

User: I plan to set reminders for my affirmations and perhaps keep a journal of my progress. This way, I'll have a tangible way to track my growth!

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful strategy! Journaling can also help you reflect on your experiences and feelings. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. You have the skills to manage your emotional responses. If you experience any challenges, we can always address them in our next session.

User: Thank you! I feel much more hopeful and positive about my abilities now.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Li Ming! I'm proud of the progress you've made today. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support along the way. You’re doing great, and I look forward to our next session. Goodbye for now!

User: Goodbye! Thank you once again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li Ming! It's great to see you again. Today, I'd like to discuss your progress during our sessions and how we can create a plan to maintain and further develop the positive changes you've experienced. How are you feeling about everything that's happened lately?

User: Hi! I feel really good, actually. Winning that award at work and getting recognition from friends has boosted my confidence tremendously. I've been more social than ever, and it feels great.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve enjoyed both professional and personal affirmation. Can you elaborate on how these experiences have changed your outlook or overall feelings?

User: Sure! I used to be a bit apprehensive about engaging in social situations, but now I feel more comfortable and even excited about meeting new people. It’s like I’ve found a new side of myself.

Consultant: That's a significant shift, Li Ming! Challenging yourself socially has proven rewarding. What strategies do you think helped you to step out of your comfort zone?

User: I think it’s really about being more open to experiences. I told myself to just go for it and not overthink things. That mindset has helped me a lot.

Consultant: It sounds like adopting a more open mindset has made a big difference for you. How do you feel about maintaining this mindset moving forward? 

User: I want to keep it up, but sometimes I worry that I might backtrack into my old habits. I don’t want to lose this confidence.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. Let's explore ways to reinforce this newfound confidence and ensure you have strategies in place should you encounter challenges. What do you think might help you stay on track?

User: Maybe setting small goals for social interactions could help, like attending one event each week or reaching out to friends more often.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Setting manageable social goals can keep you motivated and engaged. How do you feel about using specific experiences from our sessions to guide you on this journey? 

User: I think that would be useful. Reflecting on what I’ve learned and how I felt in different situations can remind me of my growth.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflection can reinforce your progress. How about journaling about your experiences? It could serve as a tool to track your feelings and milestones.

User: That sounds like a good plan! Writing things down might help solidify these changes in my mind. 

Consultant: Great! Alongside journaling, would you be interested in practicing coping strategies when you face anxiety or apprehension in social settings? 

User: Yes, I definitely want to have those strategies ready. It’d make me feel more secure in those moments.

Consultant: Wonderful! We can focus on techniques like deep breathing or positive self-talk. Have you had any experience with those methods in the past? 

User: I’ve tried deep breathing a bit, especially when I start feeling overwhelmed, but I’d like to learn more about positive self-talk.

Consultant: That’s a valuable skill to develop! Positive self-talk can really shift your mindset. For instance, replacing negative thoughts with affirmations like “I am capable” or “I can handle this” can be effective. How do you see yourself applying this?

User: I think I can start by recognizing when I have negative thoughts and actively replacing them with those affirmations. It could help a lot!

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach, Li Ming! Recognizing those thoughts is the first step. As you continue to practice these techniques, how do you envision your social interactions evolving?

User: I see myself being even more confident in approaching people and initiating conversations. I think it will feel natural over time.

Consultant: That's a beautiful vision! Your proactive mindset will certainly help you reach that point. How about we establish a timeline where you can evaluate your progress every few weeks?

User: Yes, regular check-ins would be helpful. I can adjust my goals based on how I feel and what I experience.

Consultant: Perfect! Together, we can review your progress and make necessary adjustments to ensure you're on a steady path of growth. Is there anything else you would like to explore today?

User: I feel pretty good about everything, actually. I just want to make sure I don’t lose this momentum!

Consultant: Maintaining momentum is key, and it sounds like you have a strong foundation moving forward. To summarize, we will set social goals, journal your experiences, practice positive self-talk, and have regular check-ins. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I'm excited to put this plan into action.

Consultant: I'm excited for you as well! You've made impressive progress, Li Ming. Remember that it’s okay to face ups and downs; what matters is how you navigate through them. 

User: Thank you! This talk has really clarified things for me.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. As we wrap up this session, remember that you can always reach out if you need support. You've equipped yourself with many tools that will serve you well on this continued journey.

User: I’ll keep that in mind. Thank you for all your guidance! 

Consultant: It’s been my pleasure, Li Ming. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!

User: You too!
