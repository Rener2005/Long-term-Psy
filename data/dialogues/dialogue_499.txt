Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. I know that adjusting to life at boarding school has been tough for you lately. Can you share more about how you've been feeling recently?

User: Hi. Yeah, it’s been really hard. I feel lonely all the time and I just kind of want to cry. I don’t know how to handle it. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of sadness and loneliness. Those feelings can be really difficult to deal with. Can you think of any specific moments recently when you felt particularly low?

User: Well, last week I was sitting in the common room, and everyone was talking, but I just felt so out of place. I didn’t know how to join in, and I ended up just sitting there, feeling like I was invisible.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s painful to feel invisible, especially in a social situation. When you were sitting there and feeling this way, what thoughts were running through your mind?

User: I kept thinking that nobody would want to talk to me anyway. I felt like I didn't belong there.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like you had some very negative thoughts about yourself in that moment. Do you think these thoughts contributed to how you felt in that situation?

User: Definitely. I just kept convincing myself that I was too awkward to join in.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, but let’s explore that thought a bit. What evidence do you have that you are too awkward? Have there been times where you felt more confident to engage with others?

User: Sometimes I talk to my roommate, and it’s fine. But I guess I just freeze up when I’m in larger groups.

Consultant: That's a good observation! It seems like you can interact well in smaller settings. So, when you think about those larger groups, what specific thoughts do you have that trigger your freeze response?

User: I start thinking they won’t want to hear what I have to say, and I just become silent.

Consultant: Let’s challenge that thought. Can you think of a time when you shared something in a group, and people responded positively?

User: Well, I did share a story during one of our team meetings, and everyone laughed. It felt nice.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It indicates that your contributions can be appreciated. Perhaps we can consider ways to remind yourself of that positive experience when you're in a larger group. How does that sound?

User: That could help. I just need to remember that not everyone is judging me.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s often our own thoughts that hold us back. Let's also discuss some practical strategies you can use when you find yourself in those larger social settings. What do you think could help you feel more at ease?

User: Maybe I could practice what I want to say beforehand or even just focus on listening to others.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Practicing can build your confidence, and focusing on listening can take the pressure off you to speak right away. Would you be open to trying that in your next group situation?

User: Yes, I can try that. 

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Now, let’s think broader. In what other situations might you be feeling a similar way? Can you identify any patterns that are causing your feelings of loneliness?

User: I guess when I see other friends having fun together, I often feel left out and wish I could be part of them.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It's natural to feel a sense of longing when you see groups of friends enjoying themselves. This could be a reminder of how you value connection. What thoughts do you have about those moments when you feel left out?

User: I usually think that I must be doing something wrong, or that people just don’t want to include me.

Consultant: It’s painful to feel that way. But I wonder—do you think there might be other explanations for why you feel left out? For example, could it be that they’re not aware of how you feel?

User: Maybe. I guess sometimes I don’t reach out either because I feel too shy.

Consultant: That’s a crucial insight! Taking the first step to reach out could change the dynamics. What are some small actions you could try to connect with those friends or groups more actively?

User: I could send a message to someone inviting them to hang out. 

Consultant: That’s a very proactive step! Initiating contact can be a powerful way to break the cycle of isolation. How might you feel about reaching out to someone this week?

User: I think I could do that. I just hope they’ll want to hang out.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel that way. But remember, reaching out doesn’t mean you’re imposing. Most people appreciate invitations. How about we make a plan for how you might feel comfortable taking that step?

User: Okay. Maybe I could text my roommate first since I feel more comfortable with her.

Consultant: That's a perfect place to start! Connecting with someone who makes you feel secure can be a great way to build confidence. How would you feel after sending that message?

User: I would feel a bit nervous but also relieved to try.

Consultant: That's completely understandable! Recognizing that mix of emotions shows that you’re stepping out of your comfort zone. It's all part of the process. 

User: I guess I just need to take it one step at a time. 

Consultant: Exactly! Small steps lead to bigger changes over time. Remember, you've already made great strides by reflecting on your feelings. How can you remind yourself of this progress when you're feeling down?

User: Maybe I could keep a journal of these moments when I do something outside my comfort zone. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Journaling will help reinforce your achievements and remind you of your growth. It’s a powerful tool for self-reflection. 

User: I feel a bit more hopeful now. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up today's session, let’s reflect on what you've learned today and how you can apply it in the upcoming week. 

User: I think I’ve learned that I have the ability to reach out and connect with others. 

Consultant: Absolutely! That's a valuable insight. Remember, it’s okay to feel anxious; it’s all part of the journey. You now have some strategies to help you navigate these feelings. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate the support.

Consultant: You're welcome! It’s been a pleasure talking with you today. Remember that these feelings can change, and you have the tools to help you adapt. If you ever feel overwhelmed, I'm here whenever you need support again. 

User: Thank you! I feel more prepared now. 

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately, especially regarding your interactions with classmates?

User: Hi, I've been feeling quite anxious. In class, I often worry about not participating enough and wonder if my classmates misunderstand me. It’s really stressful.

Consultant: I can see how that would create a lot of pressure for you. It's tough feeling anxious about how others perceive you while trying to focus on your studies. Can you share what specific thoughts go through your mind when you think about these situations?

User: Well, I often think that if I don't speak up, my classmates will think I'm not smart or that I don’t care about the class. It makes me feel really small and unimportant.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It seems like you feel a lot of pressure to prove your intelligence and engagement in class. It might help to explore whether those thoughts are entirely accurate. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts those thoughts?

User: I guess sometimes I do get good grades, and some of my classmates ask me for help. But I still feel like I'm not as good as they think I am.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that your classmates recognize your abilities and seek your help. That suggests they value your contributions. Let’s consider this: if a friend were in your shoes, how would you reassure them about their worth in the classroom?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone has strengths and weaknesses and that their opinions matter just like everyone else's.

Consultant: That’s really insightful! It sounds like you recognize that everyone has their unique strengths. So, what if you started applying that same kindness and understanding to yourself, giving yourself permission to participate without fear of judgment?

User: I haven’t thought about it that way. It feels like I'm being too hard on myself.

Consultant: It’s common to be our own harshest critics. Would you be open to trying some encouraging self-talk next time you're in class? For example, reminding yourself that it's okay to participate even if you feel nervous?

User: I think I could try that. Maybe I can tell myself it’s fine to speak slowly and take my time.

Consultant: That's a fantastic approach! Taking your time can reduce the pressure significantly. Let's also think about some small, manageable steps you could take in your next class to engage more. What might those steps be?

User: Maybe I could raise my hand once during the next class to answer a question. That seems doable.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent plan! Starting small can help build your confidence over time. How do you feel about setting that goal for yourself?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited to try. Maybe it will help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: Nervousness is completely natural, especially when you're stepping out of your comfort zone. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. How do you envision your classmates reacting when you participate?

User: I think they would be supportive. They seem nice, and I'm probably overthinking it.

Consultant: It’s great that you believe they would be supportive! Recognizing that can help you feel more encouraged to engage with them. How can you remind yourself of their support when you feel anxious?

User: I could remind myself of the times they've smiled at me or included me in conversations. That should help.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on these positive interactions can help shift your perspective. Let’s also talk about how you can build deeper connections with your classmates outside of class. What activities do you enjoy that involve others?

User: I like playing games and participating in group projects. Those are fun and less stressful.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent opportunities to connect! Have you thought about suggesting a game or a study group to your classmates?

User: I haven’t, but I think it might be a good idea. I could suggest a group study session or a game night.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Engaging in shared activities can help strengthen your bonds with them, and it might feel more relaxed than formal interactions. How do you think you would feel after initiating one of those?

User: I think I’d feel proud of myself. It might help me feel more connected to them.

Consultant: That pride is important! Taking those steps can greatly enhance your confidence in social situations. What emotions do you expect to experience as you start engaging more?

User: I hope to feel more confident and maybe even happy. I really want to connect with others.

Consultant: Those are beautiful intentions! Fostering connections and enhancing your confidence could significantly shift your experience in school. Remember, it’s a journey, and every small step counts. What are your key takeaways from our session today that you want to remember?

User: I want to remember to be kinder to myself, to take small steps in class, and to try to connect with others through games or study sessions. 

Consultant: Those are fantastic insights! I believe in your ability to make these changes, and I’m here to support you. As we wrap up our session, how are you feeling about everything we’ve discussed?

User: I feel hopeful and excited to try these suggestions. Thank you for your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been great talking with you today. Remember, be patient with yourself, and take it one step at a time. If you find yourself needing further support, please don't hesitate to reach out again. 

User: I will, thank you! I really appreciate it.
###################
Consultant: Hello, it's great to see you today! How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been thinking a lot about my interactions with classmates. I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of social connections. It's a bit overwhelming.

Consultant: I can understand how you feel. It sounds like you're really yearning for more connection and interaction. Can you tell me more about the specific interactions or activities where you've felt this way?

User: Well, during class activities or group projects, I often find myself just sitting back and not participating much. I worry that other students might think I'm unfriendly or uninterested.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way. It seems like you're concerned about how others perceive you. Can you share what thoughts come to your mind when you're in those situations? 

User: I often think that people might judge me for not contributing enough. Sometimes I feel too shy to speak up or join in.

Consultant: That's understandable. It's common to have those thoughts. Let’s explore those feelings a bit more. When you feel shy, what kind of emotions does that create for you?

User: I feel anxious and a bit sad because I want to connect with them, but I just don't know how.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It seems like there's a real desire to connect mixed with feelings of anxiety and sadness. If we think about those feelings in a different light, what might be a more positive thought you could tell yourself in those moments?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it’s okay to take small steps and that others might be feeling the same way. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful thought! It’s great that you’re open to that perspective. Let's talk about some small steps you can take to engage more without feeling overwhelmed. What could be a simple action you can take during a class activity?

User: Perhaps I could start by just saying hi to one person before or after class. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! Saying hi is a small but meaningful gesture. How do you feel about setting that as your goal for the next week?

User: I think I could try that. It sounds manageable.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Setting manageable goals is a smart way to ease into interactions. How do you think you will feel after achieving that goal?

User: I hope I would feel a bit more confident and maybe even open up more in group activities.

Consultant: Absolutely! Confidence can grow with each small step. Besides saying hi, is there anything else you’d like to try in those group activities?

User: Maybe I could suggest a simple game for the class or something to loosen things up.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Suggesting a game could be a great way to engage others and have fun at the same time. What specific game do you think would work well?

User: Something simple like a quick icebreaker game. 

Consultant: That’s perfect! Icebreakers can help everyone feel more comfortable. How do you think you can approach suggesting it to your classmates?

User: I could bring it up to the teacher or just mention it during a group discussion.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Approaching the teacher might also provide additional support. If you encounter any hesitation or fear when suggesting your ideas, what could you remind yourself again?

User: I can remind myself that everyone is there to have a good time, just like me.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on the shared experience can ease anxiety. Can we touch on how you’ll track your progress with this over the next few weeks?

User: Maybe I could keep a small journal to note down how it goes each time I try it.

Consultant: Writing it down is a wonderful way to reflect on your experiences. It’ll help you notice any changes in your feelings or interactions. Thinking about this journaling exercise, how do you envision it benefiting you?

User: I think it will help me see how I improve over time, and it might make me feel proud of the little steps I take.

Consultant: That’s a positive outcome to aim for! Recognizing your progress can boost your motivation. As we conclude today, let’s summarize what you've planned to do before our next session.

User: I’ll start by saying hi to classmates, suggest a game during activities, and keep a journal about how it goes.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid action plan. I’m really proud of you for taking these steps! Remember, it’s okay to feel a bit nervous, but each step is progress. If you encounter difficulties, we can explore them together next time.

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about trying now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! I look forward to hearing about your experiences. Take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hi there! It’s great to see you again. I remember last time we talked about your recent experiences in the dorm and how it helped you feel more connected. How are you feeling about those interactions now?

User: Hi! I'm feeling a bit more open to socializing. I had a really nice time chatting with my roommates, and it felt good to have something in common with them. But I still feel a bit anxious at times.

Consultant: That’s a positive step forward! It sounds like finding common ground with your roommates helped to ease some of your anxiety. Can you share what specific topics you discussed that made you feel more connected?

User: We talked about our favorite movies and some TV shows we watch. It was nice to laugh about them together, and it didn't feel as awkward as I thought it would.

Consultant: Laughter can indeed help build connections. It’s wonderful that you found such a comfortable topic to discuss! How do you think that experience influenced your feelings about spending time with them in the future?

User: I think it made me realize that I can have fun with them. I am looking forward to hanging out more but sometimes I worry about what to say or how to keep the conversation going.

Consultant: It's natural to feel a bit anxious about maintaining conversations. Let’s explore those feelings. What kinds of thoughts go through your mind when you worry about running out of things to say?

User: I often think that I’ll just sit there awkwardly, and they might get bored or not want to talk to me anymore. It feels really stressful.

Consultant: Those thoughts can certainly create a lot of pressure. Let’s challenge that idea a bit. What evidence do you have that they would feel bored? Have you noticed any signs from them that suggest they’re not enjoying the conversation?

User: No, actually, they seemed to enjoy what we were talking about. I guess I'm just overthinking it. 

Consultant: It’s common to overthink in social situations, especially when you're investing effort into connecting with others. If you were to take a step back, how would you encourage a friend in your position to think differently about the conversation?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay to pause sometimes and that they should focus on enjoying the moment instead of worrying.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective to have! Reminding yourself that pauses are fine and that enjoyment is key can help ease that pressure. Would you like to set a small goal for your next interaction with your roommates based on this insight?

User: Maybe I could aim to share a funny story or a joke during our next chat. That would make it more fun!

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Sharing a story or a joke can help lighten the mood and take pressure off both you and your roommates. How do you feel about setting that as a goal for the next time you all hang out?

User: I feel excited about it! I’ll definitely try to think of something funny to share.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It sounds like you're building a solid foundation for further interactions. As we look ahead, how else can you continue to foster these connections with your roommates?

User: I could suggest we watch a movie together or start a group activity. I think being active together will help break the ice more.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant strategy! Engaging in activities can certainly help ease anxiety and encourage conversation. How do you feel about initiating one of those activities this week?

User: I think I could propose a movie night. I just need to find a good time to bring it up.

Consultant: Absolutely! Timing can make all the difference. What could help you feel more comfortable when you suggest this idea to your roommates?

User: Maybe if I just casually mention it when we’re talking, it wouldn’t feel as daunting. I can say something like, “Hey, how about a movie night?”

Consultant: That sounds like a relaxed approach. Casual and friendly can really make your suggestion feel more inviting! How does that thought make you feel?

User: It makes me feel less anxious. I’ve been wanting to do it, but this way seems much easier.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s amazing how a small shift in perspective can ease anxiety. Have you experienced any positive changes in your mood since you’ve started opening up to your roommates?

User: Yes! I feel lighter and happier after those conversations. It boosts my mood when I connect with them.

Consultant: That’s an excellent realization! Maintaining those interactions can reinforce that positive feeling. As you continue to engage more, how can you remind yourself of the joy it brings?

User: I can keep a little journal and note down whenever we have a good chat or when I feel happy after spending time with them.

Consultant: A journal sounds like a wonderful idea! Reflecting on those positive experiences can strengthen your confidence and motivation. How does thinking about keeping a journal make you feel about your social interactions?

User: It feels like a nice way to remind myself of the good times we have! I think it would really help.

Consultant: Definitely! It’s a constructive way to reflect and celebrate your progress. Before we wrap up today, what would you say is your major takeaway from our session?

User: I believe I should focus on enjoying the conversations rather than worrying about them. Setting small goals for interactions sounds helpful too!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic insight! Remember, the more you practice those small goals, the more natural it will become. I’m really proud of the progress you’ve made. Looking forward to hearing how your movie night goes next time we meet!

User: Thank you! I feel more empowered about my social interactions now. I’ll definitely update you next time.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm glad to help. Take care, and enjoy those moments with your roommates. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling really good actually. The group activities have made me feel more connected and motivated to be around others.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear that the group activities have had a positive impact on you. Could you tell me more about what you enjoyed about those activities?

User: I enjoyed the teamwork and how everyone contributed their ideas. It felt nice to be part of something together.

Consultant: Being part of a team can be really rewarding. It's amazing that you were able to connect with others through collaboration. How did this experience affect your willingness to participate in more group activities?

User: I feel more encouraged to join in. I even want to suggest some new activities to the group.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic sign of your growth! Suggesting activities shows confidence and initiative. What kinds of activities are you thinking about suggesting?

User: Maybe some fun outdoor games or creative projects. I think it could be a great way to bond and have fun together.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent ideas! Fun and creativity can really enhance group dynamics. How do you feel about approaching your peers with these suggestions?

User: I’m a bit nervous, but excited too. I want to share my ideas, but I worry about how they’ll react.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous when sharing ideas. Let's explore that a bit. What specific thoughts or fears do you have about their possible reactions?

User: I guess I’m afraid they might not think my ideas are good or that they’ll ignore me.

Consultant: I see. So, you're concerned about not being accepted or valued in the group. Can we challenge that thought together? What evidence do you have that they might ignore your suggestions?

User: Well, I haven’t really talked to them about it yet, so I’m not sure. They might actually like the ideas.

Consultant: Exactly! Your fear is based on assumptions rather than facts. If you were to frame it differently, what positive outcomes can you envision from sharing your ideas? 

User: They might actually enjoy it and we could have a lot of fun together. 

Consultant: Yes! Seeing it as a potential positive experience can really shift your perspective. What steps can you take to prepare for this discussion with your group?

User: Maybe I could practice what I want to say. That might help me feel more confident.

Consultant: Practicing is a great strategy! It can help you articulate your thoughts more clearly. Would you like to role-play that conversation together?

User: Yes, I think that would be helpful!

Consultant: Wonderful! Let's imagine you're introducing your idea about the outdoor games. Please start whenever you're ready.

User: Okay… "Hey everyone, I was thinking we could try some outdoor games next week! I think it could be really fun and help us bond more as a team."

Consultant: That was a great start! You used a friendly tone and presented your idea clearly. How did saying that feel for you?

User: It felt a bit freeing, actually! I can see how it could be fun.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! The more you practice, the more comfortable you will become. Let’s think about how you can also encourage feedback from your peers after you present your idea. How could you ask them for their thoughts?

User: Maybe I could say, "What do you all think? Do you have any other ideas to add?"

Consultant: Perfect! Inviting their input fosters a collaborative environment. You’re on the right track! How does it feel to visualize this idea-sharing process?

User: It makes me feel more optimistic about it. I think I can do this!

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! It’s important to hold onto that optimism. Before we wrap up, let's reflect on your progress. What have you learned about your communication and social skills during our sessions?

User: I’ve learned that I can express myself better than I thought and that my ideas might actually be valuable to others.

Consultant: That's a fantastic realization! Recognizing your value is key to building confidence. As you continue your journey, what strategies can you use to maintain this positive mindset?

User: I can remind myself of this experience and trust that my thoughts and feelings are important.

Consultant: Absolutely! Keeping that positive affirmation in mind will guide you in future interactions. Our session today has been productive. Do you feel satisfied with what we discussed?

User: Yes! I feel motivated to put myself out there and participate more.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! I look forward to hearing how your attempts go in our next session. Remember, you've made great progress, and I'm here if you need support along the way.

User: Thank you so much! I can’t wait to share my experiences next time.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Until next time, take care and keep engaging with those around you.
###################
Consultant: Hello, I'm really pleased to see you today! It seems like you've made significant progress. How are you feeling about your social interactions and emotional stability lately?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling good. I’ve been more active socially and have noticed that I am more confident in group settings.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Confidence in social situations can be quite empowering. Can you share a specific instance where you felt your confidence really shine through?

User: Well, during our last group project, I contributed a lot more than I usually do. I spoke up during discussions and even helped organize our tasks, which felt really satisfying.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic achievement, and it's great that you took on a leadership role. How did that experience make you feel afterwards?

User: I felt proud and relieved. Unlike before, I didn’t worry excessively about what others thought. I actually enjoyed being part of the team.

Consultant: Enjoyment in teamwork is a significant step forward! It shows that you're creating meaningful connections without being overwhelmed by anxiety. Have you noticed any other changes in how you interact with others?

User: Yes, I think I’m more open when talking to my classmates. I initiate conversations now instead of just waiting for them to talk to me, which is a big change for me.

Consultant: That’s a big stride! Positive interactions can greatly enhance your overall wellbeing. Can you tell me about a conversation you initiated that made you feel good?

User: I chatted with a classmate about a book we both read. It was nice to share my thoughts, and they seemed interested. I felt like I was making a genuine connection.

Consultant: Making a genuine connection can be incredibly fulfilling. You’ve clearly built a foundation of trust, which is vital for deeper relationships. Looking back, what do you think has contributed to this positive shift in your social behavior?

User: I think becoming more self-aware and focusing on positive thoughts helped. I’ve also tried to remind myself that it’s okay to be myself and make mistakes.

Consultant: Self-awareness and acceptance are powerful tools for personal growth. What specific strategies have you used to maintain this positive mindset?

User: I’ve been practicing positive affirmations and trying to reframe negative thoughts. It’s a work in progress, but it helps boost my confidence.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach. Positive affirmations can really reshape your thinking process. As we continue, let’s consider how to maintain and build upon this progress. How do you feel about setting some goals for your social interactions in the upcoming weeks?

User: That sounds good! I’d like to keep improving my communication skills and maybe join a club to meet more people.

Consultant: Joining a club can be a great way to expand your social circle and connect with like-minded individuals. What type of club are you interested in?

User: I’m thinking about joining the book club or the art club since I enjoy both reading and drawing.

Consultant: Both clubs sound perfect for you! Engaging in activities you love will likely help you feel more comfortable and confident around new people. What steps do you think you can take to make joining one of these clubs happen?

User: I can look up the meeting times and sign up. I might also invite a friend to join me so that I don’t feel too nervous.

Consultant: Inviting a friend is a smart idea! Having support can ease those first-time jitters. How have you been managing any feelings of nervousness that might arise when facing new social situations?

User: I try to remind myself of past successes, like the group project. Imagining how the situation will go positively also helps reduce the anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Visualization can be a powerful ally. Would it be helpful for you to come up with a few scenarios you could visualize that would be positive when joining the clubs?

User: Yes, I think imagining myself feeling comfortable and engaging happily with others will motivate me.

Consultant: Absolutely, those visualizations will reinforce your confidence. As our session comes to a close, let’s review your progress. What do you feel has been your biggest accomplishment since we began our sessions?

User: I think the biggest accomplishment is realizing I can connect with people. It’s a huge step for me!

Consultant: That’s a significant milestone! Acknowledging your growth is essential for long-term success. As you continue to nurture these skills, remember that it’s perfectly okay to seek support whenever you need it. You’ve done a remarkable job, and I believe you can keep moving forward with confidence. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance. I feel more equipped to handle social situations now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you and witnessing your progress. Keep building on what you’ve learned, and remember, you are capable of managing your emotions and fostering new connections. Don't hesitate to return if you have more to explore in the future. 

User: I will! Thank you again. 

Consultant: Take care and best of luck with the clubs! I look forward to hearing about your experiences. Goodbye for now!
