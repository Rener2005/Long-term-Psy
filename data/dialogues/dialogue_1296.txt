Consultant: Hello, Xiao Zhang! Welcome to today's session. I want to start by checking in on how you've been feeling since our last meeting. Can you share what’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. I've been having a tough time. I keep thinking about my experiences in the military, and it's like I can't escape those memories. It makes everyday life really hard for me.

Consultant: I see that those memories are creating a significant impact on your daily life. It’s understandable to struggle with that. Can you tell me more about how these memories affect your feelings and daily activities?

User: Well, when I think about those times, I feel anxious and sometimes even angry. I find myself avoiding certain situations or conversations that remind me of the military. It's frustrating because I want to move on, but I feel stuck.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of avoidance, which is a common reaction to overwhelming thoughts and feelings. What kind of situations do you find yourself avoiding most often?

User: I try to steer clear of loud noises, and I avoid certain places that remind me of being in service. I just don’t want to feel that panic again.

Consultant: That makes sense. The panic must feel quite distressing. Let’s explore those feelings a bit more. Can you describe what goes through your mind when you encounter one of these triggers?

User: When I hear loud sounds, my mind races. I think I might be in danger, like something bad is about to happen. It makes me feel like I need to run away from whatever's causing the noise.

Consultant: It sounds like your mind is creating a strong connection between those sounds and danger, which leads to panic. What evidence do you have that suggests you're in danger when you hear these sounds?

User: I don't really have any evidence; it just feels that way in the moment. I know it's probably irrational, but it's hard to fight that feeling.

Consultant: Acknowledging that feeling is an important step. Sometimes our emotions can be convincing, even if they aren’t based on the current reality. If a friend were in a similar situation, what would you tell them about their feelings?

User: I’d tell them to try to stay calm and remind themselves that they’re safe, that the sound isn't a threat. But it’s different when it’s me; it's like I can't think rationally.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight. It’s much easier to give advice than to follow it ourselves. Let's think about how you might apply that same logic to your experience. What would happen if you challenged that immediate feeling of fear and reminded yourself that you are safe?

User: I guess I might be able to deal with it better instead of running away. But it’s hard to remember that in the moment.

Consultant: You're absolutely right—remembering that isn't easy, especially in the heat of the moment. What if we worked together on some strategies you could use to remind yourself of your safety in those situations?

User: That could be helpful. I’d like to have something to focus on other than the panic.

Consultant: Great! One idea is to create a grounding statement you can remind yourself of in those moments. Something like, “I am safe, and I am in control.” How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds okay. I think having something to say to myself might help calm me down, if I can remember it.

Consultant: Yes! And we can practice it together. Additionally, we could try some gradual exposure to those sounds in a controlled way, so you can build up your tolerance gradually. What do you think about starting with that?

User: That makes sense. Starting small sounds less intimidating. I just worry I might panic anyway.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. We’ll take it step by step, and you’ll have the chance to see that you can handle those feelings. Would you like to explore a particular sound or situation we could start with?

User: Maybe we could try getting used to the sound of a thunderstorm or something similar? That usually makes me really anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan. We can find a recorded sound of a thunderstorm and listen to it at a low volume together. I’ll guide you through that experience. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I’m nervous, but I’m willing to give it a try.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous, but remember this is a safe space. You’re taking a brave step by wanting to confront this. Would you like to schedule a time to try this out?

User: Yes, let’s do that. I think starting next week would be good for me.

Consultant: Perfect! We’ll go through that exercise next week, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. For this week, it might be helpful to practice your grounding statement a few times a day. How does that sound?

User: I can definitely try that. I’ll write it down to remember.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Writing it down will make it easier to recall when you need it. Before we wrap up, is there anything else on your mind that you’d like to share today?

User: Not really, I think I’ve said what I needed to. I feel a bit lighter, actually, after talking about it.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s great that you feel a bit lighter. Remember, taking these small steps is important for your journey. I look forward to our next session. Take care of yourself.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. See you next week!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Zhang! I'm glad you're here for our session today. I want to start by discussing how you've been feeling lately, especially with the social activities you've been trying to re-engage in.

User: Hi. Thanks for seeing me again. I've been feeling really anxious. Although I’m trying to get out and meet people, I often feel a wave of panic during these events. It's very uncomfortable.

Consultant: I can understand how daunting that must feel for you. It's great that you've made the effort to participate in social activities despite the anxiety. Can you tell me about a specific situation where you felt particularly panicked?

User: The last time I went to a gathering, I thought I would do fine. But suddenly there were loud noises and a lot of people talking, and I started to feel overwhelmed. It felt like I couldn't breathe properly.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, especially when you were trying to enjoy the gathering. It’s understandable that sudden loud noises can trigger intense feelings of panic. When that happened, what thoughts went through your mind?

User: I thought I would look silly if I panicked in front of everyone. What if they noticed how anxious I was? That made it worse, and I wanted to leave immediately.

Consultant: It's common to worry about how others perceive us, especially in social situations. It sounds like your thoughts led to even more stress. Would you say that this is a pattern you notice in other situations too?

User: Yes, definitely. Whenever I feel anxiety creeping in, I start to think about what others might think of me. I end up focusing so much on those thoughts that it paralyzes me.

Consultant: So the pressure of how others might see you can really intensify your feelings of anxiety. Let's explore this together. How about we work on recognizing these thoughts when they come up and see if we can replace some of those negative interpretations?

User: That sounds okay. I just need to find a way to calm my mind during these moments.

Consultant: Absolutely! Part of our work will involve some relaxation techniques to help you manage those feelings in the moment. Have you tried any techniques before, like deep breathing or grounding exercises?

User: I've heard of deep breathing, but I’m not sure if I do it right. I usually just try to breathe but still feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be very effective when done correctly. Let’s practice it together right now. Try inhaling deeply through your nose for a count of four, holding it for four, and then exhaling through your mouth for a count of four. Ready to try?

User: Okay, I'll give it a shot. *User practices breathing* I think I feel a bit better, but I can't help but worry that it won't work when I'm actually in those situations.

Consultant: It’s normal to have those doubts. The key is practice—like any skill, it becomes easier with time. When you encounter those noisy situations, remind yourself that it's okay to take a moment to breathe. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds doable. I just need to remember to do it.

Consultant: Yes, and we can also create some reminders or cues for you during social activities. It might also help to gradually expose yourself to situations that feel anxiety-provoking but manageable. What do you think about starting small, like attending a smaller gathering first?

User: That could be less overwhelming. I’d feel a bit more in control rather than jumping into a big event.

Consultant: Exactly! Starting small allows your mind and body to adapt without becoming too overwhelmed. You could even plan a brief stay at a social event, giving yourself permission to leave if you need to. Would that help you feel more confident?

User: Yeah, that sounds less intimidating. Just knowing I can leave if it gets too much takes some pressure off.

Consultant: Great! And during these smaller gatherings, let’s also work on positive self-talk. For example, remind yourself that it’s okay to feel anxious and that you’re taking steps to cope. What kind of messages could you tell yourself when you start to feel panic?

User: I could say something like, “It’s okay to feel this way; I’m trying my best,” or “I can handle this.” 

Consultant: Those are wonderful affirmations! They serve as a reminder of your efforts and resilience. As we move forward, we’ll continue to fine-tune these affirmations and strategies. How do you feel about our plan so far?

User: I feel encouraged. I like that we're focusing on manageable steps rather than expecting me to be perfect right away.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it's a journey, and every small victory counts. Let’s check in next time about how your practice goes and how you feel after attending a smaller gathering. 

User: I’ll do my best. Thank you for the support!

Consultant: Anytime, Xiao Zhang! I’m here for you. Just remember to be kind to yourself during this process. If you keep practicing, I believe you can become more comfortable in these situations. 

User: I appreciate that! It feels good to know there’s a plan in place. 

Consultant: Absolutely! We’ll continue to build on this progress together. I look forward to our next session! 

User: Me too. Thanks again!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! Welcome to our session today. I’m glad you’re here. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been trying to adjust to my surroundings, especially after the volunteer activities. But I still find myself getting startled by unexpected noises, and it makes me anxious.

Consultant: I understand that unexpected noises can trigger strong reactions in you. It’s great that you are challenging yourself and engaging in new environments. Can you tell me more about a specific incident where a sound affected you recently?

User: Yes, during the volunteer event, there was this loud siren nearby. I felt a wave of panic and had to step away for a moment. It was really overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds really intense, Xiaozhang. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed in such situations. When that siren went off, what thoughts were going through your mind at that moment?

User: I thought something bad was happening, and I felt trapped. I couldn't focus on the activity anymore; all I could think about was the noise.

Consultant: It seems like that situation brought up some alarming thoughts for you. Let’s explore that a bit. How did those thoughts make you feel emotionally during and after the event?

User: I felt scared and really anxious. After it happened, I was worried I might have a similar experience again, and it affected my mood for the rest of the day.

Consultant: That’s completely valid. Anticipating those experiences can make you feel anxious. It’s important to recognize these patterns. Can we try to identify the specific beliefs connected to that panic you felt?

User: I believe that I’ll lose control or that something terrible might happen. It’s as if my mind jumps to the worst possible outcome.

Consultant: It sounds like those beliefs might be contributing to the panic. Let’s challenge them together. What evidence do you have that something bad will happen when you hear unexpected sounds?

User: I don't really have evidence. It’s more like a reflex reaction. I just feel fear when I hear those sounds.

Consultant: That reflex is understandable, but let's try to think of some alternative perspectives. If a friend were in your situation, how might you counsel them to view those surprising sounds?

User: I guess I would tell them that it’s just a noise and that they’re safe. Maybe they just need to breathe and calm down.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s about reframing that experience. Let’s practice some self-monitoring techniques. When the next unexpected sound occurs, how about counting your breaths slowly to calm yourself?

User: That sounds helpful. I can try focusing on my breathing instead of the noise itself.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Would you like to create a plan for when the unexpected occurs so that you feel more prepared?

User: Yes, I think having a plan would help me feel more in control.

Consultant: Let’s outline that plan together. You can start with taking a deep breath and counting to five, then reminding yourself that you are safe. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds doable. I can definitely try that next time.

Consultant: Great! Practicing these techniques will help reinforce your feelings of safety and control. How did you feel about trying this strategy out?

User: I feel more hopeful about it. It seems like a good way to handle my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it takes time, and that’s okay. Would you like to talk about any other situations where you felt anxious?

User: I’ve noticed that sometimes even small unexpected things make me jump, like a door slamming. It's frustrating.

Consultant: It’s definitely frustrating to experience those reactions. Let’s apply what we’ve discussed. When a door slams, try using your breathing technique and remind yourself it’s just a sound, nothing more. Are you comfortable trying that?

User: Yes, I can give it a shot. It makes sense to use the breathing technique then too.

Consultant: I believe in your ability to handle this, Xiaozhang. As we practice, it will become easier to manage those reflexes. What do you think will help you remember to use your strategies in those moments?

User: Maybe I can set reminders on my phone or write it down somewhere visible. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Visual reminders can work wonders. Let’s also think about what you could say to yourself in those moments as a prompt.

User: I could tell myself, "It's just a sound, and I’m safe."

Consultant: Perfect! That positive self-talk is a powerful tool. How do you feel about the progress you’re making?

User: I feel like I’m learning to take control of my reactions, and that feels really good. 

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Your progress is commendable. Would you like to recap the strategies we’ve discussed today before we wrap up?

User: Sure! We talked about breathing techniques, reframing my thoughts about noises, and making plans for when I’m startled.

Consultant: Exactly! And remember, each time you practice these strategies, you’re reinforcing your skills. How confident do you feel about applying these techniques before our next session?

User: I feel more confident. I’m really looking forward to practicing them.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset to have! Keep acknowledging your progress. Remember, I’m here to support you. Until next time, take care and keep practicing!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite hopeful actually. After my volunteer work and the public speaking, I think I've started to adapt to my new environment.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made significant progress in building your confidence. Can you tell me more about how those experiences have influenced your thoughts and feelings?

User: Well, I used to feel really anxious about speaking in front of people, but after that successful presentation, I realized I could do it. Now I'm hopeful but also a bit unsure about what's next.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way after accomplishing something challenging. You’ve taken a big step forward! What do you think you can do next to maintain this positive feeling?

User: I think I want to engage more with the community and maybe try to speak in front of them again. But sometimes I still feel this nagging anxiety.

Consultant: Engaging with the community sounds like a great next step! Let’s explore that anxiety a bit more. When you think about speaking again, what thoughts come to your mind?

User: I often think about all the things that could go wrong, like forgetting what to say or making a fool of myself.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have those thoughts, especially after putting yourself out there. Let’s reflect on those fears. How likely do you think those scenarios are to happen, and what evidence do you have for them?

User: I guess they aren’t very likely, especially since I did okay last time. But I can't seem to shake off the fear.

Consultant: Let’s challenge that fear together. What would you say to a friend feeling the same way about speaking? How might you encourage them to see it differently?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to be nervous and that they might surprise themselves with how well they do.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve shown yourself that it is possible to succeed despite the anxiety. Can we try to reframe your thoughts when anxiety arises? Instead of focusing on the fear, you could remind yourself of your accomplishments and the support you have around you.

User: That makes sense. I should focus more on the positive experiences instead of worrying.

Consultant: Great insight! Now, let’s think about what more positive experiences you could create. Are there any upcoming events where you could practise public speaking or engage with others?

User: There’s another community meeting next week. I could volunteer to share an update on our project.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! How do you feel about speaking at that meeting?

User: I feel a mix of excitement and anxiety. I want to do it, but I’m afraid of messing up.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel both! How can you prepare yourself to minimize that anxiety before the meeting? 

User: I could practice what I want to say and maybe even visualize myself succeeding.

Consultant: Practicing and visualization are excellent techniques! Let’s also talk about what support you have around you. Who can you turn to for encouragement as you prepare?

User: I could ask a couple of my friends who were at the last meeting for feedback and support.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Having a support network can really enhance your confidence. What do you think you might learn from their feedback?

User: I might get some insights into what worked well and what I can improve on.

Consultant: Absolutely! Feedback can provide valuable perspectives. I want you to remember that each experience will help you grow. What will be your primary focus as you approach this upcoming meeting?

User: I think I’ll focus on sharing my updates clearly and enjoying the process, rather than stressing over perfection.

Consultant: That's a wonderful focus! Enjoying the experience can really shift your mindset. As we wrap up our session, let’s reflect on how you can continue to build on these positive experiences.

User: I’d like to keep volunteering and possibly seek out more opportunities to speak. It feels empowering.

Consultant: Absolutely! Engaging in activities that empower you will reinforce your positive mindset. How do you envision maintaining this momentum over the next few weeks?

User: I’ll set small goals for myself, like preparing for the meeting and reaching out to friends for support.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, every small step will help solidify your confidence. I’m proud of the progress you’ve made, and I believe in your ability to keep moving forward.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your encouragement. It’s been helpful.

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaozhang! Before we end our session, let’s remind yourself of the value of teamwork and community support. These connections can further enhance your positivity and confidence.

User: Definitely. I see how important it is to lean on others along the journey.

Consultant: Exactly! You've learned so much about yourself already. Keep nurturing those connections and your positive mindset. Remember, I'm here to support you whenever you need. 

User: Thank you! I’ll keep that in mind. 

Consultant: It’s been wonderful chatting with you today. Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. Last time, we discussed your positive experiences with team collaboration. How have you been feeling about that since then?

User: Hi! I've been reflecting on how teamwork felt really rewarding. It’s strange because I usually prefer to work alone. But I think being part of a group might really help me deal with my anxiety and other issues.

Consultant: That's a significant realization! It sounds like you're starting to appreciate the value of connection with others. Can you share a little more about what specifically made you feel rewarded during your teamwork experience?

User: Definitely! I noticed that when we worked together, I felt more motivated. We all encouraged each other, and that support felt really uplifting. I think I need more of that in my life.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear how encouragement from others can be uplifting. This sense of support can be very powerful, especially when you're dealing with anxiety and feelings of isolation. Have you thought about ways to engage with others more, perhaps through the veterans' support group you're considering?

User: Yes! I’m really interested in joining the veterans' group. I believe it could provide me with a community that understands what I’ve been through, which might lessen my feelings of anxiety.

Consultant: Joining a group like that could be a great step forward! It’s also a way to foster interpersonal connections that can combat feelings of isolation. What kind of expectations do you have about joining this group?

User: I hope to connect with people who can relate to my experiences and maybe gain some new perspectives. At the same time, I’m a bit anxious about opening up to others.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel anxious about sharing your thoughts and experiences. Maybe we can explore some strategies together to help you feel more comfortable in those situations. What do you think?

User: That sounds good. I want to work on being more open with my feelings, especially around new people.

Consultant: Great! One approach could be to start with small interactions—perhaps sharing a light story or an interest. This can help build a foundation for deeper conversations later. How do you feel about starting small?

User: I think starting small makes sense. It feels less intimidating that way. But I still worry that I might not say the right thing or seem awkward.

Consultant: That is a common concern. Remember, everyone often feels a bit awkward sometimes. You can focus on being present and listening as much as you talk. That can take the pressure off. How do you think you might handle perceived awkwardness in conversations?

User: I guess I can remind myself that it’s okay to be imperfect. Maybe I could even laugh it off if things feel a bit awkward.

Consultant: Absolutely! A little humor can go a long way in easing tension. It shows others that you’re approachable. Besides, sharing these moments can create bonds as people realize they're not alone in feeling that way. Would you be willing to practice some conversational starters together?

User: Sure! Practicing sounds helpful. I often struggle with knowing how to begin. 

Consultant: Let's try some examples! You could start with something like, "Hi, I’m new to the group. Has anyone here had any experiences they'd like to share?” What do you think about that opener?

User: That’s a good start! It invites others to share, which takes the focus off me for a moment. 

Consultant: Exactly! It involves others and helps you build a connection. Remember, engaging with others doesn’t have to be a one-way street; it's about sharing the space together. What are your thoughts about using this approach in your new group?

User: I like it. I think it makes it feel more like a conversation instead of just me talking. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As you practice these skills, keep in mind that each interaction is a learning opportunity. What other goals come to mind as you prepare to enter this group?

User: I want to work on my confidence in expressing my feelings openly. I often bottle things up, which only makes my anxiety worse.

Consultant: That’s an important goal! Feeling able to express yourself can help alleviate stress. How about we discuss some ways to express your feelings openly during your interactions?

User: I could start by sharing my thoughts on how I feel about certain topics. That seems easier than diving straight into personal issues.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Talking about feelings in relation to different topics can ease you into deeper conversations. How do you expect you might feel after practicing this kind of sharing in your group?

User: I believe I might feel less anxious and more connected to others. Plus, it could help take the focus off my own worries.

Consultant: That sounds promising! The sense of connection and community you build can make a big difference. After you try these strategies in the group, I’d love to hear how it went in our next session. 

User: That would be helpful. I am looking forward to seeing how it all plays out.

Consultant: Perfect! I believe this will be a positive experience for you. Lastly, before we wrap up today, do you feel like you made progress in our conversation about your goals?

User: Yes, I feel that much more prepared and optimistic about connecting with people. 

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement! Remember the strategies we discussed, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support along the way. I’m looking forward to our next session to hear about your experiences.

User: Thank you! I'll definitely keep you updated.

Consultant: You're welcome! Take care, and I wish you all the best with your new group. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! I'm really glad to see you again today. You mentioned feeling a tangible sense of progress recently. Can you share more about what you're experiencing right now?

User: Hi! Yes, I feel like I'm improving. After joining the veterans' support group, I've been setting some goals for my life and work, and it feels good. Still, there's this underlying anxiety sometimes, especially about if I can stick to these goals.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling positive changes and setting goals for yourself. It sounds like the support group has had a helpful impact. Can you tell me more about the specific goals you’ve set and what you hope to achieve?

User: Sure! I've planned to look for a stable job and also want to work on my fitness. I think having a routine would help me a lot. But sometimes I doubt whether I can actually keep up with it.

Consultant: That's a great approach, Xiaozhang! Establishing a routine can indeed provide more stability. Doubts are common, especially when striving for change. What particular thoughts or feelings come up when you think about sticking to these routines?

User: I often think about past failures, like trying to get fit before but giving up too soon. That makes me anxious and sometimes I just want to avoid starting altogether.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel anxious when past experiences shape your present outlook. Let’s explore that a bit more—what exactly goes through your mind when you think about those past attempts? 

User: I remember feeling exhausted and frustrated. It was like no matter how hard I tried, I didn’t see much difference, and that felt demotivating.

Consultant: It sounds like those experiences left a significant impact on your motivation. When you think about those feelings of exhaustion and frustration, how do they affect your confidence in starting again?

User: They really shake my confidence. I worry that I will end up in the same place as before—feeling stuck and hopeless.

Consultant: Those feelings can be quite heavy to carry. But remember, you mentioned that you feel a sense of progress now. What’s different this time compared to your past experiences? 

User: This time, I have support from the group, and I've set smaller, more achievable goals. I think that makes a difference.

Consultant: That’s an important insight! Smaller, achievable goals can help create a sense of accomplishment. If we viewed the process as a series of small victories, how might that change your approach to your goals?

User: It makes it feel more doable. I guess I just need to remind myself that progress takes time, and it’s okay to take small steps.

Consultant: Absolutely! Celebrating small steps along the way can build your confidence over time. How do you think you can incorporate that mindset into your daily routine?

User: Maybe I could set daily or weekly goals and check in with myself about my progress. It could help me stay focused.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan, Xiaozhang! Keeping track of your achievements, no matter how small, can provide motivation. Are there any specific activities you want to include in your weekly check-ins?

User: I’d like to include some physical activity, maybe a short workout, and also check in on my job search progress. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful goals! How often would you like to set these check-ins? And how can you ensure you stick to them?

User: I think doing it every Sunday would be good. I’ll set reminders on my phone and maybe write down my progress in a journal. 

Consultant: A Sunday check-in sounds like a great idea! Using reminders and journaling can help reinforce your commitment. How do you feel about this plan moving forward?

User: I feel more optimistic about it, actually. It gives me something concrete to work towards.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Building that optimism is vital. Before we wrap up, have you thought about ways to handle any setbacks that might come up as you work on your goals?

User: I hadn’t really thought about it. Maybe I need to remind myself that setbacks are part of the journey and not a sign of failure.

Consultant: Exactly! Viewing setbacks as opportunities for learning is a powerful perspective. How can we reinforce this mindset so you feel prepared if challenges arise?

User: I could write down past setbacks and what I learned from them, so I can refer back to it when I need a reminder.

Consultant: That sounds like a helpful strategy! Reflecting on your experiences can equip you with insights to handle future challenges. As we conclude today’s session, what do you feel you’ve gained from our discussion?

User: I feel more equipped with concrete steps and a better mindset for my goals. It’s comforting to know I can take it one step at a time.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You’ve made significant strides. Keep focusing on those small victories, and remember, it’s okay to reach out if you need support. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your guidance and support. I feel hopeful about the journey ahead. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaozhang. I believe in your potential to make positive changes. Take care, and see you next time!
