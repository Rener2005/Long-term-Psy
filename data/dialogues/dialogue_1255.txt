Consultant: Hello Liu! I'm glad you're here today. I understand that you've been feeling quite anxious about your compulsive checking behaviors. Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing lately?

User: Hi. Yes, I can’t stop checking the door locks multiple times before leaving my home or going to bed. I feel really anxious if I don’t do it, worried that something bad might happen if I forget.

Consultant: It sounds really tough. Your anxiety is pushing you to repeatedly check the locks to feel secure. Let’s explore this a bit deeper. Can you share what specific thoughts go through your mind when you feel the need to check the locks?

User: I often think, “What if I forget to lock the door and someone breaks in?” Or, “What if I leave the stove on and it causes a fire?” These thoughts just keep repeating in my head.

Consultant: It's understandable to have those worries, especially when we are concerned about safety. But it seems like these thoughts might be causing you more distress than necessary. Would you say these thoughts make you feel more anxious or do they somehow provide a sense of safety?

User: They definitely make me feel more anxious. I know I shouldn't have to check so often, but the fear of something going wrong overrides my rational thinking.

Consultant: That recognition is an important step, Liu. Let’s work on identifying whether there are any reminders or triggers related to these situations. When do the thoughts about checking come up most strongly for you?

User: It usually happens in the mornings when I’m preparing to leave for work. I find myself stuck in a loop where I check the locks multiple times even though I know they're secure.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. It seems like the mornings are particularly challenging for you. What do you feel you might be avoiding by needing to check those locks repeatedly? 

User: I guess it’s about my fear of losing control. If I forget something, I feel like I’ll be responsible for something terrible happening.

Consultant: That’s a powerful insight. The feeling of losing control can be overwhelming. Can we think about how realistic it is that your forgetting to lock the door would lead to something truly catastrophic? 

User: I know, logically, that the chances are very low. But emotionally, it doesn’t feel that way! 

Consultant: That’s very common, Liu. Our emotions can sometimes dictate our responses more than logic does. How about we explore some alternative thoughts you could have in those moments instead of resorting to checking?

User: I would like that. Maybe something like, “I've checked the lock already; it’s okay to trust myself” might help?

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a great start. Next time you feel the urge to check, you can remind yourself that you've already done it and that it's okay to let it go. Can we set a small goal for you to try out this new thought throughout your day?

User: Sure! I can try to remind myself not to check the locks after I've already done it at least once.

Consultant: That sounds like a manageable goal. You could also keep a journal noting when you resist the urge to check and how it felt afterward. This might help reinforce your progress. How does that sound?

User: Yeah, that sounds good. I think writing it down could help me see the pattern. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful plan! Documenting your thoughts and feelings can provide valuable insights. Now, let's think about some strategies for those moments when anxiety might feel overwhelming—what have you tried in the past to help calm yourself?

User: I sometimes take deep breaths or go for a quick walk, but it doesn’t always help when I’m really anxious.

Consultant: Those are good strategies! It sounds like some activities can be helpful sometimes, but when anxiety peaks, they might not be enough. We can brainstorm additional techniques that work for you, perhaps something to distract your mind while you practice letting go? 

User: I think trying to distract myself could be useful. Maybe listening to music or a podcast?

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Music and podcasts can be engaging and help keep your mind occupied. You can try incorporating these distractions into your morning routine as well, perhaps while you’re preparing to leave.

User: Yes, I can play some music while I get ready. That might take my mind off the compulsive checking.

Consultant: Exactly! It's all about finding what works for you. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize what you’d like to focus on before we meet again. What are your main takeaways?

User: I want to practice trusting my first check of the locks, remind myself of the low likelihood of something going wrong, and use music as a distraction. 

Consultant: Those are fantastic goals, Liu! You've made significant progress today, and I believe these strategies will begin to help reduce your anxiety. Let’s check in on how it's going when we meet again. Remember, you're not alone in this, and it’s okay to reach out if things feel too much.

User: Thank you. I really appreciate your help. It feels comforting to have a plan in place.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad you’re feeling more hopeful. I look forward to hearing about your experiences and successes next time.

Consultant: Hello Liu, I’m glad to see you again. How have you been since our last session? 

User: Hi. Honestly, I haven’t felt much better. I still find myself constantly worrying about little things, especially about safety. It feels like I can't stop thinking about unplugging devices or checking locks.

Consultant: It sounds like your mind is really occupied with these thoughts about safety. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed by them. Can you tell me more about what made you notice these risks recently?

User: Well, I started to think more about my living situation. I live alone, so if something goes wrong, it can be serious. I think I’m just more aware of potential dangers now.

Consultant: That makes sense. Living alone can naturally heighten concerns about safety. What do these thoughts make you feel when they arise?

User: They make me anxious and a bit helpless. I feel like no matter how much I check things, it’s never enough to calm me down.

Consultant: It’s tough feeling that way. It seems like despite your efforts, the anxiety remains. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come to mind when you start feeling this way?

User: Yes, I often think, “What if I leave something on and it causes a fire?” This thought just loops in my mind.

Consultant: That sounds really distressing. It’s common for thoughts like these to create a cycle of anxiety. Let's try to explore that thought—how much evidence do you have that this will actually happen?

User: I mean, I know that I rarely hear about this happening. It’s just that when I think about the consequences, they seem so severe.

Consultant: I can see how the severity of the consequences amplifies your anxiety. If a friend were in your situation, what advice would you give them?

User: I guess I would tell them to relax and that they are likely being too hard on themselves. 

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective. Now, let’s think about how you can apply that same kindness to your own thoughts. What if we looked at some of these fears more critically?

User: I suppose I could try to remind myself that the chances of a fire happening because I left something unplugged are really low.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Challenging those thoughts can be very effective. Let’s practice that together. The next time you feel the urge to check, what might you tell yourself?

User: I could say, “You’ve checked already, and it’s unlikely anything is wrong.”

Consultant: Exactly! This is a helpful way to counteract those thoughts. Now, thinking further, what would be a small step you could take to gradually face this anxiety?

User: Maybe I could set a specific time in the day to check things, instead of repeatedly throughout the day.

Consultant: That sounds like a very constructive plan. By setting a specific time, you’re creating a boundary for those checks, which can help reduce anxiety. How would that make you feel about your checking behavior?

User: I think it would help me feel more in control. 

Consultant: That’s a positive shift. Control over your behavior can really impact your anxiety levels. In addition to this, what are some activities that you enjoy that might help distract you during these anxious moments?

User: I enjoy reading and watching movies. Those help me relax a bit.

Consultant: Incorporating those activities can be a wonderful way to redirect your focus. When you notice your mind wandering toward anxious thoughts, you could try engaging in one of those hobbies instead. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I think I could commit to that.

Consultant: Fantastic! Let's consider how you can best integrate these strategies into your daily routine. Do you have particular times when you feel more anxious?

User: Yes, evenings tend to be the worst since it’s quieter and I have more time to think.

Consultant: Knowing that, can you plan specific reading or movie times for the evenings? This way, you’re giving your mind a break from those thoughts.

User: Yes, I can definitely set aside some time for that.

Consultant: Great! Planning this can serve as a helpful tool to manage your anxiety. Now, let’s talk about how we can reinforce this progress. How do you feel about reviewing what you’ve learned each week?

User: That sounds useful! To track my progress, I think I can start a journal.

Consultant: A journal is a wonderful idea! It helps you reflect and stay mindful of your thoughts and feelings. What will you write about?

User: I’ll write about my anxious thoughts and how I counteracted them, along with how I felt after engaging in my hobbies.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach. Reviewing your entries will help consolidate your learning and build confidence. As we come to the end of our session, is there anything else you’d like to address today? 

User: I think we covered a lot. I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Liu. Remember, it’s perfectly normal to have moments of feeling overwhelmed. With practice, you’ll continue to build on the strategies you’ve learned. If you ever need to revisit these feelings or techniques, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time.

Consultant: Hello Liu, I'm glad you're back for today's session. I understand that you've been facing some challenges with obsessive thoughts lately. Can you share a bit about how you've been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hello! It’s been a bit of a struggle, honestly. I’ve been feeling overwhelmed at work, and those obsessive thoughts seem to creep in more often when I'm under pressure. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Liu. It’s understandable that increased work demands would heighten your feelings of overwhelm. Can you tell me more about these thoughts and when they tend to happen?

User: Sure. When I receive a task, I often find myself double-checking everything—emails, reports, you name it. It’s like I can't really move on until I’m sure it’s perfect, even if it takes too much time.

Consultant: I see, so the desire for perfection and the need to check things multiple times can make you feel stuck. What emotions come up for you when these thoughts occur?

User: Mainly anxiety and frustration. I feel like I'm losing control because I can't just let things be. 

Consultant: That sense of losing control can be very unsettling. Let’s explore this a bit. What thoughts run through your mind when you feel that anxiety creeping in?

User: I often think that if I don’t double-check, something terrible will happen, like making a big mistake or getting in trouble at work. 

Consultant: It sounds like you have a significant fear of making mistakes. This might be amplifying your anxiety. Do you think there’s evidence to support that something terrible will actually happen if you don’t double-check?

User: I guess not really. Most of the time, nothing serious does happen. But it’s hard to convince myself of that in the moment.

Consultant: That's an important realization, Liu. It might help to challenge those negative thoughts. If a colleague were in your situation, what would you advise them?

User: I’d probably tell them to trust themselves more and that it’s okay to make mistakes sometimes. 

Consultant: Exactly! Now, let’s apply that logic back to your own situation. What might it look like for you to challenge those obsessive checking behaviors and trust yourself more?

User: Maybe I could try setting specific limits on how long I check things. If I give myself a bit of time, I could practice stepping away once I've gone through my checks.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Setting time limits can help create a boundary for those checking behaviors. How do you feel about starting with that in this coming week?

User: I think that sounds doable. It helps that I have a plan to follow instead of just trying to fight the urge directly.

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s about finding a balance. As you reduce those checking behaviors, what positive changes do you hope to see in your daily life?

User: I hope to feel less anxious and have more time for myself. I’d like to use that time to relax or engage in social activities, which I’ve been avoiding.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal, Liu! It sounds like engaging more with people could benefit your overall well-being. Are there any specific social activities you’re considering?

User: I’ve thought about joining a local club or group. It would be nice to meet people who share similar interests, but the thought of attending makes me a bit anxious. 

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about socializing, especially with everything going on. What thoughts come to mind when you think about attending a club or group?

User: I worry about not fitting in or making a fool of myself. 

Consultant: Those thoughts are quite common. Let’s explore this. What evidence do you have that you won’t fit in or that something embarrassing will happen?

User: I don’t really have any. Up until now, I've never had any major issues meeting new people. 

Consultant: That's a valuable insight, Liu. It seems like your fears might not be as grounded in reality as they feel in the moment. How could you reframe those thoughts to alleviate some of the pressure you feel when you think about socializing?

User: I could remind myself that everyone feels a bit nervous at first and that I have made friends before. 

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive approach! Reminding yourself that these feelings are normal can help reduce anxiety. How does that reframe make you feel about the possibility of joining a group?

User: It makes it feel a bit less daunting. I think if I take it slow, I could manage it.

Consultant: That’s a positive perspective. Starting slow is a great way to ease into new situations. As you plan for this, would you like assistance in setting an initial goal for your social engagement?

User: Yes, maybe I could aim to attend one meeting this month and see how it goes?

Consultant: That's a fantastic goal, Liu! Attending one meeting allows you to take that first step without feeling overwhelmed. How do you feel about setting that as a target?

User: I feel good about it! It’s helpful to have a tangible goal. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ve planned to help manage your OCD and enhance your social engagement.

User: I’ll work on setting limited time frames for checking my work, and I’ll aim to attend one social meeting this month.

Consultant: Excellent! Progressing with those strategies should really help in building your confidence and reducing anxiety. Before we finish today, are there any reflections you have on what we’ve discussed?

User: I just feel more optimistic about managing my thoughts and making connections. Thank you for guiding me through all of this!

Consultant: It's been a pleasure, Liu. I'm proud of the steps you're taking. Remember, it’s all about progress. We’ll reconvene next week to discuss how everything went. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu! I'm glad to have you back for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. My compulsive thoughts have lessened, and I’ve tried to challenge myself during social interactions, but it’s still tough sometimes, especially during the team-building event I recently attended.

Consultant: It sounds like you're making some progress, which is great! You mentioned feeling pressure during the team-building event. Can you share more about what happened and how it affected you?

User: Well, during one of the group activities, I felt anxious about how I was interacting with my colleagues. I kept worrying about saying the wrong thing or not fitting in. It made me overthink every interaction.

Consultant: I can understand how that type of pressure can feel overwhelming. What specific thoughts were going through your mind at that moment? 

User: I thought that if I made a mistake, everyone would judge me and I wouldn’t be respected. It sounds silly, but it really affected how I engaged with others.

Consultant: It's not silly at all, Liu. Those thoughts can be quite common in social situations. Let’s examine that thought: What evidence do you have that making a mistake would lead to judgment from others?

User: I guess I don’t have any concrete evidence. But I just feel like people don’t accept mistakes well, especially in a professional setting.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. It’s easy to feel that way, but what if we looked at it from a different perspective? If a colleague made a mistake, how would you react to them?

User: I would probably empathize with them and not think too negatively. I would want to support them instead of judging.

Consultant: Exactly! So, it seems like you would be more understanding towards others than you are towards yourself. How could you apply that same understanding to your own interactions?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it’s okay to make mistakes and that everyone goes through similar situations.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful insight! By normalizing mistakes, you can reduce some of the pressure you feel. Are there any specific situations you would like to role-play to practice this new perspective?

User: I think practicing small talk might help, like starting conversations with colleagues or participating more in group discussions.

Consultant: Great idea! Let's role-play a scenario where you start a conversation with a colleague. How would you begin that interaction?

User: I could start by asking them about their interests or how their weekend was. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic opener! Let’s say I’m your colleague, and you approach me. How would that sound?

User: Hi! I noticed you enjoy hiking. Have you been on any good trails lately?

Consultant: Nice start, Liu! How do you feel delivering that line?

User: A little nervous, but also excited to talk.

Consultant: That’s perfectly normal! Remember, it’s a practice process, and it gets easier with time. What do you think could help you manage your anxiety in that moment when speaking with others?

User: Maybe I could focus on the conversation itself rather than my worries. I could remind myself it’s just a casual chat.

Consultant: Exactly! Shifting your focus can help reduce anxiety. What are some ways you could remind yourself while you’re in the moment?

User: I could think about how every conversation is a chance to connect rather than a test. That could help me stay calm.

Consultant: Absolutely! This shift in thinking is powerful. Do you feel more equipped to approach social situations now?

User: Yes, I feel like I have some strategies to use. It’s still a bit daunting, but I’m willing to try!

Consultant: That's a commendable mindset, Liu! As we wrap up today, let’s reflect on what we've discussed. What do you think is your biggest takeaway from today’s session?

User: I think it’s realizing that I can reframe my thoughts about social interactions and that it’s okay to make mistakes. I can approach these situations with more self-compassion.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway! How will you apply this in your daily life moving forward? 

User: I’ll try to engage more in conversations at work and remind myself to be kind to myself if things don’t go perfectly.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! Remember, the journey is about progress, not perfection. If you find yourself struggling, we can discuss further strategies in our next session. 

User: Thank you! This has been really helpful. I’m looking forward to practicing these ideas.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Liu! I’m proud of the work you're doing, and I believe you will continue to see progress. Until next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Liu Hua! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been trying to consciously adjust my relationship with obsessive thoughts through some attention training at home. It’s been a bit challenging, but I feel like I'm making some progress.

Consultant: That's great to hear that you're making an effort! It sounds like you're actively working on managing those thoughts. Can you share what specific strategies you've tried during your training at home?

User: I've been practicing mindfulness exercises and journaling my thoughts. I try to observe them without judgment, but sometimes I still feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed, especially during the process of change. That awareness you’re developing is valuable. Could you tell me more about the moments when you feel overwhelmed? What thoughts typically arise during those times?

User: Usually, I start thinking that I won’t be able to manage my responsibilities at work if I can't control these thoughts. It's like a cycle—I focus too much on trying to suppress them and then panic about my performance.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of pressure regarding your performance, which can certainly amplify your anxiety. Let's consider this—the thoughts you mentioned about not managing work, how true do you think they are? Do you have evidence that supports this belief?

User: I don't know... maybe I exaggerate my performance issues. I still complete my tasks but just feel uneasy about them.

Consultant: Recognizing that possible exaggeration is an important step. If a friend were in your situation, what advice would you give them regarding those thoughts?

User: I would likely tell them to focus on the tasks they can handle and not to stress too much about the ones they can't. Just to take things step by step.

Consultant: That’s a wise perspective! It seems like you’re capable of giving support to others. How might you use that same approach toward yourself when those overwhelming thoughts arise?

User: I suppose I should try to treat myself with the same kindness and patience. It's just hard to remember that in the moment.

Consultant: Absolutely. It can be quite challenging to extend that kindness to ourselves. Perhaps we could develop a brief reminder or mantra that you can use during those moments to help you shift your perspective?

User: That sounds helpful. I could use something to ground me when I feel the panic rising.

Consultant: Great! How about something simple like, "I am doing my best, and that’s enough"? Would that resonate with you?

User: Yes, I think that would work! It sounds reassuring.

Consultant: Fantastic! Now, let’s consider how you can practice implementing this mantra throughout your day. Are there specific situations at work or during your leisure time where you find it particularly useful?

User: At work, during meetings, and at home when I’m trying to relax. Sometimes, I just dwell on those thoughts instead of enjoying the moment.

Consultant: Those are valuable insights! How do you feel about using your mantra in those contexts? You could say it quietly to yourself when you start feeling the anxiety creep in.

User: I can see that working. It might help to bring me back to the present when my mind starts racing.

Consultant: Exactly, and it also reinforces your self-compassion. Let's take a moment to reflect on how your ability to manage obsessive thoughts has evolved since we began our sessions. What do you feel has been your biggest achievement?

User: I think becoming more aware of my thoughts and being able to observe them rather than just react. That’s made a difference.

Consultant: That’s a huge accomplishment! You should be proud of that progress. What strategies do you believe you can carry forward to maintain this awareness and continue your growth?

User: I definitely want to keep practicing mindfulness and using this mantra. It feels like a solid plan.

Consultant: Sounds like a solid plan indeed! Regular practice will help reinforce your progress. What is one thing you can do this week to integrate these techniques into your daily routine?

User: I could set aside a few minutes each day just for mindfulness practice and to recite my mantra. I’ll try to make it a habit.

Consultant: That’s an excellent intention! Building a habit takes time, but I believe you can do it. As we approach the end of our sessions, is there anything specific you’d like to discuss or address further today?

User: I just want to make sure I can keep this momentum going. I want to ensure I'm prepared to handle thoughts when they arise.

Consultant: You've done a tremendous job so far, Liu Hua. Remember, it's about progress, not perfection. Moving forward, how might you remind yourself of your achievements and the strategies you've gained when faced with challenges?

User: Maybe I can look back at my journal and see how far I've come. That could motivate me.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflecting on your journey can be incredibly affirming. As we wrap up today, do you feel that you have adequate tools and strategies to continue this work on your own?

User: Yes, I feel more equipped and hopeful. Thank you for all your support!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to hear that. Just remember, you can always revisit these strategies and adapt them as needed. You've got this, and I'm proud of the progress you’ve made. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hi Liu Hua, it's great to see you again. I'm happy to hear about the improvements you've experienced lately. How are you feeling today?

User: Hi! I'm feeling quite good, actually. I've noticed that my sensitivity to compulsive thoughts has decreased, and I feel more in control of my emotions than before.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve made significant progress. Can you share a bit more about what changes you've noticed and how they’ve impacted your daily life?

User: Well, I find myself engaging in activities I used to avoid. I no longer feel overwhelmed by those intrusive thoughts, which has allowed me to focus more on my work and personal interests. It’s pretty liberating.

Consultant: It must feel really rewarding to regain that sense of control. Let’s explore this a bit. Reflecting on your journey through our sessions, what do you think has contributed the most to this change?

User: I believe it's a combination of learning to challenge my thoughts and practicing mindfulness. I’ve also been keeping a journal to reflect on my feelings.

Consultant: Those are powerful tools. Journaling is a great way to gain insights into your thought patterns. Looking back, were there any particular strategies or moments that stood out to you as especially helpful?

User: Yes, the exercises we did on cognitive restructuring were especially eye-opening. Being able to identify and question my negative thoughts made a big difference.

Consultant: It's fantastic that you found cognitive restructuring beneficial. It sounds like you’ve developed a better understanding of how your thoughts can influence your emotions. Moving forward, what strategies do you feel will be essential to maintain this progress?

User: I think continuing my journaling and possibly practicing mindfulness daily could help. I also want to remind myself of the techniques we've discussed whenever I feel those compulsive thoughts creeping back.

Consultant: Those are great plans! Consistency is key in maintaining progress. In addition to your current strategies, would you like to think about any specific long-term goals you can set for yourself to keep moving forward?

User: I’d like to set a goal to expand my social interactions. I’ve been pretty isolated, and I think connecting with others could help maintain my emotional health.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive goal! Social connections can play a vital role in overall well-being. How do you envision starting to expand those interactions?

User: Maybe I could join a local club or participate in group activities related to my interests. It would be a good way to meet people and get out of my comfort zone.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Starting with activities that align with your interests will make it easier to connect with like-minded individuals. How do you feel about setting small, achievable milestones for this goal?

User: That makes sense. I could set a goal to attend one new activity every month. This way, it's manageable, and I can gradually build my comfort in social settings.

Consultant: Excellent approach! Setting those smaller milestones will definitely make the process feel less daunting. As you think about this new goal, are there any concerns or potential challenges that come to mind?

User: I worry about feeling anxious in new social situations. Sometimes I still have moments where I feel overwhelmed, and I’m afraid they might happen during these activities.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to have those worries, especially when stepping into new situations. Remember, you’ve developed coping mechanisms that can help you manage those feelings. Would it help if we brainstormed some strategies to handle potential anxiety during these social interactions?

User: Yes, I think that would be really helpful. I could use some reinforcement for those moments when I feel anxious.

Consultant: Great! You might remind yourself of past experiences where you successfully managed anxiety. Also, having a few deep breathing techniques or calming phrases you can use on the spot could be beneficial. Would you like to try developing a personal calming mantra?

User: That sounds useful. A personal mantra could definitely ground me when I'm feeling anxious. 

Consultant: That’s a great start! Let’s work on crafting one together. How about incorporating a phrase that emphasizes your progress and strength? Something like, “I have overcome challenges before, and I can do it again.”

User: I like that! It feels empowering, and I can visualize those past successes.

Consultant: Fantastic! Visualization can be a very effective technique. Remember to practice this mantra regularly so it becomes a familiar tool for you when needed. How are you feeling about your journey and the steps we’ve discussed today?

User: Honestly, I feel optimistic! Reflecting on my progress and setting these new goals makes me excited about the future.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset to have! It sounds like you’re ready to embrace these changes and challenges. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s recap the key points we’ve discussed and any action steps you plan to take.

User: Sure! I’ll continue journaling and practicing mindfulness. I’ll also set a goal to attend one social activity each month and use the mantra we created to help with anxiety.

Consultant: Those are solid steps! You have come a long way, Liu Hua. Just remember, it's normal to encounter ups and downs along the journey. You’ve developed tools to help navigate challenges. If you ever need further support, don’t hesitate to reach out. This will be our last session for now—how does that feel for you?

User: It feels bittersweet, but I’m also ready to put into practice what I've learned. Thank you for all your guidance!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m so proud of your progress. Keep building on what you’ve learned, and remember, you can always return if you feel you need support in the future. Take care!
