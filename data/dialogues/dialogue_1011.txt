Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty anxious, especially thinking about public speaking again. I'm still so worried about it since that speech at the student representative meeting. 

Consultant: That makes sense. It sounds like you’re still holding onto that anxious feeling after your last experience. Can you share a bit more about what specifically causes you to feel this way before a public speech?

User: Well, I keep thinking about how I messed up last time—my legs felt weak, my voice was shaking, and I just felt like everyone was laughing at me. Now, even thinking about speaking in public makes me feel sick.

Consultant: I can see why that experience would lead to such strong feelings. It sounds really overwhelming and uncomfortable. What do you think would help you feel more confident if you had to give another speech?

User: I guess I just want to not feel so scared or weak. I want to be able to speak clearly and have everyone listen to me without thinking I'm awful.

Consultant: That’s a very understandable goal. Let’s explore your feelings a bit. When you think about speaking in public, what thoughts run through your mind? 

User: I often think things like, "What if I mess up again?" or "What will everyone think of me?" It just spirals from there, and I end up feeling even worse.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts create a lot of pressure for you. Let’s take a closer look at those concerns. How likely do you think it is that you'll mess up when speaking in public?

User: Honestly, I feel like there's a high chance of it because I know I can get so nervous. 

Consultant: It sounds like you’re envisioning a worst-case scenario. Let’s challenge that thought. Have you ever considered times when you felt nervous but everything turned out fine?

User: Well, there have been times when I thought I messed up but didn’t get as bad a reaction as I expected.

Consultant: That’s a great observation! It's possible that your mind is focusing on the negative experiences while overlooking positive ones. What if you thought about it differently? How would you frame that experience if a friend was going through it?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it’s not the end of the world.

Consultant: Exactly! So why shouldn’t you grant yourself that same kindness? Let's work on replacing some of those negative thoughts with more supportive ones. 

User: That makes sense, but it’s hard to remember in the moment.

Consultant: I understand that can be tough. What if we practiced some positive affirmations you could remind yourself of before speaking? Something like, “I am capable of communicating effectively.” How does that sound?

User: It sounds okay, but I’m not sure I’d believe it when I’m up there. 

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. Belief in those affirmations may take time. How about we start by breaking down the speech into smaller, manageable parts for you? We could practice each step together.

User: That could help. I think breaking it down would make it feel less daunting.

Consultant: Great! We can start with practicing the opening. How do you feel about writing a short introduction and rehearsing it together next time?

User: Yeah, I think that could be helpful. It would make the whole thing feel more organized in my head.

Consultant: Perfect! It’s all about finding small wins along the way. Remember, it’s okay to be vulnerable in front of others; it’s part of being human. 

User: Thanks, I appreciate that. I just wish I could feel that way naturally instead of forcing it.

Consultant: That takes practice! Just like any other skill, it’ll take time to become comfortable. Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. 

User: I hope so! Sometimes I just feel overwhelmed thinking about it all.

Consultant: It's natural to feel overwhelmed, especially when you're facing a challenge. Let's focus on one step at a time. What are some small activities you can do this week related to public speaking that feel a bit less intimidating? 

User: I could maybe try talking in front of the mirror or even practicing with my family first. 

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Practicing in a safe environment will help you build confidence. What emotions do you anticipate feeling while doing those activities?

User: I might feel a bit anxious at first, but hopefully more comfortable as I go.

Consultant: That’s a great attitude. Allow yourself to feel those feelings without judgment; it’s all part of the process. I'm here to support you, and you’re not alone in this.

User: Thank you! Knowing I have your support really helps. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! As we wrap up today's session, let’s summarize a few key takeaways and strategies you want to work on before our next meeting.

User: I think practicing the introduction and doing some exercises with family will be the main things. 

Consultant: Excellent goals! And remember to challenge those negative thoughts when they arise. You've made some important progress today. 

User: Thanks! I feel a little more hopeful now. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear. Just take it one step at a time, and remember, I’m here for you. Looking forward to our next session! 

User: Me too! See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session regarding your public speaking anxiety?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty much the same. I still dread speaking in front of others, especially after that last incident in class where I avoided going up. It's just so hard to shake off this fear.

Consultant: I can understand how frustrating it must be to feel that way. Can you tell me more about what goes through your mind when you think about speaking in front of your classmates?

User: Well, I often think that everyone will judge me if I mess up. I worry that I’ll embarrass myself, and that makes me want to avoid speaking entirely.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really concerned about how your classmates perceive you, which is completely normal. What emotions do you feel when you have those thoughts about judgment?

User: I feel anxious and a bit panicky. My heart races, and I just want to escape the situation.

Consultant: That sounds really overwhelming. Let’s explore that fear of judgment. Can you remember a specific thought you had just before you were called to present in class?

User: I remember thinking, "What if I mess up and everyone laughs at me?" That thought made me freeze.

Consultant: That’s a powerful thought. Would you say there’s any evidence that supports this belief that everyone would laugh if you made a mistake?

User: Not really, I mean... I’ve seen others mess up and they weren’t laughed at. People are usually supportive.

Consultant: Exactly! It seems like there might be a disconnect between your thoughts and reality. Instead of thinking, “Everyone will laugh,” you could reframe this to something like, “It’s okay to make mistakes; my classmates are generally supportive.” How does that sound?

User: That does sound better. I guess it’s just hard to remember that in the moment.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It takes practice to shift those thoughts, but you can definitely do it. What could remind you of this supportive perspective when you feel anxious?

User: Maybe I could write it down somewhere and read it before speaking. That might help me remember.

Consultant: Writing it down is a great strategy! Let's work on affirmations together that you can use to build confidence before you speak. What’s one positive statement you could tell yourself before going up to speak?

User: I could say, “I am capable of doing this, and it’s okay to be imperfect.”

Consultant: That’s an excellent affirmation! Let’s practice using it together. How might you feel if you repeated that affirmation before your next speaking opportunity?

User: I think it could help me feel a bit more at ease, perhaps reduce that panic a little.

Consultant: Great! Reducing that panic is a good step forward. Who could you visualize as being supportive while you’re speaking? 

User: I could visualize my friends who are always kind. That might help me feel less alone up there.

Consultant: Wonderful approach! Visualizing supportive people can create a comforting mental image. Now, what activities or practices do you think you could engage in to gradually expose yourself to speaking situations?

User: Maybe I could try practicing with friends first or even in front of the mirror. That feels less intimidating.

Consultant: Practicing with friends or in front of a mirror is a fantastic way to start! It allows you to build confidence in a lower-risk environment. How would you feel about setting a small goal to practice this week?

User: I suppose I could try to present a short summary of a topic I like to my friends. That feels manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! You’re setting a realistic goal. Before we wrap up, how do you feel about the progress you made today in understanding your thoughts and feelings?

User: I feel a bit hopeful. I can see that not all my thoughts are true, and I have some strategies to deal with it now.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear, Xiaozhang! Remember, change takes time, but you’re on the right path. In our next session, we can discuss how that practice went and continue building your confidence. 

User: Thank you! I feel better knowing what to do next.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress. Goodbye for now, and take care!

User: Goodbye!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to work on my public speaking anxiety, but I still feel quite nervous about it. I even avoided participating in a group discussion because of it.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like the anxiety is still significant, especially with the fear of repeating past failures in front of others. Can you tell me more about what you experienced during that group discussion?

User: Well, I felt a wave of panic thinking about having to speak in front of everyone. My heart started racing, and I just didn’t want to go through the embarrassment again. So, I decided to stay silent.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Xiaozhang. It's understandable to want to avoid situations that make you feel anxious. Let’s explore that feeling a bit more—what specific thoughts were running through your mind in that moment?

User: I kept thinking things like "What if I mess up again?" or "Everyone will think I'm terrible at this." It just made me feel worse.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing those thoughts. It seems like those negative beliefs really amplify your anxiety. Would you say these kinds of thoughts are common for you when you think about public speaking?

User: Yes, definitely. It feels like a pattern that I can't seem to break. I wish I could just feel more confident.

Consultant: Building confidence takes time, but you're already on the right path by recognizing those negative thoughts. Let’s challenge some of those beliefs together. What evidence do you have that you would mess up in front of others again?

User: I guess... I don't have any recent evidence. It’s just this lingering fear from previous experiences, mainly from that one time I stumbled over my words.

Consultant: That makes sense. It's easy to let one negative experience cloud your judgment. If a friend were to tell you they were worried about making the same mistake, what advice would you give them?

User: I would probably tell them to just focus on doing their best and not to be too hard on themselves.

Consultant: That’s great advice! Now, let's see if we can apply that to your situation. How might it feel if you allowed yourself to be a little more forgiving about any mistakes you might make?

User: I think it would help a lot. I can be really harsh on myself when I make mistakes, and it makes everything worse.

Consultant: Absolutely! Practicing self-compassion can be a powerful tool. Would you like to create a plan for your next speaking opportunity? We can include some strategies to help you manage that anxiety and focus on doing your best.

User: Yes, that sounds helpful! Maybe I can outline what I want to say and practice a few times before?

Consultant: That’s a great start! Structuring your talk and rehearsing can definitely boost your confidence. How about also thinking of some positive affirmations to tell yourself before speaking? Something like, "I am prepared, and it's okay if I make mistakes."

User: I could try that! It seems like a small thing, but it might help me feel better.

Consultant: Exactly! Small changes can make a big difference. Let’s talk a bit about how you can practice those affirmations. Would it be helpful to set a specific time before your next presentation to remind yourself of them?

User: Yes, I could spend a few minutes each morning saying them. That feels manageable.

Consultant: Perfect! Consistency will help reinforce that positive mindset. What else do you think you could do to prepare for the presentation?

User: I could also ask a friend to help me practice. I think that would make me feel less alone in it.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Practicing with a friend can provide support and make the experience more enjoyable. How do you feel about reaching out to a classmate for that?

User: I feel more confident about asking someone now. It seems less intimidating when I have someone else involved.

Consultant: That's a fantastic approach! Having support can ease your anxiety significantly. As we move towards closing today’s session, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed. What do you think are your key takeaways so far?

User: I’ve realized I need to challenge my negative thoughts more and be kinder to myself. I also have some strategies to prepare for my presentations.

Consultant: Those are brilliant insights, Xiaozhang. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. What will you take with you to help prevent those anxious thoughts from taking over next time?

User: I will focus on my preparation, positive affirmations, and seeking support. I feel like I have a plan now.

Consultant: That’s absolutely what we aim for! I'm really proud of you for taking these steps. As we wrap up, just remember that feeling nervous is normal, and with practice, you will gain more confidence. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out again. You’re doing great.

User: Thank you so much! This session has really helped me feel more positive about my public speaking.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaozhang! I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! I’m really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better actually. My anxiety about public speaking has eased a little because of the practice sessions. But I still find it nerve-wracking at times.

Consultant: That's great to hear that you feel a bit better! It sounds like the practice has been helpful. Can you share what specific situations still make you feel nervous?

User: Well, when I think about speaking in front of a larger group, like during a class presentation, I still get really anxious. I start worrying about what people will think of me.

Consultant: I understand that feeling. It’s natural to worry about how others perceive us, especially when speaking publicly. Let's explore that thought a bit deeper. What do you think would happen if something didn’t go perfectly during your speech?

User: I guess I feel like everyone would judge me or think I’m not good at it. It makes me hesitate to even start.

Consultant: That sounds very tough. Let’s take a moment to question that thought. What evidence do you have that people would judge you harshly? Have you seen it happen to others?

User: Actually, I’ve seen friends make mistakes during their presentations, and people usually just laugh it off or don’t seem to care much.

Consultant: Exactly! It seems like people are more forgiving than we often imagine. How might that change the way you see your own potential mistakes?

User: I suppose if they’re okay with mistakes, maybe I can be too. I just worry it would affect my confidence overall.

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry about that. Let’s try something together. What if we role-play a situation where you make a small mistake during a presentation? How might that look and feel?

User: Okay, I can try. Maybe I could fumble a word or forget a part of my speech?

Consultant: Great! Let’s set the scene. You’re at the front of your class, and while speaking, you accidentally skip a sentence. What do you think you might feel or say in that moment?

User: I’d probably feel embarrassed and wish I could hide. But I guess I could take a deep breath and just continue.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Breathe and keep going. How about we practice that deep breathing together now? It could help you feel more centered when facing an audience.

User: Sure! I think that would help calm my nerves.

Consultant: Let’s take a deep breath in for a count of four... hold for four... and breathe out for a count of six. Repeat that a few times. How do you feel now?

User: I feel a bit more relaxed, actually. I think I can handle it if that happens.

Consultant: Excellent! With practice, you can build that resilience. Are there more specific speaking scenarios we can work on together to boost your confidence further?

User: Maybe I could practice giving a short speech? That would be good to prepare for my class presentation.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Let’s outline a short speech together. What topic are you considering?

User: I was thinking about something related to my favorite subject, science, maybe about renewable energy.

Consultant: Perfect! Let's brainstorm some key points you want to cover in your speech. This way, you can feel more organized and confident.

User: I think I'll talk about solar energy, its benefits, and some popular projects in our area.

Consultant: That sounds very interesting! Now, as you structure these points, remember, it’s okay if you don’t cover everything perfectly. Can you remind yourself of that if you feel anxious during the speech?

User: Yes, I’ll try to focus on sharing the information rather than worrying about making everything flawless.

Consultant: Wonderful approach! It’s about sharing what you love, rather than focusing solely on perfection. Let’s plan a mock presentation next time. How does that sound?

User: I like that! It’ll be a good way to practice before the real thing.

Consultant: I’m glad you’re feeling positive about it. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on your progress. How do you feel about your public speaking journey now compared to when we first started?

User: I feel more hopeful! I’ve learned that it’s okay to make mistakes and that I can manage my anxiety better.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! Embracing those imperfections can create a much more comfortable space for your growth. As you head into your next speaking opportunity, remember you have the tools to manage any anxiety that arises.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. I'll definitely keep practicing!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’ve made. Remember, it’s okay to come back anytime you need support. Good luck with your preparations, and I believe in you!

Consultant: Hello, Xiao Zhang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident after that group presentation. I still get anxious when thinking about public speaking, but getting positive feedback really helped! 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like the positive feedback you received made a difference for you. Can you tell me more about how that experience felt for you?

User: Sure! When I finished my presentation, I was really nervous, but when my classmates said nice things, I felt relieved and happy. It was nice to know they appreciated it.

Consultant: It sounds like that was a validating moment for you. How do you feel about your ability to speak in front of others now compared to before the presentation?

User: I think I feel a bit better now. I’m still nervous imagining future speeches, but I’m trying to remind myself that it can go well, like last time.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Reminding yourself of positive past experiences can help reduce anxiety. What specific thoughts do you find yourself having when you begin to feel anxious about speaking?

User: I often think, "What if I mess up?" or "What if they think I'm boring?" Those thoughts make me really scared.

Consultant: Those thoughts are quite common when it comes to public speaking. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit more. What evidence do you have that you would mess up or that your audience would find you boring?

User: Well, I can’t think of any specific examples where I messed up. It’s more about my fear of the unknown.

Consultant: That's a key insight! It seems like your fear is largely based on uncertainty. What might happen if you considered a different perspective about those thoughts? 

User: I guess I could think, "I might do great," instead of focusing on messing up. That feels a bit more positive.

Consultant: Absolutely! Shifting your perspective can create a more supportive mindset. How would practicing this new thought help you feel before and during a public speaking event?

User: I think it would make me less anxious and maybe even excited about sharing my ideas. 

Consultant: That's a powerful shift! Let's practice together. Imagine you're preparing for another presentation. What could be a positive affirmation you might tell yourself?

User: I could say, "I’m prepared and I have interesting things to share!"

Consultant: Excellent choice! Saying affirmations like this can help you stay focused on your strengths. How do you think you'd feel using this affirmation before your next presentation?

User: I think I’d feel more calm and confident, instead of just afraid.

Consultant: Wonderful! Now, let’s develop a plan to keep building on this confidence. What actionable steps could you take over the next few weeks to practice your public speaking skills further?

User: Maybe I can try to practice speaking in front of friends more or even record myself and review it.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Practicing with friends can be a safe space to refine your skills, and recording yourself can provide valuable self-feedback. How can you set this up so that it feels manageable for you?

User: I could ask my friends if we can have a small presentation day after school next week. That way, it's not too overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds like a very achievable idea! Having a small group of friends will likely make it a more supportive environment. How do you feel about that plan?

User: I feel good about it! It feels less intimidating than a bigger audience.

Consultant: Great! Let’s also think about how you can follow up with this experience. After your practice, what will you do to reflect on how it went and what you learned?

User: I can write down my thoughts in a journal afterward to see what went well and what I can improve on.

Consultant: Reflecting in a journal is an excellent way to consolidate your learning. It can help you celebrate your successes and think constructively about any challenges. 

User: Exactly! I think I’ll keep track of the positive feedback I get and my own reflections in there.

Consultant: That’s a strong approach! Remember, every time you engage in these practices, you reinforce your confidence. How does it feel to know that you've created a structure for ongoing improvement?

User: It feels empowering! I know I'm working towards feeling even more confident in public speaking.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that, Xiao Zhang. As we wrap up today, let's summarize your progress: you've identified helpful thoughts, created an actionable step, and established a reflection process. How do you feel about the goals we’ve set today?

User: I feel really positive about them! I’m excited to put them into practice. 

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Remember, you are building on your strengths. As you continue practicing these strategies, you’ll see even more progress. If any challenges arise, we'll address them together.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm proud of the progress you've made. You're welcome to come back anytime for guidance. Keep up the great work, and I look forward to hearing about your successes next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaozhang! I'm glad to see you again. Today, let's discuss how you're feeling about public speaking and your recent achievements. What’s been on your mind since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel much better about public speaking now. I even hosted a small discussion in class, and my teacher praised me! It was a great feeling, but I still worry about future speeches.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Receiving praise must have boosted your confidence. Can you share more about what specifically made that experience positive for you?

User: I think I was well-prepared, and I practiced a lot beforehand. I felt more confident when speaking and enjoyed engaging with my classmates.

Consultant: Preparation really plays a significant role in how we feel during presentations. How do you feel about your preparation strategy? Do you think it can be further improved?

User: I do think I could explore different ways to prepare. Sometimes I feel that just practicing in front of a mirror is not enough. I wonder if there are other techniques I could try.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re open to experimenting with your preparation methods. What ideas do you have in mind for enhancing your practice sessions?

User: Maybe I could practice in front of a small group of friends or record myself and review it later. That seems like it might help.

Consultant: Those are great suggestions! Practicing in front of friends can provide immediate feedback, and reviewing recordings helps you identify areas for improvement. How do you feel about incorporating these techniques into your routine?

User: I think that would be really helpful. I feel like I’d get more comfortable speaking if I tried those methods.

Consultant: Comfort comes with practice, and it’s wonderful to see your proactive attitude! What other goals do you have regarding self-expression and public speaking in the long term?

User: I want to be able to speak confidently in front of larger audiences and maybe even participate in competitions. It would be nice to challenge myself further!

Consultant: Those are inspiring goals! Competing could be a great way to stretch your abilities. How do you envision stepping towards these goals? 

User: I suppose starting with more class presentations could be a good step, and then gradually increasing the audience size. I could also look for local competitions.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Gradually increasing your exposure will help build your confidence. What potential challenges do you anticipate as you pursue these goals?

User: I guess I might feel nervous regardless of the audience size. Sometimes the fear creeps back in, but I want to manage it better.

Consultant: Acknowledging that nervousness is completely normal. It’s part of the process. How would you like to manage that anxiety when it arises during your next presentation?

User: I could try some breathing exercises beforehand to calm myself down, or maybe remind myself of the positive feedback I've received.

Consultant: Those strategies are excellent! Breathing exercises can be quite effective, and recalling positive experiences can help shift your mindset. Can we create a specific plan that combines these elements for when you prepare for your next presentation?

User: Yes, we could outline a simple routine to follow. Maybe start with deep breathing, remind myself of previous successes, then practice my speech.

Consultant: That structure sounds very beneficial! Let’s also ensure to include short breaks during your practice sessions. How do you feel about balancing study and public speaking practice?

User: I think it’s important to balance them. If I'm overwhelmed with studying, I might feel more anxious about practicing.

Consultant: Absolutely. Taking breaks and pacing yourself is key to managing stress. How can you set up reminders to maintain that balance in your schedule?

User: Maybe I could use an app to remind me to take breaks and practice public speaking regularly. That way, I won’t feel rushed.

Consultant: Using an app sounds like a smart strategy! This way, you can create consistency in your practice while giving yourself those essential breaks. What are your thoughts on tracking your progress as you implement these changes?

User: I could keep a journal to record my practice sessions, feelings before and after, and any feedback I get. That might help keep me motivated.

Consultant: A journal is a wonderful way to reflect on your journey and recognize your growth. How do you feel about the potential benefits of this reflective practice?

User: I think it would be encouraging to see how much I’ve improved over time. It would remind me to continue working on my goals.

Consultant: That’s a positive perspective! Reflection can truly reinforce your achievements and remind you of your capabilities. As we wrap up our session, is there anything else you want to discuss or any concerns you have?

User: I feel good about our discussion! I just want to keep reminding myself that it’s okay to feel nervous and that practice is key.

Consultant: Those are healthy reflections, Xiaozhang! Remember, it’s perfectly okay to feel nervous. You have accomplished so much already, and I believe you’re on the right path. If you face challenges, feel free to reach out. Today’s session has gone well, and I’m excited to see how you progress!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your guidance. I’ll keep working on my goals!

Consultant: You're welcome! I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!
