Consultant: Hello JJxA! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’ve been feeling really angry and frustrated. My parents keep telling me to stop playing on my phone, and they don’t understand why I want to do that.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of anger, especially regarding your parents’ restrictions. Can you tell me more about what playing on your phone means to you?

User: Well, it's just fun to watch videos and play games. It makes me forget about school and everything else. 

Consultant: I can see why that would be appealing, especially if school feels overwhelming. What do you think your parents are worried about when they see you using your phone so much?

User: They think I’m being lazy and that I won’t do well in school. But I just think they don’t get it, like they don’t understand that I need to relax.

Consultant: That makes sense. You feel like you need that downtime, but it sounds like it’s leading to some tension at home. How do you feel when your parents bring up your phone use?

User: I feel really annoyed. Like, why can’t they just let me have my space? It’s like they don’t trust me.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way when you want more freedom, especially as you're growing up. What do you think would help ease that tension between you and your parents regarding your phone use?

User: I don’t know. Maybe if they would just stop checking up on me all the time, I’d have more room to breathe.

Consultant: That sounds like a good starting point. You want them to trust you more with your own choices. Have you talked to them about how you feel?

User: Not really. I usually just end up arguing with them, and then we go in circles. They don’t listen to me.

Consultant: It sounds really frustrating to feel unheard during those arguments. What do you think would happen if you approached them calmly and shared your feelings?

User: I guess it might help, but I’m not sure if they would understand anyway.

Consultant: It's tough to open up, especially when you’re unsure about their reaction. What do you think would help you express those feelings to them more effectively?

User: Maybe writing them a note? I could say everything I can’t get out during a fight.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Writing it down can help you convey your feelings clearly without the heat of the moment. How would it feel to try that approach?

User: I think it would feel good. I wouldn’t have to worry about yelling or anything.

Consultant: Exactly! It gives you a chance to express yourself without the pressure. Once you share your feelings, how do you hope they might respond?

User: I hope they would listen and maybe understand that I just want some freedom instead of them always telling me what to do.

Consultant: That’s a positive hope. Understanding your need for freedom could be a step towards a better relationship. How can we work together to make sure you feel heard in those moments?

User: I could practice what I want to say with you. That might help me feel more confident.

Consultant: That sounds like a constructive plan! Let’s think of a few key points you want to include in your note. What’s the most important message you want to share with your parents?

User: I want to tell them that I can manage my time and responsibilities; they just need to trust me a bit more.

Consultant: Trust is crucial, and you deserve to be treated as responsible. Let’s think about how you can demonstrate that responsibility. Are there any small steps you could take?

User: Maybe I could set a timer or a schedule for when I use my phone so it doesn’t affect my homework.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! By managing your time, you can show them you’re capable of balancing your interests and responsibilities. How would you feel about implementing that?

User: I think it sounds manageable! If I show them I can still do my work, they might worry less.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s all about proving to them that you can take care of both your interests and your responsibilities. What are your thoughts on setting a specific plan to discuss this with your parents?

User: I’d like that. If I have a plan, I can feel less anxious about talking to them.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Having a plan can empower you. How do you feel right now about moving forward with this idea?

User: I feel a bit better. Knowing that I can approach them calmly gives me hope.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It seems like you’re making progress. Remember, it’s all about taking it one step at a time. How do you plan to proceed from here?

User: I’ll write my note and make a schedule for my phone use. I think that will help a lot.

Consultant: I’m really proud of you for taking those steps. Remember, communication is key, and you’re on the right path. You aren’t alone in this journey, and I’m here to support you. 

User: Thanks! I appreciate it. 

Consultant: You’re welcome, JJxA! I’m looking forward to our next session to hear how it went. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello JJxA! I'm glad you're here today. I’d like to hear how things have been going since our last session. What’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hey. Things aren't great. My parents still want me to spend less time on my phone, and they keep bringing it up. It feels like I’m constantly in trouble for just wanting to enjoy my interests.

Consultant: I see, it sounds like you're feeling quite frustrated with their rules. It must be tough to feel like your interests and freedoms are being taken away. What do you think would help ease some of that tension?

User: I honestly don’t know. I just want them to understand that I don’t want to give up my phone completely. It’s not fair that they make all the rules.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. You’re looking for some understanding and freedom in how you use your phone. Can you tell me more about what you enjoy doing on your phone that makes it so important to you?

User: I love watching videos and playing games. It’s a way for me to relax and unwind after school. Without it, I feel bored.

Consultant: It seems like your phone serves as a vital source of entertainment and relaxation for you. Let’s explore this further. How do you feel when you have to put your phone down or when your parents ask you to reduce your usage?

User: I feel angry and trapped. It feels like they don’t care about what I enjoy, and I just want to do my thing without constant interruptions.

Consultant: It must feel very frustrating to have your interests overlooked. Recognizing those feelings is an important step. What if we tried to find a way that allows you to enjoy your phone while also addressing your parents' concerns? 

User: I guess that could work, but I still don’t know how they’d agree to it.

Consultant: Let’s think creatively. What if you set some boundaries together with your parents about phone use? For example, you could agree on specific times to use your phone. How would you feel about that?

User: That could be okay, but I don’t want them to make those times too short. I need enough time to enjoy it.

Consultant: Absolutely, it's important for you to feel that your time is respected. Let's aim for a balanced approach where you feel heard. What activities, besides using your phone, might interest you that could also bring some joy?

User: I used to like drawing, but I don’t do that anymore. I guess I could think about getting back into it. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Drawing can be a great way to express yourself. How would you feel about setting aside a bit of time for drawing each week to see if it helps balance your phone time?

User: I think I’d like that, actually. It might be nice to try. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! We can establish a gradual schedule that includes both drawing and phone time. How about we plan to re-evaluate how you feel about this in our next session?

User: Yeah, that sounds good. I hope it’ll help with my parents too.

Consultant: It’s a thoughtful step towards improving things at home. Remember, communication is key. You can express your intention to balance your interests to your parents. It might help them understand your perspective better. 

User: That makes sense. I’ll try talking to them about it. 

Consultant: Fantastic! As you begin this process, what do you think might be the biggest challenge you’ll face in communicating with your parents?

User: I think they might not listen. They usually just get upset when I bring up the phone.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It could help to approach the conversation calmly and to express how much you value your interests. Do you think you could frame it in a way that shares your feelings rather than just talking about rules?

User: I’ll try that. It’s worth a shot if it means we won’t fight over it.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focus on expressing yourself rather than simply negotiating rules. It’ll show them that you’re taking responsibility for your interests as well. I believe this will strengthen your communication with them.

User: I hope so. I just want them to really understand where I’m coming from.

Consultant: That’s a valid desire. It’s great that you’re willing to work on this. Remember, it might take time, but small steps can lead to significant changes. 

User: Yeah, I’ll keep that in mind. 

Consultant: Before we wrap up for today, let’s recap what you’ve decided to focus on. You want to explore drawing again and communicate your need for phone time with your parents. 

User: Right, and I’ll try and set a schedule that includes both.

Consultant: Exactly! You’ve made some positive moves today. How are you feeling about our session?

User: I feel a little better. I’m optimistic about trying the drawing and talking to my parents.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear. Remember, it’s a journey, and each step counts. I look forward to hearing how your conversations go in our next session. 

User: Thanks! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, JJxA. Keep up the effort, and know that you’re on the right path. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello JJ, welcome back to our session! I'm glad to see you here. How are you feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better. The sports activity I started has been fun, but I still have issues with my parents. 

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're enjoying the sports activity! Let's talk more about your feelings regarding your parents. What specific issues have you been facing lately?

User: Well, they still don't understand why I like spending time on my phone. We argue a lot about it, and it just makes me feel frustrated.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It seems like there's a lot of misunderstanding between you and your parents. Can you share what you think they might not understand about your time on your phone?

User: I just feel like I relax when I watch videos or play games. It helps me unwind after school, but they see it as a waste of time.

Consultant: I see. You want to relax and enjoy your free time, but your parents are concerned about how it's impacting your responsibilities. How do you usually respond when they bring this up?

User: I often get defensive and just say they don't understand what I enjoy. I can't help it if they think it's not important.

Consultant: It's understandable that you want to defend your interests, but this can lead to more conflicts. What do you think would happen if you tried to explain your perspective to them in a different way?

User: Maybe they would listen more, but I just don’t know how to express it without it turning into a fight.

Consultant: That's a valid concern, JJ. We could work on finding more effective ways to communicate with them. Would you be open to trying some new approaches for these conversations?

User: Yes, I guess I could try. But it's hard to stay calm when they get upset about it.

Consultant: Staying calm can indeed be tough. One technique could be to take a deep breath before responding, allowing you to think about how you'd like to express yourself. Would you be willing to practice this?

User: I can try that. It sounds like it might help me not react so quickly.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Let's also think about what specific points you want to communicate to them. What do you wish they understood about your interests?

User: I want them to know that it's my way of escaping stress and that I still do my homework and everything.

Consultant: It’s important they recognize that. Maybe you could express that by sharing how the videos help you unwind while still fulfilling your responsibilities. How do you feel about that strategy?

User: It seems reasonable. I just hope they will understand all of that when I talk to them.

Consultant: Building understanding takes time, but expressing your feelings clearly can be a step in the right direction. Along with this, how has your sports activity impacted your mood or relationships at school?

User: I've met some new friends. It feels nice to be part of a group, but I'm still not sure how to talk to them without feeling awkward.

Consultant: Making new friends can be exciting yet nerve-wracking. What do you think makes you feel awkward when you interact with them?

User: I guess I worry about saying the wrong thing or if they think I'm weird.

Consultant: Many people feel that way. Perhaps focusing on common interests, like sports, could help ease the conversation. What do you enjoy discussing when you’re with your new friends?

User: We usually talk about the games we play and sometimes funny moments during practice.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Sharing laughs can really strengthen friendships. How about we practice some conversation starters you could use next time?

User: Sure, I’d like that. It would be nice to feel more comfortable.

Consultant: How about starting with questions like "What did you think of our last game?" or "Do you have a favorite player?" These can keep the conversation light and engaging. Does that sound helpful?

User: Yes, those are good ideas. I'll definitely try them!

Consultant: Fantastic! I believe these strategies will help you feel more confident when interacting with others. Before we wrap up, what do you feel is the most important thing you’ve learned today?

User: I think learning to communicate better with my parents and trying to connect with friends through sports are really important.

Consultant: That's an excellent takeaway, JJ. I’m proud of your progress! Remember, it’s all about practice and patience. As we conclude, how do you feel about the steps we've discussed today?

User: I feel hopeful. I'm excited to try talking to my parents and my friends in a new way!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You have a solid plan moving forward. Keep practicing, and if you ever feel stuck, I'm here to help. Looking forward to our next session and hearing about your experiences!

User: Thank you! I’ll do my best and see you next time!

Consultant: You're welcome, JJ! Talk to you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello, JJxA! I’m glad you’re here today. How are you feeling about the recent activities you participated in with your classmates?

User: Hi! I felt really happy during the group activities. It was nice to be part of the team, but I still feel a bit anxious when I have to interact with others.

Consultant: It's great to hear you enjoyed the group activities! Feeling anxious in social situations is completely normal. Can you share more about what specifically makes you feel anxious when interacting with others?

User: I guess I worry about saying the wrong thing or that they won’t like me. Sometimes I just want to avoid talking altogether.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It sounds like you’re navigating some fear around social acceptance. When you worry about saying something wrong, what goes through your mind?

User: I think they might laugh at me or think I’m weird. It makes me not want to talk at all.

Consultant: It’s tough feeling that way. Let’s think about those thoughts—how likely do you think it is that your classmates would actually laugh at you or judge you harshly? 

User: I don’t know… maybe not as much as I think. But in the moment, it really feels real.

Consultant: That’s a valuable realization, JJxA. Our thoughts can sometimes exaggerate how others perceive us. Can we explore if there have been times when you’ve spoken up and the outcome wasn’t what you feared?

User: Well, during the team activity, I shared my ideas, and they listened. Nobody laughed or judged me. They even thanked me for contributing!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic example! It shows that when you express yourself, often the outcome can be positive. How did that make you feel?

User: I felt proud and relieved. It made me want to speak up more, but I still worry about it.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you felt proud! Why do you think those worries still linger? 

User: I think it’s just a habit. I’ve gotten used to being quiet because I was scared.

Consultant: Changing habits takes time. Let’s work on strategies to gradually challenge and replace those anxious thoughts. How about we create a small goal for your next social interaction? 

User: That sounds good. What kind of goal?

Consultant: How about aiming to share at least one idea or thought in your next group discussion? Even if it feels small, it can help build your confidence. How does that sound?

User: I think I can try that! It doesn’t sound too scary.

Consultant: Excellent! Remember, it’s about practice. If you feel anxious, take a deep breath and remind yourself of that positive experience from the team activity. What else can we do to support you in feeling more confident?

User: Maybe it would help to talk about what I might say or practice a bit before it happens.

Consultant: Practicing what you want to say is a great idea! Would you like us to role-play a scenario where you share your thoughts with your classmates?

User: Sure, that sounds fun!

Consultant: Fantastic! Let’s imagine you’re in a group discussion. What’s something you’d like to share?

User: Maybe I could suggest a fun game we could play together.

Consultant: That’s a great suggestion! How would you start that conversation?

User: I could say, “Hey guys, I have an idea for a game we can play together. What do you think?”

Consultant: That sounds perfect! You’re being assertive while inviting others to share their thoughts too. Practice saying it aloud a few times. How do you feel about that?

User: I feel a bit more confident saying it. It sounds good!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, the goal is to express yourself and see the reactions of your friends. You might be surprised by their positive responses. How are you feeling about your social interactions overall now?

User: I feel like I can handle it better. I’m excited to try speaking up more.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re gaining more confidence. Looking ahead, how do you see yourself applying these strategies in other areas, like at home?

User: Maybe I can talk more with my parents about things I want to do instead of just playing on my phone.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a great way to practice your communication skills. You could even share how you felt during the team activities—those positive experiences can strengthen your relationships at home too.

User: I didn’t think about that. I’ll definitely try to share with them how I felt.

Consultant: That’s excellent! Connecting positively with your parents can improve your relationships all around. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’re taking away from our session.

User: I’m taking away the idea of speaking up in group activities and practicing what to say beforehand. I want to keep building my confidence!

Consultant: That’s a solid plan, JJxA! Remember, it’s about taking small steps and celebrating your progress. I’m proud of what you’ve accomplished so far. Do you feel more equipped to handle social situations now?

User: Yes! I feel more ready to face it all.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Keep practicing, and remember that I’m here to support you. If you encounter any challenges, we can work through them together. I believe in you!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing how your experiences go. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, JJ! It's great to see you again. I hope you're feeling good after our last session. Today, I’d like to focus on how we can build on the positive changes you've made. How do you feel about your recent social interactions and your relationship with your parents?

User: Hi! I actually feel pretty good about things. I've made some friends in class, and the teachers have noticed my efforts. My parents seem a bit happier too, but I still get into trouble over phone usage sometimes.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear that you've made friends and have received positive feedback from teachers! It sounds like your confidence is improving. Can you share a bit more about what you think contributed to these positive changes in your social life?

User: I think participating more in class activities helped. I felt more involved and could talk to my classmates more easily. It was nice to be recognized for something good.

Consultant: Engaging in class activities can really boost your self-esteem and help build connections. It's great that you had that experience! Now, regarding your phone usage, what have been some of your thoughts or feelings about it when your parents talk to you about it?

User: Well, I get annoyed because I just want to relax with my phone. But I understand they worry about it affecting my schoolwork. Sometimes, I try to limit my time on it, but it's hard to stick to it.

Consultant: It makes sense that you feel frustrated. People often use their phones to unwind. Have you noticed any specific strategies that help you limit your phone use when trying to focus on your schoolwork? 

User: I've tried setting a timer for myself. It works sometimes, but I often forget when I get absorbed in watching something.

Consultant: Setting a timer is a good strategy! It shows you're motivated to improve. Let’s explore how you can make that timer more effective or even develop a routine around your phone use. What would a healthier balance look like for you?

User: I would like to have a time for studying and a time for fun. If I could keep them separate, it might work better.

Consultant: That's a great goal! Finding the right balance between studying and leisure is important. How about we create a simple plan together? What time do you think you could set aside for studying each day?

User: Maybe after school until dinner? That way, I have the evening free for video time.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Setting a consistent study time can help establish a routine. How do you feel about that structure? 

User: I feel pretty good about it! It seems manageable.

Consultant: Excellent! Now, let’s add to your plan. In addition to studying, how do you think you can reinforce your social relationships with your classmates?

User: I could invite them to join me for study sessions. That way, we can help each other out and have fun too.

Consultant: Inviting friends for study sessions is a fantastic idea! It can strengthen your friendships while also keeping you focused. Is there anyone specific in mind you would like to invite?

User: I think I'd invite Tom and Lily. We all get along well.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Building connections through collaboration can be rewarding. As you move forward, what positive changes do you think you can observe in yourself?

User: I think I will feel more confident. If I'm working with friends, it won’t feel like a chore.

Consultant: Confidence is key, and working with friends makes studying enjoyable. It's great to see you focusing on positive aspects! How can you remind yourself of these good experiences when you feel tempted by your phone again?

User: Maybe I could write down all the fun moments I've had and how good I felt when I was more involved in class activities.

Consultant: That's a brilliant idea! Keeping a record of successful experiences can serve as a motivational reminder. Would you like to commit to reflecting on these moments regularly?

User: Yes, I think I’d like to do that!

Consultant: Fantastic! As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel is the most important takeaway that you can apply in your daily life?

User: I think the reminder and the balance between studies and my phone are really important. Plus, spending more time with friends during study time will help me.

Consultant: Absolutely, balancing your activities while capitalizing on your friendships can make a significant difference. I am proud of your progress, and I’m excited to see how you will implement these strategies. Would you like to schedule another session to check in on your progress?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I want to see how well I can stick to the plan.

Consultant: Great! I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Remember that you have the tools to maintain these positive changes. Take care, JJ!

User: Thank you! I feel really optimistic now. See you next time!
