Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today, Xiaotian. I’d like to start by understanding how you’ve been feeling lately, especially with what happened in class. Can you tell me more about that?

User: Hi. Well, I got in trouble for shouting in class, and I think my teacher was being unfair. I felt really upset when she scolded me.

Consultant: It sounds like that situation really bothered you. You feel that your teacher was targeting you. Can you share what was going through your mind at that moment?

User: I just wanted to say something, but I didn’t think it was wrong. I felt like nobody listened to me, and that's why I shouted.

Consultant: It seems like you felt frustrated and overlooked. It’s important to be heard, isn’t it? What do you think made you feel the need to shout out like that?

User: I don’t know. I just felt like I had to say something, but then I got in trouble for it. I don’t really care though, I just think the teacher is too strict.

Consultant: You’re expressing that your teacher’s strictness makes it hard for you to share your thoughts. Can you recall a specific moment in class that led you to shout? What were you feeling just before that happened?

User: I was trying to explain my answer, and it seemed like no one was paying attention to me. I felt angry, like no one cared about what I was saying.

Consultant: Anger can be a strong emotion, especially when you feel unheard. How do you usually handle it when you feel angry at school?

User: I usually just ignore it, but sometimes I explode like this. I don’t like it, but it just happens.

Consultant: It sounds like you might feel overwhelmed when those emotions build up. Can we explore some ways to manage that anger before it leads to shouting? What do you think about that?

User: I guess that might help. But it’s hard to think of anything when I’m mad.

Consultant: That’s completely understandable. It can be challenging to think clearly in those moments. Maybe we can identify some signals that tell you when you're starting to feel angry. What kind of signs do you notice in your body or thoughts when that happens?

User: I feel really hot, and my heart starts beating fast. Sometimes, I just want to run away.

Consultant: Noticing those signs is a great first step. Recognizing them can help you take a moment to calm down. What if, when you start feeling that heat, you took a few deep breaths instead of reacting right away?

User: Hmm, I could try that. But I might forget in the moment.

Consultant: It's totally okay to forget at first. How about we think of a simple reminder you can use? For example, you could tell yourself, “Breathe and think.” Would that help?

User: Yeah, that sounds good. It might help me remember to calm down.

Consultant: I'm glad you think so! Implementing that reminder can create a little pause before reacting. Can you tell me how you think your classmates would respond if you explained your feelings instead of shouting?

User: Maybe they would understand better. But I'm still worried they won't listen.

Consultant: It’s natural to worry about how others may react, but sharing your feelings might help them see where you're coming from. What’s one positive thing that could happen if you tried talking it out?

User: Maybe they won’t think I’m just a loud kid. They could see I have feelings too.

Consultant: That’s a really insightful thought, Xiaotian. Connecting with your classmates by sharing your feelings could change their perspective about you. How does that make you feel to think about?

User: It feels nice to think they might understand me. I just need to figure out how to say it.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s about finding the right words. Would you like to practice saying something together? We could come up with a short way to express your feelings.

User: Sure, we can try that. 

Consultant: Great! How about starting with, “I feel upset when I’m not heard, and I want to share my thoughts”? What do you think about that?

User: That sounds okay. It’s clear, and I like it. 

Consultant: I’m glad you like it! Practicing that can help you feel more comfortable when you need to express yourself. Remember, it’s okay to share your feelings. Would you like to talk more about how to use this with your teacher or classmates next time?

User: Yes, I think that would be good. I really want to try it and see if it works.

Consultant: I believe it can make a difference, Xiaotian. We can explore more strategies in our next session. Remember, it's all about taking small steps. 

User: Thank you! I’ll try my best. 

Consultant: You’re welcome! You’re doing great just by being here and wanting to improve. Keep thinking about those breathing techniques, and let’s check in again next time. 

User: Okay! I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Looking forward to it! Take care, Xiaotian. Goodbye for now!

Consultant: Hello Xiaotian, I'm glad you're here today. I understand there is something on your mind. Can you tell me what happened recently at school that made you feel this way?

User: Hi. I got really mad at a classmate because I thought he was purposely not letting me copy his homework. I hit him, and now everyone is upset. I don't get why they don’t understand that I was provoked!

Consultant: It sounds like you were feeling very provoked and that made you lose control. Let's take a moment to explore what you were feeling when that happened. What thoughts were going through your mind at that moment?

User: I just felt like he was being unfair. I thought he didn't want to help me, and that really made me angry. I mean, how could he do that to a friend?

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel frustrated when you think a friend isn’t being fair. But let’s talk about the word "provoked." What do you think it means for someone to provoke you?

User: I think it means someone is trying to make you mad on purpose. Like, pushing your buttons until you snap.

Consultant: That makes sense. So in that moment, you felt like your classmate was pushing your buttons. But let's think about it: do you think it’s always someone’s intention to provoke another person? 

User: Well, maybe not. But in that moment, I just couldn’t control my feelings. 

Consultant: Recognizing that it can be hard to control feelings, especially when we feel hurt or unfairly treated, is an important step. Can you tell me how you felt after the incident? 

User: I felt bad, but also confused. I thought my reaction was justified because I felt attacked. 

Consultant: You felt bad and confused because you believed your reaction was justified. Let's explore that a bit further. Do you think there are other ways you could have responded instead of hitting him?

User: Maybe I could have just told him I was upset or something? But it felt like words wouldn't work.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Xiaotian! Talking about your feelings can be very powerful. Sometimes we may feel that words won’t help, but they can actually create understanding. What do you think you might say to him if you could go back to that moment? 

User: I might say I felt hurt when he didn’t let me copy. Maybe that would have made him understand.

Consultant: Absolutely! That shows you’re recognizing how to express yourself without getting angry. It’s a good skill to practice. What do you think about practicing that for next time?

User: I think it's worth a try, but I still feel really mad sometimes. It’s hard to control it.

Consultant: It’s definitely a process, and it’s okay to feel that way. Let’s talk about how to spot those emotions before they spill over. When you start to feel angry, can you think of some signs your body might give you?

User: Maybe my heart starts racing or I feel really hot?

Consultant: Yes, those physical signs are clues. Understanding those signs can help you catch your anger before it leads to actions you might regret. What could you do when you notice those feelings starting?

User: I could take deep breaths or walk away for a bit.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Deep breathing and taking a break can really help calm those big feelings. Is there a time you can remember doing that instead of reacting?

User: Well, I remember once I got mad at my mom but I took a deep breath and just went to my room instead. 

Consultant: That’s really good to hear. You’ve already practiced managing your feelings. It’s all about finding what works best for you. How do you feel about using some of those strategies in school, especially with your classmates?

User: I think I can try that! But I’m still worried about what they’ll think of me.

Consultant: It’s normal to worry about how others perceive us, but choosing to express your feelings positively can gain respect from your friends. What matters most is how you feel inside. Do you think you could remind yourself of that in tough situations?

User: Yeah, I see that now. I just don’t want to feel ignored or alone.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to want to feel heard. Remember, expressing your thoughts with words can bring you closer to friends instead of feeling alone. Next time, you might show you want to communicate. How would that feel to you?

User: I think if I could talk without getting angry, that would help. But it’s going to be hard.

Consultant: Definitely, it’s not always easy, but it’s a step in the right direction. As we move forward, I encourage you to keep practicing these skills, and it’s okay to lean on support when you need it. Should we talk about the importance of trust, especially with your dad?

User: I’d like to, because I feel like he doesn’t always keep his promises.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that, Xiaotian. Trust is very important, especially with family. Can you share a specific time when you felt he didn’t keep a promise to you?

User: He said we’d go to the park together last week, but he got busy with work again.

Consultant: That must feel really disappointing, especially when you were looking forward to spending time together. It’s okay to feel upset about that. How do you think that impacts your feelings toward him?

User: I just feel like he doesn’t care as much. Like, I’m not important.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling a bit overlooked, which is completely valid. Sometimes, when someone is busy, it doesn't mean they don’t care about us. What do you think could help you express how you feel to your dad?

User: Maybe I could tell him I feel sad when we don’t get to spend time together.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful way to express yourself! Sharing your feelings that way can create opportunities for improvement. How do you feel about reaching out to him?

User: I guess I could do that. I hope he listens.

Consultant: I believe he will, especially if you express your feelings honestly. As we wrap up today, remember that you have the ability to communicate and cope with your emotions. You’ve shown a lot of growth today. How do you feel about your progress in understanding these feelings? 

User: I feel better knowing I can talk about it. Even if it’s hard sometimes, I want to try.

Consultant: That’s a great attitude to have, Xiaotian! I’m proud of your willingness to learn and grow. Remember, every step counts. If you ever feel overwhelmed, reach out for support, and know that it’s okay. We will continue working together on this journey. Thank you for sharing today; I hope you have a great week ahead!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaotian! I'm really glad to see you today. I understand that you've been feeling a bit down recently because of your father's canceled plans. Would you like to share what that experience has been like for you?

User: Hi. Yes, I was really looking forward to spending time with my dad this weekend. But when he canceled, it felt like he didn’t care about me at all. I felt really upset and neglected.

Consultant: It sounds like you were really looking forward to that time together, and when it fell through, it made you feel unimportant. That must have been really hard for you. Can you tell me more about the feelings that came up when he canceled?

User: I felt angry and sad at the same time. I thought maybe he just doesn't want to spend time with me. It makes me wonder if he even cares.

Consultant: Those feelings make a lot of sense, especially considering how much you were looking forward to that time. It's tough when someone we care about doesn't meet our expectations. Do you think this situation has changed the way you view your relationship with your dad?

User: Yeah, a little. I used to think that he always wanted to spend time with me, but now I’m not so sure. It feels like I can’t trust him to keep his promises.

Consultant: Trust can be a really delicate thing, especially when it feels like promises are broken. It’s understandable to question things now. What if we took a moment to think about the reasons your dad might have for canceling? Could there be other things going on that we don't know about?

User: I guess he is really busy with work. But it still hurts because I just wanted him to be there for me.

Consultant: Absolutely, it's okay to feel hurt. Balancing work and family is difficult for many people. Perhaps we could explore ways to express your feelings to him when the time is right. How do you think he would respond if you talked to him about how this made you feel?

User: I don’t know. He’s usually busy, so I feel like he wouldn’t really listen.

Consultant: It can be hard to feel like we won’t be heard, especially when we’re feeling vulnerable. However, sometimes sharing our feelings, even briefly, can open the door to understanding. What do you think might happen if you expressed how much you were looking forward to your time together?

User: Maybe he would realize it’s important to me. But what if he just gets defensive or brushes it off?

Consultant: That's a valid concern. Sometimes people react defensively when they feel guilty or pressured. It might help to frame it as sharing your feelings rather than blaming him. You could say something like, "I was really excited about our weekend together, and when it didn't happen, I felt sad." How does that approach feel to you?

User: That sounds okay. It’s less confrontational. I might try that.

Consultant: I'm glad that resonates with you, Xiaotian. Expressing how you feel can help with rebuilding trust over time. What about focusing on some activities you can do with your dad when he’s free? What kind of things do you both enjoy together?

User: We like to go hiking and play basketball. I really enjoy that time with him.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful activities, and they can really strengthen your bond. Perhaps you can suggest planning a hiking trip for the following weekend instead. This way, you can express your desire to spend time together while acknowledging his current commitments.

User: I could do that! It sounds like a good idea.

Consultant: Great! Focusing on future plans can provide something to look forward to while also demonstrating to your dad how much those times mean to you. How are you feeling about this new approach?

User: It makes me feel a little better. I think I won’t feel as disappointed if I’m able to plan something ahead.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! Being proactive in setting up future moments can really help manage your feelings of disappointment. Besides planning this, what other things could help you cope with the feelings of sadness and frustration when they arise?

User: Maybe I could talk to my mom. She usually knows how to make me feel better.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent idea! Talking to your mom can provide comfort and support. Would you feel comfortable sharing with her how you’re feeling about your dad’s cancellation?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. She always listens.

Consultant: Fantastic! It sounds like expressing your feelings will help you feel supported. Remember, it’s okay to seek that connection. As we move forward, let’s think about how you can build confidence in expressing your feelings to both your parents. 

User: I’d like that. I want to be braver about saying how I feel.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal, Xiaotian! Building that bravery will help you not just in your relationship with your dad, but in other areas of your life too. Finally, as we wrap up today, what’s one takeaway you have from our conversation that you’d like to remember?

User: I think it’s important to communicate what I feel and plan for fun times ahead.

Consultant: Absolutely! Communication and planning can help you feel more connected and understood. I’m really proud of you for working through this today. Remember, it doesn't hurt to reach out for support when you need it. I’m looking forward to hearing how this next conversation goes with your dad. 

User: Thank you! I feel a lot better today. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaotian! I'm glad to hear that. Remember, you're not alone in this. I believe in your ability to manage these feelings and build strong connections with your family. Take care until next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaotian! I'm glad you're here today. It sounds like you've had some recent positive experiences at school. How are you feeling about that?

User: Hi! Yes, I was really happy when my teacher praised me. But now, I'm worried it might just be temporary, and I’ll mess things up again.

Consultant: I understand that you're feeling happy about the praise but also concerned about maintaining that success. Let's dive deeper—what specifically makes you feel that you might fail again?

User: I don't know. It just feels like one moment I'm doing well, and the next, everything could go wrong. I guess I just don't really believe in myself.

Consultant: It's okay to feel mixed emotions. Building confidence takes time. Can you tell me about a moment when you felt successful in school, maybe something that went well in the past?

User: Well, there was that time when I helped a classmate with a project, and the teacher complimented us. I felt good then!

Consultant: That sounds like a great experience! Helping others is something to be proud of. How did you feel about your abilities in that moment?

User: I felt smart and helpful! But I also think that was just luck. What if I can’t help again?

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, but it’s important to recognize that helping your classmate wasn't just luck—it shows you have skills and the ability to work well with others. How can we use that experience to build more confidence for the future?

User: Maybe I could try helping someone else again? But what if I fail? 

Consultant: That’s a natural concern. How about we take it step by step? We can set small goals for you. For instance, you could offer help to a classmate once a week. What do you think?

User: That sounds okay, but what if they don’t want my help?

Consultant: It’s possible, and that’s okay! Remember, each time you reach out, you’re taking a step forward, and it’s about trying, not just succeeding. How would you feel after attempting to help, even if they decline?

User: I guess I would feel proud that I tried, even if it didn’t work out.

Consultant: Absolutely! Trying is a big part of building confidence. How about we also track these little successes? After each attempt, we can discuss how you felt and what you learned. How does that sound?

User: That sounds like it could help! I’d like to see my progress.

Consultant: Great! Let's make a plan for your first step. When would you like to try helping someone next?

User: I can maybe ask my classmate about math tomorrow. He sometimes struggles with it.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Remember, you’re offering support, and that shows your kindness. How would you feel about writing down your feelings before and after this interaction to see how it goes?

User: I think I could do that. It would be interesting to see if I feel different before and after.

Consultant: Exactly! This can be a valuable tool for you. After you've tried it, we can talk about what happened. How do you feel about this plan?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I want to try!

Consultant: That’s fantastic, Xiaotian! Embracing new experiences takes courage, and you’re on the right path. Is there anything else you’re concerned about regarding this plan?

User: What if I still feel anxious, even if I help them?

Consultant: Feeling anxious is completely normal. It shows that you care. What if we practiced some calming techniques together so that you feel more prepared when you approach your classmate?

User: That could be good. I want to feel less nervous.

Consultant: Let’s practice a simple breathing exercise. Inhale deeply through your nose for four counts, hold for four counts, and then exhale through your mouth for four counts. We can do this a few times before you meet your classmate.

User: Okay, I’ll try that! Breathing sounds easy.

Consultant: It is! And remember, it’s all about progress. Each attempt, no matter the outcome, helps you grow. You have so much potential, Xiaotian! 

User: Thanks! I feel that I can do this now.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! You’re taking important steps towards building your confidence. Let’s keep working together to explore how you can engage with new activities and form connections with others.

User: That sounds good! I’m excited and a little nervous, but I want to do it.

Consultant: Both excitement and nervousness are completely normal. As you face these new situations, just remember to reflect on what you’ve achieved. You’re capable of handling these challenges. 

User: I will remember that! Thank you for helping me.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaotian! I believe in you and the progress you’re making. We'll check in next time on how things went, alright?

User: Okay! I can’t wait to share my experiences.

Consultant: I look forward to hearing all about it. You're doing great, and remember, every small step counts toward building your confidence! 

User: Thank you! I feel much better about everything now. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Xiaotian. Keep up the great work, and I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm really excited to have you here today, and I can't wait to hear more about what you've been up to lately. How are you feeling about joining the painting club at school?

User: Hi! I'm feeling a bit nervous. I really want to make friends, but I'm worried that they won't want to play with me or include me in their activities.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel nervous when trying something new, especially when it involves meeting new people. Can you tell me more about what you're excited about regarding the painting club?

User: Well, I love painting! It makes me feel happy and relaxed. I hope the other kids like to paint too, and maybe we can have fun together.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! Painting can be a great way to connect with others. What do you think you could do to start a conversation with someone in the club?

User: Hmm... I could maybe ask them what their favorite colors are or if they like to draw things?

Consultant: Those are excellent conversation starters! Asking about favorite colors is a fun and easy way to break the ice. How do you think you would feel if someone asked you those questions?

User: I think I would feel happy! It would make me feel like they are interested in me.

Consultant: Exactly! It's all about creating that interest and connection. If you find someone who feels the same way, how do you think that would change your experience in the club?

User: I guess I would feel less scared and more comfortable. Maybe I could even invite them to paint together!

Consultant: Yes! Inviting them to paint together is a great idea. Building connections like that can really help you feel more at ease. What are some feelings that come up for you when you think about talking to others?

User: Sometimes I feel excited, but mostly I feel shy and a little anxious, like my heart is racing.

Consultant: Those feelings are very common, and it's important to acknowledge them. When your heart races, it can be tough to approach others. What would you like to do when you start feeling that anxiety?

User: I would like to calm myself down. Maybe take a deep breath or remind myself that it's okay to be a little scared.

Consultant: Deep breathing and positive reminders are excellent strategies! Let's think about how you can use these techniques before you enter the club. Can you picture yourself taking a deep breath before talking to someone?

User: Yes, that sounds good. I can imagine myself doing that. I think it will help me focus on what I want to say.

Consultant: That’s a great visualization! Remember, the more you practice these techniques, the easier it will become. How do you think you can keep track of your feelings before and after each club session?

User: Maybe I could keep a little journal to write down how I feel before I go and then how it went after. 

Consultant: A journal is an excellent tool for reflecting on your experiences! It can provide insights into your thoughts and feelings over time. What will be the first thing you write in your journal after your first painting club meeting?

User: I think I will write about how nervous I felt before going in and if I talked to anyone and how it went.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Reflecting on your emotions can really help you recognize your progress. Can you tell me about a time when you felt more comfortable talking to someone?

User: I remember when I talked to my teacher about a project I was working on. At first, I was nervous, but she was really nice, and it made me feel better.

Consultant: That’s a great example! It shows that sometimes our fears can be eased when we connect with others. How might you remind yourself of that experience when you feel shy in the painting club?

User: I can think about how nice my teacher was and how that conversation turned out well. Maybe I can remember that people can be friendly and supportive too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Holding onto those positive experiences can give you the confidence to approach new situations. As we wrap up today’s session, what are you feeling most hopeful about regarding your first day in the painting club?

User: I feel hopeful that I can try talking to someone and maybe even make a new friend!

Consultant: That's a fantastic hope to have! Remember to be kind to yourself and take things one step at a time. You've got this! If you ever need to talk again, I'm here. 

User: Thank you! I feel better talking about this. I can’t wait to try my best!
