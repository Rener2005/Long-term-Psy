Consultant: Hello, Xiao Ming! I'm really happy to see you today. How are you feeling about your time at school lately?

User: Hello! I feel good! I was quiet in class recently, and the teacher was happy with me. I want to keep doing that and show I can be good in class.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It's great that you were able to be quiet in class and that your teacher noticed. Can you tell me how you felt when you were being quiet and the teacher praised you?

User: I felt really proud! I liked when the teacher said, "Good job, Xiao Ming!" It made me want to keep being quiet.

Consultant: It sounds like that praise made you feel really good about yourself! It's important to recognize how your good behavior can make you feel proud. What do you think are some things you can do to stay quiet in class again?

User: I can sit still and listen to my teacher. Sometimes, I want to talk to my friends, but I can wait until after class!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea, Xiao Ming! Waiting until after class to talk to your friends shows good self-control. Do you have any other strategies that might help you stay focused in class?

User: Maybe I can play a quiet game in my head, like counting colors or thinking of animals. That might help me stay quiet!

Consultant: That’s a clever strategy! Using games in your mind to keep focused is a fun way to help yourself. How did you feel after you managed to stay quiet while playing your game?

User: I felt happy and less fidgety! It was easier to listen to the teacher, and I didn't want to talk as much.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It's amazing how you found a way to control your urge to talk while still learning. What do you think a good reward would be for yourself when you stay quiet again?

User: Maybe I can get a sticker or a small treat! I like stickers a lot!

Consultant: Stickers are a fantastic reward! They can remind you of your achievements every time you see them. How would it feel to get a sticker for staying quiet in class?

User: I would feel very special! I would want to show it to my family!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan, Xiao Ming! Sharing your achievements with your family can make it even more special. Let’s talk about how you can remind yourself to use your strategies when you feel the urge to talk in class. What might help?

User: I think I can tell myself, “Wait to talk!” Or I could use my fingers to count to five before I say something.

Consultant: Those are really effective reminders! Counting to five gives you a moment to think before speaking. How do you think your friends might respond when they see you practicing being quiet?

User: They might notice I am quiet and ask why. I can tell them I want to be good in class!

Consultant: That's great! Explaining your goals to your friends can help them understand your efforts, and they might even want to join you. What do you feel when you think about sharing this with them?

User: I feel excited! I think they would think it’s cool, and we can all be good together.

Consultant: That sounds like a lot of fun! Working together with your friends makes it a team effort. Is there anything else you'd like to work on during our time today about your behavior in class?

User: No, I think that's all! I just want to keep being good and maybe get more stickers!

Consultant: Perfect! Practicing staying quiet and focusing in class is a great goal, and I'm confident you can achieve it. How about we review everything you will practice this week?

User: I will remember to be quiet, count to five before talking, and play games in my head!

Consultant: Excellent recap, Xiao Ming! I'm proud of you for setting these goals. Remember to celebrate your achievements, like getting your stickers. As we finish today’s session, how are you feeling about your progress?

User: I feel really proud and happy! I can’t wait to try these things!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! You are doing an amazing job, and I believe in your ability to keep improving. I'm looking forward to hearing about your successes next time! 

User: Thank you! I’ll try my best!

Consultant: You're welcome! Remember, every little step counts. See you next time, Xiao Ming!

Consultant: Hello there, Xiao Ming! I’m really glad you’re here today. I heard you’ve been doing great with sharing and helping your classmates. How are you feeling about your time at school?

User: Hi! I feel really good! I helped my friend with the toys during group activities, and it was fun to share. I want to keep doing that, but sometimes I get a bit overexcited.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re really enjoying sharing and helping others. Can you tell me more about what happens when you feel overexcited?

User: Well, sometimes I just want to grab the toy and play without asking, even if someone else wants to play too. I want to share, but sometimes I can't help it.

Consultant: It sounds like you're trying hard to be a good friend and share, but those feelings of excitement can make it tricky sometimes. What do you think you could do when you feel that excitement so you can still share?

User: Maybe I could take a deep breath and wait for my turn, but sometimes it’s hard to remember to do that when I really want to play.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Taking a deep breath can help you pause and think. Can we practice that together? Imagine you see a toy you want to play with. What could you say to yourself to remind you to share first?

User: I could say, “Wait! Sharing is fun too!” Maybe that will help me remember.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive reminder! You could even visualize sharing and having fun with your classmates. How do you think your friends would feel if you did that?

User: They would probably be happy! They like when I share. I want them to be happy.

Consultant: Absolutely! Sharing can bring a lot of joy to everyone. Let’s think of a situation where you felt overexcited. Can you tell me about it and what went through your mind?

User: One time, I saw my friend playing with a car, and I wanted to play with it too. I just ran over and took it from him. I thought, “I want to play now!” but then he looked sad.

Consultant: I can understand how you felt excited and wanted to play right away. What could you say or think next time you feel that excitement about taking the toy?

User: I think I should remember my friend's feelings. I could ask, “Can I play with it after you?” instead of just taking it.

Consultant: That’s an excellent thought! Asking first shows you care about your friend’s feelings. How do you think it would feel to you to ask for that turn?

User: I would feel happier if my friend is happy too! It’s nice to share.

Consultant: Definitely! And when you share and ask nicely, it can help everyone have more fun together. Let’s talk about what can make it easier for you to remember to ask and share when you feel excited.

User: Maybe I can ask my teacher to remind me. And I can practice with my toys at home too!

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Asking your teacher for reminders can help you. Practicing at home will make it even easier. What else could help you remember to share during playtime?

User: I could make a little sign that says “Share first!” and hang it up where I play. That could remind me to share more.

Consultant: I love that idea! A reminder can be really helpful. How do you feel about making that sign and using it when you’re playing?

User: I feel excited! It will help me remember, and I can show it to my friends too!

Consultant: That’s fantastic! And sharing your sign with your friends might encourage them to share too. What do you think you'll do if you forget and feel overexcited again?

User: If I forget, I will try to breathe and remember my sign. And if I make a mistake again, I can say sorry and ask for another chance.

Consultant: That’s a mature way to handle it! Saying sorry shows you care about your friends’ feelings. How do you feel about your ability to improve your sharing and get better at waiting your turn?

User: I feel proud! I really want to do better. It feels good when everyone is happy.

Consultant: That’s a great feeling, Xiao Ming! Let’s recap what we’ve talked about: you’ll have your reminder sign, practice asking, and remember to apologize if you need to. How does that sound for your plan moving forward?

User: It sounds good! I feel ready to try and make my friends happy while playing.

Consultant: You’re really showing a lot of growth, Xiao Ming. I know you can keep working on this. If you ever feel uncertain, you can always come back and share your experiences, okay?

User: Okay! I will. Thank you!

Consultant: You're very welcome! I’m proud of the progress you’re making. Remember, it’s okay to feel overexcited sometimes, and you’re doing a great job trying to manage it. Looking forward to hearing more about your adventures next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaoming! I'm really happy to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I feel okay, but I still sometimes get really excited and run around during gym class. It's fun, but my teacher reminded me to calm down.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re having a lot of fun, but also facing some challenges with staying calm. It’s great that you want to show good behavior. Can you tell me what you did after your teacher reminded you?

User: I stopped and took a deep breath. I tried to listen more and not run so much after that.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful way to handle the situation! Taking a deep breath can really help you calm down. When you feel excited next time, what other things do you think might help you control your energy?

User: Maybe I could try counting to ten or think about what I need to do, like just playing and not running around too much.

Consultant: Counting to ten is a great idea! It gives you a moment to think. Let's practice this now—imagine you're feeling excited and ready to run. Can you walk me through how you might use counting to help you?

User: I would start counting: one, two, three... until I get to ten. This will give me time to decide if I should calm down or keep playing.

Consultant: Exactly! By counting to ten, you give your brain a moment to catch up with your feelings. Besides counting, how do you think deep breathing helps you in those moments?

User: Breathing helps me feel less jumpy. When I breathe in and out, I can think better about not running.

Consultant: That’s a really good insight, Xiaoming! Breathing can slow down your heart and help you think more clearly. Can you think of a time you used your breathing to calm down?

User: Yes! One time during gym class, I got really excited when we played a game. I took a deep breath and remembered to focus.

Consultant: Great job remembering to focus! It seems like you're already applying your breathing technique. What would you like to do next time you feel that excitement in class?

User: I think I will use my breathing and maybe remind myself, “Calm down, it's okay.” 

Consultant: That's a wonderful reminder to yourself! It’s important to encourage yourself. How does it feel when you can remind yourself to calm down like that?

User: It feels good! I think I can stop from getting too wild, and I’ll feel proud of myself.

Consultant: Being proud of yourself is an excellent feeling! It shows that you recognize your progress. What do you think you might gain from using these techniques during class?

User: I could get to play more with my friends and not get in trouble. It would be fun!

Consultant: Absolutely! Having fun and playing with friends is very important. You're building skills that can help you enjoy your time at school even more. How does this make you feel about participating in class activities?

User: I feel more confident! I want to join in more and show my teacher I can do it!

Consultant: That's a fantastic attitude, Xiaoming! Your confidence will shine through when you use these techniques. Let’s think of a game. When you feel excited in class, how about you practice taking a deep breath and counting while playing?

User: Yes! I can practice that. I want to be a good player and friend.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! Being a good player and a friend makes everyone happy. What strategies can you use to support your friends if they feel excited too?

User: I can remind them to breathe and count like I do!

Consultant: That’s a generous idea, Xiaoming! Helping your friends shows a lot of kindness. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the progress you’ve made with your self-regulating skills?

User: I feel proud! I’m excited to use my breathing and counting and to help others too.

Consultant: You should be very proud of yourself! You’ve made great progress. Remember, it’s all about practice. Keep using those techniques, and don’t hesitate to share them with others! I look forward to hearing about your successes next time.

User: Thank you! I'm happy we talked. I'll see you next time!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Xiaoming! I’m glad we had this time together. Keep up the great work, and I can't wait to hear all about your experiences in our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Little Ming! I'm really happy to see you today. How are you feeling about your classroom activities lately?

User: Hi! I feel really good! The teacher said I did great when I spoke up during class discussions. It makes me want to participate more.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Getting positive feedback can really boost your confidence. Can you tell me how it felt when you shared your thoughts in class?

User: It felt exciting! I was a bit nervous at first, but then I felt proud when the teacher smiled and said it was a good answer.

Consultant: It’s amazing that you felt proud! That’s a great feeling to hold onto. What kinds of things do you enjoy talking about in class?

User: I like talking about our stories and sometimes I share about my favorite games. It makes me happy when friends listen to me.

Consultant: That’s lovely, Little Ming! Sharing your interests makes the discussion more fun for everyone. How do you think you can keep that good feeling when you want to share something in class?

User: Maybe I can think about the fun things I want to say before I raise my hand. That could help me feel less nervous!

Consultant: That sounds like a smart plan! Thinking ahead can give you the confidence to speak up. Are there any moments when you still feel a bit scared?

User: Sometimes, I worry that my answer might be wrong, and then I don’t want to raise my hand.

Consultant: That’s understandable. It's normal to worry about being correct. Can I ask, what do you think might happen if your answer isn’t exactly right?

User: I guess the teacher will just correct me, and it's okay to learn.

Consultant: Absolutely! Learning is all about trying and sometimes making mistakes. If a friend was feeling nervous about sharing, what would you tell them?

User: I would tell them that it's okay and that we can all learn together.

Consultant: That's a wonderful way to encourage your friend! What if you used those same thoughts to help yourself when you feel nervous?

User: I think that could work! I’ll remember that it’s okay and that I can learn from it.

Consultant: Yes, exactly! Now that you’re feeling more confident after speaking up, are there specific things you’d like to practice in our session today?

User: I want to practice talking about my favorite story and how to say it to the class.

Consultant: Great choice! Let’s set the scene—imagine we’re in class, and I’m your teacher. Can you tell me about your favorite story?

User: Okay! My favorite story is about a dragon that helps a village. The dragon is really friendly, and everyone loves it!

Consultant: That sounds amazing! You shared that really well. What other details about the dragon or the village would you like to share?

User: I want to say that the dragon helps with everything, and there’s a festival to celebrate it. Everyone has fun!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic addition! Celebrations bring joy to the story. Now, let’s think about how to share that in a way that catches everyone’s attention. What could you say at the beginning to make everyone excited about your story?

User: Maybe I could start with, “Did you know there’s a kind dragon that saves a village?”

Consultant: That’s a great opener! It makes people curious. Would you like to try telling your story from the beginning?

User: Yes! Did you know there’s a kind dragon that saves a village? The dragon is really friendly, and everyone loves it!

Consultant: You did wonderfully! Your tone makes it sound very engaging. How did it feel to share that part of your story?

User: It felt really good! I was nervous at first, but now I feel proud!

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Building your confidence is an important step. If you keep practicing like this, I believe you will get even better at sharing in class. Is there anything else you want to work on before we finish?

User: Maybe I can also practice speaking a little louder, so everyone can hear me.

Consultant: That sounds like a good idea! Let’s work on that together. When you practice at home or in class, remember to speak clearly and confidently. How do you think you can remind yourself to do that?

User: I will think about my happy thoughts and remember that I have good things to say!

Consultant: That's perfect! Keeping happy thoughts in mind will definitely help you. You’ve made great progress today, Little Ming. How do you feel about all the things we've talked about?

User: I think they will be proud of me! They like it when I do good things.

Consultant: Absolutely! Having your family’s support can make a big difference. Have you talked to them about your plans yet?

User: No, not yet. But I want to tell them about my chart and the star.

Consultant: It’s a great idea to share your plan with them! They can help cheer you on. How do you feel about sharing your goals with them?

User: I feel good! I think they will be excited. It will help me stay on track.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Support from your family can really help you stick to your goals. Is there anything else you feel you need to keep up this good behavior?

User: Maybe I need to remember that it’s okay to ask for help if I need it.

Consultant: Yes, asking for help is very important! Everyone needs support sometimes. What can you do if you’re feeling unsure or need some encouragement?

User: I can ask my teacher or my mom or dad. They can help me remember what to do.

Consultant: Perfect! Having that support network will keep you focused. Can you think of a time when asking for help made a positive difference for you?

Consultant: Hello there! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling about your time at home and school lately?

User: Hi! I'm feeling pretty good! I shared some funny stories with my family, and they said my way of expressing myself is much better now. It makes me happy!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like your family is noticing your progress, which is fantastic. Can you tell me more about how you feel when you share those stories?

User: I feel excited! I love making them laugh. But sometimes, I worry if I'm saying the right things or if they think I'm silly.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way sometimes. You want to share your thoughts while also being accepted. Have you noticed any specific moments where you felt unsure about what you were saying?

User: Yes, there were times when I forgot some words. I felt embarrassed, but then my family encouraged me to keep going.

Consultant: It’s great that your family supports you! Encouragement can make a big difference. When you felt embarrassed, what thoughts went through your mind?

User: I thought maybe they would laugh at me, or think I’m not good at talking.

Consultant: I understand that it can be tough to feel that way. Let's explore those thoughts a bit more. Do you think those thoughts reflect what truly happens when you share your stories?

User: Maybe not… They usually laugh because they find it funny and they enjoy listening to me.

Consultant: Exactly! Sometimes our minds can trick us into thinking negatively. So, when you notice those worries, how could you remind yourself of the support and laughter from your family?

User: I could think of the times they laughed with me and said nice things. That would make me feel better.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Focusing on the positive moments can help shift your feelings. Let's talk about your experiences at school. How have things been going for you there?

User: School is okay! I like playing with my friends, but sometimes I feel shy to speak up in class.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel shy sometimes, especially in front of others. Can you recall a specific moment in class when you felt shy to speak?

User: There was a day when the teacher asked a question, and I knew the answer, but I didn’t raise my hand.

Consultant: That’s a brave acknowledgment! What do you think held you back from raising your hand that time?

User: I was afraid everyone would look at me and I might say something wrong.

Consultant: I see. The fear of being looked at or saying something wrong can make anyone hesitant. How do you think you could handle that feeling in the future?

User: Maybe I could practice raising my hand at home with my family first, so I feel more confident.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Practicing in a safe environment can really boost your confidence. What else do you think might help you feel more at ease when speaking up?

User: I could remind myself that everyone makes mistakes and that it's okay!

Consultant: Yes! That’s a healthy mindset to have. Everyone does make mistakes, and it’s part of learning. How do you feel about your progress so far?

User: I feel proud that I'm improving! Talking is getting easier, and I want to keep getting better.

Consultant: You have every reason to feel proud! Recognizing your progress is key. What would be your next step to continue improving your speaking skills?

User: I want to try sharing stories more often and maybe join a little group where I can talk to friends.

Consultant: Those are wonderful steps! Engaging more with others will definitely help you grow. How does it feel knowing you have goals to work towards?

User: It feels exciting! I really want to show everyone what I can do.

Consultant: That's a brilliant attitude! Keeping that excitement is vital. As we wrap up our session today, can you share what you consider your biggest achievement so far?

User: I think it’s that I’m feeling more confident and my family is proud of me!

Consultant: That’s truly impressive! Celebrating your achievements is important. Remember, whenever you face challenges, there are ways to overcome them. If you ever need support again, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help. I feel great about our talk today!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm glad to hear that. Keep shining and sharing those stories. Take care until next time!
