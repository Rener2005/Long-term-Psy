Consultant: Hello Xiaohua! I'm glad you're here for our session today. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling even more anxious. The pressure of exams is really getting to me, and I keep overthinking everything. It's like my mind won't stop racing.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It seems like the anxiety is becoming overwhelming, especially with exams to contend with. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that keep racing through your mind?

User: I keep thinking about how much I need to succeed. If I don’t perform well, I worry what my mom will think. Sometimes, I even compare myself to my classmates, and that makes it worse.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way, especially with high expectations from yourself and others. When you think about comparing yourself to your classmates, how does that make you feel?

User: I feel jealous. I hate it, but I can't help it. It makes me feel like I'm not good enough, and then I stress even more about getting the grades I want.

Consultant: Jealousy can indeed create a lot of pressure. You’re feeling like your worth is tied to being the best. Can we explore what evidence supports the thought that not achieving your goals makes you less valuable? 

User: I don’t know. I guess if I don't do well, it means I’m not trying hard enough? My mom talks a lot about hard work and success, and I feel like I have to prove that I’m capable.

Consultant: That’s a common belief, but it’s worth questioning. What if you didn't achieve the grades you wanted? Would that truly determine your worth as a person? 

User: Maybe not, but it feels that way when I think about it. I just want to make my mom proud.

Consultant: Wanting to make your mom proud is a natural desire, but remember, your value isn't based solely on your academic achievements. What alternative thoughts could you adopt when you're feeling this way?

User: I could try to remind myself that I’m doing my best, and that it's okay to make mistakes. But it’s really hard to think that way in the moment.

Consultant: It can definitely be challenging. Let’s consider a small experiment. The next time you find yourself feeling anxious during exams, can you try taking a moment to breathe deeply and say something reassuring to yourself? 

User: That sounds like it could help. If I remind myself to breathe and stay calm, maybe it will make a difference.

Consultant: Exactly! Practicing deep breathing and positive affirmations can be powerful tools. Let’s also discuss activities you enjoy outside of studying. Have you been able to do anything fun lately?

User: Not really. I've been so focused on studying that I haven't had time for anything else. I used to play basketball a lot, though.

Consultant: Basketball sounds like a great release for stress! How about we schedule some time to play this week? Engaging in activities you enjoy can help reduce your anxiety.

User: I think I could do that. It would feel nice to play again, even just for a little while.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Incorporating enjoyable activities can really help you manage anxiety. Let’s check in on your feelings during our next session. How do you feel about starting to implement these strategies?

User: I feel a bit hopeful. It sounds manageable. I really want to work on not letting my anxiety control me.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset, Xiaohua! Remember, acknowledging your feelings is the first step. Before we end today’s session, could you summarize what you've learned so far that you find helpful?

User: Sure. I learned that I can challenge my negative thoughts about my worth being tied to grades. I can also try deep breathing and focus on positive self-talk while playing basketball or studying. 

Consultant: Perfect! You seem to have grasped these concepts well. As we continue, let's keep revisiting these strategies and monitoring your progress. Next time, we can also discuss your experiences with these techniques. How does that sound?

User: That sounds great! I’m excited to see how things go.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It's been a pleasure working with you today. Remember, it's okay to take it one step at a time. I'm here whenever you need support. See you at our next session!

User: Thank you! I appreciate it. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Xiaohua! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling recently, especially regarding your interactions with your classmates?

User: Hi. I haven’t been feeling great. Lately, I've noticed that I’m becoming more anxious and there's tension between me and some of my classmates. I find it hard to talk to them, and I feel isolated.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It’s understandable to feel anxious when social interactions become difficult. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel tense when you’re around your classmates?

User: I think it’s partly because I’m afraid of saying something wrong or that they won't like what I have to say. Sometimes, I feel like they are judging me.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure to fit in and be accepted. Those worries can be overwhelming. What kinds of thoughts come to your mind in those moments of tension?

User: I often think things like, “They’ll probably think I'm stupid” or “What if they don’t want to talk to me?”. It makes me want to avoid them altogether.

Consultant: I see how those thoughts can contribute to your anxiety and make you want to withdraw. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit more. How much evidence do you think there is that your classmates are actually judging you negatively?

User: I don’t know… I guess it’s more of a feeling I have rather than something I can prove. Sometimes they seem distracted or uninterested, which makes me think they don’t want to talk to me.

Consultant: That's a valuable insight, Xiaohua. It’s easy to misinterpret others' behavior, especially when we’re feeling anxious. If a friend were in your situation, what would you suggest they think about these interactions?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay if someone seems distracted; it might not have anything to do with them. But I find it hard to think that way for myself.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate perspective. It sounds like you care a lot about your friendships. Let’s work on reframing those thoughts for yourself. Instead of assuming they are judging you, could you consider that they might be preoccupied with their own issues?

User: Yes, I can see that. It makes sense that others might have their own problems. 

Consultant: Great! Let’s build on that understanding. Can we think of an example where you felt less anxious in a social setting? What was different about that situation?

User: Well, during a group project last week, I felt more comfortable because we were all focused on the task. I actually contributed to the discussion, and it felt good.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It shows that focusing on a shared goal can help ease anxiety. How about we come up with some strategies for similar situations in the future?

User: That sounds good. What kind of strategies can we use?

Consultant: One strategy could be to start conversations with open-ended questions related to schoolwork or shared interests. This can help steer the conversation and take some pressure off you. Would you be willing to practice that?

User: Yes, I’d like to try that. I think starting with school topics might make it easier.

Consultant: Excellent choice! What are some questions you could ask your classmates to open up that conversation?

User: Maybe I could ask them about their opinions on a recent lesson or if they need help with homework.

Consultant: Those are great starters! It’s a good way to show interest and engage without feeling overly pressured. Now, let’s role-play a situation where you use one of those questions. How does that sound?

User: Okay, I’ll give it a try. 

Consultant: Imagine you see a classmate who seems approachable. How would you initiate the conversation?

User: I’d say, “Hey! What did you think about the math lesson today? I found it a bit tricky.”

Consultant: That sounds perfect! You’re engaging them in a conversation while also expressing your feelings. How do you feel about that approach?

User: I feel a bit more confident about it now. It’s not just me talking about myself.

Consultant: Exactly! It creates an opportunity for connection. Let’s think about what steps you can take to feel prepared when you’re faced with these situations. What would help you feel more at ease?

User: Maybe having a few more questions prepared in advance could help. I can also remind myself that it’s okay if not every conversation goes perfectly.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Remember, it’s about practice, and each step you take can help build your confidence over time. Would you be open to trying this out in the coming week and sharing your experiences with me next session?

User: Yes, I’ll try it out. I want to see if it helps.

Consultant: I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes! You're making great progress. As we wrap up today, what would you say has been your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think it’s that my thoughts can be really misleading, and I need to challenge them more. Plus, I can prepare to make interactions less stressful.

Consultant: Absolutely, Xiaohua. That’s a significant realization. You’re learning to manage your anxiety and engage more confidently with others. Remember, I'm here to support you whenever you need. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today.

Consultant: It’s my pleasure! I’m proud of the steps you're taking. See you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaohua! I'm glad you're here today. Let's talk about how you've been feeling recently, especially after the competition. How are you doing?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really down lately. I participated in this competition, and I didn't do as well as I had hoped. Now, I'm just doubting my abilities.

Consultant: I hear you. It’s tough to deal with those feelings of self-doubt, especially when you set high expectations for yourself. Can you tell me more about what you felt after the competition? 

User: Well, I thought I was prepared, but when I saw my results, I felt like I had let myself and everyone down, especially my mom. She has always had such high expectations for me.

Consultant: That sounds very challenging. It's understandable that you would feel that pressure, especially given your mom's expectations. What thoughts went through your mind when you saw the results?

User: I kept thinking that maybe I'm not as smart as I thought I was. Maybe I won't be able to achieve the goals I've set for myself.

Consultant: That’s really heavy to carry. It sounds like you’re feeling like your self-worth is tied to your performance. Have you noticed how those thoughts affect your feelings or actions?

User: Yes! Whenever I think that way, I feel really anxious and demotivated. It makes it hard to study or focus on anything else.

Consultant: It seems that these negative thoughts are creating a cycle of anxiety and demotivation. Let’s try to break that down a bit. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that you’re not smart enough?

User: I guess I don’t have much evidence other than this one competition. I usually do well in my studies, but this just overshadowed everything.

Consultant: It’s important to recognize that one setback doesn’t define your overall abilities. If a friend faced a similar situation, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably remind them of their achievements and encourage them not to dwell on one failure.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! You seem to have a lot of compassion for others. Now, what if you applied that same kindness to yourself? 

User: I suppose I should remind myself of my successes too. It just feels hard to do that right now.

Consultant: Totally understandable. Let’s try to reframe that a bit. Instead of focusing on that competition, what other achievements can you acknowledge in your life?

User: Well, I have consistently good grades, and I have enjoyed participating in other activities like sports. 

Consultant: Those are excellent accomplishments! By recognizing those, you can challenge the thought that your worth is based solely on this one experience. Can we work on setting some realistic goals moving forward?

User: I think so. Maybe I can set smaller, achievable targets instead of aiming too high all the time.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! What might be a reasonable goal for you in your next study session or competition?

User: I’d like to focus on preparing for my upcoming exams without putting too much pressure on myself.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Taking it one step at a time can help ease that pressure. How can you remind yourself to stick to this goal when challenges arise?

User: Maybe I can write down my goals and reasons for studying without stress. That could help me look at it when I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Great idea! Keeping a visual reminder can reinforce positive thinking. Would you say that expressing your feelings about the competition helped you understand your emotions better?

User: Definitely! Talking about it makes me feel a bit lighter, even if I still feel pressured by my mom's expectations.

Consultant: It’s good to acknowledge that pressure. Let’s think about strategies to communicate with your mom about how you’re feeling. How do you think she would respond if you shared your thoughts with her?

User: I think she might understand, but I worry she’ll still push me hard to do well. I don't want to disappoint her.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. However, sharing your feelings could foster understanding and strengthen your relationship. What’s one small step you could take to open up that dialogue?

User: I guess I could start by expressing that I appreciate her support but that I need to find my own path too.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy approach. You deserve to express your needs while maintaining that relationship with her. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit anxious but also relieved. I think it’s important to be honest with her.

Consultant: Absolutely! Honesty can be very freeing. Remember, it’s about finding a balance between your expectations and hers. As we wrap up today, what’s one takeaway or strategy that you want to focus on this week?

User: I want to work on my mindset and remind myself of my achievements, and communicate better with my mom.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! I believe you can do this. Remember, it’s a process, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. I look forward to hearing how it goes next time we meet. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help today. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Xiaohua! Take care, and see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaohua! I'm really glad you could come in today. How have things been going since our last session?

User: Hi. Honestly, things have been pretty rough. I've had a few arguments with my mom recently. It feels like no matter what I do, I can’t meet her expectations, and that really stresses me out.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling quite pressured by your mom's expectations, and those arguments are adding to the tension between you two. Can you tell me more about what those arguments were about?

User: Mostly about my grades and how I should be studying more. She thinks I should be getting straight A’s all the time, and I just feel overwhelmed. I used to handle it better, but now it just feels like too much pressure.

Consultant: I can see how that would make you feel overwhelmed. It seems like you’re caught between wanting to meet her expectations and feeling that pressure weighing you down. How did you feel after those arguments?

User: After we argue, I feel really upset and guilty. Like I'm letting her down. I want to make her happy, but I also feel resentful when she pushes me so hard.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way. You care about your mom's happiness, but it’s also important to acknowledge your feelings of resentment. Have you had a chance to express these feelings to her?

User: Not really. I usually just stay quiet because I don't want to make things worse. I’m afraid of what she might say if I try to explain how I feel.

Consultant: I can see why that would be difficult. It might be helpful to think about some ways you could express your feelings while still maintaining a good relationship. What do you think about that idea?

User: Yeah, I guess it could help. I just don’t know how to start the conversation without it turning into another argument.

Consultant: Starting the conversation can be tricky, but perhaps you can begin with something like, "Mom, I've been feeling really stressed about school, and I’d like to talk about it." This way, it opens the door for a discussion without immediate conflict. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds okay, but what if she doesn't understand or just brushes me off?

Consultant: That's a valid concern, Xiaohua. Maybe you could prepare yourself for that by thinking about how you would respond if she reacts that way. Would you be able to share how her response makes you feel at that moment?

User: Maybe I can try that. I could say something like, "I feel hurt when we argue because I want us to have a good relationship." 

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Expressing your feelings clearly and thoughtfully can help her understand your perspective. How do you feel about trying this in the next few days?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also relieved that I have a plan. I hope it goes well.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about it. It’s a big step, but you’re taking control of the situation. If you find yourself feeling anxious before or after the conversation, remember to take deep breaths and remind yourself of your intentions. 

User: That makes sense. I’ll try to stay calm. I want to be able to talk to her without feeling like I'm walking on eggshells.

Consultant: That’s a good goal. Practicing calmness can really help your approach. And remember, it’s also okay if the conversation doesn't go perfectly. What’s important is that you’re standing up for yourself and trying to open up the lines of communication.

User: Yeah, I think I needed to hear that. I sometimes tend to be too hard on myself if things don’t go as planned.

Consultant: It’s very common to be hard on ourselves, especially in situations that involve loved ones. Remember to be compassionate towards yourself throughout this process. Do you think you'd be willing to set aside some time to reflect on how this conversation went after it happens?

User: Yes, I can do that. It would help me think through what worked and what didn’t.

Consultant: Exactly. It’s a great way to learn and grow from the experience, and it may help you feel more prepared for future conversations. Let’s take a moment to reinforce your goals for the upcoming week. How can you make sure you’re feeling supported as you work on this?

User: I guess I could check in with some friends before I talk to her. They usually understand my situation and help me feel less alone.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Connecting with friends can give you a sense of support and encouragement. We’ve been making some good progress today. How do you feel about your ability to handle the situation with your mom now?

User: I feel a bit more confident. I still have some doubts, but I think I have the tools to express myself better.

Consultant: That’s a positive shift! Recognizing that you have tools and strategies will help you manage your feelings. Would you like to share anything else that’s been on your mind lately?

User: Just the thought of starting at a new school next year is kind of intimidating. What if I don't fit in?

Consultant: Transitioning to a new environment can bring up a lot of anxiety. It's normal to feel unsure about fitting in. Let’s navigate this together. What specific worries are coming up for you about this new school?

User: I'm worried that I won't make any friends and that I’ll feel alone. I guess I've just always had a few close friends and now it’s all changing.

Consultant: Change can be daunting, especially when it affects your social life. You’ve put a lot of thought into your friendships, and that’s valuable. Have you thought about how you might approach making new friends in that new environment?

User: I suppose I could try joining some clubs or activities to meet people with similar interests, but it still feels scary.

Consultant: Joining clubs is a fantastic idea; it provides a way to bond over shared interests. And feeling scared is completely natural. Maybe you could set a small goal, like starting a conversation with one new person each week, to ease into it. How does that sound?

User: That could work. I just need to remind myself to be confident.

Consultant: Confidence can grow with practice. Just remember to take one step at a time. You’re doing great by thinking ahead about how to adapt to these changes. 

User: Thanks! I feel a bit more at ease talking about all this stuff.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that. Keep in mind that you’re capable of adapting and growing in this new environment. Remember, I’m here for you whenever you need guidance. 

User: I appreciate that! I think I’ll try to keep these strategies in mind as I move forward. 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today and any next steps you’d like to take as you continue to navigate both your relationship with your mom and the upcoming school change.

User: Sure! I’m going to talk to my mom about how I feel and try to reflect on that conversation. Also, I’ll look into activities at school and practice being confident.

Consultant: Those are excellent steps! You’re making strides towards improving both your relationships and your confidence. It's been a fruitful session today. Feel free to reach out whenever you feel you might need support. 

User: Thank you! I feel really hopeful!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about progress. Looking forward to our next session. Take care and keep up the good work!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaohua! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really anxious. The new tutoring class is overwhelming, and I'm not sure if I can fit in with everyone.

Consultant: I understand that feeling anxious in a new environment can be quite challenging. Let's talk about what specifically is making you feel overwhelmed. Can you share what thoughts come to mind when you're in the class?

User: I keep thinking that everyone is smarter than me and that I won't be able to keep up with them. It makes me really nervous.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are really affecting your confidence. What emotions do you experience when those thoughts arise?

User: I feel a mix of anxiety and self-doubt. Sometimes I even feel like I want to give up before trying.

Consultant: That’s understandable, Xiaohua. It's challenging when we feel we might not measure up. Have you noticed any situations where those doubts seem to be stronger than others?

User: Yes, when the teacher asks questions and I don’t know the answer, I feel so embarrassed and anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like those moments are particularly tough for you. Can you recall a specific instance when you felt this way recently?

User: Last week, the teacher asked a question about a topic I wasn’t familiar with, and I just froze. My heart was racing, and I felt so embarrassed.

Consultant: I can see how that would be a difficult experience for you. Let’s explore that moment a bit deeper—what was going through your mind right before you froze?

User: I thought, “Everyone will think I’m stupid if I don’t answer.” That thought just paralyzed me.

Consultant: It seems that thought really impacted your ability to respond. What evidence do you think supports that thought? Is there any possibility that others might be understanding?

User: I guess I don’t really know if they would think that. But I feel like they would just assume I’m not smart enough.

Consultant: That’s a common concern, but maybe we can challenge that thought. If a friend was in a similar situation and felt unprepared, what advice would you give them?

User: I’d probably tell them that it’s okay not to know everything and that it doesn’t define their intelligence.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s a valid perspective. So, for yourself, can we try to adopt a similar mindset? What if not knowing the answer doesn’t reflect on your abilities?

User: That makes sense. I just need to remind myself that everyone is learning and nobody knows everything.

Consultant: Absolutely! Now, let’s consider some practical strategies. What could you do the next time you feel that anxiety in class?

User: I could take a deep breath and remind myself that it’s okay to not have all the answers.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Deep breathing can help ground you. How about also preparing some questions or topics you want to discuss before class? Would that feel manageable?

User: Yes, I think preparing some questions could help reduce the pressure.

Consultant: Awesome. Let’s also work on some exposure techniques. Perhaps you could practice speaking up in smaller, more relaxed settings first. Would you be open to that?

User: Yes, I’ll try that in my group of friends first. It shouldn’t be too hard.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! How do you feel about your progress so far in feeling more confident to adapt to this new environment?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful now. I see that I can take small steps to improve my comfort level.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Xiaohua! Remember, growth takes time. What strategies can you keep in mind for the future when you feel anxious?

User: I can remind myself that it’s okay to have questions and that everyone is learning together. 

Consultant: Yes, and maintaining that perspective will really help in facing new challenges. Before we wrap up, what would you say is your biggest takeaway from our conversation today?

User: I think my biggest takeaway is that it’s okay to not know everything, and I can practice more to build my confidence.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! As we conclude our session, let’s note the progress you’ve made and how you can carry this newfound confidence into your daily life. How do you feel about leaving today?

User: I feel relieved and excited to try out these ideas. Thank you for your help!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. Remember, maintaining that positive mindset is key. Don't hesitate to reach out again if you need support. Good luck, and take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, 小华! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good actually. Getting recognition for that project with my classmates made me realize my value more. I seem to have a more positive outlook recently!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like that recognition has really boosted your self-esteem. What specific thoughts or feelings come to mind when you reflect on that achievement?

User: I feel proud of myself. I think I can contribute something valuable when I work with others, and it’s nice to be appreciated for that.

Consultant: It's great that you're recognizing your contributions! Being appreciated can really validate our efforts. How might you use this newfound recognition to help you set long-term goals for your academics or personal development?

User: I want to keep striving for good grades but also explore different activities, maybe join a club or something. It would be nice to balance schoolwork with other interests.

Consultant: That sounds like a balanced approach! Exploring new activities while maintaining your academic performance can definitely keep things exciting. What types of clubs or activities are you considering?

User: I'm thinking about joining the debate club. I like discussing and debating topics, and it might help me improve my speaking skills too.

Consultant: Joining the debate club sounds like an excellent choice! It aligns well with your interests and can also enhance your skills. As you consider this, how do you think participating in such activities will affect your overall mindset and motivation?

User: I think it will keep me motivated. If I’m involved in something different, it could help me stay enthusiastic about my studies as well.

Consultant: Absolutely! Engaging in different activities can refresh your focus on your studies. Since you mentioned wanting to keep positive thoughts, how can you ensure that you maintain this optimistic mindset even when faced with challenges?

User: I could remind myself of my achievements and the positive feedback I’ve received. I think that would help me stay motivated.

Consultant: That's a powerful strategy! Reminding yourself of your achievements can indeed serve as a confidence booster. Would you like to create a specific plan for how you'll incorporate these reminders into your daily routine?

User: Yes, I’d like that. Maybe I could keep a journal where I write down my accomplishments each week.

Consultant: A journal sounds like a fantastic idea! It can help you track your progress and maintain that positive outlook. How often do you think you could set aside time to write in your journal?

User: I could probably do it every Sunday. It would give me a nice way to reflect on my week.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Setting aside a specific time each week for reflection can really solidify those positive thoughts. Is there anything else you'd like to add to your personal development plan?

User: I want to make sure I maintain a good balance between study and leisure time. I don't want to push myself too hard.

Consultant: That's a wise consideration. Balancing work and relaxation is critical for maintaining your mental health. How do you currently manage your time between studying and taking breaks?

User: I usually study for a few hours and then take breaks to play games or hang out with friends.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthy routine! It's important to reward yourself after focused work. What strategies could you use to ensure that your break times remain refreshing and don’t turn into procrastination?

User: I think I need to set a timer for my breaks. That way, I won’t lose track of time when I'm gaming or chatting.

Consultant: Setting a timer is an excellent strategy! It allows you to enjoy your leisure time while also keeping you accountable. How do you feel about this plan for managing your time going forward?

User: I feel good about it. The timer will help me stay disciplined without feeling too stressed.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It seems like you've made some important decisions today. To sum up our session, how do you feel about the progress you've made and the goals you’ve set for yourself?

User: I feel really positive! I think I have a good plan to maintain my self-esteem and work toward my long-term goals.

Consultant: That’s fantastic, 小华! Remember, it’s all about enjoying the process. As we conclude this session, do you have any concerns or questions about your journey ahead?

User: No, I think I’m all set. I’m looking forward to putting everything into action.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! You’ve got this, and I’m confident you’ll handle everything admirably. If you ever need to talk again, don’t hesitate to reach out. Good luck, and take care!

User: Thank you! I'll definitely keep that in mind. Goodbye!
