Consultant: Hello J! I'm glad you could join me today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I feel really down. My friends teased me recently about my food at school, and it made me feel even worse about myself.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that, J. It can be tough when others say hurtful things. Can you tell me more about how that incident made you feel?

User: I felt really embarrassed and ashamed. I've always been a bit shy, and this just made me feel more like an outsider.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult. It's normal to feel hurt when people tease us. In moments like this, what thoughts go through your mind about yourself?

User: I just keep thinking that I'm weird and that nobody really wants to be friends with me.

Consultant: It sounds like you're being really hard on yourself. Let’s try to unpack that a bit. When you think you’re "weird," what evidence do you have for that belief?

User: I don’t know… maybe because I don’t eat the same things as others? And I'm smaller than most kids.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel different sometimes, but being different doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you. What are some things you like about yourself or that others have said nice things about?

User: I guess I’m good at helping my mom with her food stall... and sometimes I make people laugh.

Consultant: Those are great qualities, J! Helping out and making people laugh shows you’re caring and have a good sense of humor. How do you think these qualities could help you feel better about yourself?

User: I suppose if I think about those things, maybe I wouldn’t feel as bad. But it’s hard to focus on the good stuff.

Consultant: It can be hard, especially when negative thoughts seem stronger. What do you think would happen if you tried to remind yourself of those positive qualities when you feel low?

User: I think it might help a little. But I’m still worried about school and my friends.

Consultant: It’s perfectly okay to have those worries. What if we brainstormed some small steps you could take to connect with your friends, even while managing those feelings?

User: Okay, maybe I could try inviting one of them to help me with homework. But what if they say no?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. What if you considered their possible responses? Could there be a way to frame your invitation that feels comfortable for you?

User: Maybe I could ask them if they want to hang out and do work together, like just chilling and studying. That sounds less pressured.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Making it sound casual could help reduce some pressure. How do you feel about asking them?

User: I feel a bit anxious but also excited about it. It’s a start, I guess.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful perspective, J! Feeling anxious is natural, but taking that first step is important. How can we support you in feeling less anxious when you ask?

User: I don’t know… maybe if I practice what I’ll say a bit?

Consultant: Practicing is a fantastic strategy! You could even write down what you want to say. Would you like to try that together right now?

User: Sure! That could help. 

Consultant: Let’s think about it together. How about starting with something like, “Hey, would you like to come over and study with me? We can help each other out”? How does that sound?

User: That sounds okay! Simple and to the point. 

Consultant: Exactly! It allows you to invite them without a lot of pressure. After you invite them, how do you think you’ll feel if they agree?

User: I think I’d feel better. It might make me feel like I fit in more.

Consultant: That’s a positive outcome to look forward to! Remember, the invitation is just one step. Regardless of their answer, you’re making a great effort to reach out. 

User: Yeah, I guess so. 

Consultant: Let's talk about how you can process your feelings afterward, whether they say yes or no. What do you think you could do to take care of yourself in that moment?

User: Maybe talk to my mom or write in my journal. I feel better when I express myself.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Sharing your feelings with your mom or writing them down can help you process what happens. How do you feel about including this practice regularly? 

User: I think I’d like to try that. Maybe it would help me feel more confident.

Consultant: That's a great approach, J. It's all about gradually building that confidence. Would you like to set up some goals for this week focusing on these steps?

User: Yes, I’d like to aim to talk to my mom about it and try reaching out to at least one friend.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! As you work through these steps, remember to be gentle with yourself and recognize each effort you make. How does that feel for you?

User: It feels good. I’m hopeful I can improve things.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that, J! We can continue to build on these experiences in our future sessions. Just remember, you’re not alone in this.

User: Thank you. This means a lot to me. 

Consultant: I’m happy to help, J. Keep focusing on those positive qualities and steps you’re taking. I look forward to hearing how it goes next time we meet.

User: Me too. I’ll do my best. 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Take care, and see you soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello J! I’m glad you’re here for our session today. Let’s talk about how you’ve been feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I feel really overwhelmed and a bit helpless. My dad got mad at me for not finishing my homework last weekend. It makes me feel like I can’t keep up and I’m not doing enough at home.

Consultant: I hear you, J. It’s tough when you feel pressure from both school and home. Can you tell me more about how this makes you feel, especially in terms of your schoolwork?

User: I just feel really stressed out. I want to do well at school, but sometimes it feels impossible. I’m scared I won’t catch up with my classmates.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of pressure to perform both at school and at home. When you think about your homework, what specific thoughts go through your mind?

User: I often think that I’m not smart enough to finish my homework, and I feel like I’ll always disappoint my parents if I fail.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy to carry, J. Let’s explore them a bit. Do you think there’s any evidence that supports the idea that you’re not smart enough? Have you ever succeeded at something you thought was difficult?

User: Well, I did manage to complete a project last month, but it took a lot of time. I just feel like everyone else gets things done faster than I do.

Consultant: That’s great to hear about your project! It shows that you are capable when you put in the effort. How about what you mentioned earlier—can you think of times when you felt proud of your achievements, no matter how small?

User: Sometimes I feel good when I help my mom with her work, but with homework, it just feels different. I feel like I'm always behind.

Consultant: Helping your mom is definitely something to be proud of, and it shows responsibility. Let’s tackle this homework situation together. What if we set some small, achievable goals for your homework? This might help you feel more accomplished and reduce that overwhelming feeling.

User: That sounds okay, but I’m not sure how to start.

Consultant: No worries, J! We can break it down. How about if we start with writing down your tasks for this week? Which subjects do you feel you need the most help with or time to focus on?

User: I think math and English. I always struggle with math, and sometimes I don’t understand what the teacher says in English.

Consultant: That’s a good start. Let’s create a plan. How about setting aside 15-20 minutes each day for math, and maybe a little time for English too? We can also see if there are ways to make these subjects more interesting for you.

User: I guess that could work. I could try using some videos online for math.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Online videos can help explain things in a different way, making them easier to understand. How will you feel after trying this new plan?

User: Maybe a bit more in control? If I can understand the math better, at least I won’t feel so lost.

Consultant: Exactly, feeling more in control can really boost your confidence. Remember, it’s okay to ask questions if you don’t understand something. What about your homework time? How do you feel about making a specific schedule for it?

User: I could try doing my homework right after school when I get home. That way, I can finish before my mom gets busy with her work.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Having a routine can really help in managing your time. How do you think this change might make you feel about your homework and responsibilities?

User: I hope I won't feel so stressed! If I stick to this plan, maybe I’ll actually finish everything.

Consultant: That sounds promising, J. Remember, it’s a process, and it’s okay to adjust your plan if necessary. Now, let’s also talk about how you can express what you’re feeling to your parents. Would you feel comfortable discussing your struggles with them?

User: I think I could try talking to my mom. She might understand, even though she’s busy.

Consultant: That’s a good step, J. Sharing your feelings can sometimes lighten the load. You might be surprised by their support. How do you feel thinking about having that conversation?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also relieved to consider it. Like maybe they’ll help me, or at least understand.

Consultant: Nervousness is normal, but it’s great that you’re open to it. I believe that being open with them can really help. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you see as your next steps?

User: I’ll make a homework schedule, try some videos for math, and talk to my mom when I can.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent steps forward! I’m proud of you, J. Just remember to be kind to yourself as you make these changes. We’ll check in next time to see how everything’s going. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit better just talking about it. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to hear that. I look forward to our next session, J. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello J! I'm really glad to see you today. I know we talked about your feelings of frustration and helplessness regarding your studies last time. Can you tell me how you've been feeling recently?

User: Hi! I've been feeling really down because I just don't understand the new subjects at school. I worry that I'm falling behind my classmates, and it makes me feel even more anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like that anxiety is really weighing on you. You want to keep up with your peers, and that's understandable. Can you share more about what specific subjects or areas you find most challenging right now?

User: I find math especially difficult. The new topics are confusing, and I feel like I’m not grasping the concepts. Sometimes I feel like I'm just sitting in class without really understanding anything.

Consultant: It makes sense to feel overwhelmed when the material isn't clicking for you. Let's take a moment to consider how this impacts your feelings about school. What emotions come up for you during these classes?

User: I feel embarrassed that I can't keep up. Sometimes I think about just giving up, but then I feel guilty because I know I should be trying harder.

Consultant: That internal struggle sounds tough to manage. You want to do well, but the pressure you're feeling is causing you to doubt yourself. Have there been any moments where you felt a bit more confident, or times when you understood something better?

User: A few weeks ago, I understood a math problem we did in class. I was really happy about it, but it didn’t last long. Now, it feels like I can’t remember how I did it.

Consultant: It’s great that you had that moment of understanding! Let’s try to identify what helped you grasp that concept. What strategies do you think worked for you, if any?

User: I think I just focused really hard during that lesson. I tried to ignore everything around me and just listened to the teacher.

Consultant: Focusing on the lesson is an excellent strategy! We can build on that. What if we create a personalized study plan that includes focused study sessions like that? It might help reinforce those learning moments. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good, but I worry I won't stick to it because there are so many distractions at home.

Consultant: It’s valid to think about distractions. Let’s brainstorm some techniques that can help you study effectively at home despite the noise. What do you think would help you concentrate better?

User: Maybe I could try making a little study corner in my room and keeping it tidy. I think having a dedicated space might help.

Consultant: That's a fantastic idea! A designated study area can certainly enhance your focus. How about we also set mini-goals for each study session? This way, you can track your progress and feel a sense of accomplishment.

User: Yes, that might work. I like the idea of setting small goals. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed by thinking I need to do everything at once.

Consultant: Absolutely, breaking tasks down into smaller goals can make them seem much more manageable. What’s one small goal you could set for your next math study session?

User: I could probably focus on just understanding one type of problem, like addition or subtraction. 

Consultant: That sounds like a realistic and achievable goal! In addition to studying, let’s also think about your feelings when it comes to honesty, especially regarding telling your parents about your homework. How do you feel about that?

User: I feel really ashamed about lying to them when I said my homework was done. I don’t want them to be disappointed in me.

Consultant: It’s a heavy burden to carry those feelings of shame. Remember, being honest about what you're struggling with can actually help you receive the support you need. What’s stopping you from being open with them?

User: I guess I’m afraid of their reaction. I worry they’ll think I’m not trying hard enough.

Consultant: That’s understandable. However, being honest can open a door to having a better conversation about your struggles. If they know where you need help, they might be more supportive. How do you feel about trying to talk to them about your need for guidance?

User: I want to, but I’m not sure how to start. 

Consultant: Starting can indeed be the hardest part. How about we practice what you might say? It could be as simple as, “I’m having a tough time with my math, and I need some help.” Are you comfortable trying that?

User: Yeah, I can try saying that. It feels a bit scary, but I think it could help.

Consultant: Feeling scared is completely normal, but it sounds like you’re ready to take that step. Remember, asking for help is a sign of strength. After talking to them, we can check in again to see how it went. How does that sound for our next session?

User: That sounds good! I’ll do my best.

Consultant: I believe in you, J! Before we wrap up, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed. You’ll work on your study space, set small goals for your math, and have an honest conversation with your parents. 

User: Yes, I’ll do those things. Thanks for helping me figure this out.

Consultant: You’re welcome, J! I’m proud of the progress you’re making. Remember, honesty is key, and I’m here to support you. Until next time, take care!

User: Thank you! I’ll see you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello J! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since we last talked about honesty and its importance?

User: Hi. I still feel really ashamed about lying about my homework. Since the teacher found out, I've been really worried about how my classmates view me. I can't stop thinking about it.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience has left you feeling pretty anxious and worried about what others think. Let’s explore that a bit more. What do you think your classmates are thinking about you now?

User: I guess they might think I'm dishonest or maybe even that I'm not smart enough to do my homework. It's really embarrassing.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way. It seems like you're feeling judged, which can be really tough. Can you share what you felt when the teacher revealed that you had lied?

User: I felt really upset and small. I just wanted to disappear. It was like everyone was looking at me, and I wished I could hide.

Consultant: Feeling exposed in front of others can really heighten feelings of shame. What do you think it means to you to be seen as honest or dishonest by your peers?

User: I think being honest is important, but I’m scared of what they might think if I admit I made a mistake. I don't want to seem weak.

Consultant: It takes a lot of courage to admit mistakes. Can we examine the negative thoughts you have about admitting the truth? What would happen if you expressed your honest feelings to your classmates?

User: I think they might laugh at me or think I'm a loser. But I also feel like keeping it inside is hurting me more.

Consultant: That’s a really insightful realization. Sometimes, the fear of rejection can keep us from expressing ourselves. What if we thought of a different perspective? How would a friend react if they found out you were honest about your mistake?

User: I think they’d likely respect me for being honest. They might even share their own mistakes too.

Consultant: Exactly! Honesty can often encourage openness in others. How about we practice a scenario where you tell a friend about your homework situation? 

User: Okay, I can try that. What should I say?

Consultant: You could say something like, “I messed up and didn't do my homework because I thought I could get away with it. I feel embarrassed about it.” How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds hard, but it also feels kind of good to say it out loud. 

Consultant: That’s a great step! By practicing how to express your feelings, you can gain confidence. What do you think you might gain from being honest with your peers?

User: I guess I would feel less guilty. And maybe I might even make some friends who understand.

Consultant: That’s a positive outlook! Let’s also think about how you can balance your homework with your home responsibilities. How do you currently manage both?

User: It’s tough because my mom is busy with her stall, and I sometimes don’t have time to do homework. I end up lying to avoid getting in trouble.

Consultant: Balancing responsibilities can be challenging. What if we brainstormed some ways you could manage your time better and communicate honestly about what you can handle?

User: I could try to talk to my mom about needing a little more time for homework on busy days. But I’m afraid she won’t understand.

Consultant: That’s a valid concern, but expressing your needs can help her understand your situation better. How do you feel about having that conversation?

User: I’m nervous, but I really want to try because I don’t want to keep lying. 

Consultant: That’s a strong motivation! After talking to her, how can you ensure you follow through with your homework responsibilities?

User: Maybe I could set up a schedule or ask for reminders from her.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Having a plan can help keep you on track and reduce the temptation to lie. Would it be helpful to have a small reward system for following through with your honesty and homework?

User: I think that could work. Like, if I finish everything honestly, I can treat myself to something fun?

Consultant: Absolutely! Positive reinforcement can be very helpful. It keeps you motivated. How does this approach feel to you, balancing honesty in your homework and responsibilities at home?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Just talking about it makes me feel less alone in this.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that, J! Remember, it’s a process, and it’s okay to have ups and downs. What’s one step you can take today towards practicing honesty?

User: I think I’ll start with talking to my mom about my homework load tonight.

Consultant: That sounds great. After our conversation today, how do you feel about the potential outcome of that discussion?

User: I feel cautiously optimistic. I hope she understands, and even if she gets mad, I think it’s important to be honest.

Consultant: That's a very mature perspective. Remember, no matter how she reacts, you’re doing your best to communicate. Let’s reconnect next time to see how it went and continue working on your goals. 

User: Thank you for helping me feel better. I appreciate it!

Consultant: You're very welcome, J! I'm proud of the progress you're making. Good luck with your conversation, and take care until we meet again.
###################
Consultant: Hello, J! I'm really glad to see you today. How are you feeling about your responsibilities at home and school?

User: Hi. I feel really guilty and overwhelmed. I’ve been trying to help my mom with her work, but then I don’t get my homework done, and my teacher scolded me for it. I just don’t know how to balance everything.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling stuck between helping your family and keeping up with your studies. That must be really tough for you. Can you tell me more about what you hope to achieve in managing these responsibilities?

User: I want to do well in school but also help my mom. I just wish I could find a way to do both without feeling so stressed.

Consultant: That's a great goal, J. Balancing family support and schoolwork is challenging. Let's explore what that balance might look like for you. What does a typical day feel like when you try to manage both?

User: Usually, I help my mom during the day with the dumpling stall, and then I come home late and try to do the homework quickly. But I often end up lying about finishing it because I’m too tired.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty, J. It sounds exhausting to try and do everything on little sleep. If you could change one thing about your current routine, what would it be?

User: Maybe I could find a way to finish my homework before helping my mom, but I don’t want to let her down either.

Consultant: That’s a thoughtful consideration. Let’s think about how you can communicate with your mom about your homework schedule. How do you feel about discussing your needs with her and seeing if there's a way to adjust your responsibilities?

User: I guess I could talk to her about it. I'm just scared she might think I'm being lazy or not helping enough.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel worried about how she might react. However, sharing your feelings with her could help her understand your perspective better. How do you think she would respond if you expressed your need for some more time for homework?

User: I hope she would listen, but I’m not sure. She has a lot on her plate too.

Consultant: Absolutely, it's important to consider her perspective. Perhaps we can think about how you frame the conversation. You could express gratitude for what she does while sharing how important your studies are to you. Would that feel comfortable for you?

User: Yeah, that sounds like a nice way to start. I think I can give it a shot.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Now, let’s also think about practical steps you could take. How about setting a specific time each day for your homework? When do you feel you might have some uninterrupted time to focus?

User: Maybe in the morning before I help her. That way, I wouldn’t be so tired after the stall.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Morning time could give you a fresh start. Let’s plan a daily routine together where you dedicate some time in the morning to your studies before helping your mom. How does that make you feel?

User: That helps a lot! It gives me a clearer idea of what to do.

Consultant: Wonderful! Establishing a routine can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed. Since you mentioned feeling guilty sometimes, do you think there are small ways you can remind yourself that it’s okay to prioritize your education too?

User: Maybe I could put a note somewhere to remind myself that it’s okay to focus on school. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic strategy! Visual reminders can be powerful. What would you write on your note to keep you motivated?

User: I could write “Balancing is key, and it’s okay to study hard!”

Consultant: Perfect! A positive affirmation can help encourage you throughout the day. Let's also discuss small steps for building friendships. How do you feel about reaching out to classmates or joining a group activity?

User: I’d like to make more friends, but it’s kind of scary to start a conversation with people.

Consultant: It's normal to feel a bit anxious about making new friends. Maybe you could start with a simple hello or ask someone about their homework. What do you think about breaking the ice that way?

User: That sounds doable! I could try that.

Consultant: Great! Small interactions can lead to bigger connections. We can also explore hobbies or clubs you might enjoy. Is there anything you've wanted to try that could help you meet others?

User: I really like drawing, but I’ve never joined an art club or something like that.

Consultant: Joining an art club could be a wonderful opportunity for you to express yourself and meet other kids with similar interests. How would you feel about looking into that?

User: I think I would like that! It sounds like fun.

Consultant: I'm happy to hear that! Engaging in activities you enjoy can really boost your confidence. As we wrap up, what would be the most important takeaway from today’s session for you?

User: I think finding a balance is possible. And talking to my mom is the first step.

Consultant: Exactly, J! You’ve taken a big step forward today by planning how to manage your time and emotions. Remember, it’s all about gradual changes. Would you like to set a follow-up goal for our next session?

User: Yes, I want to talk to my mom about my homework and maybe check out that art club.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I’m here to support you in this process, and I believe you can make these positive changes. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, J! I'm proud of you for being so proactive. Let’s continue building on this momentum. I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, J! I'm so glad you're here for our session today. It's wonderful to see you being more open to making new friends and participating in team activities. How have things been going for you lately?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good. After that team activity at school, I felt really happy working with others. But sometimes, I still feel anxious about meeting new people.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've had a positive experience with teamwork! Feeling anxious about meeting new people is normal. Can you tell me more about what makes you feel anxious in those situations?

User: I think I worry that I won't know what to say or that they won't like me. I often feel shy and don’t know how to start a conversation.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me, J. It's understandable to feel that way. Let's explore this further—what do you think might happen if you did start a conversation? How could that feel for you?

User: I guess it could be fun, but I also feel scared. What if I say something silly and they laugh at me?

Consultant: It's natural to have those worries. But remember, everyone makes mistakes during conversations, and it doesn’t mean people will think less of you. If you were to give yourself some advice, what would you tell yourself about starting a conversation?

User: Maybe I could tell myself to just be myself and that it's okay to not be perfect.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful approach! Being yourself is what makes you unique. Let's practice that idea. How about we try a little role play where you start a conversation with me? You can choose a situation you might face.

User: Okay, I’ll try! Maybe I’m at school, and I see someone I want to talk to during recess.

Consultant: Sounds good! Go ahead and start the conversation whenever you’re ready.

User: Um, hi! I saw you in that team activity we did. It was fun, right?

Consultant: Yes! It was really fun! I liked how we worked together. What did you enjoy the most about it?

User: I liked that we all had to share ideas to solve the puzzles. It felt good to work as a team.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic point! Working together can really bring people closer. How do you feel about how that conversation went?

User: I think it went okay! It wasn’t as scary as I thought.

Consultant: That’s a huge step forward, J! You tackled your anxiety and engaged in a conversation. How about we think of a few more conversation starters you could use in different situations?

User: Yeah, maybe I can ask about their favorite games or what they like to do after school.

Consultant: Those are excellent suggestions! Asking about interests is a great way to connect. Let’s also think about how you can respond if they ask you questions. What could you share about yourself?

User: I could talk about how I like to help my mom at the dumpling stall and that I enjoy playing with my few friends.

Consultant: That sounds perfect! Sharing about your interests can help others get to know you better. Remember, everyone has their own experiences to share. How do you feel about practicing this even more?

User: I feel more confident now! I will definitely try it at school.

Consultant: That's great to hear, J! Confidence is key. Let’s also think about what to do if you feel anxious again. What strategies can you use to calm yourself before meeting new people?

User: I could take deep breaths or remind myself to be myself.

Consultant: Exactly! Taking deep breaths can help ease anxiety. Whenever you feel nervous, just remember to check in with yourself and breathe. Would you like to set a specific goal for applying these social skills in the next week?

User: Maybe I can try talking to at least one new person during lunch.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful goal! One new person is a great start. How will you celebrate once you achieve that?

User: I could reward myself by watching a fun movie or having a special snack.

Consultant: That sounds like a nice reward! Celebrating your successes, no matter how small, helps reinforce positive experiences. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the progress you've made in our sessions?

User: I feel like I'm getting better at this. I’m excited to try talking to new people!

Consultant: That's fantastic, J! You should be proud of the progress you've made. Remember, taking small steps is crucial in building your confidence and social skills. If you ever feel unsure, just remind yourself of our practices. I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session!

User: Thank you! I will definitely try and let you know how it went!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm excited for you, J. Keep up the positive attitude, and I'll see you next time!
