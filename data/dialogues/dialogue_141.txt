Consultant: Hello, Wei! I'm really glad you could join me today. Before we dive into our conversation, can you share how you've been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. Well, honestly, I’ve been really anxious, especially when I think about speaking in class. I’m trying to figure out why I feel so nervous.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel anxious about speaking in front of others. What specifically about speaking in class do you find most overwhelming?

User: I just get really nervous. When the teacher calls on me, I feel like everyone is watching and judging me. Even if I know the answer, I can’t express it clearly because my mind goes blank.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Wei. It seems like the pressure of being observed makes it hard for you to express yourself. Can you remember the last time you felt this way? What thoughts were going through your mind at that moment?

User: Yes, during my recent mid-term exam, I felt it again. I was sweating and my hands were shaking. I kept thinking, "What if I mess up?" That thought made it even worse.

Consultant: It sounds like that thought of "messing up" was really powerful for you. How did that particular thought affect your feelings in that situation?

User: It made me feel embarrassed and I ended up stumbling over my words. I really want to learn how to manage this better.

Consultant: I hear you. It seems like the fear of embarrassment is a big part of your anxiety. What do you think would happen if you allowed yourself to make a mistake in class? 

User: I guess I’m afraid everyone would think I’m not smart. It feels like my whole chance to prove myself would be ruined.

Consultant: That fear of judgment can be overwhelming. Do you think there might be a different perspective on making mistakes? What might you tell a friend who felt the same way?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and it’s okay as long as you try. But it’s hard to apply that to myself.

Consultant: That's a great insight, Wei! Recognizing that everyone makes mistakes is crucial. Maybe we can work on transforming that thought into something kinder for yourself. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds helpful, but I’m not sure how to start doing that.

Consultant: A first step could be to acknowledge that it's normal to feel nervous and that it doesn't define your abilities. Would you be open to trying to replace negative thoughts with more supportive ones during class? 

User: I’ll give it a try, but I’m afraid it won't work. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel hesitant about trying something new. How about we discuss some strategies to help you gradually face this anxiety? 

User: That sounds good. I really want to work on this.

Consultant: One idea could be to practice speaking in a low-pressure environment first. Do you have a friend or family member you could practice with, perhaps share your thoughts about school or hobbies?

User: Yes, I could talk with my mom about sports. That would be a bit easier.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic start! It could help you get comfortable expressing yourself. After that, we can gradually move to slightly more challenging situations. 

User: I think I can manage that. 

Consultant: Great! Also, it might help to visualize yourself speaking confidently. Can you picture what that would look like for you?

User: I can imagine it, and it feels nice, but it’s a little hard to believe it could actually happen.

Consultant: It's okay to have doubts. Visualization is a tool we can build on over time. Maybe try imagining a positive outcome before you speak in class. 

User: I'll try visualizing it and practice with my mom.

Consultant: That's wonderful! Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to take it step by step. What might be your next small goal to work towards feeling more comfortable in class?

User: I guess just talking to my mom first and then trying to speak up once in class.

Consultant: Those are solid goals! We can revisit these steps next time to see how they worked out for you. How do you feel about today's session?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful, but also still anxious. 

Consultant: That’s completely natural, Wei. We’ve made strides in understanding your feelings. Remember, you're not alone in this. Would you like to discuss what we talked about in our next session?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I want to keep working on it.

Consultant: I'm looking forward to it! Together, we can keep addressing your anxiety and building your confidence. You've got this! 

User: Thanks! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You're welcome, Wei! Keep believing in yourself, and remember that change takes time. I’ll see you next time. 

User: Bye!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wei! I'm glad you're here today. I remember you mentioned feeling quite anxious when it comes to speaking in class. Can we start by discussing how you've been since our last session?

User: Hi. I still feel nervous whenever I have to speak in front of the class. I tried to calm down during the group discussion, but I ended up feeling even more tense.

Consultant: I'm sorry to hear that. It must be frustrating to feel that way, especially when you're trying to control your emotions. Could you tell me more about what thoughts go through your mind when you know you have to speak up?

User: I keep thinking that everyone is judging me. When I stand up, I feel like all eyes are on me. Even if I know the answer, I just... freeze.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It seems like those thoughts are creating a lot of pressure for you. What kind of feelings arise when these thoughts pop into your head?

User: I feel embarrassed and anxious. My heart starts racing, and I just want to sit back down. I really want to stop feeling like this.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to wish for that. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit deeper. When you think about others judging you, can you recall any specific moments that felt particularly intense?

User: Well, during the last group discussion, I could see some classmates looking at me, and I panicked. I ended up stumbling over my words, and it made everything worse.

Consultant: It sounds like that moment was really overwhelming. Let's unpack that experience. What do you think were the exact thoughts you had when you noticed your classmates looking at you?

User: I thought they would think I'm dumb if I mess up. I felt like I was going to embarrass myself in front of everyone.

Consultant: That belief can definitely heighten your anxiety. Let's challenge that thought together. Is there any real evidence that your classmates would think negatively of you if you stumbled during your speech?

User: Well, I guess they might not think anything really bad, but I just feel embarrassed anyway.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel embarrassed; those feelings are normal. But what if we looked at it from another perspective? If a friend of yours was in the same position and stumbled, would you think any less of them?

User: No, I would probably support them.

Consultant: Exactly! You might be more forgiving towards others than yourself. What would happen if you tried thinking of it that way when it's your turn to speak?

User: I suppose I could try to be kinder to myself in those moments instead of thinking that everyone is judging me.

Consultant: That’s a great realization, Wei! Let’s work on a small exercise to practice this. Next time you find yourself in a speaking situation, try to remind yourself of how you would support a friend. Can you commit to this for our next session?

User: Yes, I can try that. It might help to think of it that way.

Consultant: Wonderful! Also, let’s create some coping strategies for when you begin to feel anxious. What are some actions you can take to distract yourself or calm down before speaking?

User: I could take a few deep breaths or maybe count to ten. I’ve heard that helps.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Deep breathing can significantly help reduce anxiety. Would you like to practice a quick breathing exercise together right now?

User: Sure. That sounds good.

Consultant: Alright, let's take a deep breath in through your nose for four counts… hold for four counts… and breathe out through your mouth for four counts. How do you feel after trying that?

User: I feel a bit more relaxed. It’s nice to focus on my breath.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Remember, you can use that technique anytime you start feeling anxious. Now, let's wrap up today’s session by reflecting on what you’ve learned. How do you feel about the steps we discussed regarding your thoughts and feelings?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Identifying my negative thoughts feels like a start, and the breathing exercise seems helpful.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Wei! It’s important to acknowledge progress, no matter how small. For our next session, let’s see how applying these strategies goes for you. And remember, it’s okay to feel frustrated sometimes, but you’re making great progress!

User: Thanks! I’ll try my best and see how it goes. I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here for you. Just keep practicing, and we’ll continue to work on building your confidence together. I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session!

Consultant: Hello, Wei! I'm glad to see you in today's session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. I've been trying to participate more in club meetings, but I still feel really nervous when I have to speak. I thought it would help, but I just end up feeling embarrassed and frustrated.

Consultant: It's great that you're taking steps to challenge yourself in those situations. Can you tell me more about what happens when you try to speak in the club?

User: Well, my heart starts racing, and I feel like everyone is staring at me. Even if I have something to say, I just freeze up or end up stuttering.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult. It seems like the pressure of speaking in front of others triggers a strong response. What do you feel right before you have to speak?

User: I feel a tightening in my chest, and my mind goes blank. It’s like I forget everything I wanted to say.

Consultant: That tight feeling you describe is a common reaction to anxiety. It can make it hard to think clearly. Let's explore that moment before you speak a bit more. Do you notice any specific thoughts that pop into your mind?

User: I always think that I’ll mess up or that people will judge me. It makes me hesitate even more.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite powerful in creating anxiety. Can you recall a recent instance where those thoughts stopped you from speaking? What were you thinking at that moment?

User: Last week, during a meeting, I wanted to share my idea but kept thinking, "What if they laugh at me?” I ended up saying nothing.

Consultant: I can see why that would be discouraging. Let's try to challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that they would laugh at you if you spoke up?

User: I don’t have any real evidence. It’s just a fear I feel.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Wei. Recognizing that those negative thoughts may not be based on reality can be empowering. If a friend were in your situation, how would you encourage them?

User: I would tell them it’s okay to make mistakes and that everyone feels nervous sometimes.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re showing a lot of kindness towards others. Now let’s turn that kindness towards yourself. What if we practice some role-playing for a few minutes to help you feel more prepared?

User: That sounds helpful. I’d like to try!

Consultant: Great! Let's start simple. Imagine you’re at the club, and someone asks for ideas on a project. You can practice responding as if I’m one of your friends. What would you say?

User: I might say something like, "I think we should focus more on teamwork."

Consultant: That’s a solid start! Let’s practice that together. I’ll ask, “What are your thoughts on our project?” and you respond.

User: Okay. “I think we should focus more on teamwork.” 

Consultant: Well done! How did that feel? 

User: A bit nerve-racking, but I managed to say it without stumbling!

Consultant: That’s fantastic progress! Each time we practice, it builds your confidence. Have you noticed how trying this out felt different compared to when you’re alone?

User: Yes, it felt much less intimidating when I was just practicing with you.

Consultant: That's a valuable realization! With each practice session, you’re creating a new experience for yourself. Let’s continue to build on that. How do you feel about incorporating this practice into your week?

User: I think I can try to practice my responses in front of a mirror before the next meeting.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Practicing in front of a mirror can help you see your own expressions, which can make it feel more real. How do you think you’ll feel after doing that?

User: I hope it will make me feel less nervous. Maybe I’ll gain some confidence.

Consultant: I believe it will! Remember, building confidence takes time, and it’s okay to feel nervous. What’s something you can say to yourself to help ease that anxiety before speaking up?

User: I can remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that I have good ideas too.

Consultant: That’s a powerful affirmation, Wei! Let’s keep working on replacing the negative thoughts with supportive ones. How do you feel about tracking your experiences after each speaking opportunity?

User: I can do that. Maybe writing it down will help me see my progress.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reflecting on your experiences will help reinforce those positive changes. Shall we summarize what we’ve worked on today?

User: Sure! I need to practice role-playing my responses and remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: That’s right, and you're also going to track your experiences. Remember, you’re building a foundation for future success. I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. How are you feeling about our session today?

User: I feel more hopeful. I think I can improve with practice.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! You’re already on the path to overcoming your anxiety. I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Keep up the great work, Wei!

User: Thank you! I’m excited to practice and will see you next week.

Consultant: Hello Wei! It’s great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better, but I still get nervous when I have to speak in class. I did participate in a debate recently, and that made me feel proud of myself.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear that you participated in the debate! It sounds like you are building your confidence. Can you tell me more about how you felt during the debate and how it went for you?

User: During the debate, I was really nervous at first, but once I started speaking, it felt okay. I guess I just need more practice to get used to it. 

Consultant: It’s impressive that you pushed through your nerves! You mentioned that you felt okay once you started speaking. What did you do to help yourself in that moment?

User: I just took a deep breath and focused on what I wanted to say. I was also trying to remember that everyone was there to support each other.

Consultant: Taking a deep breath and focusing on your message are great strategies! It’s also wonderful that you recognized the support of your peers. How did that experience impact your feelings about speaking in class?

User: It made me realize that it’s not the end of the world if I get nervous. I even felt like I want to speak more in class now.

Consultant: That’s a significant shift in your perspective! Acknowledging that it’s okay to feel nervous is an important part of overcoming that fear. Are there specific situations in class where you still find yourself getting anxious?

User: Yes, especially when the teacher calls on me unexpectedly. I often freeze just thinking about what everyone is thinking of me. 

Consultant: That’s understandable. Being called on unexpectedly can be stressful. Let’s try to think of some strategies for those moments. What could help you when the teacher calls on you?

User: Maybe I could practice some responses or even rehearse with friends beforehand. That way, I’ll feel more prepared.

Consultant: Practicing with friends sounds like a strong strategy! It could help you feel better prepared and more relaxed. Have you had a chance to share any of your thoughts or concerns with them?

User: Not yet, but I think I could do that next time. I hope they would understand.

Consultant: I’m sure they would! Friends are often very supportive, and it could help strengthen relationships too. Let’s also consider how you can manage your thoughts when you start feeling nervous. What kind of thoughts go through your mind in those moments?

User: I usually think that I’ll mess up or that everyone will laugh at me. It's really frightening.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be quite overwhelming. It’s important to recognize them. Could we challenge those thoughts together? For example, what evidence do you have that people will actually laugh at you?

User: I don’t know... I think it’s just a fear in my head. Maybe they are more focused on their own answers.

Consultant: Exactly! It can be helpful to remind yourself that your classmates are likely preoccupied with their thoughts too. How would you reframe that thought in a more positive way?

User: I could think, “I have something valuable to share, and it’s okay to make mistakes.” 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful reframe! Focus on your valuable contributions rather than potential mistakes. Let’s practice that mindset together. Can you say that affirmation out loud?

User: “I have something valuable to share, and it’s okay to make mistakes.” 

Consultant: Well done, Wei! Repeating that affirmation can help ground you. Moving forward, how about we set a goal for you to raise your hand or speak up in class at least once during each session? 

User: That sounds manageable. I think I can do that!

Consultant: Great! You’re making wonderful strides. Let’s also discuss how we can celebrate your progress after each successful attempt. How would you like to reward yourself?

User: Maybe treat myself to some ice cream or hang out with friends after school!

Consultant: Those sound like delightful rewards! Celebrating your wins is a great motivator. As you work toward this goal, remember to take it one step at a time. How are you feeling about our plan?

User: I feel excited! I think this will really help reduce my fear of speaking.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! We’re laying a solid foundation for your growth, and I truly believe you’re capable of achieving your goals. Before our next session, remember to practice your affirmations and share with friends. 

User: I will! Thank you for your help. 

Consultant: You’re welcome, Wei! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Keep believing in yourself!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Wei! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling about speaking up in class since our last session?

User: Hi. I feel a lot more confident, actually! I managed to answer a question last week without getting too nervous, which surprised me.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! It sounds like you are making good progress. Can you tell me more about what helped you feel more confident during that moment?

User: I think I just reminded myself that it was okay to make mistakes. I focused on what I wanted to say instead of worrying about how everyone was looking at me.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy, Wei! Shifting your focus from the audience to your message can really help reduce anxiety. How do you feel about implementing that strategy in future situations?

User: I feel good about it. I want to keep reminding myself of that. I also think managing my breathing helped calm my nerves.

Consultant: Managing your breathing is an excellent technique. It helps your body relax and can prevent anxiety from overwhelming you. Is there a specific technique you like to use for breathing?

User: I try to take deep breaths in and out before I speak. It seems to help clear my mind a bit.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be very effective. Let’s build on that. In our future sessions, we can develop a plan that includes this technique along with others to keep your confidence strong. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I could use more structured help for different situations, not just in class.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can create a plan together for various situations where you might need to speak up. What other scenarios do you think might cause you anxiety?

User: I worry a bit about group projects, too. Sometimes I need to present, and I feel that pressure again.

Consultant: Group projects can definitely feel intimidating, especially with the added pressure of presentations. Would you like to explore some strategies that could help you feel more prepared for those situations?

User: Yes! I’d like to feel less anxious about that.

Consultant: Great! One approach is to practice your presentation multiple times before the actual day. This can help you feel more familiar with your content. How would you feel about rehearsing in front of a small group, like friends or family?

User: I think I could try that. I trust my friends, so it might make it easier.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan. Practicing in a comfortable environment can build your confidence. Let’s also discuss how you might handle unexpected questions or interruptions during your presentation. What do you think?

User: I guess I could take a moment to think before answering. I've been trying that too.

Consultant: Taking a moment is an excellent way to gather your thoughts. You might also consider saying, “That’s a great question, let me think for a second,” which can buy you some time to respond. Does that sound useful to you?

User: Yes, that sounds really helpful!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Let's summarize what we’ve discussed so far. We have your breathing techniques, familiarizing yourself with content through practice, and handling unexpected questions. Are there any other strategies or thoughts you’d like to include?

User: Not right now, but I like how we are putting these strategies together.

Consultant: Perfect! As we progress in our sessions, we can refine and expand these strategies. Now, let's think about ways to monitor your progress as you use these techniques. Would you feel comfortable keeping a journal of your experiences when you speak up?

User: I think I could do that. It might help me notice how I improve.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! A journal can help you reflect on your experiences and recognize your growth over time. How often would you like to check in with your progress in writing?

User: Maybe weekly? That feels manageable.

Consultant: Weekly sounds excellent. This will help keep you accountable and allow us to discuss your experiences during our sessions. How do you feel about your overall progress so far?

User: I’m feeling pretty hopeful! I didn’t expect to feel this much better so soon.

Consultant: It’s wonderful to hear that you’re feeling hopeful! Change takes time, and your efforts are paying off. As we move forward, continue to remind yourself of your successes, no matter how small they may seem. 

User: I will, thank you!

Consultant: You're very welcome, Wei! For our next session, we’ll discuss your experiences with your presentation practice and any challenges you face. Does that work for you?

User: Yes, that’s perfect. I’m looking forward to it!

Consultant: Great! I believe you’re on the right path. Keep using the strategies we’ve talked about, and remember, it’s okay to reach out if you need more support before our next session. 

User: I will. Thanks for your help today!

Consultant: Anytime! I'm here for you, Wei. Let’s keep building on the progress you've made. Have a wonderful day until we meet again!

User: You too! See you next time!
