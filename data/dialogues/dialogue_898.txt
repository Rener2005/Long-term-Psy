Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious about the group project presentation coming up. Every time I think about speaking in front of the class, I feel my heart racing and I get shaky.

Consultant: It sounds like that anxiety is quite intense for you, especially in front of larger groups. Can you share more about what thoughts you tend to have before or during those moments when you need to speak?

User: I keep thinking what if I mess up or forget everything. I feel like everyone will judge me if I don’t do well, and that makes my anxiety even worse.

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like the fear of judgement is a significant part of what you’re experiencing. Let’s talk about those thoughts. Do you think they’re based on solid evidence, or are they more assumptions you’re making?

User: They feel very real to me, but I guess I’m not sure if they’re completely rational. I just can’t shake the feeling that everyone will notice if I mess up.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that way, especially in a public speaking situation. However, let’s explore the evidence for those thoughts. Have there been times where you’ve presented and it didn't go as badly as you feared?

User: Well, I did a presentation last semester, and even though I was nervous, I got some good feedback. But the anxiety I felt was overwhelming.

Consultant: That’s great to hear you received positive feedback! It shows that your worries might not align with reality. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about their thoughts?

User: I’d probably tell them it’s okay to feel nervous and that they shouldn’t be too hard on themselves. But it’s hard to apply that advice to myself.

Consultant: It’s really common to have a double standard in self-talk like that. Let’s try to reframe your thinking a bit. Instead of saying, “Everyone will judge me,” what’s another thought you could choose to focus on?

User: Maybe something like, "I’m prepared and it’s okay to make mistakes."

Consultant: That’s a fantastic alternative! Holding onto that positive thought can help create a more supportive mindset. How can we practice applying that thought before your presentation?

User: I could remind myself of that before I go up, maybe take deep breaths to calm myself down.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a brilliant technique to help manage anxiety. Let’s practice a short breathing exercise right now. Would you like to try it with me?

User: Yes, I’d like that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s inhale deeply through our nose for a count of four, hold for four, and exhale slowly through our mouth for a count of six. Ready? Inhale… hold… and exhale. How did that feel?

User: It helped a bit. I felt a little calmer after that.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Incorporating this breathing technique before your presentation can help manage the anxiety. How are you feeling about the upcoming presentation after our discussion today?

User: I still feel a bit anxious, but I think understanding my thoughts better helps. I just wish I felt more confident.

Consultant: Confidence can take time to build, but remember, every small step counts. Focusing on the progress you’ve made can help, like recognizing your positive feedback last time. What specific steps can you take to boost your confidence this time?

User: Maybe I can practice my presentation more and get feedback from my friends beforehand.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan! Practicing and getting input from others can really bolster your confidence. How about we set some goals for what you can work on before the presentation?

User: I think I’ll aim to rehearse a few times this week and maybe do the breathing exercise every day to ease my anxiety.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Rehearsing and using your breathing techniques will definitely help you feel more prepared. Let's touch on this next time. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?

User: Not really, I feel like we covered a lot. Thank you for helping me sort through my feelings.

Consultant: You’re welcome! It’s been great speaking with you. Remember, progress takes time, and I'm here to support you. Looking forward to our next session!

Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better about my anxiety regarding presentations. But I still struggle with confidence and my role in group projects. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling somewhat better. It sounds like you're gaining a clearer understanding of your feelings. Can we explore what specifically still makes you feel insecure about your role in the group?

User: Well, during the last presentation, I felt like I didn't contribute enough. I always worry that I'm not good enough, especially when everyone else seems to have a strong presence.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially in a group setting. What thoughts crossed your mind during that presentation that made you doubt yourself?

User: I kept thinking, "What if I mess up?" And I noticed I was comparing myself to others, thinking they were more capable than I am.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite common in situations like this. Let’s unpack that a bit. How do those comparisons make you feel when you notice them?

User: They make me feel even more anxious and less capable. I feel like I just want to disappear instead of speaking up.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It's like those thoughts take over and push you away from participating. If you were to put those feelings into words, what would you say about your abilities in these situations?

User: I guess I would say I'm not as capable as my peers, and my voice doesn't matter.

Consultant: That’s an important insight. Let’s challenge that belief together. Can you think of any evidence that suggests your voice does matter in your group?

User: Hmm, I did contribute some ideas that got positive feedback from my group members. But somehow, I still feel it doesn’t count.

Consultant: It certainly counts, and feedback from others reflects that! What if we reframed your initial thought to say, “I can contribute valuable ideas, and my voice is important”? How does that feel to you?

User: It feels a bit more encouraging, I guess. But I still find it hard to believe that completely.

Consultant: That's perfectly okay! Believing new thoughts takes time and practice. What if we do a small practice exercise to help you with your confidence? 

User: Sure, I’m open to trying.

Consultant: Great! Let's role-play a situation where you have to contribute an idea in a group meeting. You can take the lead. How does that sound?

User: Okay, I’ll try. Can I pretend it’s a group project presentation?

Consultant: Absolutely! Whenever you're ready, begin, and I'll respond as your group members.

User: Alright. “Hey everyone, I was thinking we could include some real-life examples in our presentation to make it more relatable."

Consultant: "That's an interesting idea! Can you share specific examples you have in mind?”

User: “I was thinking about using statistics from recent studies related to our topic. It could help show our points better.”

Consultant: "That’s a solid point! I like how you're bringing in research to support our presentation. How do you feel about sharing that idea in a real setting?”

User: It feels good! I think if I prepare a bit more, I could actually present it without panicking.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Remember, preparation can be a powerful tool to boost your confidence. What other strategies can we add to help you feel prepared?

User: Maybe I could practice more with friends or in front of a mirror?

Consultant: Absolutely! That would help you get comfortable with expressing your ideas. When we practice, we give ourselves a chance to reinforce our positive beliefs about our capabilities. 

User: I really like that idea. Practicing more will definitely bring me some comfort.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we continue, it will also be crucial to remind yourself of the value you bring. How do you think you could keep track of your positive contributions during group work?

User: Maybe I can jot them down after each meeting, just to remind myself that I have something valuable to offer.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Keeping a record of your contributions will help reinforce your confidence over time. How do you feel about putting this into practice for your next project?

User: I feel more focused and I think I can actually do it. I just need to remind myself to trust my abilities.

Consultant: Absolutely, trusting yourself is key. As we approach our session end, let’s reflect on your journey so far. What has been your biggest takeaway from today’s discussion?

User: I’ve realized that my voice does matter and that I can prepare to make myself feel more confident.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! You’re growing in acknowledging your strengths. As you move forward, what strategies will you use to handle any negative thoughts that may arise?

User: I’ll challenge those thoughts and remember what I've learned—like recording my contributions and practicing.

Consultant: Perfect! Keeping those strategies in your toolbox will empower you. I believe you are on the right path. How do you feel about our sessions coming to a close today?

User: I feel relieved and hopeful. I’m excited to make these changes and face my next presentation.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! You’ve worked hard, and I’m proud of your progress. Keep believing in yourself, and if you need support in the future, feel free to reach out. Goodbye for now!

User: Thank you so much! Goodbye!

Consultant: Hi there! I'm really glad to see you again today. Last time we discussed your anxiety about public speaking, especially regarding your personal statement project. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I think I’ve been more anxious, honestly. The closer it gets to presenting, the more I worry about what people will think of me and my ideas. 

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way, especially as the presentation date approaches. Can you describe what specific thoughts or worries pop into your mind when you think about presenting?

User: I keep worrying that I’ll mess up or that my ideas won’t be well-received. I also fear that people will judge me harshly. 

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pressure around the expectations of yourself and others. What kind of feelings do those thoughts create for you?

User: They make me feel really anxious and sometimes even a bit hopeless, like maybe I’m just not cut out for this. 

Consultant: Those feelings can be quite overwhelming. Let’s work together to identify if there are any particular thinking patterns behind these thoughts. Do you notice any extremes in your thoughts, like all-or-nothing thinking? 

User: Yes, I tend to think if I don’t get a perfect response, it means I completely failed. 

Consultant: Recognizing that black-and-white thinking is a great first step. What might be a more balanced way to view your performance on the presentation?

User: I guess I could consider that even if it doesn't go perfectly, it doesn’t mean I failed. Maybe some people just not responding well doesn’t reflect my entire worth.

Consultant: Absolutely! That's a more realistic perspective. Let's challenge that negative thought further—what evidence supports the idea that a less-than-perfect presentation would mean failure?

User: Well, there are times when I’ve spoken, and even if I felt nervous, not everyone reacted badly. Some seemed to appreciate my effort, even if I stumbled.

Consultant: That’s excellent insight! It shows that your self-worth doesn't depend solely on others' opinions. How might you remind yourself of this during your upcoming presentation?

User: Maybe I could write down some positive feedback I've received before and read it beforehand to boost my confidence.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic strategy! Preparing yourself with positive reinforcement can really help. Have you thought about any specific ways to practice your presentation?

User: I’ve considered rehearsing in front of my family, but I feel nervous about that, too. 

Consultant: It’s normal to feel nervous about practicing in front of others. Would you be open to starting with smaller groups or even just in front of a mirror to build your confidence gradually?

User: Yeah, practicing alone does sound more comfortable. I think I can start with that.

Consultant: Great choice! Also, when you do practice in front of others, let them know you're working on building confidence. This way, they can provide supportive feedback. Are you also considering using any relaxation techniques before your presentation?

User: I’ve heard about deep breathing, but I haven't really tried it before. 

Consultant: Deep breathing can be very effective in calming nerves. Would you be willing to learn a simple technique together that you can use before and during your presentation?

User: Sure, that sounds helpful!

Consultant: Fantastic! Let’s practice it now—close your eyes if you’re comfortable, inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Let’s do that a few times.

User: Okay... that feels a bit calming already. I think I can use this before I go up to present.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! Remember, it's all about practice and gradually facing those fears. You might try visualizing a positive outcome for your presentation as well.

User: I can try that. Imagining it going well sounds reassuring.

Consultant: Exactly. Visualization can help create a sense of confidence. As you prepare, focus on reminding yourself of the effort you’re putting in and what you've accomplished so far. 

User: That’s a good point. I want to focus on the progress I’m making, not just the end result.

Consultant: That’s a healthy mindset! Over the next few days, try out the deep breathing and the visualization. Reflect on your practice sessions too. Would you like to share any goals for our next session?

User: I hope to feel a bit more confident and maybe even try practicing in front of a small group.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful goal! We’ll check in on how that goes next time. Remember, building confidence takes time, and you’re making great strides. 

User: Thank you. I feel a bit more hopeful about this now!

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! Keep in mind the positive steps you’re taking, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Take care!

User: Thanks! I will. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm excited to see you today. Let's talk about how you're feeling since our last session. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite good actually. The small public speaking event I participated in made me feel accomplished, and I think my confidence has increased a bit.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! It sounds like that experience had a positive impact on you. How do you think this accomplishment influences your view on public speaking moving forward?

User: I feel more capable now. I used to be really nervous about speaking in front of people, but now I think I can handle it better, especially since the response was so encouraging.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve recognized your capabilities, which is wonderful! Can you tell me more about how you felt during the event itself?

User: During the event, I was nervous at first, but once I started speaking, I felt more relaxed. The audience was nodding and smiling, which helped a lot.

Consultant: It’s great that you felt more at ease as you continued speaking! How did you feel after the event when you received positive feedback?

User: Afterward, I felt a rush of happiness! I think that feedback really boosted my morale. It made me want to try more public speaking opportunities in the future.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! Let’s reflect on this success. How do you think acknowledging these positive experiences can affect your approach to future public speaking tasks?

User: I suppose it will help me approach future tasks with less fear and more excitement. I want to build on this positive experience.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on these successes can really fortify your self-confidence. What specific strategies do you think could help you feel more prepared for your next speaking role?

User: I think practicing more beforehand would help. Maybe I could rehearse in front of friends or even in front of a mirror to build my confidence further.

Consultant: Practicing in front of others is a great strategy! It allows you to become accustomed to the environment. Is there a particular new role or speaking opportunity you’re looking forward to?

User: Yes, I'm going to host a small event next month. I'm both excited and a little nervous about it!

Consultant: That’s an excellent next step! It’s completely natural to feel a mix of excitement and nerves. How can we further prepare you for this hosting role, so you feel more confident?

User: I guess I could make an outline of what I want to say and possibly even gather some tips on engaging the audience. 

Consultant: Creating an outline is a fantastic way to organize your thoughts! Additionally, thinking about ways to engage your audience can make your speech feel more interactive. What kind of techniques are you considering?

User: Maybe asking questions to the audience or using stories to make points clearer. I think that might keep people interested.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! Engaging the audience with questions and stories can create a strong connection. How do you think practicing these techniques might help reduce your anxiety?

User: I think it will make me feel more in control during the event, knowing I have a plan and a way to interact with the audience.

Consultant: Having a clear plan can definitely reduce anxiety. It gives you a sense of structure and purpose. What do you think is the most significant challenge you are facing as you prepare for this role?

User: Honestly, it’s the fear of forgetting what I want to say or not connecting with the audience. That makes me worry sometimes.

Consultant: It's common to have those fears, but remember the success you've already had! Would it be helpful to explore some ways to manage those fears if they arise during your hosting?

User: Yes, that would help! I want to be able to redirect my focus if I start feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: One approach could be to practice mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing, to help center yourself in those moments. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I think taking a few deep breaths beforehand could calm my nerves.

Consultant: Absolutely! Deep breathing can help ground you and bring a sense of calm. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you’ve learned. What are your key takeaways from our conversation?

User: I’ve learned the importance of acknowledging my successes, practicing ahead of time, and how to engage the audience. Plus, I have strategies to manage my anxiety, like breathing exercises.

Consultant: That’s wonderful progress! Remember, you’ve already proven to yourself that you can succeed in these situations. Trust in your abilities and the strategies you've developed. If you encounter challenges, you’re well-prepared to handle them.

User: Thank you! I'm feeling more ready to take this on and am excited for the next steps.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’ve made significant progress, and I believe you’ll do great in your hosting role. If you ever find yourself needing support in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. Good luck, and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you’re here today. How are you feeling as you take on this new role as a host for the student council activities?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’m feeling a mix of nervousness and excitement. It’s a big responsibility, and while I’m looking forward to the challenge, I can’t help but worry about how I’ll perform.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel both nervous and excited when facing new challenges. Could you share more about what aspects of the hosting role make you feel the most anxious?

User: I think it’s mainly the fear of speaking in front of a lot of people. I worry that I might forget what to say or that I’ll embarrass myself.

Consultant: I understand that fear of public speaking can be quite daunting. It’s a common concern for many people. Have you had any experiences in the past where you felt nervous speaking in front of others?

User: Yes, I remember during a class presentation last semester, I was so anxious that I stumbled over my words and forgot some parts. It was really embarrassing.

Consultant: That sounds very challenging. It's understandable that the memory of that experience can contribute to your current anxiety. How did you feel after that presentation, once it was over?

User: After it was done, I felt relieved but also frustrated with myself. I wished I could have done better.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize those feelings. It's important to understand that each experience, even the difficult ones, can be valuable for learning and growth. What do you hope to achieve with your upcoming hosting role, besides overcoming your anxiety? 

User: I want to improve my public speaking skills and feel more confident in expressing myself in front of an audience.

Consultant: Those are fantastic goals! Improving your public speaking can be really empowering. Let's talk about how we can build a plan to help you prepare effectively for your hosting duties. What strategies do you think might help you feel more confident going into this role?

User: Maybe practicing my speech a lot and getting comfortable with the material would help. I could also try speaking in front of a few friends first.

Consultant: Practicing in front of friends is an excellent strategy. It can create a supportive environment that helps you build confidence. How about we incorporate a structured practice routine into your preparation?

User: That sounds helpful! I’d like to have a clear plan so I know exactly what to do.

Consultant: Great! How about this: we can outline specific areas to focus on during your practice sessions, such as your tone, body language, and engaging the audience. Do you think that would work for you?

User: Yes, I like that idea. Focusing on those areas could really help me improve.

Consultant: Wonderful! Let's also consider some techniques for managing your nerves right before you go on stage. Have you ever tried any relaxation exercises or breathing techniques?

User: I haven’t really tried them before. I’ve heard about deep breathing, but I’m not sure how to do it effectively.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be quite effective! It's about taking slow, deep breaths to help calm your mind. Would you like me to guide you through a simple breathing exercise now?

User: Yes, that would be great!

Consultant: Alright, let's do it together. First, find a comfortable position. Now, take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four. Hold it for a moment. Now slowly exhale through your mouth for a count of six. Let’s repeat that a few times... 

User: I feel a bit more relaxed now. That was helpful.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, you can use this technique before your hosting duties to help calm your nerves. How do you feel about your preparation plan so far?

User: I feel more organized and less anxious about it. Having a plan really helps.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Setting clear goals and strategies can certainly alleviate some of the pressure. What steps will you take next to start your practice?

User: I’ll write down the key points I need to cover and set up a time to practice with my friends this weekend.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! By practicing and familiarizing yourself with the material, you'll be better equipped to handle any unexpected moments. How will you ensure that you're also keeping a positive mindset throughout this journey?

User: I think reminding myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that I can always improve will help. I’ll also try to celebrate small successes along the way.

Consultant: Absolutely! Celebrating small successes is a great way to build confidence. What would be a small win you could recognize after your practice sessions?

User: Maybe if I feel comfortable enough to speak in front of my friends without panicking would be a great start.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal! Acknowledging those moments can really boost your confidence. As you continue preparing, remember that it’s a gradual process. Are there any additional resources you think could help you?

User: Perhaps watching videos of good speakers to learn from them might help, and I could even try some practice runs at home.

Consultant: Watching videos and practicing at home sounds like a fantastic idea! It can give you new insights and inspiration. As our session is coming to an end, let’s summarize the key points you've learned today. What stands out to you as the most important takeaway?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is having a structured plan and practicing relaxation techniques. Those tools will help me feel more confident.

Consultant: Exactly! Remember, this preparation not only helps with your hosting role but can also benefit other areas in your life. You're on the right path. I believe you’ll do great! 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help today. I feel much more ready to take on this challenge.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I'm so proud of your progress. Remember that you have the tools to manage your anxiety and enhance your confidence. If you ever need to chat again, I'm here for you. Good luck with your practice!

User: Thanks! I'm looking forward to it.
###################
Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today's session. I'm glad to see you again. Before we dive in, how are you feeling about your recent experiences, especially after successfully hosting that event?

User: Hi! I'm feeling really good, actually. Hosting went better than I expected, and I received some nice feedback. It's been a boost to my confidence, and I'm excited to explore more opportunities to express myself.

Consultant: That sounds fantastic! It's wonderful to hear how positive feedback has influenced your confidence. What are some specific social or expressive opportunities you're considering pursuing next?

User: I'm thinking about joining a debate club or maybe a public speaking group. I want to keep building on this confidence and challenge myself further.

Consultant: Joining a debate club or public speaking group sounds like an excellent way to expand your skills! What aspects of these activities excite you the most?

User: I think the idea of speaking in front of people and really making a point is thrilling. But I also worry about how I'll perform under pressure.

Consultant: It's natural to feel a bit anxious about performing, even with your growing confidence. Can you share what thoughts come to mind when you're concerned about performing under pressure?

User: I often think, "What if I mess up?" or "What if people don't take me seriously?" These thoughts can be pretty overwhelming.

Consultant: Those thoughts can definitely create pressure. Let's unpack them a bit. When you think about "messing up," how does that make you feel in the moment?

User: I feel really anxious and embarrassed. I just keep imagining how everyone would react, and it makes me hesitate to participate.

Consultant: Feeling anxious and embarrassed is understandable, especially when you're putting yourself out there. Let's explore whether these thoughts might involve any cognitive distortions. Do you think there's a chance you're exaggerating how others might react?

User: I guess I do tend to jump to the worst-case scenario without knowing how people will actually react. 

Consultant: Recognizing that is a great step! What could be a more balanced thought to replace, "What if I mess up?" when you're preparing to speak?

User: Maybe something like, "It's okay to make mistakes, and most people can relate to that." 

Consultant: That's a much healthier perspective! Remember, everyone makes mistakes, and it often doesn't define their abilities. How can you remind yourself of this thought when you're feeling anxious?

User: I can write it down and keep it near my desk, or even practice saying it to myself before an event.

Consultant: That sounds like a helpful strategy! Practicing positive affirmations can support your confidence. What other techniques can we incorporate to help you feel more prepared when you face these challenges?

User: I think practicing in front of friends could help, or even recording myself to see how I actually perform.

Consultant: Practicing with friends is a great idea! It can provide you with constructive feedback and build your comfort level. Recording yourself can be insightful too. How does thinking about these practice sessions make you feel?

User: It makes me feel more in control and less anxious. If I can practice, I think I could handle the real thing better.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! Feeling more in control can significantly reduce anxiety. How do you feel about setting a specific goal for practicing this week?

User: I’d like to set a goal to practice at least twice before my next event, whether it’s with friends or by recording myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Let’s break down these sessions a bit. What will you focus on during your practice to ensure it’s effective?

User: I want to focus on my delivery and managing my pace. I think that would help me sound more confident.

Consultant: Excellent focus! Working on delivery and pace can make a huge difference. What are some ways you can track your progress during these practice sessions?

User: I could note down the feedback I get from friends and also reflect on how I felt during the recordings.

Consultant: Keeping a journal of your experiences is a great idea! It can help you see your progress and any patterns in your thoughts or feelings. How are you feeling about all these strategies we've discussed?

User: I'm feeling really hopeful! Having a plan makes me feel much more prepared and excited for the future.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s amazing how having a plan can increase your confidence. Let’s also think about what support you might need moving forward as you implement these strategies.

User: I think just knowing I can come back here for guidance will help a lot if I start feeling overwhelmed again.

Consultant: Absolutely! Remember, I'm here to support you whenever you need. As we wrap up today, what has stood out to you as your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: Just how important it is to challenge my negative thoughts and to have a solid plan when stepping out of my comfort zone.

Consultant: That’s an insightful takeaway! Challenging those negative thoughts and preparing can really empower you. As we end today’s session, how do you feel about your path ahead?

User: I feel much more confident. I’m excited to put these strategies into action!

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! I believe you have all the tools you need to succeed. Remember to take it one step at a time, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care!

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate all your help. I’ll see you next time!
