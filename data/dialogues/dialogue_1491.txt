Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. How are you feeling? What’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really down and anxious. In class recently, I stuttered when trying to answer a question, and I felt so embarrassed. My self-esteem has taken a hit.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience was really tough for you. You mentioned feeling embarrassed and that it has affected your self-esteem. Can you tell me a bit more about how that made you feel afterwards?

User: I just felt really ashamed and started to blame myself for not doing better. I want to speak more fluently and be more confident when I'm in front of people.

Consultant: I can understand how that situation could lead to feelings of shame and self-blame. It’s important to acknowledge those feelings. What do you believe has contributed to your stuttering, especially in public settings?

User: I think it started because my parents had high expectations of me. They always pushed me to be perfect. I’ve struggled with this since elementary school, and now it's like a cycle I can't break.

Consultant: That cycle sounds really challenging. It seems like the pressure to meet those expectations has intensified your anxiety. Let's explore that cycle a bit more. When you start to feel anxious about speaking, what thoughts go through your mind?

User: I often think that everyone is judging me, and that I’ll embarrass myself again. It makes me want to avoid speaking up altogether.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly difficult. It seems like fear of judgment is impacting your willingness to engage. Can we work together to identify some specific negative thoughts you experience in those moments?

User: One thought is “I’m going to mess up again.” This makes me feel even more anxious and causes me to just freeze up.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that. Let's challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that supports that idea? Could there be other ways to view the situation?

User: I guess sometimes I do speak well without any issues. But when I think about speaking in front of a group, that negative thought overshadows everything.

Consultant: It's great that you've recognized those moments of fluency. Let’s try to create a more balanced thought. What would you say to a friend who was feeling like this before speaking in public?

User: I would probably tell them that it's okay to make mistakes and that people are usually not as critical as we think.

Consultant: Exactly! Those kinder, more realistic thoughts can help shift your mindset. Let’s work on gradually facing those situations that make you anxious. What if we set a goal for you to practice speaking up in small, safe environments?

User: That sounds doable. Maybe I could start by speaking in a small group with friends or family first.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Let’s plan a specific situation where you can practice that. How about discussing a topic you enjoy with them? 

User: Yes, I could talk about a book I recently read with a couple of friends. It feels a bit less intimidating.

Consultant: Wonderful! Setting a clear and enjoyable environment will help ease your nerves. How do you feel about the idea of practicing with your friends?

User: I feel a mix of excitement and anxiety. I want to do it but I'm still scared.

Consultant: That’s perfectly normal! Feeling both excited and anxious shows that you’re stepping out of your comfort zone. Let’s also think of ways to calm those anxious feelings before you speak. What techniques have you tried in the past?

User: Sometimes I try deep breathing, but I often forget about it when I'm nervous.

Consultant: Deep breathing is a fantastic tool. How about preparing a quick reminder to use breathing techniques right before you speak? It might help you stay grounded. 

User: That's a good idea! I can write a note for myself to remember.

Consultant: Fantastic! Also, remember to celebrate every small step you take, even if it feels minor. Each achievement will contribute to building your confidence. 

User: I think I can do that. It helps to focus on small victories instead of the big picture.

Consultant: Absolutely! Progress often comes from these small steps. As we continue to meet, we can keep refining these strategies and build your confidence together. 

User: Thank you, that sounds good to me. I feel a little better already knowing that we have a plan.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it's a journey, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. We'll continue to challenge these negative thoughts and celebrate your successes.

User: Thanks! I’m looking forward to our next session to see how it goes.

Consultant: Me too! Let's keep working on this together. In our next session, we can talk about how your practice with your friends went and any feelings that came up. 

User: That sounds great! Thank you for today, I really appreciate it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm proud of you for taking these steps. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support before we meet again. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello A! Welcome back to our session. I’m glad you’re here. How have you been feeling since our last talk?

User: Hi. Honestly, I still feel really tense. After the group discussion where I couldn't speak up and we ended up losing points, I've been feeling a lot of guilt. I keep thinking about how I let my team down.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of guilt and tension around that situation. It’s understandable to feel this way when we hold ourselves to high standards. Let’s take a moment to talk about what happened during that discussion. Can you tell me about the thoughts that went through your mind at that time?

User: I just remember being so nervous. I kept thinking about all the eyes on me, and I was worried about stumbling over my words. I thought everyone would judge me. It felt easier just to stay quiet.

Consultant: It seems like those thoughts contributed to your anxiety and made it hard for you to speak up. What role do you think these thoughts played in your decision to remain silent during the discussion?

User: I guess I thought if I spoke, I would embarrass myself even more. I felt like my stutter would make everyone look down on me.

Consultant: That’s a very strong fear, A. It’s not uncommon to worry about how we are perceived by others, especially in group settings. But I wonder, how accurate do you think those thoughts are? Do you believe everyone in the group would have reacted negatively?

User: I know deep down that not everyone would judge me harshly. But in the moment, it just felt so real and overwhelming.

Consultant: It’s important to recognize that sometimes our feelings can distort our perception of reality. Let’s explore this further. If a friend were in the same situation, what would you tell them about their fears of judgment?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s okay to make mistakes and that everyone has their own struggles. They shouldn't be so hard on themselves.

Consultant: That’s a lovely perspective. It seems like you have the capability to be compassionate towards others but may be harder on yourself. How might you apply that same compassion to your own situation?

User: I guess I could try to remind myself that it’s okay to speak up, even if I make mistakes. I need to be kinder to myself.

Consultant: That’s a great insight. Practicing self-compassion can help reduce your self-criticism and improve your comfort in social situations. As we move forward, let's consider some strategies to help you gradually face those fears in similar group settings. What are some small steps you can take to begin participating in discussions again?

User: Maybe I could try speaking up just once in the next meeting, or even just share one thought, even if it’s small.

Consultant: That sounds like a manageable step! Starting small can help you build confidence over time. Additionally, we could incorporate some breathing exercises to help you ease your tension before speaking. Would you like to practice that together now?

User: Yes, I think that could really help. I often forget to breathe when I’m anxious.

Consultant: All right. Let’s take a moment to practice deep breathing. I’ll guide you through it. Take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four... hold it for a count of four... and breathe out through your mouth for a count of four. Let’s do this a few times together.

User: *[Practices breathing]* That feels a bit more calming.

Consultant: Great job! Deep breathing can be a powerful tool to use when feeling anxious. Remember to try this before your next group discussion. How are you feeling about the idea of sharing in future meetings now?

User: I feel a little more hopeful. Practicing breathing might really help with my nerves.

Consultant: That's fantastic to hear! Hope is an important part of moving forward. As we continue meeting, we can work on more techniques to help you stay calm and engaged in discussions. How do you envision our next steps together?

User: I’d like to work on more strategies to reduce my anxiety and maybe some role-playing scenarios to practice speaking in front of others.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. We can incorporate role-playing to simulate those group situations in a safe environment. It can help make those real-life experiences feel more manageable. In the meantime, try practicing self-compassion and breathing exercises. 

User: I will try that. Thanks for all the support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, A. Remember, progress takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks along the way. I'm here for you. Before we end today, is there anything specific you’d like to reflect on or discuss one last time?

User: I just want to remind myself that it's a process. I need to be patient with myself.

Consultant: That's a wonderful perspective to have. Being gentle with yourself is key. I’m confident you’re on the right path. This concludes our session today. Remember, you are capable, and you can always reach out whenever you need. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: Take care, A. Looking forward to our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you joined me today. Before we start, could you share how you've been feeling lately and what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really down after I struggled to introduce myself during a class activity. It was so embarrassing, and I keep criticizing myself for not being able to speak properly. I worry about how this will affect my future.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience was really frustrating for you. It's understandable to feel disappointed when things don't go as planned. Let's explore those feelings a bit more. What thoughts were going through your mind when you were asked to introduce yourself?

User: I thought everyone would judge me for my stutter. I just felt like I was letting everyone down, including myself. 

Consultant: That sounds really tough, feeling like you're being judged. Can we look at those thoughts together? What evidence do you have that people were judging you, or that you were letting anyone down?

User: Well, I don’t have any proof, but it felt like everyone was staring at me and waiting for me to mess up.

Consultant: It makes sense that you felt that way in a tense situation. But remember, just because it felt that way doesn't mean it was true. If a friend were in your shoes, what advice would you give them?

User: I guess I would tell them that it’s okay to struggle and that everyone has their own challenges.

Consultant: Exactly! Everyone has their own struggles, and it’s okay to face difficulties. Let's try to challenge that negative thinking. Can you think of a time you successfully spoke in front of others, even if it felt challenging?

User: Actually, there was a time I spoke during a group project, and it went better than I thought it would.

Consultant: That's a great example! What can we take from that experience to help you with future introductions? 

User: Maybe I can remind myself that I've done it before and that I can try again. 

Consultant: Yes, that’s a wonderful approach! Let’s think about some practical steps you could take when faced with similar situations again. How about practicing some relaxation techniques beforehand?

User: That sounds like a good idea. I haven't really tried that before.

Consultant: Relaxation techniques can help reduce anxiety. We could explore a few options, like deep breathing exercises. How does that sound?

User: I’d like to try that! It might help me calm down before speaking.

Consultant: That's the spirit! Let's also consider how you could be kinder to yourself after challenging situations. What would it look like to practice self-acceptance in those moments?

User: I suppose I could remind myself that it’s normal to feel nervous. Everyone makes mistakes, right?

Consultant: Absolutely! Mistakes are a part of learning. How might you reframe your thoughts when something doesn’t go perfectly?

User: Maybe instead of saying, “I failed,” I could say, “I did my best, and I can always improve.”

Consultant: I love that! That’s a much more supportive way to speak to yourself. Let's also set some goals for applying these techniques in your daily life, especially as you prepare for speaking situations.

User: I could set a goal to practice speaking in front of a mirror every day.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! It will help build your confidence. What else might you incorporate into your routine to help manage your anxiety?

User: Maybe I can write down my worries and then challenge them like we talked about.

Consultant: That's a great strategy. Writing down your thoughts can provide clarity and help you challenge negative beliefs. How do you feel about these planning steps?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Having these tools makes me feel like I can handle things better.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Focusing on self-acceptance and employing these strategies can lead to significant improvements. How about we discuss how to track your progress next?

User: I could keep a journal to reflect on my feelings and the speaking opportunities I take.

Consultant: Excellent idea! A journal can help you monitor your growth and recognize the positive steps you take. As we wrap up today, what do you think will be your biggest takeaway from our conversation?

User: I think it’s learning to treat myself with more kindness and practicing how I can better manage my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway! Remember, being compassionate to yourself is a vital part of this journey. You’ve made excellent progress today. How are you feeling about everything we discussed?

User: I feel encouraged and ready to try out these techniques. Thanks for the support!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in your ability to take these steps. If you ever need more support, remember, I'm here to help. Keep practicing, and I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been trying to practice some of the relaxation techniques from the workshop, but I still feel quite anxious, especially about speaking in public.

Consultant: I understand. It sounds like you're trying your best to implement those techniques. Can you share which techniques you attempted and how they worked for you?

User: I tried deep breathing and a bit of meditation. The breathing helped a little, but I still feel really nervous when I think about speaking in front of others.

Consultant: It's great that you've started practicing deep breathing and meditation. It’s normal to still feel nervous, especially if it’s something you're not used to. How do you feel immediately after using those techniques?

User: After breathing exercises, I feel a bit calmer, but that nervousness comes back pretty quickly.

Consultant: That’s understandable. The nervousness can return, especially in anticipation of a speaking situation. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come up when you start feeling that way?

User: Yes, I usually think that everyone will judge me or that I will mess up. It's like my mind goes into overdrive.

Consultant: Those thoughts can definitely heighten anxiety. Let's try to unpack that. How likely do you think it is that people will judge you harshly?

User: I don't really know. Maybe it's just my fear making it feel worse than it really is?

Consultant: It sounds like you’re recognizing that those thoughts may be exaggerated. What would you think if you were to look at this situation from a friend’s perspective? How would they interpret it?

User: I think they might say that people are often too focused on themselves to really judge others harshly.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a really supportive perspective. This is a good example of how we can challenge those negative thoughts. Now, let's practice the deep breathing again together to see if we can make it even more effective. Can we try it once more?

User: Sure! That sounds good.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four, hold for four, and exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Ready?

User: Yes, I’m ready.

Consultant: Inhale… 1, 2, 3, 4. Hold… 1, 2, 3, 4. Now exhale… 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. How did that feel?

User: I felt a bit more relaxed after that.

Consultant: That’s a positive sign! Remember, practicing this regularly can help train your body and mind to respond differently when you feel anxious. How about setting a small goal to practice this technique daily?

User: I think I can manage that! Maybe in the morning before school.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Morning practice can set a positive tone for the day. Do you also want to integrate a few minutes of meditation into your routine?

User: Yes, I’ll try to add a little meditation as well. 

Consultant: Perfect! It’s all about finding what feels right for you. Next time, we can discuss how these practices are influencing your anxiety. Remember, it’s a gradual process. What are some things you can remind yourself when that nervousness creeps in?

User: I could remind myself that it's okay to make mistakes and that most people are understanding.

Consultant: Absolutely! That's an important self-soothing message. You've made some wonderful insights today. As you continue to work on these skills, you might find that your confidence increases over time. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel more hopeful. I think with practice, I can make my anxiety less overwhelming.

Consultant: That's a fantastic realization! It really seems like you’re starting to cultivate that confidence. In our upcoming sessions, we can also explore additional strategies to gradually expose you to those public speaking situations. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I’m open to trying more things!

Consultant: Wonderful! I look forward to hearing about your progress with the relaxation techniques and your new mindset in our next session. Keep practicing, and remember, you're not alone in this journey. See you next time!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. See you!

Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. I'm glad to hear that you've found some success in your recent social interactions. How are you feeling about your progress?

User: Hi! I'm feeling really happy about it. I was able to speak in a small group during a campus social event, and it felt good to connect with others. I hope to keep this momentum going.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're building some confidence through these experiences. Can you share more about how you felt during that interaction?

User: During the interaction, I felt nervous at first, but as I started talking, I began to relax. It was nice to see that people were engaged in the conversation. I think that helped me feel more at ease.

Consultant: It sounds like you handled that situation really well! Your feelings of relaxation are a positive sign of your growing confidence. What do you think contributed to your ability to relax while speaking?

User: I think having a small group helped. It felt less intimidating than speaking to a large audience, and I knew some of the people already, which made it easier to express myself.

Consultant: That's a great observation! Familiarity can definitely ease anxiety. Let's build on that. What kind of small goals can you set for yourself in future social situations to help continue enhancing your self-efficacy?

User: Maybe I could aim to initiate conversations more often, even with new people. I could also practice speaking up in class discussions. 

Consultant: Those sound like excellent goals! Setting specific aims to engage with others can help solidify your confidence. How do you feel about practicing some techniques we discussed to support those goals?

User: I think practicing techniques would be really helpful. I sometimes worry about how I come across when I speak, so any support in that area would be great. 

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s completely normal to have those worries. We can work on challenging any negative thoughts that arise when you're about to speak. What specific thoughts come to mind when you feel anxious to speak?

User: I often think that I will stutter or that people will judge me negatively. It makes me hesitate to speak at times.

Consultant: Recognizing those thoughts is a great step! Let's examine them together. How much evidence do you have to support the idea that people will judge you negatively? 

User: I don't really have much evidence. Most people seem understanding, but I still can’t shake the thought when I'm about to speak. 

Consultant: That’s an important realization! It seems like the fear of judgement might be tied to your past experiences. What might you say to a friend who shared these concerns with you?

User: I would probably reassure them that everyone makes mistakes and that it's okay. I’d tell them it’s more important to express themselves than to be perfect.

Consultant: That’s a compassionate and rational perspective! How can you apply that same kindness to yourself when those anxious thoughts arise?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s okay to be imperfect and that the important thing is to just participate. 

Consultant: Exactly! Shifting your mindset can make a big difference. Perhaps you could even create a mantra or a phrase to remind yourself of this when you start feeling anxious. What do you think?

User: I like that idea! Maybe something like “It’s okay to be me. I can speak and still be myself.” 

Consultant: That’s a powerful phrase! I encourage you to use it before you engage in conversations to help ground yourself. How do you feel about setting a goal to use this mantra in your next social interaction?

User: I feel good about it! I think it will help me relax and focus on expressing myself rather than worrying.

Consultant: That's a fantastic mindset! As you continue practicing, also acknowledge your successes, no matter how small they may seem. What small victory did you experience during your last social interaction that you can celebrate?

User: I managed to keep the conversation going without feeling too overwhelmed, and I even laughed at a joke!

Consultant: That’s an excellent achievement! Celebrating those moments reinforces your progress. Let's review some strategies you have learned and how they can support your upcoming interactions. 

User: Sure! I remember the importance of making eye contact, using my mantra, and focusing on the conversation rather than my anxiety.

Consultant: Exactly! You've articulated those strategies well. As you move forward, keep those tools in mind, and continue to experiment with them. How do you envision applying these in the near future?

User: I plan to participate more in group settings and manage my anxiety by using my mantra. I also want to find new opportunities to practice speaking, maybe through joining clubs.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! It's great to see your proactive approach. Remember, every interaction provides an opportunity for growth. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you’ve gained from our sessions so far?

User: I’ve gained more confidence in my ability to communicate. I understand that practice and self-kindness can really help me overcome my fears.

Consultant: It’s been wonderful to hear your reflections. As you continue this journey, remember that setbacks are normal, and each experience is a chance to learn. How are you feeling about your social interactions now?

User: I feel much more hopeful and ready to face challenges! I appreciate all the support you’ve provided.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! You’re doing an amazing job. Remember to reach out when you feel the need for a check-in or support. Good luck with your future interactions, and I'll be here if you need me!
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. I'm looking forward to our session today. How have you been feeling since we last met?

User: Hi! I've been feeling quite positive actually. I was able to speak confidently during my course presentation, and my tutor praised my performance. It really boosted my self-esteem and made me feel more at ease with social interactions.

Consultant: That sounds wonderful! It's great to hear that your confidence has grown and that you received positive feedback. Can you tell me more about how that experience influenced your interactions with others?

User: Well, I felt much more comfortable talking to my classmates after the presentation. I even initiated a few conversations! It was a big step for me since I usually struggle with speaking up in public or even in small groups.

Consultant: Initiating conversations is indeed a significant step forward! It seems like your hard work is paying off. How do you feel about your ability to express yourself compared to before?

User: I feel like I'm making progress, but I still have some reservations. Sometimes, I worry that I might stumble over my words or that others won't understand me.

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those concerns. It's great that you recognize both your progress and the lingering fears. Can you share an example of a situation where you felt these reservations recently?

User: Just last week, I attended a study group, and while I wanted to contribute, I hesitated. I feared that my words wouldn't come out right, even though I had ideas to share.

Consultant: That hesitation is something many people experience. When you think about that moment, what thoughts were running through your mind that might have contributed to those feelings of hesitation?

User: I kept thinking that I shouldn't say anything unless I was perfect. I thought they'd judge me if I made mistakes.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite weighty. It's understandable that they would make you hesitant to speak up. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts those thoughts about being judged?

User: I really don't know. Most of my friends have been supportive. I guess the thought is just a habit, but it's hard to shake off.

Consultant: It's insightful that you've recognized it as a habit. Sometimes, our minds can play tricks on us. What would you say to a friend if they were feeling the same way about speaking up? 

User: I would probably tell them that nobody expects perfection and that their ideas are valuable, regardless of how they express them.

Consultant: That's a compassionate perspective! Now, let's try shifting that wisdom back to yourself. How can you remind yourself of that when you start feeling hesitant again?

User: Maybe I could write down some encouraging notes for myself or remind myself of the positive comments I've received. 

Consultant: Those sound like excellent strategies! Keeping reminders of your strengths can help reinforce your confidence. Have you thought about trying a specific practice before a speaking opportunity to help ease your anxiety?

User: I haven't really thought about that. I guess I could try some breathing exercises or even rehearse what I want to say beforehand, just to feel more prepared.

Consultant: Those practices can be very effective! Breath control can help calm your nerves, and practicing can increase your comfort level. Would you like to set a goal for using these strategies in your next speaking situation?

User: That could work! I would like to practice a few lines before my next class presentation and try some breathing exercises to keep calm.

Consultant: That's a wonderful goal! Practicing and employing relaxation techniques could really help you feel more at ease. How does that make you feel about your next opportunity to speak?

User: I feel slightly more confident just thinking about it. It feels good to have a plan!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Establishing a plan can certainly boost your confidence. As we wrap up today, how would you summarize the progress you've made since we started your sessions?

User: I think I've definitely improved in my ability to express myself and feel less anxious in social situations. I have a better understanding of my thoughts, and it's encouraging to see myself make progress.

Consultant: That’s an inspiring summary! Acknowledging your growth is an important part of maintaining your progress. What strategies do you think will help you continue this journey moving forward?

User: I plan to keep practicing my skills and reminding myself of my accomplishments. I'm also going to reach out more in social situations.

Consultant: Those sound like fantastic strategies! I’m proud of the progress you've made, and I believe you can continue building on it. Remember, I'm here to support you whenever you need. Our sessions have come to a close for now, but you’re always welcome to come back if you feel you need more guidance.

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate all your help and encouragement. I’m looking forward to continuing this journey.

Consultant: It’s been a pleasure working with you. Remember that you have the tools to succeed, and you can manage your anxiety. Take care, and see you next time!
