Consultant: Hello, Yali! I'm glad you could make it today. Let's start by talking about how you're feeling right now. What’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. Honestly, I’m feeling really down. Ever since my breakup three months ago, I’ve been struggling with my emotions. I find myself feeling so impulsive and sometimes even resorting to self-harm. It’s like I don’t know how to handle it.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, Yali. It’s understandable that a breakup can impact your emotions significantly. Can you share a bit about what triggers these impulsive feelings or the urge to self-harm?

User: Well, it happens when I feel particularly lonely or when I think about my past with my boyfriend. I just feel so lost and unworthy. Sometimes, it seems like hurting myself is the only way to release the pain I’m feeling inside.

Consultant: I hear you. It’s tough to cope with such loneliness and the sense of unworthiness. It’s important to acknowledge these feelings, but also to explore healthier ways to release the pain you’re feeling. What do you think might help you when these feelings arise?

User: I wish I knew. I sometimes try to distract myself, but it doesn’t always work. I've also thought about reaching out to friends, but I don’t want to burden them with my problems.

Consultant: It’s good to recognize that distraction can be a temporary solution. However, reaching out to friends can actually provide support and connection, which may help ease that loneliness. What would it feel like to share your feelings with a trusted friend?

User: I guess it could feel comforting, but I’m worried they might not understand or might judge me. I don’t want to seem weak.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel that way, but it’s also important to realize that everyone goes through tough times, and reaching out shows strength, not weakness. Have you had any past experiences where sharing helped you feel better?

User: I did talk to a friend once, and it felt relieving, but I didn’t do it again because I was nervous about burdening her.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s common to feel hesitant about sharing. Maybe we can develop some strategies to help you communicate your feelings better with your friends when you feel ready. Would you be interested in that?

User: Yes, I think that could help. I really want to reduce these impulsive behaviors.

Consultant: Great! Let’s talk about recognizing the feelings you experience before these impulses arise. When you start to feel overwhelmed, what physical sensations or thoughts do you notice?

User: I often feel a tightness in my chest and sometimes get really restless. My mind races, and I just want to act on that urge to hurt myself.

Consultant: Those physical sensations are important signals. Learning to recognize them can help you pause before acting on those impulses. What do you think might be some healthier coping strategies to try when you notice those sensations?

User: I’ve thought about journaling or taking walks, but I haven't committed to it. It feels hard to start.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Journaling can help you process your feelings, and walking can give you a chance to clear your mind. How about we set a small goal for you to try one of these activities this week? 

User: That sounds doable. Maybe I can start with journaling at least a few times this week.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful plan, Yali. Remember, the goal is to express yourself without any pressure. How do you think journaling might change how you feel in those moments?

User: I think it might help me understand my feelings better instead of just acting on them. I could see things more clearly.

Consultant: Exactly! It can provide an outlet for your emotions and help you reflect on what you're going through. Let's also talk about emotions in your relationship with your parents. How have those interactions been for you lately?

User: I feel disappointed with them. They don’t seem to understand what I'm going through, and I often feel judged instead of supported.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, especially when you’re looking for support. It’s essential to communicate your feelings to them, even if it’s hard. How do you think you could approach that conversation?

User: Maybe I could try telling them how I feel without feeling like I'm blaming them. It’s just hard to put it into words.

Consultant: That’s a good approach, Yali. Using “I” statements can help express your feelings without sounding accusatory. For instance, you might say, “I feel alone when I’m struggling and would appreciate your support.” Would that work for you?

User: Yes, that seems less confrontational. I’ll try to keep that in mind for our next conversation.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it’s okay to express your needs. Over time, this could improve your relationship with them. Let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed today. What do you feel is the most important takeaway from our session?

User: I think the biggest thing is recognizing my feelings and trying to communicate better with others. I want to work on replacing unhealthy coping mechanisms with healthier habits.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight, Yali. Acknowledging your feelings and wanting to improve communication is a big step forward. As we wrap up, what are some strategies you can use to maintain the progress you’ve made?

User: I’ll make journaling a habit and try talking to my friends more. I also want to keep practicing how to express my feelings to my parents.

Consultant: Those are wonderful plans, Yali. I believe you can achieve this. Remember, it’s a process, and you're not alone in this journey. If you feel overwhelmed, reach out for support. The door is always open for you to return.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support and advice. I feel a little better thinking about these strategies.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Yali. I’m glad to hear that. I look forward to hearing how you progress in our next session. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Yali! I'm really glad you could make it today. From our last session, I understand that you've been feeling quite overwhelmed lately, especially with the tensions at home. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi. I've had a lot of ups and downs. Living with my parents has been really stressful. We argue quite frequently, and I feel like I'm losing control of my emotions. I just want to feel valued and less anxious about our interactions.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, Yali. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when you’re facing these conflicts. Let’s start by discussing what specific moments you’ve found difficult. Can you share an example of a recent conflict and what thoughts went through your mind during that time?

User: Sure. Just the other day, I had a disagreement with my mom about how I should spend my time at home. I felt like she was belittling my choices. I thought, “I can’t do anything right,” and it made me feel really worthless and angry.

Consultant: I can see how that would provoke strong feelings. When you thought, “I can’t do anything right,” how did that affect your emotions in that moment?

User: It just spiraled. I felt really frustrated, and then I started to doubt myself even more. I ended up shutting down and not wanting to talk to anyone. It’s like I can’t escape this negativity.

Consultant: It makes sense that those thoughts would lead to such intense emotions and isolation. Have you noticed any patterns in your thoughts when conflicts arise? For example, do you often feel like you're being criticized or judged unfairly?

User: Yes, absolutely. I always feel like they see me as a failure. I frequently go back to those negative thoughts and blow them out of proportion.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization, Yali. It sounds like you might be experiencing some cognitive distortions in how you perceive these interactions with your parents. Let’s identify a few of these thoughts and see if we can challenge them together. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts the idea that you are a failure?

User: Well, I guess I’ve done things that I’m proud of, like taking care of myself and trying to improve my mental health. But it’s hard to remember those moments when I’m feeling down.

Consultant: That's a very important insight! You have accomplishments that reflect your strengths. When conflicts happen, those achievements become overshadowed by negative perceptions. What could be an alternative thought you could focus on during those arguments?

User: Maybe, “I’m doing my best, and it’s okay to make mistakes.” But it feels hard to live that truth when emotions run high.

Consultant: That sounds like a healthier perspective to adopt. It can be tough in the moment, but practicing that thought could gradually shift how you feel. How about we create a simple plan together? You could write down affirmations that highlight your strengths and remind you of your progress. Would that be helpful?

User: Yes, I think it could help me focus on the positives instead of dwelling on the negative.

Consultant: Great! Now, let’s think about some proactive strategies for when conflicts arise. Can we discuss some methods you can use to manage your emotions more effectively during those heated moments?

User: I guess taking a break to calm down could work. Sometimes I just need space to breathe and think.

Consultant: Taking a break sounds like a wise and effective approach. It helps create distance from the emotions before re-engaging in the conversation. We can also practice some grounding techniques that you can use during those breaks. Are you open to trying a few?

User: Yes, I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Wonderful! One technique might involve focusing on your breathing—taking a few deep breaths to help clear your mind. Would you like to try this together now, just for a minute?

User: Sure, I think that would be good.

Consultant: Okay, let’s take a moment. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a deep breath in for four counts, hold for four, and exhale for four. Let’s do this a few times together.

User: *breathes deeply* I feel a little calmer already. I think this could help.

Consultant: I’m glad you’re feeling that way! Practicing mindfulness in those moments can truly make a difference. As we continue our sessions, we can work on integrating these techniques into your daily life. Do you feel more prepared to handle conflicts with your parents now?

User: I feel like I can at least try. I’m still scared, but I’m willing to put in the effort.

Consultant: That's a huge step, Yali, and it's commendable that you're willing to try. Remember, it’s a process, and it’s okay to have setbacks. What do you think would be your focus for our next session after trying these strategies?

User: I’d like to talk about what happens after I try them and how I feel then. I want to see if I can manage to feel more in control.

Consultant: That’s a solid plan! We can definitely dive into that in our next meeting. I’m here to support you as you work through these challenges. Before we wrap up, is there anything specific you want to bring into our next session or something you feel you need support with right now?

User: I think I just need to feel more confident in my own voice when I talk to my parents.

Consultant: Absolutely! Building that confidence is key. We can explore some role-playing exercises to help you practice expressing yourself more assertively. I’m excited for the progress we can make together. Thank you for sharing openly today, Yali.

User: Thank you for listening and helping me figure things out. 

Consultant: You're welcome! Remember, it’s all about finding what works for you. I'm looking forward to our next session and continuing this journey with you. Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Yali! I'm glad you're here today. I understand you’ve been trying some new approaches to manage your emotions but haven’t seen the results you hoped for. Can you share with me what’s been on your mind lately?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really disappointed. I tried to start running to help with my binge eating urges, but I guess I did too much too quickly. Now, I’m just exhausted and still struggling with the same issues.

Consultant: It sounds like you’ve been putting in a lot of effort, but it’s been disheartening to feel like it's not working out as you'd planned. When you think about running and how you’ve approached it, what emotions come up for you?

User: Honestly, I feel frustrated and anxious. I thought exercising would help me feel better, but now I just feel more tired and overwhelmed.

Consultant: Those feelings of frustration and anxiety are completely understandable given your experience. You hoped exercise would be a positive outlet, and it’s tough when it leads to exhaustion instead. Can you tell me more about your expectations around running? What did you hope it would do for you?

User: I thought if I ran regularly, it would help control my eating habits and maybe even improve my mood. But now it just feels like another thing I’m failing at.

Consultant: It seems like you put a lot of hope into running as a solution to feeling better, which makes the current situation even more disappointing. What would you say has been the most challenging part for you in this process?

User: I think it’s just feeling like I’m stuck in this cycle. I try something new, but then it backfires, and I don’t know what to do next. It’s really discouraging.

Consultant: That cycle of trying different things and feeling discouraged can be really tough to break. It’s important to recognize that you’re not alone in feeling this way. What would it feel like to shift your perspective a bit and think of these attempts as part of the process rather than failures?

User: I guess it would help. But it’s hard to see them that way when I’m in the moment, feeling so low.

Consultant: Absolutely, it can be difficult to maintain that perspective. Let’s try to identify some moments where you felt hopeful or accomplished, however small they were. Can you think of a time recently where you felt a sense of progress, even if it was brief?

User: Maybe when I just started running and felt a bit of energy? But it quickly turned into feeling tired and giving up.

Consultant: That initial energy is important, Yali! It shows that you were engaging in a healthy behavior. Can we explore ways to build on that small sense of accomplishment rather than let it fizzle out? What if we set more manageable goals around your running that could support you better?

User: I think I might be open to that. I just need to figure out a way to keep it balanced so I don’t feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Finding balance is key, and it sounds like you’re really aware of that need. We can work together to create a realistic plan that allows for those energetic moments without pushing you too hard. What is a realistic running routine you think could work for you?

User: Maybe just running a couple of times a week instead of trying to go all out every day? 

Consultant: That sounds like a great start! Focusing on consistency rather than intensity could really help you maintain your energy and motivation. How would you feel about scheduling your runs at specific times to make it easier to stick to?

User: I like that idea. If they’re scheduled like appointments, I might be more likely to follow through.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach! Having a structured plan can help you feel more accountable and less overwhelmed. How about we also talk about some alternative activities that might help you with your emotional regulation besides running? 

User: Sure, I’m open to that. I just want to feel better.

Consultant: Let’s brainstorm together! Activities like yoga or even just going for a walk outside could be refreshing as well. How does that sound to you? 

User: I think that would feel good. It’s less intense and might help me clear my mind.

Consultant: Definitely! Gentle forms of exercise can be really effective in helping you regulate your emotions and prevent burnout. Perhaps we can integrate a few of these options into your weekly routine alongside running? 

User: That seems doable. I’ll feel like I have different choices instead of just running or nothing.

Consultant: Exactly! Having a variety of options may help reduce that pressure and keep things enjoyable. How are you feeling about that idea? 

User: It’s making me feel a bit more hopeful. I like the thought of having different ways to relieve stress.

Consultant: I’m really glad to hear that! Hope is an important part of this journey. As we move forward, let’s keep track of what's working for you and what’s not. Remember, it’s okay to adjust the plan as you go. 

User: Yes, that makes sense. I’ll try to stay flexible about it.

Consultant: Flexibility can really help ease the pressure. One last thing—let’s discuss some mindfulness techniques that you can use when you feel overwhelmed or anxious. How does that sound? 

User: That would be good. I need some strategies to cope in the moment.

Consultant: Great! Techniques like deep breathing or grounding exercises can be very effective. We can practice a few together to find what feels best for you. Would you like to try that now?

User: Yes, I would. 

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s start with some deep breathing. Take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a moment, and then slowly exhale through your mouth. Let’s do that a few times, focusing just on your breathing. How does that feel?

User: It’s calming. I can feel my body relaxing a bit.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, you can use this breathing technique whenever you feel anxious. As we wrap up this session, what are your biggest takeaways from our conversation today? 

User: I feel like I have a plan now, and I feel a bit more in control. I’m hopeful I can apply some of these strategies.

Consultant: That's wonderful progress, Yali! Taking these steps can make a significant difference. Just remember, it's a journey, and it's okay to reach out for support if you need it. Looking forward to seeing you again soon! 

User: Thank you! I feel better just having talked about everything. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome. Take care, and I’ll see you next time!
###################
Consultant: Hi Yali! It’s great to see you today. How are you feeling about our session? 

User: Hi. Honestly, I’ve been feeling really anxious about socializing. I’ve tried going out and meeting new people, but it’s hard for me to connect. I feel like I might not be able to express myself well.

Consultant: I understand that you feel anxious about connecting with others. It sounds like you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself to perform in social situations. Can we start by talking more about what makes you feel anxious during these interactions?

User: I think I worry that people won’t like me or that I’ll say the wrong thing. It makes me second-guess myself a lot.

Consultant: Those feelings of self-doubt can be really overwhelming, especially when you’re trying to engage with others. Can you recall a specific situation where you felt this way recently? What thoughts ran through your mind during that time?

User: Well, I went to a gathering last weekend, and I felt really out of place. I remember thinking, "I shouldn't be here," and it made me anxious to even talk to anyone.

Consultant: It sounds like that situation was really challenging for you. You mentioned the thought, "I shouldn't be here." What emotions did that thought bring up for you?

User: I felt embarrassed and alone. It’s like I just wanted to disappear because I thought everyone else was better at socializing than me.

Consultant: That must have felt really isolating. It might be helpful to explore whether that thought has a basis in reality. Is there any evidence that supports the idea that you don't belong in those social situations?

User: Well, I don’t know… I guess there were people who were really friendly to me, but I kept focusing on my flaws.

Consultant: That's an important observation! It seems like while there were positive interactions, your mind was drawn to the negative thoughts. If a friend were in your situation, what might you tell them about their experience?

User: I would probably say that it’s okay to feel awkward, and that everyone has their own struggles in social settings.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s common for everyone to feel a bit awkward sometimes. What if we tried to challenge that thought of not belonging? Could we find some realistic alternatives to that belief? 

User: Maybe I could think that I'm learning and it’s okay to not be perfect. Everyone has to start somewhere.

Consultant: That's a wonderful shift in thinking! By replacing the belief that you don't belong with the idea that you’re still learning, you can give yourself permission to improve. How does that feel for you?

User: It feels a bit relieving, actually. It makes me feel like I have the chance to grow instead of being stuck.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Now, as we try to enhance your confidence in social situations, would you be open to setting some small, manageable social goals for yourself? 

User: Yes, I think starting small sounds good. Maybe I could aim to chat with one new person at the next event?

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic goal! Engaging in a conversation with one new person can be an excellent way to build your confidence. What do you think you could say to start that conversation?

User: I could try asking them about something related to the event. That’s usually a good way to break the ice, right?

Consultant: Yes! Asking about the event is a great way to initiate a conversation. Besides practicing that, do you have any activities or hobbies you could share that might pique someone’s interest?

User: I like painting and hiking. I could mention that and see if others share those interests.

Consultant: Those are great ways to connect with others! Sharing your interests can create common ground. If the conversation feels challenging, remember, it's okay to take a breath and collect your thoughts. 

User: True. I’ll try to keep that in mind when I start talking to someone.

Consultant: I believe in you, Yali! It's all about practice and giving yourself grace through the process. What do you think might help you feel less anxious before this next social interaction?

User: Maybe I could prepare a few topics to talk about ahead of time so I don’t freeze up.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Having some topics in mind can certainly ease your anxiety. As we wrap up for today, how do you feel about your progress so far?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I still have worries about being rejected, but I can see that there’s a way forward.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to have those feelings. Remember, building relationships takes time, and you've already made important strides. For our next session, let's discuss how your interactions go and any new thoughts you discover about socializing.

User: Yes, I look forward to it. Thank you for your help today!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Yali! I'm proud of the progress you’re making. Remember, I’m here for you whenever you need support. Take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yali! I'm glad you're here today. How are you feeling at the moment?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit mixed. I’ve made some new friends recently and that’s a nice change, but I still worry about being rejected or left out. It’s like I can’t fully enjoy it because of this fear.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing some ups and downs with your new friendships. On one hand, you're feeling a sense of belonging, but on the other hand, the fear of rejection seems to cast a shadow over those positive experiences. Can you tell me more about those feelings?

User: Yeah, it’s just that sometimes I think they might not really want to hang out with me. I keep second-guessing their intentions, and that makes me nervous during our interactions.

Consultant: It’s understandable to have these concerns, especially when you're trying to build new relationships. It seems like the fear of not being accepted is affecting how you perceive these friendships. What kind of thoughts go through your mind in those moments of doubt?

User: I often think things like, “They probably don’t like me as much as I think,” or “What if they choose someone else over me?” Sometimes, I even feel like maybe I don't deserve their friendship.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy, Yali. It seems they are contributing to your anxiety. Can we explore where those beliefs come from? What evidence do you have that supports these negative thoughts about your friendships?

User: I guess I don’t have much evidence, but I’ve been rejected before in social situations. So, it’s hard to shake the feeling that it could happen again.

Consultant: Past experiences can certainly impact our current feelings. Have you had any positive experiences with these new friends that might challenge those negative thoughts?

User: Yes, actually! They invited me out a couple of times, and we had a lot of fun together. They seemed to enjoy my company, at least.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It sounds like there are positive signs in your interactions with them. How might recognizing these positive experiences help you adjust those negative thoughts about being rejected?

User: I suppose it could remind me that not every situation will end poorly. I could try to focus more on the good times rather than my worries.

Consultant: Exactly! Shifting your focus to those positive moments can help you build more trust in these relationships. If a close friend were to share similar doubts, how would you support them or encourage them to think differently?

User: I would probably tell them to look at the bright side and that their friends likely appreciate them. I wouldn’t want them to feel alone in their worries.

Consultant: That’s very empathetic of you, Yali! It shows you have a kind heart. Now, how can you apply that same kindness and understanding to yourself in these moments of doubt?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it's okay to feel uncertain but also to acknowledge that I have friends who enjoy hanging out with me.

Consultant: Absolutely! Acknowledging that uncertainty is a normal part of building relationships can be very helpful. How about we develop some strategies for you to use when those negative thoughts come up again? 

User: Yes, I’d like that! It would be helpful to have some tools to manage these feelings.

Consultant: One approach could be to practice some reframing techniques. Whenever you have those negative thoughts, try countering them with evidence of your positive interactions. What do you think about that?

User: That sounds doable! I can create a list of good experiences to remind myself that I’m worthy of friendship.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! Keeping a list can serve as a tangible reminder of your worth. Additionally, we can think about some activities you could do with your friends that would reinforce those positive feelings. Any ideas come to mind?

User: Maybe I could suggest doing something fun together, like going out for coffee or a hike. That way, we can bond more.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Engaging in activities can deepen those connections while also helping you feel more secure in those relationships. How do you feel about discussing your emotions when you’re with them? 

User: I think talking about feelings would help, but I’m still hesitant. I worry that it might scare them off.

Consultant: It’s natural to feel that way, but sharing can also be a way to build trust. If you approach the conversation gently, it might help clarify any misunderstandings as well. What small step could you take to express your feelings?

User: Maybe I could start by casually mentioning how much I appreciate their company and see how they respond. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great first step! It’s positive and opens the door for deeper conversations without being too intimidating. As we look ahead, how does this exploration make you feel about your friendships?

User: I feel a little lighter now. I think I’m beginning to see that I can trust myself and the process of forming friendships. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Yali! Remember, building trust takes time, but with the steps we discussed, you’re on the right path. How do you want to continue moving forward regarding your emotions and friendships?

User: I want to keep nurturing these relationships and remind myself to focus on the positives. I also want to work on my feelings around the idea of getting back to work soon.

Consultant: That’s a healthy approach! Let's make sure we incorporate that focus on your future goals, too. You deserve to feel supported both in your social interactions and in your career ambitions. 

User: Thank you! It feels good to talk this through. I appreciate your support.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Yali! I’m really proud of the progress you’ve made today. Remember, it’s perfectly okay to reach out again whenever you need support. How has today’s session impacted your view on future interactions?

User: I feel more optimistic now. I think I can manage my feelings better, and I’m looking forward to exploring my friendships as well as job opportunities.

Consultant: That’s an excellent mindset to have! Embrace the journey and take each step as it comes. You have the tools and support you need. Let’s touch base again soon to check on your progress.

User: Definitely! I'll keep you updated. Thank you once again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Yali! I'm really glad that you're here today. I remember last time we talked about your feelings and the challenges you're facing regarding your career. How are you feeling about that today?

User: Hi! I feel a bit better, actually. My emotions have stabilized a little, and I’m trying to stay positive about my future. But I still feel uncertain about re-entering the job market.

Consultant: It's great to hear that your emotions are stabilizing, and I appreciate your openness about your uncertainties. Can you share what specific aspects of re-entering the job market feel most uncertain or challenging for you?

User: I guess I worry about whether I’ll find a job that fits me, and if I'm even capable of handling the pressure and responsibilities that come with working again.

Consultant: Those concerns are completely understandable. Finding a job that feels right can be daunting, especially after some time away. What sort of work do you think might fit you best, considering your skills and interests?

User: I’ve always thought I’d enjoy something in marketing or communications, but I’m not sure if I have the right skills or experience anymore.

Consultant: It sounds like you have some ideas about your interests in marketing or communications. Let’s explore that a bit. What specific skills do you think you possess that relate to those fields?

User: I used to be good at writing and social media, and I enjoyed brainstorming creative ideas. But it feels like such a long time since I last worked on those skills.

Consultant: Those skills are very valuable in marketing and communications! It's common for people to feel rusty after a break. Do you think there might be ways you could refresh those skills or even build new ones?

User: I suppose I could take an online course or start a small project on my own. It’s just a bit intimidating to put myself out there again after a break.

Consultant: Taking a course or starting a project sounds like a proactive approach! It’s totally normal to feel intimidated. What if we break that down into smaller steps? What would be the first step you could take toward refreshing your skills?

User: I could start by researching some online courses. That doesn’t sound too overwhelming.

Consultant: That’s a great first step! Researching online courses is manageable and will help you feel more empowered. How do you feel about taking this step?

User: Honestly, I’m feeling a bit excited about it now. It feels achievable and might help me regain some confidence.

Consultant: I love to hear that! Gaining excitement and confidence is a step in the right direction. Let’s think about how you can handle any worries that might come up as you begin this journey. What are some thoughts that come to mind when you think about facing potential challenges or pressures?

User: I guess I worry about feeling inadequate or overwhelmed again, like I might not keep up.

Consultant: Those feelings of inadequacy and overwhelm are quite common, especially when starting something new. What if we discuss ways to challenge those thoughts? For example, how might you reframe thoughts of inadequacy into something more supportive?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone starts somewhere and that it’s okay to make mistakes while learning.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s an excellent reframe. Encouraging yourself by acknowledging that learning is a process is powerful. Let’s also think about how you could manage feelings of being overwhelmed. What strategies could you use to take things one step at a time?

User: I could set smaller goals for myself, like dedicating a little time each day to my research, rather than trying to do it all at once.

Consultant: Setting smaller, manageable goals is a fantastic strategy! This way, you’ll give yourself the flexibility to progress at your own pace. How do you feel about creating a timeline for these smaller goals?

User: That sounds helpful! I think having a timeline would keep me motivated and make it easier to track my progress.

Consultant: Wonderful! Creating a timeline can really enhance your sense of accomplishment. As you outline your goals, keep in mind to celebrate each small success along the way. How does that sound to you?
