Consultant: Hello, Bingbing! I'm glad to see you today. I heard you've been having some trouble in class lately. Can you tell me more about that?

User: Hi! Yes, I've been a bit naughty in class. I sometimes make noises on purpose and throw things. I just can't help it; it feels like fun at the moment!

Consultant: It sounds like you're really lively and want to have fun. But it's also important to think about how these actions might affect you and your classmates. How do you feel when you make those noises or throw things?

User: Well, sometimes it's exciting, but I also see the teacher getting mad. I feel nervous when that happens. I don’t want to get in trouble!

Consultant: That makes sense, Bingbing. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement, especially if you think it’s fun. But it’s great that you recognize the teacher's feelings too. What do you think could help you feel more in control of your actions in class?

User: I don’t know... maybe if I had a way to keep my hands busy? Like a toy or something?

Consultant: That's a good idea! Keeping your hands busy can help you stay focused. We can explore some options together. What if we think about a "magic wand" that could help you channel your energy into positive actions instead? 

User: A magic wand? That sounds cool! What would that do?

Consultant: Imagine that when you wave your magic wand, it helps you remember to choose fun and positive behaviors instead of the naughty ones. It could remind you to raise your hand when you want to speak or draw instead of throwing things. How does that sound?

User: That sounds fun! I think I would really like that!

Consultant: Fantastic! It’s about using your imagination to encourage good choices. When we use our "magic wand," we can also think of rewards for positive behavior. What kind of rewards do you think would motivate you?

User: Maybe getting extra playtime or a sticker would be nice!

Consultant: Great suggestions! Stickers and extra playtime can be wonderful rewards. They can help remind you how good it feels to control your behavior. Let’s think about a way we can track your progress. How about keeping a chart where you can mark each time you make a positive choice in class?

User: Yeah! That sounds like a fun game! I would like to see my marks each day.

Consultant: I love your enthusiasm! A chart can be a great visual reminder. We'll call it your "Magic Behavior Chart." Each mark you get will be like earning magic points. What would you want to do to celebrate when you reach a certain number of points?

User: I think I would like to have a small party with my friends! That would be awesome!

Consultant: A party with friends is a great celebration! It’s a fun way to reward yourself for all your hard work. So, if you keep track of your magic points and make those positive choices, you’ll be closer to that party. 

User: I really want to try that! It seems like it could help me behave better in class.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that, Bingbing! It does sound promising. Now, let’s think about some situations that might be a bit tricky for you. What do you think makes it hard to use your ‘magic wand’ in class?

User: Sometimes my friends are noisy too, and it makes me want to join in on the fun!

Consultant: That’s understandable! Friends can be really distracting. How about this: when you feel like joining in on the noise, you can take a deep breath and imagine waving your magic wand instead. You could even give a thumbs-up to show your friends you're choosing to be quiet. How does that sound?

User: I think I can do that! I’ll just pretend I have the wand with me.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Pretending will make it easier. Plus, whenever you make that choice, you’ll earn magic points. Let’s practice how you could respond in those moments. What would you say to your friends when you want to stay focused?

User: I could say, “Let’s have fun quietly!” 

Consultant: That’s a perfect way to express it! It shows you can still be playful without being noisy. Remember, whenever you use your magic wand to make a positive choice, you’re also a good role model for your friends. 

User: Yeah! I want them to see that it might be more fun to be quiet sometimes!

Consultant: Absolutely! And by showing them how much fun it can be, you’re helping everyone in the class too. So, as we wrap up today, what are you taking away from our conversation about your magic wand and the changes you want to make?

User: I learned that I can choose to be good and earn magic points! I think I can do it!

Consultant: That's wonderful, Bingbing! You've shown a lot of understanding and motivation today. Remember, you hold the wand and can use it whenever you wish. I believe in you, and I'm excited to hear about your progress next time. 

User: Thanks! I’m looking forward to showing you my chart and telling you about my magic points!

Consultant: I can’t wait either! Keep believing in your magic, and we’ll see how it goes. Take care until we meet again!

Consultant: Hello, Bingbing! I'm glad to see you today. I know we've been talking about your magic wand and how it helps you manage your behavior. How have you been feeling about that lately?

User: Hi! I've been trying to imagine the magic wand more often. Sometimes it makes me feel like I can actually control my actions better, especially in class.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It sounds like you’re really engaging with the idea of the magic wand. Can you tell me about a situation in class where you felt you could use it to help you control your behavior?

User: Well, there was a time when I wanted to interrupt the teacher, but I imagined the wand and stopped myself. It felt good to hold back.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful example, Bingbing! Using your imagination to pause and think before acting shows real progress. How did it feel to hold back in that moment?

User: I felt proud! I didn’t want to be disruptive, and the magic wand helped me remember that.

Consultant: Feeling proud of yourself is a fantastic step forward. Let’s talk about how we can build on that success. What would you like to achieve next with your magic wand?

User: Maybe I can use it to help me stay focused on my work and not wander off during class activities.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent goal! Staying focused can really help you do well in school. Can we break this down into smaller steps? For example, how would you like to use the magic wand during a specific activity?

User: I think I could use the wand when we have group work. I can remind myself to listen and not just talk.

Consultant: Perfect! Using the wand during group work is a great idea. How about we set a mini-goal? You could aim to use your wand at least twice during group activities this week. What do you think?

User: That sounds good! If I can remember to use it twice, I’ll try to do even better.

Consultant: I love your enthusiasm! If you manage to use the wand successfully, how will you reward yourself?

User: Maybe I could have extra playtime or a small treat afterward!

Consultant: That sounds like a fun reward! Associating your good behavior with a treat can motivate you even more. How will you remind yourself to use the wand during your next group activity?

User: I think I could write a note to myself and put it in my desk. That way, I’ll see it and remember!

Consultant: That’s a smart idea! Having a reminder can really help. As you practice this, how do you think you’ll feel about your ability to manage your behavior?

User: I hope I’ll feel more in control and happy that I can do it. It’s nice to feel like I can change things.

Consultant: Absolutely! Gaining control over your actions is empowering. Remember, it’s okay to make mistakes along the way. What will you do if you forget to use the wand in a moment?

User: I guess I could just try again next time and not be too hard on myself.

Consultant: That’s a healthy approach! Being kind to yourself is very important. As we wrap up today, can you share one thing you’re excited about trying with your magic wand this week?

User: I’m excited about seeing if I can really use it during group work! I want to tell you about how it goes next time.

Consultant: I’m looking forward to hearing all about your experiences, Bingbing! Keep practicing, and remember that you’re doing great. I believe you can manage your behavior successfully!

User: Thank you! I feel more ready for the week now!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Enjoy practicing with your magic wand. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello there! I'm happy to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to limit my disruptive behaviors in class. Sometimes it's a bit hard, but I think I'm making some progress.

Consultant: That's great to hear that you're making an effort to change! Can you tell me more about how you've been trying to control those behaviors and what has been working for you?

User: Well, I've been trying to catch myself before I act out. I've also set a goal to only "release my habits" a few times a day instead of all the time.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re using self-control techniques to manage your actions, which is a positive step. How has your experience been when you manage to stick to those goals?

User: When I follow through, I feel really proud of myself! But sometimes it’s hard when my friends are being funny or silly.

Consultant: That’s totally understandable. It’s great to hear that you feel proud when you succeed. Let’s explore those moments when it's challenging for you. What thoughts go through your mind when you want to join in with your friends?

User: I think about how fun it would be to be silly with them. But then I remember I want to focus on my behavior.

Consultant: It's awesome that you're able to recognize the fun but also remind yourself of your goals. How does it make you feel when you choose to stick to your behavior goals instead?

User: I feel a lot better after class because I didn’t get in trouble. But sometimes I worry they won't want to play with me anymore.

Consultant: That's a valid concern, wanting to fit in with friends is important. Can we think about some ways you can still have fun with your friends while keeping your behavior in check?

User: Maybe I can join in sometimes but just not as much? Like when it's not during lessons?

Consultant: That sounds like a balanced approach! You can still participate and enjoy time with them while keeping your focus in class. How will you remind yourself to follow this plan?

User: I could set reminders in my head or even tell my teacher so they can help me.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! Having your teacher help can provide additional support and accountability. How do you feel about sharing this plan with your teacher? 

User: I think I could do that! It might make me feel more responsible.

Consultant: Exactly! Taking responsibility for your behavior is a significant step. As you engage with your teacher, how do you think that will influence your confidence in managing your actions?

User: I think it would help me feel more in control. Plus, it might make my classmates see I’m trying to be better.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic insight! Feeling more in control can lead to feelings of success. Have you felt any positive changes from your efforts so far?

User: Yes! I noticed my teacher actually praised me the other day for being quieter. It made me feel good.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful acknowledgment of your hard work! It shows that others are noticing your efforts. How do you think receiving positive feedback affects your motivation?

User: It makes me want to keep trying! I like feeling appreciated.

Consultant: That’s a powerful motivator! Let’s think about how you can maintain this momentum. What strategies do you think you can use to continue feeling appreciated and motivated?

User: Maybe I can set new goals for myself? Like trying to be less disruptive for the whole week.

Consultant: Setting concrete goals is an excellent approach! How would you celebrate your success if you achieve that goal this week?

User: I could treat myself to some extra playtime or something fun!

Consultant: That sounds like a great reward! It’s important to acknowledge your achievements. As we wrap up today, what do you feel is the most valuable takeaway from our session?

User: I think I learned that I can control my behavior and still have fun with my friends when I set goals.

Consultant: That’s a huge realization! You are making significant progress, and I’m proud of you. Remember, practicing these skills will help you in different situations, and it’s okay to seek support when you need it. Would you like to share anything else before we end our session?

User: No, I feel good about what we talked about. Thanks for helping me!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad you’re feeling good. Remember, I’m here for you whenever you need support. Keep up the great work, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time!

Consultant: Hello! It's great to have you here today, Bingbing. I’ve been hearing about the positive changes you’ve been making lately. How are you feeling about your progress?

User: Hi! I feel really proud of myself. My teachers and classmates have said nice things about me, and I really like participating in class now.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're starting to enjoy being recognized for your hard work. Can you tell me more about what you think helped you make these positive changes?

User: I think I just started to try harder. I wanted to behave better and not get into trouble. It feels nice to see my teachers smile instead of getting in trouble all the time.

Consultant: That’s a very mature perspective. It sounds like you’re really aware of how your actions can affect those around you. What do you think you can do to keep this positive behavior going in the future?

User: Maybe I can set some goals for myself, like being helpful in group work or answering more questions in class. I want to keep improving.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals, Bingbing! Setting goals can really help maintain your motivation. How do you feel about tracking your progress towards these goals?

User: I think keeping track would help me see how I'm doing. I could write it down or maybe talk about it with someone.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Writing it down can give you a clear view of your achievements over time. How about we create a simple chart together that you can update regularly?

User: Yeah, that sounds fun! I think it would help me stay focused.

Consultant: Absolutely! And it can be very rewarding to see your progress visually. How do you usually feel when you accomplish something you’ve worked hard for?

User: I feel really happy and proud. It makes me want to keep trying even more.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Celebrating your achievements is important. It sounds like you’re building a positive cycle there. What other areas of your school life do you think you'd like to improve or focus on next?

User: I really want to work on making more friends. Sometimes I feel a little shy when I want to talk with others.

Consultant: Building friendships is a great goal, too! Feeling shy is completely normal. What do you think could help you feel more comfortable when approaching new friends?

User: Maybe I could practice starting conversations, like asking them about their favorite games or what they like to do.

Consultant: That’s a great approach! Asking about their interests can be a great icebreaker. Would you like to try setting a specific goal, like initiating a conversation with one new person each week?

User: Yes, that sounds good! I think I can do that. It would give me a reason to talk to someone new.

Consultant: Perfect! Setting that weekly goal can help you gradually build your confidence. How do you think you will feel after having a conversation with someone new?

User: I think I would feel really happy and maybe even surprised that it wasn’t as hard as I thought!

Consultant: Exactly! It often gets easier with practice. Keeping a record of these interactions can also help you see just how much progress you’re making. Are you excited about this plan?

User: Yes! I feel like I have a lot to look forward to now.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Let’s summarize what we discussed: keeping track of your behavior improvements, setting goals for group work, and practicing conversations with new friends. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds really good! I feel like I have a clear plan now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Bingbing! Maintaining this positive momentum is important. How are you feeling overall about the changes you are making?

User: I feel really positive about it. I can see that I’m changing, and I like it!

Consultant: That’s so encouraging to hear! Recognizing your own growth is a powerful thing. As you continue to take these positive steps, remember that it's perfectly okay to feel nervous sometimes. 

User: Yes, I understand that now. It’s part of trying to grow.

Consultant: Exactly! And I’m really glad to see your openness to these feelings. Looking ahead, if you encounter any challenges, remember to reach out and talk about it. I'm here to help.

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support.

Consultant: Hi there! I'm really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been pretty good, actually. I felt really proud after that group activity where I shared my idea about the “magic box.” Everyone seemed to like it!

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like sharing your idea had a positive impact on both you and your classmates. How did it feel to present your idea to the group?

User: It felt great! At first, I was a little nervous, but then I saw my friends smiling and nodding, and it made me feel more confident.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that. Confidence can really make a difference in those situations. What do you think contributed to that confidence while presenting your idea?

User: I think it was because I had practiced it a lot before and I knew what I wanted to say. Plus, I really believed that my idea was cool and fun!

Consultant: Practicing certainly helps, and your belief in your idea is really important too. Let's explore that a bit more—what specific things do you believe make your idea "cool and fun"?

User: Well, the “magic box” can hold surprises, and I thought it would be fun for everyone to take turns using it during our activities. It’s like we can create excitement together!

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic concept! Engaging others with surprises is a great way to foster teamwork. After your presentation, did you notice any changes in how your classmates interacted with you?

User: Yes! After I shared the idea, some of them came to talk to me more. They even asked if we could use the magic box in our next project.

Consultant: That's a significant improvement! It sounds like your idea not only made you feel good but also encouraged your classmates to engage with you. How have these interactions impacted your feelings about working in groups?

User: I feel much better about it now! I used to think it was hard to connect with others, but now I feel more excited to join in and share my ideas.

Consultant: That’s an excellent shift in your mindset. Embracing that excitement is crucial. Can you think of any situations in the future where you would like to share your ideas or take a lead in a group again?

User: Yes! I have a class project coming up soon, and I think I might want to suggest using the magic box again. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful opportunity! How can we prepare you for that situation to ensure you feel just as confident as before?

User: Maybe I could practice my presentation again and think of some fun surprises to include with the box!

Consultant: Practicing and preparing those surprises will definitely help. You seem to be recognizing the steps you can take to succeed. What feelings do you have about making those plans?

User: I feel excited! I like having a plan and being able to think ahead.

Consultant: That's great to hear! Excitement can be a wonderful motivator. As we approach the end of our session, let’s reflect on what you've achieved so far. How do you feel about your progress in social situations?

User: I feel proud! I’ve improved a lot, and I actually enjoy working with others now.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. It's clear you've built some strong social skills. To keep this positive momentum going, what goals would you like to set for your future interactions?

User: I want to keep sharing my ideas and maybe try to help others feel included too, like I did during the last group. 

Consultant: That’s an admirable goal! Helping others feel included is a wonderful way to continue developing your social skills. Do you feel ready to put that into practice?

User: Yes, I really want to!

Consultant: Wonderful! Remember, it's about enjoying the process as much as the outcome. As we wrap up, think about one key takeaway from our sessions that you want to carry forward. 

User: I think it will be to keep believing in my ideas and being confident when I share them, just like with the magic box!

Consultant: Absolutely! Believing in yourself is a powerful tool. I’m proud of the progress you've made. Remember, you can always contact me if you need support in the future. 

User: Thank you! I’m really glad I came to these sessions.

Consultant: Me too! It’s been a pleasure working with you. Keep shining and embracing your creativity.

User: Hi! I'm feeling really proud of myself. I was recognized as the most improved student in my class, and I just can't stop thinking about it!

Consultant: That's fantastic, Bingbing! It sounds like you worked really hard, and it's great to see your efforts acknowledged. What do you think contributed the most to your improvement?

User: I think I just focused more in class and listened to the teacher. I also started to believe that I could do better, which helped!

Consultant: That’s an important insight! Focusing and believing in yourself can make a big difference. Now that you've experienced this success, how would you like to continue developing your skills and interests?

User: I want to learn new things and maybe even try out for the school play! But I'm also a little scared about it.

Consultant: It’s perfectly normal to feel scared when trying something new, Bingbing. Let's talk about the school play. What excites you about it, and what makes you nervous?

User: I'm excited because I've never acted before, but I'm worried that I might mess up in front of everyone.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re feeling excited! Let’s think about it this way: what if you concentrate on having fun and doing your best, instead of worrying about messing up? What could that look like for you?

User: I guess I could just focus on enjoying the moment and not think too much about what people will say.

Consultant: Absolutely! Enjoying the moment sounds like a wonderful approach. How can you remind yourself to focus on the fun during rehearsals or performances?

User: Maybe I could tell myself that it's okay to make mistakes and just do my best.

Consultant: That's a great strategy, Bingbing! Encouraging yourself can help alleviate some pressure. As you move forward, what specific goals or skills would you like to target in your learning or acting journey?

User: I really want to get better at speaking in front of people and maybe even learn to express different emotions when acting.

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! Practicing speaking in front of a mirror or with family could help you build confidence. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I can practice my lines and get feedback from my family.

Consultant: Great plan! Feedback can help you grow. Let's also think about how you can reward yourself for your efforts. What kind of rewards motivate you?

User: I like the idea of getting extra playtime or maybe a new book once I finish my lines for the play!

Consultant: Those rewards sound wonderful! They can keep you motivated as you work towards your goals. How do you feel about this whole plan we have just talked about?

User: I feel really good! It seems achievable, and I can't wait to start practicing!
