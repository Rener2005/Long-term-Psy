Consultant: Hello, Jiani! I'm glad you're here for our session today. I understand that things have been quite challenging for you lately. Can you start by telling me a bit about what you've been feeling?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really down lately, especially with school. I just can't seem to adapt to the new environment. I often cry, and I feel so useless and detached from everything around me.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of sadness and isolation. That's really tough to deal with. What specific challenges have you faced in adapting to your new school?

User: Well, I just don't feel like I fit in. The other students seem to bond easily, and I'm left out. I try to talk to them, but it just feels awkward, and I don't know how to connect.

Consultant: It must be overwhelming to feel like you're on the outside looking in. Let's explore that a bit more. When you attempt to connect with your classmates, what thoughts go through your mind?

User: I think they probably don't want to talk to me or think I'm weird. I constantly worry about saying the wrong thing or that they’ll judge me.

Consultant: Those thoughts seem to increase your feelings of anxiety and sadness. It’s understandable to feel that way, but let’s think about this. Is there any evidence that supports these thoughts, or could there be another way to look at the situation?

User: I guess I don’t have concrete evidence. It’s just a feeling I get. Part of me thinks maybe they’re just busy making friends and don’t notice me, but then I also think they must be thinking something negative about me.

Consultant: That’s an important insight, Jiani. It sounds like there’s a mix of self-doubt and assumptions about others' perceptions. If a friend were in your shoes, what would you tell them about their thoughts?

User: I would probably say that it’s okay to take time to make friends and that not everyone is judging them. They should just be themselves.

Consultant: Exactly! You would reassure your friend and encourage self-acceptance. Let’s try to apply that same kindness to yourself. Can you think of an example where you felt more connected with someone, even if it was just a small moment?

User: Well, there was a time when I partnered up with someone for a project. We shared ideas, and I felt like we were on the same page, even if it was brief.

Consultant: That’s a great example! It shows that connections can happen, even in small ways. How can we build on that experience moving forward?

User: Maybe I could try to reach out more during group activities or share my ideas. I just feel scared of being rejected.

Consultant: It is natural to feel scared of rejection, but taking small steps can help ease that fear. What if you set a goal to start a small conversation with one classmate this week? How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds manageable. I think I could try it, but I’m still really nervous about it.

Consultant: Feeling nervous is okay, and it’s perfectly normal to experience that. We can even plan what you might say to help. How about asking about a subject or sharing your thoughts on a class assignment?

User: That sounds like a good idea. Starting with schoolwork might make it easier.

Consultant: Yes! It gives you a shared topic to discuss. What else can we do to support you in feeling more confident when approaching them?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that it's okay if the conversation doesn't go perfectly. That I can learn from each attempt, even if it doesn’t feel great.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective to have—recognizing that every experience can be a learning opportunity. If things don’t go as planned, what’s a positive way you can respond to yourself?

User: I could tell myself that I tried my best and that it’s okay to feel uncomfortable sometimes. I need to keep reminding myself that I can improve with practice.

Consultant: Exactly! Practicing self-compassion is important. It seems like you’re developing a more supportive inner voice. How do you feel about the plan we’ve created for reaching out to classmates?

User: I’m feeling a bit more hopeful. It feels good to have a plan. I just need to take that first step.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Jiani! Remember, every small step counts. As you prepare for this, what other emotions do you think might come up, and how can we manage those together?

User: I might still feel anxious, but I guess I could also feel excited about the possibility of making friends. Managing the anxiety will be important.

Consultant: Recognizing that mix of emotions is key. It’s okay for both anxiety and excitement to coexist. We can practice some grounding techniques next time to help with anxiety. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel like I was able to express myself, and I have some steps I can take now. It’s been really helpful just talking things through.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Jiani. Your openness is a significant step forward. As we finish for today, let’s reflect on what you’ll take from this session into your week ahead.

User: I’ll focus on trying to connect with my classmates and remind myself to be kind to myself during the process.

Consultant: That’s an excellent takeaway. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes next time. Take care, and see you soon!

User: Thank you so much! See you next time!

Consultant: Hi, Jiani! I'm really glad to see you today. Let's start by talking about how you've been feeling lately. Can you share what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really lonely and disconnected from my classmates. I used to be more outgoing, but now I just feel anxious talking to them.

Consultant: I can see how that would be really tough for you. You mentioned feeling lonely and anxious—could you tell me more about what situations make you feel that way?

User: Well, during breaks or group activities, I just stand aside and watch. I want to join in, but I feel like I'm not interesting enough, and I end up not saying anything.

Consultant: It sounds like you really want to connect with your classmates, but that anxiety holds you back. Can we explore what thoughts go through your mind when you're in those situations?

User: I often think they won't want to talk to me or they might judge me. I feel like I'm not cool enough to fit in.

Consultant: Those thoughts you have seem to be pretty heavy. What kind of emotions do those thoughts bring up for you?

User: They make me feel embarrassed and unworthy, like I don’t belong there.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way with those thoughts. Let's see if we can challenge some of those beliefs. What evidence do you have that your classmates think negatively of you?

User: I guess I don't have any solid evidence. It’s just a fear in my mind.

Consultant: That's important to recognize, Jiani. It sounds like that fear might be clouding your view. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their thoughts?

User: I’d probably say that they shouldn't assume what others think and that they should just try to join in.

Consultant: Exactly! If a friend deserves compassion and encouragement, so do you. Let's try to apply that perspective to your own situation. Would you be open to some small steps to help you connect with your classmates?

User: I think I would be open to that. What do you have in mind?

Consultant: How about setting a goal to start small conversations with one classmate at a time? Maybe you could begin with a simple greeting or compliment. What do you think?

User: That sounds manageable. I can give it a try, but I still worry about what to say.

Consultant: It's great that you're willing to try. Remember, the goal is just to start the conversation. You could also ask about schoolwork or share something lighthearted. We can brainstorm some topics together.

User: That's a good idea! I think I could ask them about their weekend plans or something like that.

Consultant: Perfect! Asking about weekend plans is a simple yet effective way to engage in conversation. Just think of it as a way to get to know someone better. How do you feel about trying that this week?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also excited. I really hope it goes well.

Consultant: It's natural to feel nervous, but remember, it’s a learning experience. Plus, each small effort helps build your confidence. After you try it, we can talk about how it went. Does that sound good? 

User: Yes, I’ll do my best to talk to someone.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Let’s not forget to celebrate each step you take, no matter how small it seems. How do you usually reward yourself when you achieve something?

User: I usually listen to music or watch my favorite shows to treat myself.

Consultant: Great! Use those activities as rewards after you make an effort to connect with classmates. It’ll give you something to look forward to. 

User: That sounds motivating! I hope this helps me feel less anxious about socializing. 

Consultant: I believe it will, Jiani. Each step counts, and sometimes progress is gradual. As we continue to work together, we can explore ways to manage those anxious feelings about academics too. 

User: Yes, I do feel a lot of pressure about my studies lately. It’s been hard to focus with everything going on.

Consultant: Pressure in academics can certainly add to your anxiety about social interactions. What specific aspects of your studies are causing you the most concern right now?

User: I worry about my grades and keeping up with assignments. It feels overwhelming.

Consultant: It sounds like the expectations you have for yourself may be contributing to that stress. Have you considered how you can break your study tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces?

User: I haven’t really thought about that. I usually just try to tackle everything at once.

Consultant: That’s a common approach, but it can lead to feeling overwhelmed. We can create a study schedule together that breaks your tasks down into smaller goals. How does that sound?

User: That sounds helpful! I think having a plan would make things less stressful.

Consultant: I'm glad you think so! A structured plan can help you see progress and feel a sense of control over your study routine. We can also discuss some relaxation techniques to try when anxiety creeps in during study time.

User: Yes, I would love that! I need help finding ways to calm down when I start feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: Absolutely! Things like deep breathing exercises or short breaks during studying can be very helpful. We can practice one together if you’d like!

User: I’d appreciate that. It sounds like a good way to keep my anxiety in check.

Consultant: Let's try a simple deep breathing exercise. Inhale for a count of four, hold for four, and exhale for four. Ready? 

User: Okay, I’m ready.

Consultant: Breathe in deeply... one, two, three, four. Hold... one, two, three, four. And now exhale slowly... one, two, three, four. How did that feel?

User: That felt really calming. I think I could use this when I’m feeling anxious.

Consultant: I'm glad it helped! Practicing this regularly can make it easier to use during stressful moments. Remember, you’re taking positive steps toward improving both your social interactions and managing your academic stress.

User: Thank you! I feel a little more confident about moving forward. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Jiani. It’s great to see your willingness to work through these challenges. Let’s keep building on that in our future sessions. 

User: Yes, I look forward to it!

Consultant: Hi, Jia Ni! I'm glad you're here today. How have you been feeling recently, especially with school pressures on the rise?

User: Hi. I've been pretty stressed out with school lately, especially since I'm in the first year of high school. I find it hard to focus on my studies and I can't seem to sleep well at night.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of pressure with your schoolwork, and that it's starting to affect your sleep and focus. Can you share a bit more about what specifically is causing you anxiety about your studies?

User: I worry that I won't do well in my exams, and it feels like there's so much to learn in such a short time. It's overwhelming, and I often find myself staring at my books without making any progress.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, Jia Ni. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed when there’s so much to cover. Let’s break this down a bit. What do you think happens in your mind when you start feeling anxious about your studies?

User: I keep thinking that if I don’t do well, I’ll disappoint my mom and myself. I can't help but feel that I’m not good enough, and that thought just keeps looping in my head.

Consultant: It seems like those thoughts about disappointment are really weighing on you. Have you noticed any physical sensations or emotions that come along with those thoughts?

User: Yeah, I feel tight in my chest and sometimes I get really fidgety. It's like my body is restless while my mind is racing.

Consultant: That sounds uncomfortable. It’s important to recognize how those thoughts and feelings are affecting your body, too. Let’s work together on identifying these automatic thoughts and see if we can find a way to challenge them. Can you recall a recent time when those anxious thoughts peaked?

User: Yes, just last week I had a big assignment due. I spent the whole night worrying about whether I would get a bad grade and didn’t sleep at all. I ended up feeling awful the next day.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that moment, Jia Ni. It sounds like that experience was particularly tough. What thoughts were running through your mind during the night when you were worried?

User: I kept thinking that if I didn’t get a good grade, everyone would think I was a failure. I also thought it would ruin my chances of getting into a good university someday.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy and stressful. Let’s try to unpack them. How strong do you think the evidence is for those beliefs? Is there any possibility that things might not turn out as negatively as you imagine?

User: I guess I’ve done okay in the past, and my teachers have reassured me. But when I’m anxious, it feels like I can't remember those positives.

Consultant: Exactly! It can be hard to recall positive experiences when anxiety takes over. What would you tell a friend if they were in your situation, feeling the same way?

User: I’d probably tell them to focus on what they can control and to remember that one assignment doesn’t define their worth.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective, Jia Ni. It’s so true that one assignment is just a small piece of the bigger picture. Let’s think about some practical steps you can take to manage your time and study effectively while reducing anxiety. What do you like to do when you plan your study sessions?

User: I usually just try to cram everything in at the last minute, but that doesn’t work well.

Consultant: Cramming can certainly add to your stress. Let’s explore creating a more structured study plan together. How about we break your workload into smaller, manageable tasks with specific goals? 

User: That sounds good! I think it might help me feel less overwhelmed.

Consultant: Great! Let’s set up a timeline for your assignments. We can also include some breaks and relaxation techniques. What activities do you enjoy doing that help you unwind?

User: I like listening to music and sometimes I draw to relax.

Consultant: Those are wonderful activities! We can integrate them into your study schedule as breaks to help refresh your mind. Also, how about trying some breathing exercises before bed to improve your sleep quality?

User: I’ve heard of breathing techniques but I’ve never really tried them. Do they actually help?

Consultant: Yes, they can! Breathing exercises help calm the mind and body, making it easier to fall asleep. Would you be open to trying a simple technique together?

User: Sure, I’d like to give it a try!

Consultant: Awesome! Let’s do a quick exercise together. Inhale deeply through your nose for four counts, hold for four counts, then exhale slowly through your mouth for four counts. Ready? 

User: Okay, I’ll try that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s do it a few times. How do you feel after trying it?

User: I feel a little calmer, actually. I think it’ll help me before I sleep.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, it’s about practice and consistency. As we wrap up, what’s one takeaway you’d like to focus on moving forward?

User: I’d like to work on my study schedule and remember to use breathing exercises when I feel anxious.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. You’re already taking great steps toward managing your anxiety and improving your focus, Jia Ni. I believe you can do this! Remember, I’m here to support you whenever you need.

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful after our talk today.

Consultant: You’re welcome! It was great to talk with you. Keep practicing these strategies, and we’ll catch up next time. Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Jiani! Welcome to today's session. I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. I tried participating in that life skills course at school, and I found it quite interesting. It made me realize that I can actually learn new things.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive experience! It's great to hear that you're enjoying the life skills course. Can you tell me more about what you learned and how it made you feel?

User: I learned some basic cooking and budgeting skills. At first, I was nervous, but as I practiced, I actually started to feel accomplished. It was nice to feel like I was good at something for a change.

Consultant: Feeling accomplished is an important step, Jiani! It sounds like engaging in these activities is boosting your confidence. What kind of impact do you think this newfound accomplishment has on your self-worth?

User: I think it helps me feel like I'm capable of doing things, especially after feeling so lost after my parents' divorce. I just wish I could keep feeling like this.

Consultant: It's understandable to want to maintain those positive feelings, especially during challenging times. How do you feel about setting some specific goals to continue building on those skills you're learning?

User: That sounds good! I want to keep learning and improve my skills. Maybe I could set a goal each week? 

Consultant: Yes, setting weekly goals can be a wonderful strategy! How about we identify a few skills you’d like to focus on that could help you feel more capable and confident?

User: I think I want to improve my cooking because it’s practical. Also, learning how to manage my time better would help with school.

Consultant: Those are excellent choices! Cooking and time management are both very valuable skills. Let's start by setting one goal for each area. What would you specifically like to achieve in cooking this week?

User: I want to try making a simple dish I’ve never cooked before. Maybe something like pasta?

Consultant: Trying out a new dish sounds like a fantastic goal! How do you think you'll feel after successfully making that pasta?

User: I think I’ll feel really proud of myself. It would be nice to share it with my mom, too.

Consultant: Sharing your achievement with your mom can make it even more rewarding! Now, regarding time management, what goal could we set for that area this week?

User: I guess I need to plan my study time better. Maybe I could create a weekly study schedule?

Consultant: That’s a great idea! A study schedule can help you balance your academic responsibilities. How about setting aside specific times each day for studying and planning breaks as well?

User: Yes, I think I can do that. It will help me stay organized and not get overwhelmed.

Consultant: Perfect! By breaking it down, managing your time will likely feel much more manageable. Let's talk about how you'll evaluate your progress with these goals. How will you celebrate your achievements?

User: I could treat myself to something nice, maybe a movie night with friends if I complete my goals.

Consultant: Celebrating your successes is important! It helps reinforce positive experiences. How do you feel about checking in on your goals next week?

User: I think that would be good. I want to discuss how it went and what I learned from it.

Consultant: I’m looking forward to that! It sounds like you’re developing a plan that will help you feel more confident. How has talking about your goals today affected your mood?

User: I feel lighter now! It’s nice to talk about my plans instead of just all the worries. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! It’s important to focus on your potential. Remember, facing these little challenges week by week can greatly enhance your sense of self-worth. 

User: That makes sense. I’m more excited to start working on my goals now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! I’m proud of you for taking this step. Let’s continue to build on these skills together. How would you like to approach our next session?

User: I’d like to reflect on my progress and maybe find more skills I can work on.

Consultant: Absolutely, we can certainly do that. As you continue exploring and challenging yourself, you will likely gain even more confidence. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection.

User: Thanks for reminding me. I’ll keep that in mind as I move forward.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Jiani! Enjoy your week, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care!

User: Thank you! I will see you next week!
###################
Consultant: Hi, Jiani! It's great to see you again. I'm excited to hear about your recent experiences with the group activities. How have you been feeling since we last spoke?

User: Hi! I've actually been feeling a lot lighter and more open lately. Participating in the group activities really helped me connect with others, and it was nice to feel included. 

Consultant: That sounds wonderful, Jiani! It's great to hear that you've had positive interactions. Can you tell me more about one specific experience where you felt really connected or happy during these activities?

User: Well, during one of the team games, I worked closely with a few classmates. We had to solve a puzzle together, and I felt relaxed while interacting. We actually ended up laughing a lot, and I felt like I was part of the group.

Consultant: It sounds like that experience was really joyful for you. Sharing laughter and teamwork can create strong bonds. How did that make you feel about your social skills?

User: I noticed I was able to communicate better than before. I didn't feel as shy this time, and it made me believe I could engage with others more easily.

Consultant: That's a great realization! It sounds like you've made some progress in feeling more confident around your peers. What do you think helped you feel less shy during that activity?

User: I think just being in a fun environment and having a common goal with my classmates made it easier. I wasn't thinking too much about how others would see me.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight, Jiani! Being focused on the task can really ease social pressures. How do you feel about applying this mindset in other social situations in the future?

User: I definitely want to try that! I think if I can focus on the activity instead of worrying about myself, it might help me feel more comfortable.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on the task can be a helpful strategy. Are there any upcoming events or opportunities where you might be able to practice this new approach?

User: Yes, there's another group project coming up in school. I’m a bit nervous, but I really want to participate actively and not hold back.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel a little nervous, but it sounds like you are ready to embrace this challenge. How could you remind yourself of the confidence you gained from the last activity while you prepare for this new project?

User: Maybe I can visualize the last game and remember how much fun it was to work with others. That might give me motivation.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Visualization can be a powerful tool to reinforce positive feelings. What specific thoughts or affirmations can you tell yourself before you meet your group?

User: I could say something like, “I’m capable and I can share my ideas,” or remember that it’s okay to make mistakes.

Consultant: Those are very constructive affirmations! Reminding yourself of your capabilities is key. How do you think your family can support you as you take on these new social challenges?

User: I think having my mom encourage me would help. She always supports me, and it would be nice if she reminds me that I can do it.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful support system. It’s great to have someone who believes in you. How do you plan to communicate your need for encouragement to her?

User: I can just talk to her and express how I’m feeling. It might help her understand that I want to try harder socially.

Consultant: That's a good approach! Open communication can strengthen those bonds. Speaking of support, how have your feelings about your family changed since you started to open up socially?

User: I feel more comfortable talking to my mom and even my brother. I realize we can support each other, and it's nice to feel that connection.

Consultant: That's heartwarming to hear, Jiani! Feeling connected with your family can greatly influence your confidence. How do you want to maintain that connection while you continue working on your social skills?

User: Maybe we can have more family activities together. I think it would help us bond and give me a sense of security.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Finding ways to connect with your family can further enhance your sense of support. As we wrap up today, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I feel more confident in approaching social situations and I know I can lean on my family for support when I need it. 

Consultant: That’s a significant realization, Jiani! You’ve made great progress. Remember to apply these strategies and communicate with your family. I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes at our next session. 

User: Thank you! I’m excited to share my experiences next time.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep up the great work, and take care until we meet again!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Jiani! I’m really glad to see you today. How have you been since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better, actually. Talking to my mom helped a lot. I can sense her support and expectations for me, which feels reassuring.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It’s great that you felt that support. Can you tell me more about how that conversation with your mom impacted you?

User: Well, she expressed her belief in me and talked about how she wants to help me succeed. I felt like I had someone rooting for me, which I haven’t felt in a while.

Consultant: It sounds like that connection with your mom is really positive for you. How do you think you can maintain that support in your daily life?

User: I think I could talk to her more often about my feelings and ask for advice when I'm struggling, instead of keeping everything to myself.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan! Opening up to her can certainly strengthen that bond. How does thinking about this make you feel?

User: It makes me feel hopeful. Like I won't be alone in dealing with my challenges anymore.

Consultant: Hope is a powerful feeling. Let’s explore how you can create this open dialogue with your mom. What specific things do you think you can talk to her about?

User: I could share my worries about school and how I'm feeling overwhelmed with everything. 

Consultant: That's a great start. Sharing those worries can invite her to support you more. Have you thought about how you would begin that conversation?

User: I could just be honest with her and maybe start by saying that I've been feeling stressed lately with school.

Consultant: Honesty is a wonderful approach. What do you think you might feel when you express those thoughts to her?

User: I might feel nervous at first, but hopeful that she would understand and want to help me.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about sharing your feelings, but it sounds like you have faith in her understanding. How do you think you might cope with that nervousness when the moment comes?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that it's okay to be vulnerable and that she really wants to help me.

Consultant: That's an excellent strategy. Remembering her support can help ease your nerves. What are some small steps we can plan for you to take this week towards that conversation?

User: I could write down my feelings first. That way, I don't forget anything important when I talk to her.

Consultant: Writing your feelings can be very helpful! It will give you clarity. Besides writing, is there anything else you think could help you prepare?

User: Maybe practicing what I want to say out loud, so I feel more confident.

Consultant: Practicing is a fantastic idea! It can help make the conversation feel more manageable. How do you feel about having those small steps in place?

User: I feel really good about it! It seems doable, and I like the idea of having a plan.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Having a plan can increase your confidence. As you move forward, how important do you think it is to acknowledge your feelings even when they’re difficult?

User: I think it’s very important. Ignoring them just makes me feel worse, but talking about them feels freeing.

Consultant: Absolutely! Acknowledging your feelings is a key part of your emotional journey. In moments of doubt, how do you think your newfound support from your mom can help you?

User: I guess I’ll remember that I’m not facing things alone and that I can rely on her for encouragement.

Consultant: That's a great perspective. Having that reliable support can significantly boost your resilience. As we wrap up today, what’s one thing you want to focus on most before our next session?

User: I want to make sure I have that conversation with my mom and be open about how I'm feeling.

Consultant: That's a wonderful goal! Open communication can pave the way for deeper connections. I'm proud of you for focusing on this. You’re making meaningful progress. 

User: Thank you! I feel more motivated now that I have a clear plan and support.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that, Jiani! Remember, it’s a process, and you’re doing great. I’m here to support you whenever you need. 

User: Thank you for your help today! I really appreciate it.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I look forward to hearing how your conversation goes next time. Take care, and see you soon!
