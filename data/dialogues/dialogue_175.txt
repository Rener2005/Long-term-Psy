Consultant: Hello, Li Hui! I'm glad to see you today. It sounds like you've been going through a lot lately. Can you share your feelings and what has been on your mind recently?

User: Hi. Yeah, I feel really lost and unsure of myself. School is tough now, and my parents have really high expectations for my grades. It feels like no matter how hard I try, it's never enough.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly difficult. Feeling that pressure can be overwhelming, especially when you feel like you're not meeting expectations. What specific experiences have contributed to this feeling of not being enough?

User: Well, since moving to high school, the feedback I've received from teachers hasn't been great. I used to feel confident in middle school, but now I'm starting to doubt my abilities, and it’s affecting my self-esteem.

Consultant: I can see how that shift in feedback would really shake your confidence. It’s natural to feel discouraged when you don’t receive the validation you used to. How does this affect your daily life and interactions at school?

User: I often feel out of place in class, like I don’t fit in. I don’t really talk to my classmates because I feel like they’re all ahead of me. Plus, I often escape into video games and social media to forget about it.

Consultant: It sounds like video games and social media have become a way for you to cope with those feelings of isolation and pressure. How does using your phone make you feel when you’re struggling with these thoughts?

User: When I play games or scroll through social media, it helps me forget everything for a while, but afterwards, I feel even more isolated and guilty for not studying.

Consultant: That cycle of using your phone to escape, then feeling guilty afterwards is quite common. It seems like there is a conflict between wanting to cope with your feelings and the expectations you have for yourself. Have you noticed any patterns in how often you use your phone during the day?

User: Yeah, I’ve noticed I spend hours on my phone, especially when I should be doing homework. It’s like I can’t start studying without playing first, and it makes everything worse.

Consultant: Recognizing that pattern is an important first step. What do you think triggers your desire to dive into your phone when it’s time to study?

User: I guess it’s mostly stress. I feel anxious about the work I have to do, and the games are just a quick escape from that anxiety. It's like a temporary relief.

Consultant: It’s understandable to seek relief from stress, but it sounds like it's leading to more anxiety in the long run. Have you thought about ways to manage that anxiety without relying on your phone so much?

User: Not really. I just feel overwhelmed and don’t know where to start.

Consultant: That’s okay, Li Hui. It can be tough to see other options when you’re feeling this way. What if we try to brainstorm a small step you could take next time you feel the urge to reach for your phone? Perhaps a brief walk or some deep breathing exercises?

User: I suppose I could try taking a short walk. It might help clear my head a bit instead of just jumping into games.

Consultant: That sounds like a great first step! It could offer a moment of reset instead of diving straight into your phone. How do you think you would feel after trying that?

User: I think it could help me feel a bit calmer before I tackle my homework. It definitely seems better than just going straight to my phone.

Consultant: Fantastic! It’s all about creating healthier habits, and it sounds like you're already thinking ahead. How do you feel about discussing this with your parents? Having their support might help you feel less isolated in your struggles.

User: I’m not sure how they’d react. They usually just push me to study harder without really listening to how I feel.

Consultant: That’s tough, and it’s important to feel heard. How about we explore some ways to communicate your feelings to them that might make them more receptive to your perspective?

User: I’d like that, but I’m not sure how to say it without them getting upset.

Consultant: We could think about framing it positively. Perhaps you could express that you appreciate their support but are going through a challenging time in adjusting to high school. Would that feel manageable for you?

User: Yeah, that sounds better. I could talk to them about how I’m feeling and how I need their support to balance things out.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach, Li Hui. It’s about building a conversation, aiming for understanding. Remember to be clear about what support looks like for you. Let's check in on how this conversation goes next time. 

User: I will try that. Thanks for helping me think it through. It makes me feel a bit more hopeful.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s important to feel hopeful as you work through these challenges. Let’s keep building on this progress. Looking forward to our next session and hearing more about how things go with your parents.

User: Thank you! I appreciate it. 

Consultant: You're welcome, Li Hui! Remember, it's okay to take things one step at a time. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Li Hui! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially after the argument with your parents?

User: Hi. I still feel pretty lost and alone. The fight about my phone usage really got to me. I have this mix of wanting to connect with my parents and feeling angry about how they treat me.

Consultant: It makes sense that you're feeling this way. The conflict with your parents must be quite overwhelming for you. Can you tell me more about what you hoped to achieve in your communication with them during that argument?

User: I just wanted them to understand how I feel about everything. I feel like they only see my phone use and not really me. I want to explain why I use it so much but it just turns into a big fight.

Consultant: I hear you. It sounds like you're seeking understanding from your parents but end up feeling misunderstood. What do you think makes it difficult for them to see your perspective?

User: Maybe they think I’m just wasting my time or being irresponsible. They always talk about my grades and how they want me to succeed. But I feel like they don’t get that the phone is my way to relax or connect with friends.

Consultant: That’s an important point. So, you feel that your parents might be focusing solely on your academic performance, which makes you feel like they don’t appreciate how you use your phone to unwind and connect socially. Have you tried explaining this to them in any specific way?

User: I tried, but the moment I bring up my feelings, they just get frustrated and interrupt me. It makes me feel even more anxious about talking to them.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling really anxious when trying to communicate with them. What if we explored some ways to express your feelings to your parents that might help reduce that anxiety?

User: I guess I could try writing them a letter or something. But what if they still just see it as an excuse for my phone usage?

Consultant: Writing a letter could be a good way to express your thoughts without the immediate pressure of a conversation. You could also frame it to show that you want to improve your relationship. How would you feel about including your understanding of their concerns about your phone use in that letter?

User: That might work. I mean, I do understand their point of view, but I just want them to understand mine too.

Consultant: Absolutely! Acknowledging their concerns while sharing your perspective could open up a better dialogue. What would you say if you were to acknowledge their feelings while expressing yours?

User: I could say something like, "I realize you want me to do well in school, and I appreciate that. I just also need some time to relax and connect with my friends."

Consultant: That sounds like a compassionate approach. It shows that you value their concerns, which might help them be more receptive to understanding your viewpoint. How confident do you feel about taking this step?

User: I feel a bit nervous about it, but it also makes me hopeful. It's just that I worry they’ll still focus on my phone and not my feelings.

Consultant: That's a valid concern. It's common to feel apprehensive about such conversations. What if we role-play this scenario together to practice how you might approach your parents? This could help build your confidence.

User: That sounds like a good idea. I’d like to try that.

Consultant: Great! Let's imagine you're sitting with them. You can start by saying what you prepared about their concerns and then share your feelings. Would you like to start?

User: Okay, um... "Mom, Dad, can we talk? I know you both want me to do well in school, and I really appreciate that." 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! How does it feel to say that?

User: A bit scary, but also kind of good. I hope they’ll listen. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel scared, but this is a brave step you're taking. Now, what would you say next to share your feelings?

User: “I also need some time to relax and connect with my friends, and I hope you can understand that.” 

Consultant: That’s a significant addition. You’re expressing your needs while recognizing theirs. If you feel they respond negatively, what could you say to keep the conversation on track?

User: Maybe I could just remind them that I'm trying to balance both school and my social life?

Consultant: That sounds like a suitable strategy to keep the lines of communication open. How are you feeling about the prospect of having this conversation after practicing it with me? 

User: I feel a bit more prepared now. I still worry, but at least I know what to say.

Consultant: It’s great to hear that you feel more prepared! Just remember to take it one step at a time. Also, before we end today, is there anything else you’d like to discuss related to your feelings or any other strategies you might find helpful?

User: I think I’d like to know how to manage my anxiety when I’m alone. Sometimes I feel like I can't escape the tension at home.

Consultant: That’s an important point, and I want to help you with that. How about we explore some practical techniques you can use when you feel anxious? We could try mindfulness exercises together. How do you feel about that?

User: I think that could really help. I sometimes just get lost in my thoughts and don’t know how to come back.

Consultant: Mindfulness could provide you with some relief. It’s a great way to stay present and reduce anxiety. We can start with simple breathing exercises, which can help ground you during those times. Would you like to learn more about it now or in our next session?

User: Let’s do it now!

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s begin by finding a comfortable position. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and we’ll take a few deep breaths together. Focus on inhaling deeply through your nose and exhaling slowly through your mouth... 

User: Okay, I’m ready.

Consultant: You're doing great! Just let your breath settle into a natural rhythm. With each inhale, imagine filling your body with calmness... and with each exhale, release any tension or worry. 

(As the session continues, the consultant will guide Li Hui through breathing exercises and mindfulness techniques, helping him feel a little more centered.)

Consultant: Hello, Li Hui! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a bit better about reducing my phone usage. I’ve started playing basketball with some classmates, which is nice. But I still worry about my ability to make friends and fit into the group.

Consultant: That’s great to hear you’re working on reducing your phone time and trying basketball! It sounds like you're taking positive steps. Could you share more about what specifically worries you about fitting in with the group?

User: I guess I just feel a bit out of place sometimes. I worry that I won't know what to say or how to join the conversations.

Consultant: That feeling of being out of place is quite common, especially in new social situations. What kind of thoughts go through your mind when you’ve been with your classmates while playing basketball?

User: I often think that they might not like me or that I’ll embarrass myself somehow. It makes me anxious, and then I just stay quiet.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite powerful for you, and they might be holding you back from engaging with others. Let's explore that a bit. How much evidence do you have that your classmates don't like you?

User: I have no actual proof, but sometimes I see them laughing together, and it makes me feel like they can't include me in their fun.

Consultant: I understand that can be tough to see. It might help to remind yourself that laughter doesn't necessarily mean exclusion. If you were to consider this from a different perspective, what might you tell a friend who felt similarly?

User: I would probably tell them that it's okay not to fit in right away and that they should just be themselves.

Consultant: Exactly! Being yourself is so important. It’s a great step to take. Would you feel comfortable trying to share a little bit about yourself in those situations, perhaps starting with a small comment during practice?

User: I think I could try to share a bit about my interests, like my passion for gaming or how I’m trying to enjoy basketball. But I'm not sure how they'll react.

Consultant: That's a good start! Sharing your interests can spark conversation and help others relate to you. Remember, they might be interested in your experience with gaming too. How do you feel about setting a small goal for yourself this week to share something in your next basketball practice?

User: I think I can do that. Just thinking about it makes me a little nervous, though.

Consultant: It's totally normal to feel nervous when trying something new! However, remember that taking small steps can help reduce that anxiety. What if we planned it out? Maybe you could think of one particular story or experience you'd like to share?

User: Okay, I could talk about that time I won in a tournament. I remember being really passionate while playing, and it would be nice to share that.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic story! Sharing that experience not only reflects your passion but might also resonate with others. How do you feel about this plan? 

User: I feel relieved actually, thinking of discussing something I love makes it seem less scary.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Focusing on your passions can be a great way to build connections. Remember, it's a journey, and every step, no matter how small, counts. Is there anything else about this situation that’s been on your mind?

User: Well, I still worry a bit about falling back into old habits with my phone usage since I sometimes feel bored or lonely.

Consultant: It's okay to have those concerns. Redirecting habits takes time. Could we brainstorm some activities or alternatives for when you feel those urges to reach for your phone?

User: Sure! I could read more or practice basketball. Also, maybe I can join a gaming group online.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent alternatives! Engaging with your hobbies can provide a great balance. How do you feel about committing to those activities this week?

User: I feel motivated about this! I think I’ll try to make time for those things instead of just reaching for my phone.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It seems like you’re ready to take action. How about we check in next time about how it went with sharing your story and reducing phone usage?

User: Yes, that sounds good. I definitely want to talk about it again!

Consultant: Wonderful! I’m looking forward to hearing all about it. Remember, you’re on the right path, and it's okay to go at your own pace. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?

User: No, I think that cover everything for now. Thanks for the support!

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li Hui! I’m here for you, and I’m excited to hear about your progress. Have a great week ahead, and take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Li Hui! I'm really glad you're here today. I see that you've been feeling happy about your new friendships, but you still have some concerns about your phone usage. Let's start by exploring how you feel about these changes and what specific goals you have in mind.

User: Hi! Yes, I'm really excited about my new friends from basketball. It's like I've finally found my place at school. But at the same time, I worry that I'll slip back into spending too much time on my phone. It’s tough to balance everything.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really enjoying your social life, which is great! And it's completely understandable to have concerns about your phone usage. What specific challenges do you feel you're facing when it comes to managing your phone habits?

User: I think when I'm bored or stressed, I just instinctively reach for my phone. I know I should focus on my studies or hang out with friends, but it feels much easier to just scroll through my social media or play games.

Consultant: That's a common struggle. Reaching for your phone can seem like a quick way to cope with boredom or stress. Let’s think about how you can create a plan that makes it easier for you to choose other activities instead. Have you considered setting specific times for phone use or finding alternatives to fill that time?

User: I haven’t really made a plan yet. I just think about it and feel guilty when I waste time. Maybe I could try setting time limits or something like that? 

Consultant: Setting time limits is a great idea! It gives you a structure to follow. You might also want to identify some enjoyable activities to do during those times instead of reaching for your phone. What are some activities you really enjoy that you could focus on more?

User: I love playing basketball and hanging out with my friends. I also used to enjoy drawing but haven't done that in a while. 

Consultant: Those are wonderful activities to incorporate more into your life! How about we create a plan that includes basketball and drawing as alternatives to phone use? For example, you could set specific times for these activities each week. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I think having specific times for basketball and drawing would help me a lot. Plus, spending more time with friends would be nice.

Consultant: Absolutely! And it will also strengthen those friendships. Let’s break this down further. How many times a week do you think you could realistically play basketball or draw, and when might you want to do those activities?

User: Maybe I could play basketball twice a week—like on Wednesdays and Saturdays. And I could try to draw on Sundays for an hour or so. 

Consultant: That sounds very achievable! It looks like you’re setting those positive goals for yourself. How do you think you will feel after having dedicated time for those activities instead of using your phone?

User: I think I’d feel more productive and maybe even happier. Plus, I wouldn’t feel guilty about using my phone so much. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic insight! Focusing on productive activities can certainly bring more fulfillment and reduce guilt. Now, let's discuss how you can reinforce these new habits and maintain a balance going forward. What strategies do you think might help you stick to your plan?

User: I could tell my friends about my plan. Maybe they can help keep me accountable. Also, setting reminders on my phone for my drawing time could work too.

Consultant: Enlisting the support of your friends is an excellent strategy! They can encourage you and join you in activities as well. Setting reminders is also a practical way to stay on track. How about we check in on your progress next time? 

User: That sounds good! I’m already looking forward to it.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You’re making some positive strides today, and I believe you’ll find success with your new plan. Remember, it’s perfectly normal to face challenges along the way, so be kind to yourself through this process. 

User: Thank you! I feel more motivated and clear about what I need to do.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Li Hui! It’s been great working with you today. I believe you’re on the right path to creating a balanced lifestyle. Before we finish for today, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any final thoughts?

User: No, I think I’m good. I really appreciate your help!

Consultant: It’s been my pleasure! Take care of yourself, and I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Goodbye for now!

User: Bye! Looking forward to our next meeting!
###################
Consultant: Hello Li Hui! I'm glad to see you today. Last time we talked about your feelings and the schedule you created to help reduce your dependency on your phone. How have you been since then?

User: Hi! I've felt a bit more stable emotionally. I’ve been following my schedule, and it's been somewhat helpful. However, I still can’t shake off the worry about my grades.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you’re following your schedule and feeling more stable. Let’s explore your worries about your grades deeper—what exactly about them concerns you the most?

User: I feel like my parents expect a lot from me. I want to meet their expectations, but sometimes I just get so overwhelmed by everything.

Consultant: I can understand how heavy those expectations can feel. It seems that there’s pressure from both your parents and yourself. What would it look like for you to balance those expectations with your own goals for your studies?

User: I guess I would feel less stressed if I had clear goals to work towards. Right now, I’m just studying without a clear direction, which makes everything feel harder.

Consultant: That makes sense. Creating clear, realistic goals can definitely help guide your studying and relieve some pressure. Have you thought about specific areas in your studies that you're interested in or enjoy more than others?

User: I enjoy mathematics and physics a lot, but I don't think I'm good enough at them. 

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you have interests in mathematics and physics. Let's focus on setting some SMART goals regarding these subjects. SMART means specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. How about we start with a specific goal for your math studies? 

User: Sure! Maybe I could aim to finish a certain number of chapters per week in math.

Consultant: That’s a great start! What specific number of chapters do you think is achievable each week that would help you feel accomplished?

User: I think aiming for two chapters a week sounds realistic.

Consultant: Two chapters a week is a solid and achievable goal. How about physics? Is there a similar structure you’d like to set for that subject as well?

User: Yes, I’d like to aim for two physics chapters a week as well.

Consultant: Excellent! Now you have two clear, achievable goals for math and physics each week. How do you think you will feel once you start following through with these goals?

User: I think I’ll feel more in control of my studies and less anxious about my grades.

Consultant: That sounds very positive! Feeling more in control can significantly reduce anxiety. Let's also think about a rewarding strategy. What could you do for yourself as a reward for achieving these goals each week?

User: Maybe I could allow myself some extra time to relax and play video games if I meet my study goals.

Consultant: That’s a good idea! Balancing study with relaxation is important. So, you would reward yourself with some gaming time if you complete your study goals each week. How does that sound to you?

User: It sounds fair and motivating!

Consultant: Wonderful! Now, it’s essential to keep track of your progress. How will you monitor your achievements each week?

User: I could keep a checklist on my schedule for the chapters I’ve completed.

Consultant: Perfect! A checklist is a great way to visualize your progress. Remember, it's also about celebrating the small wins. How do you feel about that?

User: I think I need to remind myself to celebrate those moments instead of just focusing on what’s next.

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight, Li Hui. Acknowledging your progress will help maintain your motivation. Is there anything else regarding your studies that you'd like to discuss today?

User: I think we’ve covered most of the things I wanted to address.

Consultant: Great! Before we wrap up, let’s summarize what we’ve talked about today. You’ve set clear study goals, planned rewards, and established a method for tracking your achievements. How do you feel about this plan overall?

User: I feel hopeful! It seems manageable, and I’m excited to get started.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that you feel hopeful! It’s a significant step forward. Remember, I’m here to support you if you need further guidance. If challenges arise, we can always discuss how to adjust your goals or strategies.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Li Hui! I believe you’re on the right path. Let’s plan to meet again next time to review your progress and adjust as needed. You’ve got this!

User: I will! See you next time.

Consultant: Looking forward to it! Take care, Li Hui. Goodbye for now.
