Consultant: Hello, Nono! I'm glad you joined today’s session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi. Not so great, to be honest. I feel really embarrassed about what happened in class. Everyone seems to be talking about me, and it makes me feel so alone.

Consultant: I can see that this situation has made you feel quite isolated and embarrassed, which is understandable. Let's talk about how you’re feeling. Can you tell me more about what you've experienced since then?

User: Well, it feels like no one wants to play with me anymore. I feel like I’m a bad person for stealing, and I’m scared my mom will be even more upset with me. 

Consultant: It's really tough to feel like you're being judged and not accepted by your classmates. You mentioned you're scared your mom will be even more upset. Can you tell me about your relationship with her?

User: I don’t think she likes me as much as she likes my little brother. She seems to always be busy with him, and I sometimes feel ignored. It makes me want her attention even more, but then I feel guilty for stealing.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling quite neglected and that you’re trying to compete for attention. Can we explore what thoughts go through your mind when you feel this way about your brother and your mom?

User: I just keep thinking that if I do something wrong, maybe she’ll notice me more. It’s like, if I get in trouble, at least she’ll pay attention to me. But then I regret it afterward.

Consultant: I hear you saying that in a way, you're using trouble as a way to get attention. That’s a really hard cycle to be in. Can we think about how this makes you feel right after your actions? 

User: It makes me feel awful! I feel guilty and ashamed. I hate myself for doing it, but I just... I don’t know how to get her love.

Consultant: It's clear that you're in a lot of emotional pain right now. Let’s take a moment to identify those feelings. You mentioned guilt and shame—are there specific situations where you feel these emotions most strongly?

User: I feel it a lot in class when everyone looks at me. And when I get home, I’m scared to face my mom. I just want to disappear.

Consultant: That sounds very distressing. You’re feeling rejected and it seems like you want to escape those feelings. Let’s think about what you can do instead of avoiding your mom. Have you ever tried talking to her about how you feel?

User: No, I can’t talk to her about this. I’m afraid she’ll get mad or think I’m a bad daughter. 

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. It can be really challenging to open up to someone who you’re afraid might react negatively. What if we think about how you could express your feelings in a way that doesn't feel too scary?

User: Maybe I could write her a letter? But I’m still scared she won’t understand. 

Consultant: Writing a letter could be a wonderful idea! It gives you a chance to express yourself without worrying about her immediate reaction. What do you think you would want to say in that letter?

User: I want to tell her that I feel sad and that I miss her. I don’t want her to think I’m a bad kid. 

Consultant: That sounds like a heartfelt way to share your feelings! How do you think she might respond if she reads your letter and understands your feelings?

User: I hope she would feel sorry for me and maybe talk to me more. I just want us to be close again. 

Consultant: Wanting to connect with her is such a valid feeling. If she responds positively, how would that change your feelings about yourself?

User: I guess I would feel a little better. Maybe not so alone. 

Consultant: That’s a hopeful thought! You deserve to feel understood and connected. Now, let’s focus on your feelings of shame—what steps do you feel you could take to address that shame when you think about your actions?

User: I could try to remember why I did it and maybe tell myself it’s okay to make mistakes. 

Consultant: That’s a great insight, Nono. Recognizing that everyone makes mistakes can help lessen the weight of that shame. How would it feel to remind yourself of that when you think about what happened? 

User: It might help a bit... I just don’t want to steal again, but I don’t know how to stop.

Consultant: It’s positive that you don’t want to continue that behavior. Let’s brainstorm some alternatives to stealing when you feel the urge. What might be a healthier way to seek attention or express your feelings?

User: I could ask to talk to someone instead of acting out. Like, maybe ask my mom to play a game with me? 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Asking for attention in a positive way can help build your relationship with your mom. What steps can you take to start those conversations with her?

User: I can practice what I want to say and maybe even pick a time when she’s not busy with my brother.

Consultant: Practicing what to say sounds like a helpful plan! Finding the right moment is also important. How do you feel about making that plan for this week?

User: I guess I can try. I’m still nervous about it, but I want to feel better.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about these changes. Just taking that first step is really brave, and remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. How would you like to keep track of how you're feeling after you talk to your mom?

User: I could maybe keep a little diary about what we talked about and how I felt after. 

Consultant: Keeping a diary is a wonderful way to reflect on your feelings and experiences. It can help reinforce your progress and serve as a reminder of those positive moments. As we start wrapping up today’s session, what’s one key takeaway you want to focus on moving forward?

User: I want to remember that it’s okay to make mistakes and to try talking to my mom. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway, Nono. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey, and I’m here to support you. Let’s talk again soon and see how your plan with your mom goes. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. Thank you for listening and helping me today. 

Consultant: Thank you for sharing your feelings and being so open today. I'm really proud of you for taking these steps. Until next time, take care!

Consultant: Hello Nono! I'm glad to see you today. I want to create a safe space for you to share what's been on your mind lately. Can you tell me how you've been feeling?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious and frustrated. My mom is stricter with me since she found out I've been taking things from my classmates. I feel like I'm always in trouble, and it makes me so upset.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by your mom's reactions, and that it’s affecting your mood. Can you share a bit more about your relationship with your mom? What do you feel when you think about her?

User: I feel like she doesn’t really care about me anymore since my brother was born. She seems to prefer him and I'm always the one getting in trouble. It really hurts.

Consultant: I can see how that would be really painful for you. It’s normal to feel neglected when you perceive a shift in attention. How do you think this has influenced the way you interact with her?

User: I think I try to avoid her because I don’t want to get yelled at. But then, I feel alone and upset.

Consultant: That makes sense. Avoiding her might feel safer in the moment, but it sounds like it just adds to your feelings of loneliness. Have you noticed any specific thoughts that come to your mind when you think about your mom or your relationships at home?

User: I often think that she must love my brother more than me. I feel like I can’t do anything right, and that makes me want to act out. 

Consultant: Those thoughts are really heavy. Let’s try to break them down a bit. What evidence do you have that your mom loves your brother more? Are there things she does that might show she cares about you as well?

User: She says she loves me, but it's mostly when she's not too busy with him. Otherwise, she just seems so frustrated with me. 

Consultant: It sounds like her actions can overshadow her words, which can be confusing. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their mom's feelings?

User: I would probably tell them that maybe their mom is just really busy and maybe still loves them, even if it doesn’t feel like it. 

Consultant: That’s a helpful perspective. Sometimes, our own view can be influenced by our emotions. What do you think might happen if you started to see your mother's busy-ness as something separate from her feelings for you?

User: I guess I could try to understand that she might just be overwhelmed. I think that might help me feel better.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Understanding her situation can help relieve some of your burden. What could be some small steps to improve your communication with her, given how you feel?

User: Maybe I could try talking to her when she's not busy, like when we're having dinner. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Setting a special time to connect may open up more positive interactions. What’s something specific you would like to express to her during that conversation?

User: I think I want to tell her that I miss her and sometimes feel ignored. I want to know how she feels about me.

Consultant: That’s a very brave step! Sharing your feelings can create space for her to respond and reassure you. How do you think you might feel after expressing those thoughts?

User: I think I’d feel relieved, even if it’s a little scary. 

Consultant: Absolutely! It takes courage to share your feelings, and it can lead to a better understanding. Remember, it’s okay to be nervous about this. What can you do to cope with that nervousness before your chat with her?

User: I could take deep breaths and remind myself that this is important for us. 

Consultant: That’s a good strategy! Focusing on your breathing can help calm your nerves. Is there anything else you’d like to work on today related to your feelings about your actions at school?

User: Yes, I feel really ashamed about taking things from my classmates. I don’t know why I do it, but I can’t help myself.

Consultant: Feeling shame can be overwhelming, and it’s a common response in situations like this. What thoughts come to your mind when you think about your actions?

User: I think I’m a bad person for stealing, and that makes me feel even worse.

Consultant: It’s important to be kind to yourself. We all make mistakes. Can you think of any reasons or feelings that could be driving you to take things that don’t belong to you?

User: Maybe I just want attention or to feel special, like I matter. 

Consultant: Seeking attention is a natural desire, especially when you’re feeling ignored. What are some positive ways you could seek that attention or affirmation without resorting to stealing?

User: I could try asking for help with my schoolwork or join more activities at school.

Consultant: Those are fantastic ideas! Engaging in activities that bring you joy can help you connect with your peers positively. How do you feel about trying that out?

User: I feel hopeful that it might work. 

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It sounds like you’re open to new possibilities. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s think about the steps we’ve discussed. What will you focus on first when we meet again?

User: I want to try talking to my mom and maybe join a club at school. 

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful goals! I look forward to hearing how those conversations go. Remember, you’re taking important steps towards understanding and improving your relationships. 

User: Thank you! I feel a bit better having shared this today. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to hear that. Take care, Nono, and see you next time.

Consultant: Hello, Nuo Nuo! It's great to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better at school. I'm trying to follow the behavior rules, and I even joined a few activities. But I still feel like my mom doesn't notice me.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that you're working on following the behavior rules and participating in activities. It must be tough feeling like your mom doesn't notice you. Can you tell me more about how that makes you feel?

User: It makes me feel kind of sad and like I'm not important. I see her spending much time with my little brother, and I wish she would pay more attention to me.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging, Nuo Nuo. Feeling overlooked can be very painful, especially when you’re trying your best. Have you thought of any ways to talk to your mom about how you're feeling?

User: I don’t know… I’m scared she might get angry or not listen to me. I just feel like I'm always in the way.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel scared about sharing your feelings, especially if you worry about causing any conflict. What if we think about some gentle ways to share your thoughts with her? Maybe expressing that you miss her attention?

User: That sounds okay, but I’m still nervous. What if she doesn't understand?

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about that. Sometimes, it helps to start by sharing a positive memory with her, like a time you felt close. Then, you could express how you miss those moments. How does that sound?

User: I think that could work. I could tell her about our last family trip and how fun it was to spend time together.

Consultant: That's a wonderful idea! It sets a nice tone for the conversation. When do you think would be a good time to bring this up with her?

User: Maybe during dinner when we’re all together? That feels like a good time to talk.

Consultant: Dinner sounds like a perfect opportunity! It’s relaxed and everyone is together. How do you feel about approaching it then?

User: I feel a bit better about it. I’ll try to remember what you said about starting with a happy memory.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, sharing your feelings is a sign of strength, and it could bring you closer to your mom. Speaking of positive actions, have you found any activities at school that you enjoy?

User: Yes! I joined the art club, and I really like it. I feel happy when I’m painting.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Art is a wonderful way to express yourself. Have you had a chance to share your artwork with anyone at school?

User: Not really. I’m kind of shy about it.

Consultant: Shyness is very common, especially when sharing something personal. What if you started by showing your artwork to a classmate you feel comfortable with? It might be a nice way to connect with them.

User: I guess I could do that. Maybe I’ll show it to my friend during art club.

Consultant: I think that’s a great idea! Sharing your creativity can help you build friendships. If you do this, how do you think it might affect your confidence?

User: Maybe I would feel more confident if they liked it. I hope they do.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful outlook! Keep in mind that everyone has different tastes, and the important part is that you’re expressing yourself. How do you feel about having this conversation with your friend?

User: I feel a bit excited but still nervous.

Consultant: Excitement mixed with nerves is completely normal! It shows that you care about sharing with them. Perhaps you could practice what you want to say before the club meeting. How does that sound?

User: That could help. I think I’ll practice what I want to say.

Consultant: Great plan, Nuo Nuo! Practicing can give you more confidence. Now, going back to your mom—if the conversation goes well, what positive changes do you hope for in your relationship?

User: I hope she notices me more and we can spend time together. I just want to feel closer.

Consultant: That's a beautiful hope, Nuo Nuo. Building that connection can take time, but it sounds like you're on the right track. Let’s keep working on these connections at school and home. When we meet again, we can talk about how everything went. 

User: Yes, I would like that! I want to share my progress next time.

Consultant: Perfect! I’m looking forward to hearing about both your conversation with your mom and your experience in the art club. Remember, you’re taking positive steps, and I’m here to support you.

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! You’re doing a great job, Nuo Nuo. Keep that hope alive as you embrace these opportunities. See you next time!

User: See you! Thank you for your help!

Consultant: Hi Nono! I'm really glad you could join me today. Last time we talked, you mentioned feeling a bit relieved about your mom's attitude changing and you were hoping to improve your relationship with her even further. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I feel a bit better because my mom seems to listen more now. I still wish she could see me as much as she sees my little brother. Sometimes I feel like I’m invisible to her.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, Nono. It’s great to hear that there’s been a small change but feeling invisible can be very painful. Can you tell me a bit more about the moments when you feel this way?

User: Well, when my brother does something cute, everyone is always focused on him. I try to show her my good grades or tell her about my day, but she seems distracted or uninterested.

Consultant: I understand how frustrating that must feel when you’re trying to connect with her, and she’s not fully present. It’s important to have that supportive attention. Have you thought about ways to express your feelings or get her attention during those times?

User: I’ve tried talking to her after dinner when we are all together, but she gets busy with my brother. Sometimes, I just feel like giving up and not saying anything at all.

Consultant: That makes sense; when you feel ignored, it can be disheartening to keep trying. Let’s think about alternatives. Maybe we could come up with a specific time or place to talk that could allow her to focus more on you. What do you think?

User: Maybe if I asked her to go for a walk or something, it could work. I don’t know if she’ll say yes, though.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! A walk can feel more relaxed and might help her to really listen. It’s okay to feel unsure about her response. If she isn’t available, how would you like to handle that situation?

User: I guess I could try again another time. It just feels discouraging when she’s busy all the time.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel discouraged, Nono. It’s a process, and building that connection takes time. Would you like to practice how to frame your request to her, perhaps so it feels easier for you?

User: That could help. I just want her to understand that I want to talk and that I need her to listen.

Consultant: Absolutely. You can express how much her attention means to you. For example, you might say, “Mom, I’d really like to share something important with you. Can we take a walk together?” How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds good! I can do that.

Consultant: Fantastic! I believe in you, Nono. Remember, you’re showing courage by reaching out. How else do you think you can make that moment feel special when you do have her attention?

User: Maybe I could share something fun about my day or show her something I’ve done well in school.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Sharing something positive can help create a warm atmosphere. It sounds like you want to connect with her in a positive way. How are you feeling about trying this approach?

User: I feel a bit more confident. I hope she’ll be interested.

Consultant: Confidence is key, and it's wonderful to hear you're feeling more of it! As we talk about this, how are your feelings towards your self-worth and what you bring to your family?

User: I’ve been trying to remind myself that I matter too, but it can still be hard.

Consultant: It's a great step that you’re trying to remind yourself! What affirmations or thoughts could help reinforce that idea when things get tough?

User: I could tell myself that I’m doing my best and that I’m important to them, even if they don’t always show it.

Consultant: That’s an excellent affirmation! It’s empowering to recognize your own worth. As you work on this relationship, maintaining that affirmation can support your self-esteem. Do you think you could use this when you feel ignored?

User: Yes, I think I can work on that. It might help me feel better about myself when I’m feeling down.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s all about recognizing and valuing yourself, regardless of the external situation. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you feel have been your biggest successes during our sessions. 

User: I think I've learned that it's okay to speak up, and I have some ideas on how to communicate better with my mom.

Consultant: Those are crucial insights, Nono! It’s important to celebrate your progress, and remember, you have tools and strategies now to help you navigate these conversations. How do you feel moving forward based on our discussions today?

User: I feel hopeful and more equipped to try talking to my mom. I really want to improve our relationship.

Consultant: That's a wonderful feeling to have. Keep practicing those affirmations and strategies, and remember, progress takes time. I'm here for you, and I believe in you. Feel free to reach out anytime you need support.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’ll definitely try the things we talked about.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Nono! I look forward to hearing how it goes. It's been a pleasure working with you today. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Nono! It's great to see you again today. I want to start by acknowledging the progress you've made since our last session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi! I actually feel pretty good! I got an award for my group work during a class activity, and it made me feel proud. 

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Receiving an award can really boost your confidence and self-esteem. How did it feel to be recognized by your classmates and teachers?

User: It felt amazing! It’s nice to be appreciated. I think it made me realize I can do well when I work with others.

Consultant: Absolutely! Teamwork can often bring out our strengths in ways we might not expect. What do you think this experience has taught you about yourself?

User: I think it taught me that I can contribute and that people do see me. I usually feel like I’m not noticed at home, especially since my brother was born.

Consultant: It sounds like being recognized in your class was really validating for you. It’s understandable to feel overlooked sometimes, especially in a busy family. What strategies can we discuss today to help you maintain this positive feeling, especially at home?

User: I don't know... sometimes I feel like my mom pays more attention to my brother. I wish she would notice what I do more, like now.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to want that recognition from your mom. Have you thought about sharing your feelings with her? Sometimes open communication can help bridge that gap.

User: I’m scared to talk to her. What if she gets angry or says I’m being silly?

Consultant: That fear is valid, but remember that your feelings are important too. What if we explored together some ways to express your feelings to her that feel safe for you?

User: Maybe I can write her a note or something? That seems less scary.

Consultant: Writing a note is a great idea! It allows you to express your feelings without the immediate pressure of a face-to-face conversation. What would you want to say in that note?

User: I would want to tell her that I feel like I’m not as important as my brother and that I wish she sees what I do too.

Consultant: That’s very honest and brave of you, Nono. Expressing how you feel can be the first step toward her understanding your perspective. Would you like to brainstorm some positive ways to remind yourself of your worth while you work on this?

User: Yes, I think that would help. Sometimes I doubt myself.

Consultant: One method is to keep a journal where you write down three things you do well each day. This will help reinforce your self-esteem over time. Does that sound like something you’d be willing to try?

User: Yeah, I can do that. I already like to write!

Consultant: Fantastic! Writing can be very therapeutic. Now, in addition to your journal, let’s think about setting some new goals for yourself. What would you like to achieve in your studies or social interactions in the coming weeks?

User: I want to keep doing well in school and maybe join a club or something to make new friends.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal, Nono! Joining a club can offer you new social experiences, and it might help you feel more connected. Which clubs are you interested in?

User: I really like art, so maybe the art club? I think it would be fun!

Consultant: The art club sounds perfect for you! It aligns with your interests and opens up opportunities to meet new people. Let’s make a plan to help you take that step. How about we outline what you need to do to join?

User: I could check when the meetings are and talk to the teacher.

Consultant: Yes, checking details is a great first step! Also, talking to the teacher can give you more context about the club and help ease any nervousness you might feel. When do you think you could do this?

User: I’ll try to find out by the end of this week.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid timeline. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s summarize the progress you’ve made and the strategies you’ll apply moving forward. How do you feel about your ability to implement these new strategies?

User: I feel good! I think talking to my mom will help and joining the art club sounds exciting.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. You’ve shown a lot of insight today, and I believe you have the tools to continue this journey. If you ever need to talk again, don’t hesitate to reach out. You’ve got this!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. 

Consultant: You're welcome, Nono! Keep believing in yourself and your abilities. I look forward to hearing how things go. Take care!
