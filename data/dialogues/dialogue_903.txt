Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. I know things have been tough for you lately. Can you share more about what’s been going on?

User: Hi. I've been feeling really angry and hurt because of what those guys in the other class said about me on social media. It's made me feel weak and frustrated.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly painful, and it's understandable to feel that way. You mentioned feeling weak and frustrated. Can you tell me more about what those comments made you think about yourself?

User: I just feel like I'm nobody. I can't stand feeling like this, and I hate how others see me. It makes me want to lash out.

Consultant: It's completely understandable that you'd want to react strongly when you're feeling devalued. I’d like to explore those feelings a bit more. When you think about yourself in those moments, what specific thoughts come to mind?

User: I think things like “I’m worthless” or “I can't do anything right.” It feels like no one respects me.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound really heavy and defeating. Let's take a moment to challenge them. Do you think there's any evidence that speaks against those beliefs? Have there been times when you’ve felt proud of yourself or accomplished?

User: Sometimes I do okay with my work, but it feels like it doesn't matter when people say stuff like that. It's hard to remember the good stuff when I'm so angry.

Consultant: I understand how anger can cloud your ability to see the positives. Let’s try to focus on one of those positive moments. What’s one small achievement that you felt good about recently?

User: Well, I did manage to score well on a test last month, which surprised me.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Scoring well on a test shows that you have the capability and intelligence. It might help to remind yourself of that achievement when negative thoughts come up. How does that sound to you?

User: I guess it makes sense, but I still feel like I need to prove myself. 

Consultant: Proving yourself can be a tough pressure to carry. What do you think drives that need to prove yourself to others?

User: Maybe it’s because I want to be respected, or at least not seen as weak. I don’t want people to take advantage of me.

Consultant: Wanting respect and not wanting to be taken advantage of is very understandable. Let's consider this: what are some ways you can show your strength without having to resort to anger or violence?

User: I could try to ignore them, but it feels hard. Or maybe I could talk back, but that doesn't help either.

Consultant: Those reactions make sense in the moment. What if we explored some healthier ways of asserting yourself—like communicating how their words affect you directly or seeking support from someone you trust?

User: Talking to them directly seems scary, and I don’t know if it would change anything.

Consultant: It’s normal to feel scared about confronting people. Sometimes, just expressing your feelings to someone supportive can be a stepping stone. Who do you think you could talk to about this?

User: I might talk to my sister. She usually listens.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Having someone to share your feelings with can offer you some relief. How do you feel about that step?

User: It feels a bit better knowing I can tell someone.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, it’s important to validate your feelings. It’s okay to feel anger and frustration. We can work together to find constructive ways to express and manage those emotions.

User: Yeah, I don't want to feel this way anymore. I want to be seen as more than just a target.

Consultant: That's a powerful goal! Wanting to be seen beyond the bullying and feeling respected is important. Let’s work on identifying clear steps for how you can begin to shift that perception.

User: Like what?

Consultant: For starters, you can practice addressing the negative thoughts we discussed and replacing them with affirming ones. Also, engaging in activities that make you feel confident can help. What’s something you enjoy or are passionate about?

User: I like playing basketball. I guess I feel good when I'm playing.

Consultant: Basketball sounds like a great outlet! How about setting a goal to participate more in that activity, possibly even joining a team? It might help you build confidence and connect with peers in a positive way.

User: That could work! I’ve always liked playing with friends.

Consultant: Excellent! It’s a constructive way to channel your emotions and potentially form stronger friendships. How do you feel about trying that out?

User: I feel excited. It sounds better than what I've been doing.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! As you explore these new avenues, remember to be patient with yourself. Change takes time, but each small step counts. How do you see your progress moving forward?

User: I guess I can start with just talking to my sister and maybe playing basketball more.

Consultant: Those are fantastic first steps! Let’s summarize what you’ve learned today. You've identified feelings around your situation, discussed some positive experiences, and imagined healthier ways to cope. 

User: Yeah, I feel like I have some tools now.

Consultant: Absolutely! You've made commendable progress in our time together. As we wrap up today, I want to remind you that it's okay to reach out for support whenever you need it. You’re not alone in this journey.

User: Thank you. I’ll try to remember that.

Consultant: You're welcome! Remember, you can always come back if you need more support. I'm here for you. Good luck with your plans, and take care!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you for today's session. How have you been feeling since our last meeting?

User: Hello. Honestly, I've been feeling more isolated lately. After that conflict during the class activity, it seems like my classmates are even more distant. I just don't understand why they treat me like this. It's frustrating.

Consultant: I can see how that situation has made you feel even more alone. It’s completely valid to feel frustrated when others treat you that way. Can you tell me more about your feelings and thoughts around this isolation?

User: I just feel angry most of the time. I want to be accepted by my peers, but the more I try, the more I feel pushed away. It's like they see me as a bully, and I don’t even understand why.

Consultant: It sounds really tough to feel misunderstood and angry at the same time. When you think about your behavior and interactions with your classmates, what thoughts come to mind? 

User: I sometimes think that maybe I’m the problem. I act out because I feel threatened, but I don’t want to be this way. It’s just hard to control my emotions.

Consultant: It’s insightful that you recognize your feelings of being threatened and how they impact your actions. Let’s explore some of those feelings a bit deeper. Can you recall a specific moment when you felt this way during your interactions?

User: Yes, during the class activity, I made a sarcastic comment because I felt attacked. Then, I realized everyone was looking at me differently, like I was the one to blame.

Consultant: That’s a crucial moment to reflect on. It seems like your attempt to protect yourself led to more misunderstandings. What thoughts ran through your mind right after that comment?

User: I was just thinking I had to defend myself, but afterward, I felt terrible. I didn't want to hurt anyone, but it happened anyway. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to want to defend yourself, yet it’s tough to manage the aftermath. How did that experience affect your desire for acceptance among your peers?

User: It made me feel even more isolated. Now I’m scared to talk to them because I don't want to make things worse. It feels like they don’t even want me around.

Consultant: That fear of rejection is deeply painful. Let’s consider how you can express yourself without feeling like you need to defend yourself aggressively. Are there alternative ways you think could help you communicate with them?

User: I guess I could try just being more honest and direct about how I feel, but sometimes I don’t know how to put it into words.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Being honest and direct can foster understanding. How about we work on some ways to phrase your feelings so that it opens up a dialogue instead of creating tension?

User: That sounds good. I really want to learn how to communicate better so I don’t feel like I’m on the attack all the time.

Consultant: I’m glad you’re open to that. When you feel provoked, instead of reacting right away, you could take a moment to breathe and think. What’s a way you'd feel comfortable expressing how you feel without escalating the situation?

User: Maybe I could say something like, “I feel hurt by the jokes.” That feels honest, and it doesn’t seem aggressive.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! By sharing your feelings without placing blame, you’re inviting a conversation. Let’s practice that. Imagine you’re talking to one of your classmates. Could you try expressing your feelings using that phrase?

User: Okay, I’ll try: "I feel hurt by the jokes." I hope they would understand me without getting defensive.

Consultant: That’s a brave step! Practicing that can help you gain confidence. Now, let’s think about the friendships you desire. What kind of support or understanding do you wish to receive from your classmates?

User: I want them to see me as someone who is trying to do better. I wish they could help me instead of pushing me away.

Consultant: That’s a powerful wish. Building mutual understanding can take time, but reaching out with honesty is a solid foundation. What can you do to take that first step toward bridging that gap with those classmates?

User: I think I can start by being more approachable. Maybe I could ask them if we could talk about things instead of just avoiding each other.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea. Showing your willingness to communicate can break down barriers. Reflecting on your emotions is key. How do you plan to reinforce this approach if you feel rejected again?

User: I guess I could remind myself that everyone has challenges, just like me. It might help to think about it from their perspective.

Consultant: That’s very insightful! Understanding that others face their struggles can foster empathy, which is crucial for healthy relationships. How do you feel about using this understanding in your daily interactions?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. If I can remember to be patient and empathetic, it might really change how I interact with them.

Consultant: Hope is a powerful motivator! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what you've learned about managing communication and emotions. What key strategies do you feel are most important for you moving forward?

User: I think expressing my feelings honestly, practicing empathy, and finding ways to communicate without being defensive will really help me.

Consultant: You’ve made amazing progress today! Keeping these strategies in mind will help you navigate those tricky situations. Remember, it's okay to take time to practice and find your voice. I’m here for you as you take these steps toward improvement.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I’ll try to keep these strategies in mind.

Consultant: You’re doing great! Remember, change takes time, so be kind to yourself through this process. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m looking forward to seeing your progress in our next session!

User: I will. Thank you!

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you today. To start, I want to understand what you've been feeling lately and what's been on your mind. Can you share a bit about what's going on with you?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really down lately. I had a big argument with my mom, and it left me feeling misunderstood. I wish I could have more support from my family but it seems like they don’t really get me.

Consultant: It sounds like that argument with your mom was really tough for you, and I can see why you're feeling disappointed in how things are at home. Let's talk about how that makes you feel. What emotions do you experience when you think about your family support?

User: I feel angry and frustrated. It's like no one really listens to what I have to say. I just want them to understand what I'm going through, but it seems impossible.

Consultant: Those feelings of anger and frustration are completely valid, especially if you feel unheard. It’s important for you to express your needs. Can you tell me more about what you wished your family would understand or support you with?

User: I just want them to see how hard things are for me at school and inside myself. My mom is always busy with her stall, and my dad is not around. It feels isolating.

Consultant: That isolation can be really painful, especially when you're dealing with challenges at school. You mentioned earlier that you want to improve your relationship with your family. What kind of changes would you like to see in those relationships?

User: I want to be able to talk to them without it turning into a fight. I just wish we could communicate better.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re looking for more open, constructive communication. That’s a great goal. Let's explore what might help facilitate those conversations with your family. What do you think is currently making it hard for you to communicate effectively with them?

User: I guess when I try to explain how I feel, my mom gets defensive. It makes me feel like I shouldn't even bother talking about my feelings.

Consultant: It’s understandable why you might feel discouraged if your attempts to share your feelings result in defensiveness. What if we could identify some different approaches you could try in those conversations to help bridge that gap?

User: I don’t really know what else I could do. I just feel like I'm always being attacked.

Consultant: It’s tough to feel attacked, especially when you're just trying to communicate. One strategy could be to start the conversation by sharing your feelings without placing blame. For example, using "I" statements can help. Have you heard of this approach before?

User: No, I haven’t. What do you mean by "I" statements?

Consultant: "I" statements focus on your own feelings instead of pointing fingers. For instance, instead of saying "You never listen to me," you could say, "I feel ignored when I try to talk." This shifts the focus to your experience rather than making the other person defensive. How does that sound to you?

User: That makes sense. I think I could try that. But what if they still don’t get it?

Consultant: That is a possibility, and it can be really frustrating. If that happens, it's important to stay calm and maybe even take a break from the conversation. Letting them know you still want to communicate but need some time to cool down can be helpful. How do you feel about taking that strategy on board?

User: I think that could work. I just hope they don't just shut me down again.

Consultant: It’s okay to feel that concern. We can plan ahead for those scenarios. If they respond defensively, you might say, “I understand this is a hard conversation, but I really want us to understand each other better.” Would that feel comfortable for you?

User: Yes, I think I could say that. 

Consultant: Great! You’re showing openness to trying new ways of interacting. Along with that, how about we discuss some techniques for calming yourself before diving into these conversations, so you feel more in control?

User: That sounds good. I usually feel really anxious before talking to them.

Consultant: That anxiety can be tough to manage. One technique is deep breathing. It helps to pause, take a few deep breaths, and ground yourself before engaging in a potentially stressful conversation. Would you be willing to practice this with me now?

User: Sure, I’d try that.

Consultant: Let's do a quick exercise together. Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs completely. Hold it for a moment, and now slowly breathe out through your mouth. How did that feel?

User: It felt calming actually. I think I can do that before the talks.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that. This can be a helpful tool to bring into your interactions. As we continue to work on improving your communication with your family, what specific skills or strategies would you like to focus on next?

User: I want to learn how to express my feelings more clearly without getting upset.

Consultant: That’s a valuable skill to work on! We can explore more about expressing your needs and feelings in a way that invites understanding. Would you like to practice creating statements that communicate what you feel but also encourage dialogue?

User: Yes! That sounds like something I need.

Consultant: Excellent! Let’s start by identifying a specific situation that has been challenging for you to express yourself. What has been on your mind that might be a good example for us to work through?

User: I think the last argument about my studies. I felt hurt when my mom said I wasn’t trying hard enough.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant moment. How did that make you feel when she said that? 

User: It made me feel like she doesn’t believe in me. It was really frustrating.

Consultant: Understanding that hurtful feeling, you might want to communicate how that impacted you. Perhaps saying, "When you said I wasn’t trying hard enough, I felt discouraged and hurt." How does that sound to you?

User: I think I could say that. It says how I feel without attacking her.

Consultant: Exactly! You’re making connections between your feelings and the situation. That's a great step toward enhancing your communication. As we wrap up today, what key takeaways do you have that you want to remember as you move forward?

User: I want to remember to use "I" statements and practice deep breathing before talking to my family. 

Consultant: Those are excellent takeaways! It shows your commitment to improving your relationships. If challenges arise, remember it’s okay to take a break and regroup. You’re taking constructive steps. I believe you will manage this. If you ever need support in the future, I’m here for you.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you’re here today. How are you feeling about our session?

User: Hi. I’m feeling a bit lost, honestly. I want to change my behavior and emotions, but I don’t know how to start. 

Consultant: It’s great that you’re open to making changes. Let's explore what specific aspects you’d like to improve. What do you feel are the main challenges you’re facing right now?

User: Well, I sometimes get angry easily, especially when things don't go my way. I also sometimes bully others because I feel pressured or frustrated.

Consultant: I appreciate your honesty. It sounds like you're aware of both your frustrations and how those feelings impact your behavior. What interests you about learning conflict resolution skills?

User: I learned a bit about it during a school activity, and it made me think I could actually change things for the better. I want to feel more in control of my emotions.

Consultant: That’s a positive realization! Gaining control over your emotions will certainly help with your interactions. Can you share a specific situation where you felt your anger got the best of you?

User: Just last week, I got really mad during a football game. I ended up yelling at someone who made a mistake. I felt so frustrated.

Consultant: That sounds like a tough situation. It’s understandable to feel heightened emotions during competitive events. What thoughts were running through your mind at that moment?

User: I thought that my team was going to lose, and it felt like it was all because of that one person. I just couldn’t hold back my anger.

Consultant: I see. It’s common to focus on immediate outcomes in high-pressure situations. How did that outburst make you feel afterward?

User: I felt guilty afterward because I saw how upset I made that person. But I didn’t know how to express my feelings differently in the moment.

Consultant: Your awareness of the impact on others shows growth. Let’s work on identifying alternative thoughts you could have in those moments. What might be a less extreme way to react to similar frustrations?

User: Maybe I could try to think that mistakes happen and it’s not just one person’s fault? 

Consultant: Absolutely, that’s a healthier perspective. By reminding yourself that mistakes are part of the game, you can reduce that frustration. Can we try some role-playing to practice that?

User: Sure! I’d like to see how that could work in real life. 

Consultant: Let’s imagine you’re in that football game situation again. When the mistake happens, how could you respond positively instead of reacting with anger?

User: I could say something like, “It’s okay, we can fix it together!” That sounds better.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic response! Offering support can help maintain a positive team atmosphere. Let’s explore how this approach can apply to other areas, like at school or with friends. Can you think of a recent incident?

User: Well, I had a fight with my friend about something small, and I overreacted.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re reflecting on that. If you were in that situation again, how might you handle it differently with a supportive mindset?

User: Maybe I could just ask why they did what they did instead of assuming they were trying to upset me.

Consultant: That’s a very constructive approach. It opens up dialogue and helps you understand each other better. How do you feel about using this strategy moving forward?

User: I think it could really help! I want to try it the next time I feel angry.

Consultant: That's an excellent mindset! It’s all about practice. How about setting a small goal for yourself to practice these new skills this week?

User: I could try to actively listen more and respond calmly when I feel angry instead of lashing out.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Remember, it’s a process, and each small step counts. Let’s also think about how you could track your progress. 

User: Maybe I could keep a journal about what happens when I try the new responses?

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Journaling can help you reflect on what worked and what didn’t. As we wrap up today, how do you feel about the strategies we discussed?

User: I feel more hopeful! I think I can manage my anger better and improve relationships.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that! You’ve already shown a lot of insight and willingness to change. What’s one key takeaway you’d like to remember from today?

User: I want to remember to stay calm and ask questions instead of jumping to conclusions.

Consultant: That’s a valuable takeaway! You should be proud of the progress you're making. Remember, these new skills take practice. I look forward to hearing how it goes next time. 

User: Thanks! I appreciate your help. I’m excited to try this out.

Consultant: You're welcome! I'm excited for you too. Keep practicing, and I'll see you in our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really pleased to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I think I’ve been feeling a bit more confident lately. I've been trying to apply the techniques we discussed to better interact with my classmates. It's not perfect, but I feel like I’m making some progress.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Building confidence and working on your interactions is a big step. Can you share a specific instance where you applied those techniques?

User: Well, there was this one time during lunch when I sat with a group of classmates I usually don’t talk to. I initiated a conversation about a game that we all enjoy, and surprisingly, they responded positively. It felt good to connect with them.

Consultant: It sounds like a valuable experience for you! Initiating conversation can be challenging, but you took the step and it paid off. How did that make you feel afterward?

User: I felt better about myself. I wasn’t as angry as I usually am when things don’t go my way. It was nice to actually get a smile and laugh with them.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It’s so encouraging to hear that you’re experiencing positive emotions. How have these new interactions impacted your feelings towards yourself?

User: I think it's helping me see that I can be more friendly instead of acting tough all the time. I want to keep this up and maybe develop real friendships.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! Understanding that you can be friendly opens up many possibilities for positive relationships. What strategies do you think would help you continue this growth?

User: I guess I could try sitting with different groups during lunch, and maybe I could join a club. I’ve been considering it.

Consultant: Joining a club sounds like a great idea! It provides a structured environment with common interests and could be an excellent way to build friendships. Do you feel ready to take that step?

User: Yeah, I think I am. It’s just a bit scary thinking about it, but I really want to try.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel scared about new situations. Let’s talk about how you can handle that fear. What thoughts go through your mind when you think about joining a club?

User: I worry that I won't fit in or that I’ll embarrass myself. Those thoughts seem to pop up a lot.

Consultant: Those thoughts are understandable and common when facing social situations. We can work on challenging those thoughts. For example, what evidence do you have that you wouldn’t fit in?

User: I don’t have much evidence, to be honest. It’s just how I feel. 

Consultant: That’s an important observation. Feelings don't always reflect reality. If a friend were in your position, what would you advise them to think about their ability to fit in?

User: I’d probably tell them that everyone feels nervous, and if they just give it a chance, they might find people who appreciate them.

Consultant: That’s a perfect approach! If you can extend that kindness to yourself, it could help mitigate those fears. Let’s think about some small steps to ease into this. What if you tried attending one club meeting just to observe first?

User: That sounds doable! I think I could manage just going to check it out without too much pressure. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Observing first can help you ease into the environment. Once you feel more comfortable, you can decide if you want to participate more actively. How does that sound?

User: It really helps. Just thinking about it now makes me feel less anxious. It’s encouraging.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, each small step counts towards your goal of building friendships and enhancing your self-esteem. How do you want to celebrate this commitment to yourself?

User: I could treat myself to something special after I check out the club, like getting my favorite snack or something. 

Consultant: That’s a lovely idea! Rewards can be a great motivator. Reflecting on your progress, what do you think has been your biggest gain during this period of change?

User: I think it’s realizing that it’s okay to be vulnerable and that I don’t have to act tough all the time. That’s been freeing.

Consultant: That’s a profound insight! Embracing vulnerability can lead to deeper connections. How can you maintain this mindset moving forward?

User: I guess I can remind myself that everyone has their struggles, and it’s okay to reach out for connection instead of pushing people away.

Consultant: Exactly! As you continue building connections, make sure to practice self-compassion. As we near the end of our sessions, are there any particular skills or topics you’d like to explore further to support your journey?

User: Maybe just more on how to manage my reactions when things get tough or I feel misunderstood.

Consultant: Absolutely, managing reactions is key to navigating relationships. We can definitely work on strategies to help you respond effectively in those moments. As we wrap up today, what’s one main takeaway you’d like to carry with you?

User: I think it’s that I am capable of change and that reaching out for support is a strength, not a weakness.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization! It’s been a pleasure walking this journey with you. Remember, you can apply what you’ve learned and continue growing. Should you need guidance in the future, know that you’re welcome to come back anytime. Take care!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you here for our session today. It sounds like you've been reflecting on your experiences lately. How are you feeling about everything?

User: Hi! I'm feeling a bit better about myself after the praise I received from my teacher during our group activity. It made me realize that I can contribute positively, but I still feel uncertain about my future.

Consultant: That's great to hear that you received positive feedback! It’s a big step in recognizing your potential. What aspects of your future are you feeling uncertain about?

User: I’m uncertain about my studies and whether I can improve my grades. Sometimes, I get frustrated because it seems like I'm not making any real progress.

Consultant: I understand how difficult it can be to feel stuck. Let’s explore your studies a bit more. What specific challenges do you face that make it hard for you to improve your grades?

User: I often find it hard to focus during classes, and when I try to study at home, I get easily distracted. It feels like I can't keep up with the lessons.

Consultant: It sounds like distractions and focus are significant barriers for you right now. Have there been any particular strategies you've tried to help you study better?

User: I’ve tried studying with friends, hoping it would keep me engaged, but I often end up chatting instead of studying.

Consultant: Studying with friends can definitely be a double-edged sword! While it can be fun, it can also lead to distraction. Let's think about alternatives. What about setting specific goals for your study time, perhaps breaking it into small, manageable chunks? 

User: That could work. I’ve heard about the Pomodoro Technique, where you study for 25 minutes and then take a short break. 

Consultant: Yes, the Pomodoro Technique can be very effective! It might help you to maintain your focus and give you those necessary breaks. Would you be willing to give that a try and see how it feels?

User: I think I will. It sounds doable, and I can see if it helps me stay on track. 

Consultant: That’s a positive approach! Along with that, how do you feel about setting some short-term goals related to your studies? For example, focusing on one subject at a time each week?

User: I like the idea of focusing on one subject at a time. I think it could help reduce my stress since I wouldn’t feel overwhelmed with everything at once.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Remember, celebrating small victories can also motivate you. What do you think you'd like to celebrate after achieving your first goal?

User: I’d probably treat myself to some video games or hang out with friends. That would be a nice reward for finishing a week of studying!

Consultant: Celebrating your accomplishments is important! It creates a sense of achievement. Speaking of accomplishments, how have you felt about your interactions with classmates since the feedback from your teacher?

User: I’ve noticed they are more friendly toward me lately. I think my teacher's praise kind of opened up some connections. I want to keep that going.

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Stronger connections can really enhance your school experience. Have you thought about how you could contribute to group activities to build on those connections?

User: Yes, I was thinking of suggesting fun activities for us to do together, like a study group or some games. I hope it can bring everyone closer.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Suggesting fun and constructive activities shows leadership and can further enhance your self-esteem. How do you feel about taking the initiative in this?

User: I'm actually excited about it! It feels good to think that I’ll be contributing positively.

Consultant: I can see that excitement! As you think about leading these activities, how do you feel about your ability to handle any challenges that might come up?

User: I guess I’m a bit nervous about dealing with conflicts or disagreements if they come up, but I want to try.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel nervous about that. Perhaps we can discuss some strategies that could help you navigate those situations if they arise?

User: That sounds helpful. I think having a plan would make me feel a bit more confident.

Consultant: Exactly! One approach could be to actively listen to your classmates and ensure everyone feels heard. You could also gently steer conversations back to the main topic when needed. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds like a good approach. I think I can manage that!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! You’re building a toolkit for effective group interactions. Reflecting back on our conversation, what do you feel is the most important takeaway for you today?

User: I think the biggest takeaway is setting manageable goals for my studies and being proactive in my interactions with others. It feels empowering!

Consultant: Absolutely! Empowerment comes from taking those steps. As we wrap up today, what do you think you’ll focus on implementing first?
