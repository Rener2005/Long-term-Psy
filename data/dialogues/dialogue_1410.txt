Consultant: Hi Joanna, it's great to see you today. How are you feeling since our last session?

User: Hello. I’ve still been feeling really anxious, especially about Dina taking the bus home. It’s hard to shake off the worry, especially after that last time when she didn’t message me on time. 

Consultant: I completely understand. It sounds like that incident has really intensified your worries about her safety. Let's take a moment to explore what those feelings look like for you. What goes through your mind when you think about Dina taking the bus home?

User: I immediately start to think about all the bad things that could happen. What if she gets lost, or something happens to her on the bus? I know it’s irrational, but I can’t help but go there.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially when it comes to your child. It seems like you’re experiencing a lot of fear, which is heightened by that recent event. Can you tell me more about how these thoughts make you feel?

User: They make me feel helpless and scared. I often feel my heart racing, and I can’t focus on anything else. I just keep imagining the worst-case scenarios.

Consultant: It sounds really tough to manage those feelings of fear and helplessness. Sometimes, our minds can trick us into believing the worst is always going to happen. Can we try to identify together what some of those thoughts might be when you feel this way? 

User: Sure, I guess I think, “What if she’s in danger?” or “What if she just doesn’t care about keeping in touch?” 

Consultant: Those thoughts sound distressing. Let’s examine them more closely. What evidence do you have that supports these thoughts? Are there any moments where evidence may suggest otherwise?

User: Well, she usually messages me right after school, and she’s always been responsible. I know deep down that she cares, but I just can’t seem to override the panic.

Consultant: It’s encouraging to hear that she has been responsible and typically communicates with you. Maybe we can challenge those thoughts. If a friend came to you with similar concerns about their child, what would you suggest they think about the situation?

User: I would tell them to trust their child and remember the good behavior, not the worst scenarios. But I can’t seem to apply that to myself!

Consultant: That’s a really wise perspective! It shows that you have a clear understanding of what a supportive mindset looks like. How might you begin to use that advice on yourself, to challenge your negative thoughts about Dina? 

User: Maybe I could remind myself of her past responsible behavior and look for other explanations for why she didn’t message on time, instead of jumping to the worst-case scenario.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! It’s about creating a balance between concern and trust. Let’s think about some practical steps you can take when that anxiety strikes. What might be an action you could take rather than letting the worry take over? 

User: I guess I could set a reminder for myself to text her instead of just waiting. It could help me feel more in control.

Consultant: That’s an excellent approach! Taking action can empower you and help alleviate that feeling of helplessness. Let’s also consider some small activities you can engage in when you’re worried, to distract and calm yourself. What are some things you enjoy doing?

User: I love reading and sometimes I try to paint, but I haven’t felt like doing those since I’ve been so anxious.

Consultant: Engaging in those enjoyable activities could really help shift your focus. How about we try to set a goal for you to do at least one of those activities each week? Would you feel comfortable doing that?

User: Yes, I think that could help. I would like to get back to painting and maybe it would help clear my mind.

Consultant: That sounds fantastic! Finding time for activities you enjoy might help ease some of that anxiety. Let’s also recap a bit: What strategies have we discussed today that you feel comfortable applying moving forward?

User: I will remind myself of Dina’s responsible behavior and challenge the negative thoughts when they arise. Also, I’ll try to keep myself busy with painting and texting her if I'm worried.

Consultant: Those are all great strategies, Joanna. Remember that it’s a process and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. How are you feeling about our session today? 

User: I feel a little better, actually. I appreciate having this space to talk through things.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s important to have these discussions. Just remember, it’s perfectly okay to reach out if those feelings come back or if you need further support. You're making great progress. 

User: Thank you! I think I’ll try to focus on the positive steps we talked about. 

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Let’s keep building on that progress. You’re learning to manage those worries, and I believe in your ability to keep moving forward. 

User: Thanks for believing in me! I’ll see you next time!

Consultant: Looking forward to it, Joanna! Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello, Joanna! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling lately regarding Dina and your worries about her safety?

User: Hi! I've been really anxious. I know I should trust Dina to take the bus home, but I can't help but worry about what could happen during her commute. It's a constant source of stress for me.

Consultant: I can hear how much concern you're feeling. It's understandable to worry about your child's safety. Could you share a bit more about what specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about her taking the bus?

User: Well, I often imagine different worst-case scenarios, like her getting lost or something happening on the way. It just feels overwhelming, and I can't shake those thoughts.

Consultant: That sounds really tough to deal with. Those worst-case scenarios can feel very real and can create a lot of anxiety. Let's try to identify and challenge some of those thoughts together. When you think about those scenarios, what emotions do they bring up for you?

User: I feel scared and helpless, like I can't protect her. It's like my mind goes into overdrive thinking about all the bad things that could happen.

Consultant: It makes sense that you would feel scared when facing those thoughts. Sometimes our mind can exaggerate situations, which increases our anxiety. Have you noticed if there's a specific thought that seems to trigger your anxiety the most?

User: Yes, definitely! The thought that something could happen to her while she's not with me is the worst. It makes me feel like I have no control over her safety.

Consultant: That sounds very distressing. Let's take a closer look at that thought. What evidence do you have to support the idea that something bad is likely to happen to her during the bus ride?

User: Well, nothing specific, really. It’s just that I read about accidents or kidnappings. My mind starts linking that to her situation.

Consultant: I understand. Those news stories can certainly amplify your worries. However, it’s crucial to recognize that they are isolated events and not necessarily reflective of Dina's experience. If a friend were in your shoes, what advice would you give them regarding their child’s safety?

User: I would probably tell them to trust their child and that they can't control everything. It's just so much easier to say than to feel!

Consultant: Absolutely, it’s much easier to give advice than to follow it when you’re in the moment. Let’s try something practical. Is there a way we could set up a supportive routine where you can check in on Dina that also helps ease your mind?

User: Maybe I could text her after she gets off the bus and establish a specific time for that? But I worry I’ll be too anxious until I hear back from her.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Setting a specific time for communication could help. It might also be beneficial to practice some relaxation techniques while you wait for her message. Would you be open to trying some breathing exercises or mindfulness strategies to keep yourself calm during those moments?

User: Yes, I would like to try that. I just never thought about doing something to cope while I wait.

Consultant: That’s a crucial realization! These strategies can help ground you and distract from anxious thoughts. Let’s make a plan: When you start to feel that anxiety creeping in while waiting, take a moment to breathe deeply and focus on your breath. How does that sound?

User: That sounds manageable. I think focusing on my breath might help me stay grounded. 

Consultant: Wonderful! It sounds like you’re open to trying new techniques, which is an important step. Remember, it’s okay to feel uncertain; it’s about learning to manage those feelings. How do you feel about our conversation so far?

User: It’s helpful to talk about it. I realize I have more control over my feelings than I thought. I just need to keep reminding myself of that.

Consultant: Exactly, and this is a process. It's normal to have ups and downs, but with practice, you can build resilience. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize the strategies we discussed. You’ll work on setting a specific text time with Dina and practice breathing exercises when waiting for her message. 

User: Yes, I will definitely try that!

Consultant: Fantastic! And remember, it’s okay to reach out for support when you need it. You’re making important steps towards managing your anxiety. If you find that the worries feel overwhelming again, we can explore those feelings further in our next session.

User: Thank you so much! I feel a bit more hopeful after this conversation. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Joanna! I’m here for you, and I believe you can work through this. Take care until we chat again!

Consultant: Hello, Joana! I'm glad you're here today. I understand that you've been feeling anxious about Dina's safety lately. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling and any specific worries you have?

User: Hi! Yes, I’ve been really anxious since I can’t always pick her up after school. I keep worrying about her safety on the bus. It’s hard to focus on anything else when I’m waiting for her messages.

Consultant: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of fear and uncertainty when you can't be there for her. What would it look like for you to feel more at ease during those times when you’re waiting?

User: I would like to feel calm and trust that she can handle it. But right now, I just can’t shake off the anxiety. I want to feel more in control of my emotions.

Consultant: That’s a great goal, Joana. Gaining a sense of control over your feelings can definitely help reduce your anxiety. Let's explore your thoughts a bit. When you're waiting for Dina’s message, what goes through your mind?

User: I keep imagining all the worst-case scenarios. Like, what if she misses the bus or something happens on her way home? It spirals from there, and I can't stop myself from thinking negatively.

Consultant: I understand how distressing those thoughts can be. It’s common to have those automatic negative thoughts. Can we identify specific thoughts that arise when you feel this way?

User: I often think, “She’s not safe,” and “What if something happens?” Those thoughts make everything worse.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very overwhelming. Can you reflect on how those thoughts make you feel physically and emotionally when they come up?

User: They make my heart race, and I feel a tightness in my chest. I become restless and can’t concentrate on anything. It’s exhausting.

Consultant: It sounds like these worries lead to quite intense physical reactions. Let’s challenge those thoughts together. How much evidence do you think there is to support that something bad will happen to her?

User: I try to think logically, but it’s hard. There’s always a small chance of something going wrong, right?

Consultant: That's true, there is always some risk involved. But do you think it’s possible to find a balance where you acknowledge the risk but not let it dominate your thoughts?

User: Yes, I guess I can try to remind myself that she has a phone, and she’s been capable of getting home on her own.

Consultant: Exactly! Focusing on the evidence that supports her safety is essential. If a friend were in your situation, what would you tell them about their thoughts?

User: I’d probably tell them to trust their child and focus on the positive. It’s just so much easier said than done for me.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to find it difficult, especially when emotions run high. You’re doing well so far. How about we come up with some strategies to cope with those anxious moments while waiting for Dina’s message?

User: That would be really helpful! I need something to distract myself or keep my mind occupied.

Consultant: Great! One option is to practice mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing or grounding exercises. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before?

User: I’ve heard of them but never really practiced them. I usually just sit and worry instead.

Consultant: That's understandable. We can practice a simple breathing exercise right now if you’d like. It could help when you feel overwhelmed with anxiety.

User: Sure, that sounds good. 

Consultant: Let’s take a moment together. Close your eyes if you're comfortable, take a deep breath in through your nose, and exhale slowly through your mouth. Repeat this a few times. How does that feel?

User: It’s calming. I can feel a little less tension as I breathe.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. It's a helpful technique you can use whenever you start to feel anxious. Remember, being aware of your breathing can ground you during those moments of worry.

User: I’ll try to use it when I start feeling anxious. 

Consultant: Perfect! Also, let’s think about how we can set realistic expectations about Dina's safety. What would that look like for you?

User: I guess I could remind myself that she has made this journey successfully many times before. Maybe I should keep that in mind.

Consultant: Yes, exactly. By reinforcing these positive memories, you can give yourself a stronger foundation to trust her and build your own confidence. 

User: I see how that might help lessen my anxiety.

Consultant: That's a positive realization. If at any point those worries become overwhelming again, you can always reach out to her and remind yourself of the positives.

User: Yes, texting her often makes me feel more connected and reassured.

Consultant: That's a great approach. How about we summarize what you’ve learned today and explore how to apply this moving forward?

User: Sure! I’ve learned to challenge my negative thoughts, practice breathing techniques, and reinforce positive memories about Dina’s trips home.

Consultant: Wonderful! You have a solid plan now. As we wrap up, what steps do you feel ready to take before our next session?

User: I’ll definitely practice the breathing exercises and try to remind myself of Dina’s capabilities when I feel anxious again.

Consultant: That sounds excellent, Joana. I'm proud of the progress you've made today. Remember, it’s okay to seek support whenever you need it. You’re building valuable skills!

User: Thank you! This has been really helpful.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I look forward to hearing how things go in our next session. Take care, and remember you’ve got the tools to manage your feelings!

User: I will! Thank you again!

Consultant: Goodbye, Joana! Take care!

Consultant: Hello, Dina! It's great to see you today. I want to start by checking in with how you've been feeling since our last session. How has your experience been regarding your anxiety lately?

User: Hi! I've been trying to be more aware of my anxiety, especially since my mom shared how worried other parents are about their kids. It's made me think about my own feelings when I ride the bus alone.

Consultant: That's an insightful observation, Dina. It's normal to compare feelings with others, especially when it comes to safety. Can you share more about how those thoughts affect you when you're on the bus?

User: Well, sometimes I feel really nervous, like something bad might happen. I notice my heart racing, and I can't concentrate on anything else. It makes the ride feel much longer.

Consultant: I see. It sounds like those thoughts create a lot of physical sensations for you, which can be overwhelming. Let's take a moment to evaluate whether those thoughts are helping or hindering you. When you think about your bus ride, what specifically worries you the most?

User: I worry about being alone, or what if something happens and no one is around to help me? It feels like I’m the only kid on there sometimes.

Consultant: That makes sense, feeling alone can heighten those worries. However, I want you to consider this: What is the evidence that something bad will actually happen during those rides? 

User: I guess I don't really have any proof. It's just my mind jumping to conclusions. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s common for our minds to leap to worst-case scenarios. How do you feel about challenging those scary thoughts by asking yourself what might actually improve the situation?

User: I think I could try that. Maybe I could remind myself that I usually get home safely.

Consultant: That's a great start! Something we can practice is replacing that initial scary thought with a reassuring thought, like remembering those safe rides. How about we create a short phrase you can tell yourself during the ride?

User: That sounds helpful. Maybe something like, "I've been safe before and I can be safe again"?

Consultant: I love that phrase, Dina! Having a positive affirmation can be a powerful tool. How do you think repeating that phrase might affect your feelings during the next bus ride?

User: I hope it helps calm me down. It’s worth a try, I guess.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s all about trying new strategies. As you continue practicing this thought reframing technique, what else do you think might help you feel more secure while riding the bus?

User: Maybe I could listen to music or a podcast. That usually distracts me.

Consultant: Excellent idea! Engaging with music or a podcast can distract your mind and make the ride feel more enjoyable. Let’s consider incorporating that into your routine. Have you thought about what you might listen to?

User: I really like audiobooks. They make the time pass quicker.

Consultant: Audiobooks are a wonderful choice! They can truly transport you to a different world. So, we have the positive affirmation and an engaging distraction. What steps will you take to implement these changes?

User: I can prepare a few audiobooks in advance and remember to say that phrase before getting on the bus.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan, Dina. It’s great to see you taking pro-active steps. How do you feel about approaching your next bus ride with these new tools?

User: I feel a bit more confident. I’m excited to see if it actually works!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic attitude! Remember, managing anxiety is a process, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. Let’s check in on your progress when we meet next. How does that sound?

User: Sounds good! I’ll try my best and I’ll be ready to share how it goes.

Consultant: I look forward to hearing about it. You’re doing a great job at being proactive about your feelings. Is there anything else you would like to discuss before we wrap up today?

User: Not right now. I think I've covered what I needed to. Thanks for listening!

Consultant: Of course, Dina! It’s my pleasure. Just remember, you have the tools and the ability to manage these feelings. I believe in you, and I’m here to help you whenever you need it. Take care until next time!

User: Thanks! See you next time!

Consultant: Hello, Joanna! I'm glad to see you again for our session. You've been making great progress with managing your anxiety. How are you feeling today?

User: Hi! I feel a bit nervous about our talk today. I want to make sure I'm still on the right path with my anxiety management.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a bit nervous. We can take it step by step. Let’s start by reviewing what techniques you've been using to manage anxiety lately. What strategies have been helpful for you?

User: I’ve been trying deep breathing exercises and some positive affirmations. They make me feel calmer, especially before I take the bus.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Deep breathing and affirmations can really make a difference. Can you share a specific situation where you used these techniques and how they helped you?

User: Last week, I was really anxious about taking the bus home after school. I took a few deep breaths and kept telling myself that I could handle it. It actually worked!

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that! That’s a great example of putting your skills into practice. How did that make you feel afterward?

User: I felt proud of myself for managing my anxiety. I realized I could control my feelings instead of letting them control me.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, Joanna. It shows how much progress you’ve made. What other situations do you think could benefit from using those strategies?

User: I think I could use them when I'm doing homework too. Sometimes I get overwhelmed and just want to give up.

Consultant: Absolutely! Applying what you've learned during homework time can really help. Can you think of a moment recently when you felt that overwhelm while doing homework?

User: Yes! I had a tough math assignment last week. I was overwhelmed and frustrated, which made it hard to focus.

Consultant: Let's explore that. During that moment of frustration, what thoughts were going through your mind that contributed to how you felt?

User: I kept thinking that I was never going to understand it and that I was going to fail.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really heavy. How do you think those negative thoughts impacted your ability to continue with the assignment?

User: They made me feel like I should just give up, which I did for a while.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way when negative thoughts take hold. What do you think would happen if you replaced those thoughts with something more positive or realistic?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that it’s okay to struggle and that I can ask for help if I need it.

Consultant: Yes, that’s a great alternative! Acknowledging the struggle while also knowing that help is available can be incredibly empowering. How does that shift in thinking feel for you?

User: It feels better. I think it would help me push through when things get tough.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Let's talk about how we can practice that mindset. Would you like to try a small activity to help reinforce those positive thoughts?

User: Sure! What do you have in mind?

Consultant: We can create a list of positive statements you can tell yourself during challenging situations. What’s one statement you want to include that reflects that more positive mindset?

User: “It’s okay to ask for help, and I’m doing my best.”

Consultant: That’s a fantastic affirmation! Let’s add a few more to make a toolkit for you. How about something like “Every step I take is progress, even if it feels slow”?

User: I like that! It reminds me that I’m moving forward.

Consultant: Great! Let's keep building this toolkit. Are there any other statements that resonate with you or that you’ve used before?

User: “I can learn and improve every day.” 

Consultant: That’s a beautiful addition! So, we have a few powerful affirmations now. How do you think having these statements to refer to will help you in the future?

User: I think when I start to feel anxious or overwhelmed, I can read them to remind myself to stay positive.

Consultant: Exactly! This toolkit will serve as a reminder of your strengths and resilience. Moving forward, how do you plan to practice using these affirmations in your daily life?

User: I can keep a note of them in my backpack and read them before I start homework or when I’m about to take the bus.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Keeping your affirmations accessible is a smart way to stay connected with your new coping strategies. We’ve reviewed so much today. How do you feel about your progress since we started these sessions?

User: I feel really good! I can see how far I’ve come and how I can keep developing my skills.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’ve really gained confidence in managing your anxiety. As we wrap up today, are there any final thoughts or feelings that you’d like to share?

User: I just want to thank you for your help. I feel like I can face my challenges better than before.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Joanna! It’s been a pleasure watching your growth. Remember, you have the tools and skills to manage your emotions. Keep practicing, and whenever you're ready, you can always come back for more support. 

User: Thank you! I feel more confident about everything.

Consultant: You’re welcome, Joanna! I’m proud of your progress. Until next time, take care of yourself!

Consultant: Hello Dina! I'm glad to see you today. It sounds like things have been going well with your mom. Can we discuss how you've been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! Yes, I think I've been feeling less anxious. Mom and I have been communicating better, and it's nice. But I still worry sometimes when I'm alone on the bus.

Consultant: That's great to hear about your improved communication! It's normal to still feel some anxiety when you're alone, especially in new situations. Can you share more about what goes through your mind during those bus rides?

User: Well, I just keep thinking about what could go wrong, like missing my stop or something bad happening. It makes me nervous.

Consultant: It sounds like your mind tends to focus on potential problems. What emotions do those thoughts bring up for you?

User: They make me feel really scared and sometimes a little hopeless. Like I can't control what happens.

Consultant: I see. Feeling scared and hopeless can be really tough. Have you found any strategies that help you cope during those bus rides?

User: I try to distract myself with music or texting mom. Sometimes it works, but not always.

Consultant: Texting your mom and listening to music are good strategies. It’s a start. Do you think there are specific thoughts that make it harder for you to enjoy those distractions?

User: I think it’s mostly the ‘what if’ thoughts. Like, what if I get lost or something happens and mom doesn’t know where I am.

Consultant: Those "what if" thoughts can create a lot of anxiety. Let's take a moment to challenge those thoughts—what evidence do you have that those things will actually happen?

User: Well, I have my phone and I’ve made the trip a few times without issues. So I guess there's no real reason to think something bad will happen.

Consultant: Exactly! You have your phone, and you've successfully made the trip before. How does recognizing that affect your feelings about those bus rides?

User: I feel a bit better knowing that. I guess I can trust myself to handle it.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Building trust in yourself is very important. Now, let's talk about how we can reinforce this belief for the next time you ride the bus. What are some positive affirmations or reminders you could use?

User: Maybe I could tell myself, "I’ve done this successfully before, and I can do it again"? 

Consultant: That’s a great affirmation! Maybe you could even write it down and look at it before you leave. How do you feel about that idea?

User: I like that! It would help remind me that I have the skills needed.

Consultant: Perfect! Now, let’s also think ahead about what you can do if anxiety pops up during the bus ride. What coping skills can you use to calm yourself down in those moments?

User: I could breathe deeply or count to ten. I think I can do that.

Consultant: Deep breathing and counting can be very effective ways to ground yourself. It sounds like you have some excellent tools. Let’s wrap things up by reviewing your progress. What do you think has been your biggest achievement since we started our sessions?

User: I feel more in control of my anxiety and am able to communicate better with mom.

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement! It’s wonderful to see your growth. As we conclude our session, do you feel equipped with strategies to manage future anxieties?

User: Yes, I feel like I have everything I need to handle it. 

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that! Remember, you can always return if you need more support. You've done an amazing job, and I believe in your ability to continue managing your emotions. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate all your help. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Dina. Take care, and remember, you’re not alone in this journey.
