Consultant: Hello, Zhang San! I’m glad you could join me today. I know things might be tough right now. Can you share more about how you're feeling and what's been going on in your life lately?

User: Hey. I've been really anxious due to losing my housing. It's overwhelming, and the thought of being homeless just terrifies me. I also find it hard to stop using drugs, especially cocaine and heroin. It feels like I'm losing control, and I don't know what to do.

Consultant: That sounds incredibly challenging, Zhang San. Losing your housing and struggling with drug cravings can create a lot of stress. I appreciate you opening up about your feelings. Can you tell me more about how this anxiety affects your daily life?

User: I can’t focus on anything. I’ve lost interest in even the things I used to enjoy. I just spiral into this cycle of negative thoughts, and then I want to use drugs to escape it. I feel so trapped.

Consultant: Feeling trapped is tough, and it's understandable you'd want to escape from that pain. Let's talk about those negative thoughts you mentioned. What thoughts run through your mind when you feel overwhelmed?

User: I keep thinking that I’ll never get my life back on track. I feel like I'm a failure. It’s like I’m stuck in this hole with no way out.

Consultant: I can see how those thoughts add to your anxiety and sense of hopelessness. It seems that you’re labeling yourself as a failure, which can be really heavy to carry. Can you look at that thought and tell me how true it feels? 

User: It feels really true sometimes. I think about all the mistakes I've made, and I just can't see a way out. 

Consultant: It sounds like you’re weighing yourself down with past mistakes. However, is there a part of you that believes you could create a different narrative? Maybe one where you acknowledge the struggle but also recognize the possibility of change?

User: I guess there’s a small part of me that hopes for change, but it feels so distant. Most of the time, I just can’t see it.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way. The first step is recognizing that there's a glimpse of hope. If you were to suggest a friend in a similar situation to look for small changes, what might you tell them to do first?

User: I suppose I would tell them to take small steps, like maybe ask for help or talk to someone about what they’re going through.

Consultant: Exactly! Small steps can be so powerful. What do you think would be the first small step you could take in your situation, either to find support or to manage the cravings?

User: Maybe I could reach out to an old friend. We used to talk about everything, and it’s been a while since I’ve been vulnerable with someone.

Consultant: That sounds like a promising first step, Zhang San. Reaching out to an old friend might provide you with some emotional support and connection. How do you feel about acting on that idea?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also hopeful. It might help to talk to someone who understands me.

Consultant: It's completely okay to feel nervous, but it’s great that you're open to trying. Let’s talk about how you can manage those cravings when they hit. What do you usually feel like doing in those moments?

User: I just want to use drugs. It’s like nothing else matters when the cravings hit.

Consultant: I can see how intense those cravings can be. Have you ever had moments where you tried to distract yourself or engage in other activities during those cravings?

User: Sometimes I try to go for a walk or listen to music, but it’s hard to focus on anything else.

Consultant: That’s a good start! Engaging in activities like walking or listening to music can help, even if it’s difficult at first. Could we brainstorm some other activities or coping strategies that you might enjoy or find helpful during those cravings?

User: Maybe I could try drawing again. I used to find it soothing, but I haven’t done it in a while.

Consultant: Drawing sounds like a wonderful idea! It can serve as a creative outlet and help distract from those cravings. What do you think could help you get back into that practice?

User: I think I just need to set a specific time each day to do it. Maybe I could start with just 10 or 15 minutes.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic plan! Setting aside dedicated time can really help. Let’s also think about the anxiety surrounding your housing situation. What are your thoughts on trying to create a plan to explore your options for housing?

User: I’ve felt so lost that I didn’t even want to think about that. But maybe I could try looking into shelters or other resources.

Consultant: That’s a great approach, Zhang San. Exploring options can empower you and perhaps ease some of that anxiety. How does that idea sit with you?

User: It feels good to be thinking about taking steps. I’ve just been avoiding it out of fear.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel fear, but taking action can help to reduce that fear over time. As we start wrapping up today, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed. What feels like a key takeaway for you today?

User: I think recognizing that I can take small steps is important. I need to reach out for help more and find ways to cope with cravings. 

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing those small steps is essential. It’s been wonderful working through these feelings with you today. Remember, this is a journey, and it’s okay to have ups and downs. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel lighter for sure. It's nice to put some things into perspective and think of next steps. 

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’ve shown bravery in sharing your struggles, and it’s a big step forward. I look forward to hearing how you progress in our next session. Remember, it’s okay to reach out if you need support before we meet again. Take care, Zhang San!

Consultant: Hey there, Zhang San! I’m glad you’re here today. How have you been feeling since our last session, especially regarding the uncertainties around your housing and future?

User: Hi. I feel a bit better about my housing situation since it's temporarily resolved, but I still can’t shake the feeling of being lost when I think about the future. I have a lot of anxiety, especially about the whole process of quitting drugs. I'm still quite resistant to the idea of changing my habits.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that. It sounds like while there’s some relief regarding your housing, the underlying anxiety and resistance to change remain significant challenges for you. Can you share what specific thoughts or emotions come up for you when you think about quitting drugs?

User: When I think about quitting, I feel this intense fear and doubt. It’s like I’m afraid of losing something that I rely on, even though I know it's not good for me. I worry that I won’t know how to cope without it.

Consultant: That’s a really important insight, Zhang San. It seems like you're feeling caught between the desire to change and the fear of what that change might entail. What do you think might happen if you gave quitting a serious try?

User: I guess I worry that it will just be too difficult. I’ve tried before and failed, so I think about how painful it would feel to go through it again, only to struggle without success.

Consultant: I hear you. It’s understandable to have those feelings, especially after past attempts. Let’s explore that idea of pain a bit deeper. What specifically do you think would be the hardest part about facing the process of quitting?

User: I think the withdrawal symptoms would be really tough. Plus, I'm scared of dealing with cravings. The thought of facing those challenges without any support feels overwhelming.

Consultant: Acknowledging those fears is an important step. It makes sense that you would feel overwhelmed. Have you considered what kind of support or strategies might help you manage those cravings and symptoms if you decided to pursue this change?

User: I haven’t thought that far ahead. I guess I don’t really know what could help me. I feel stuck.

Consultant: Feeling stuck can be frustrating. Let's think about it together. What if we brainstorm some coping strategies or actions that you might be willing to take, even on a small scale, to start feeling more empowered? 

User: I suppose I could look into support groups or maybe talk to someone who has gone through this before. It might be helpful to hear someone's experience.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step to consider! Connecting with others who have similar experiences can provide insight and reduce feelings of isolation. What would it take for you to reach out and explore those options?

User: I guess it just feels like a big step. But maybe if I started researching some groups and just reaching out to a few, it wouldn’t feel so overwhelming.

Consultant: That’s a great idea! Taking it one step at a time can make it feel more manageable. How do you feel about setting a small goal related to that? For instance, researching one support group this week?

User: That sounds doable. I think I can manage that without feeling too stressed.

Consultant: Excellent! Celebrating these small victories is important. Now, let’s touch back on your feelings about the future. What do you envision for yourself if you could navigate this process—what would a healthier lifestyle look like?

User: I picture waking up feeling more energetic and confident. I want to have a meaningful life, maybe even finding work that I enjoy. It feels nice to think about, but it also feels so far away.

Consultant: It’s wonderful that you have that vision in mind! It may feel distant now, but recognizing those desires is a powerful motivator for change. What small steps can we outline today to help bridge the gap between where you are now and that future you hope for?

User: Perhaps focusing on my daily routine could help. Like, I could set specific times for activities that are positive for me—like exercise or reading. It could create structure in my day.

Consultant: That’s a smart approach! Creating structure can provide a sense of stability and help you focus on positive activities. What specific activities would you like to incorporate as part of your daily routine?

User: I think starting with a 15-minute walk each day and some reading time in the evening could be nice.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent choices! Small, consistent actions can lead to significant changes over time. How do you feel about committing to these activities in your daily routine?

User: I feel hopeful about it. It’s nice to think that I can do something practical that could make me feel better.

Consultant: That’s amazing to hear! Hope is such a vital part of this journey. As we wrap up today, let’s summarize the key points. You’re aiming to research support groups, incorporate walking and reading into your daily routine, and keep that future vision in mind. How does that sound?

User: Sounds good! I feel like we’ve made some progress today.

Consultant: Absolutely! You’ve identified actionable steps, and that’s a significant move forward. Remember, change takes time, and every step counts. If you ever start feeling overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m here to support you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate what you’ve done for me. 

Consultant: You're very welcome, Zhang San! I'm confident in your ability to navigate this path. Take care, and I look forward to our next session to hear about your progress.
###################
Consultant: Hello! Welcome to today's session, Zhang. I'm glad you're here. Before we begin, I'd like to hear about your current feelings and any recent experiences that have been on your mind.

User: Hi. I've been feeling really anxious lately. The pressure of my financial situation is becoming overwhelming, and I find myself thinking about my past struggles with substance use. I want to change my life, but sometimes I feel stuck.

Consultant: That sounds like a heavy burden to carry, especially with the added worry about your financial situation. It's commendable that you're open to change. Can you tell me more about what aspects of your financial pressure are weighing on you the most?

User: Well, I haven’t been able to find stable work, which makes me feel even more anxious. I keep worrying about how I'll support myself in the future. It feels like I'm losing control over my life.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially with the uncertainty in your job situation. Losing control can lead to a sense of helplessness. You mentioned wanting to change. What changes are you looking to make in your life, particularly regarding your current situation?

User: I think I need to figure out how to manage my anxiety first. Sometimes, I get overwhelmed and just want to escape from everything, which makes me turn to substances again. I want to find a way to cope that doesn’t involve that.

Consultant: It’s great that you recognize the pattern and are looking for healthier coping mechanisms. Managing anxiety is key. Can we explore what specific situations or thoughts trigger your anxiety? How do these relate to your feelings around substance use?

User: Whenever I think about applying for jobs or dealing with my finances, I start to panic. My mind begins racing with thoughts of failure, and that’s when I feel tempted to use again.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really powerful. It seems like there’s a cycle where the anxiety about your financial situation leads to a feeling of failure, which then makes you feel like you want to escape. Can you recall what specific thoughts go through your mind when you feel that way? 

User: I often think things like, "I'll never get a job," or "I can't handle this." It feels very final, like there's no way out of my situation.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very distressing and understandably overwhelming. It's common to have extreme thoughts during stressful times. Could we challenge those thoughts together? What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts those ideas that you "can’t handle this" or "will never get a job"?

User: I guess I have some skills from my past jobs, but I haven't really focused on those since I lost my last one. It's just hard to see past my current feelings.

Consultant: That makes sense. It’s difficult to focus on your skills when you’re feeling overwhelmed. Reflecting on your past experiences, can you identify any moments where you overcame challenges or found success? Those successes could provide some evidence that you can handle this after all.

User: I did manage to work through a tough period a couple of years ago and found a job that I liked. I suppose that shows I can find work again if I really try.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s an important insight. You’ve demonstrated resilience before, and it’s possible to tap into that again. How can we leverage that past experience to help you move forward now, particularly in managing both your anxiety and your job search?

User: Maybe I could break things down into smaller steps, like updating my resume or applying for one job at a time. That might make it feel less overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical and achievable plan! Breaking tasks into smaller steps is a great technique to manage anxiety. What might be your first step in this process, and how would you feel taking that step?

User: I think updating my resume sounds like a good first step. It feels manageable, and I could do it at home without too much pressure.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic starting point! Setting a small, clear goal can empower you. How can I support you in this next step? Is there a way we can build in a sense of accountability or motivation for you?

User: Maybe we could plan for me to have it updated by our next session. That would give me a deadline to aim for.

Consultant: I think that’s an excellent plan! Having a deadline can motivate us to take action. As you work on this, it’s also crucial to find positive outlets to manage your anxiety. Are there any activities or strategies you’ve found helpful or enjoyable in the past?

User: I used to enjoy painting, but I haven't done it in a while. I think it could be a good way to relieve stress.

Consultant: Painting sounds like a wonderful way to express yourself and manage stress. Incorporating a creative outlet alongside your resume update could really help. How about we set a goal for you to engage in painting as well, perhaps once or twice before our next meeting? 

User: Yes, that sounds good! I’d like to make time for that. 

Consultant: Great! It's all about finding balance. Together, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed today. You’ll work on updating your resume by our next session and also set aside some time for painting. How do you feel about these steps?

User: I feel more motivated now. Having a plan makes a huge difference.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear, Zhang! Understanding these steps can reinforce your progress. As you continue to explore these changes, remember to be kind to yourself, recognizing how far you’ve come. What else can we discuss today regarding your feelings about social support in this journey? 

User: I’ve been thinking about reaching out to a few friends. I’ve isolated myself for too long, and I know they want to support me.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! Building connections can provide valuable emotional support. How do you feel about reaching out to them? What might that look like for you?

User: I think I could message one friend this week and see if they want to catch up. That could help me feel less alone.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Making that connection can not only lift your spirits but also reinforce a supportive environment as you work through your challenges. I’m proud of the steps you’re taking, and I believe you’re making meaningful progress. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. 

Consultant: It’s my pleasure, Zhang. Your openness to change and willingness to take these steps shows a lot of courage. As our session wraps up, remember that it’s entirely okay to lean on your friends and ask for help. Together, we can continue building on these skills. 

User: I feel grateful for this session. I look forward to our next chat.

Consultant: Me too! I'm excited to hear about your progress. Take care, and I’ll see you at our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I actually feel a bit better since participating in that community activity. I enjoyed talking to people, which is something I haven't done much lately.

Consultant: That's great to hear! Engaging with others can really lift your spirits. Can you share more about what you enjoyed about those conversations?

User: I liked the feeling of being connected to others. It was refreshing to hear different perspectives, and it made me realize that I’m not alone in this.

Consultant: It sounds like those interactions provided you with a sense of belonging and connection. How do you feel this newfound openness towards socializing might influence your journey toward change?

User: I think it might help me feel less isolated and more willing to reach out for support. But there's still this voice in my head that doubts I can really change.

Consultant: Doubts can be quite challenging, especially when embarking on a journey of change. What do you think this voice is trying to protect you from?

User: I suppose it's trying to protect me from disappointment or failure. I’ve tried to quit drugs before, and it didn’t work out.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel hesitant, especially after past experiences. Let’s explore how you can approach this change differently this time around. What would be a small step you could take to build your confidence?

User: Maybe I could start by joining a support group. Speaking with others who are in similar situations might help me.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic idea! Connecting with others who understand your experiences can provide valuable support. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit anxious about it, but also hopeful. I think it could be a good way to make new connections.

Consultant: Hope is a strong motivator, and it's great that you’re willing to face that anxiety. What if we brainstormed some ways you could prepare for that group setting?

User: Sure. I could write down some points about what I want to share. That might make me feel more comfortable.

Consultant: Writing down your thoughts is an excellent strategy. It can help you articulate your feelings and experiences. What topics do you think you might want to cover in the group?

User: I guess I’d want to talk about my struggles with addiction and how it's affected my life. I feel like engaging with this could help me process it.

Consultant: That sounds like a meaningful way to connect with others. How do you think sharing your story might affect your feelings of isolation?

User: I think it could help me feel less alone. Others may relate to my experiences, and it might be comforting to know that I’m not the only one dealing with these issues.

Consultant: Exactly! Sharing can build camaraderie and reduce feelings of isolation. As we prepare for this next step, let’s talk about potential challenges you might face in the group.

User: I’m worried about being judged or that my experiences aren’t significant enough compared to others.

Consultant: Those concerns are valid and common. What evidence do you think supports or contradicts those worries about judgment?

User: I suppose everyone has their own struggles. Just because they differ from mine doesn’t mean mine aren’t valid.

Consultant: That’s a thoughtful perspective. Everyone’s story is unique, and your experiences matter. How might this realization empower you in the support group?

User: It makes me feel a bit more accepted. I have something valuable to share, and maybe my story can help others too.

Consultant: Absolutely! You have unique insights that can resonate with others. Remember, vulnerability can foster deep connections. How can we reinforce this idea to reduce your self-doubt?

User: I could remind myself that being genuine is important and that others might appreciate my honesty.

Consultant: That’s a strong affirmation! Keeping that in mind can help you approach the group with confidence. What else can you do to build up your courage before you attend?

User: Maybe I could practice with someone I trust before going. It might help to get some feedback.

Consultant: Practicing with a trusted friend is a great way to ease any nervousness you might feel. It can help you feel more prepared. How do you feel about your plan moving forward?

User: I feel more optimistic now about reaching out and attending the group. I think this could be the start of something good.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, every step you take in this direction is progress. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s think about what we’ve accomplished and the steps you want to take this week.

User: We’ve talked about attending the support group and practicing with a friend. Those feel like solid next steps.

Consultant: Exactly! You have a clear path ahead, and I believe you are capable of making those connections. If you ever feel overwhelmed, remember that these feelings are part of the process. 

User: Thank you, this has been really helpful. I appreciate the encouragement.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Zhang! I'm proud of your progress and enthusiasm. Let’s check in again soon to see how things are going. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Zhang. I'm glad to see you today. It seems like you've had some positive experiences recently. How are you feeling about those employment opportunities you've encountered?

User: Hi. Yes, I feel a bit more hopeful. The social interactions do help me feel like I have a chance at something better. But I still struggle with my past and the urge to use drugs, which holds me back.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling a sense of hope! Acknowledging that struggle with your past is also an important step. How do you think these job opportunities might help you in your recovery journey?

User: I think having a purpose could make a big difference. If I have a job, it might keep me focused and away from negative thoughts related to using again.

Consultant: That's a very insightful thought. A job could provide you with structure and a sense of achievement. What kind of work opportunities are you considering?

User: I've heard about some openings in a local factory and maybe some retail jobs. I just worry that I'm not ready for it.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel that way. You’re identifying your worries and that’s a good first step. What specifically makes you feel like you might not be ready for those jobs?

User: I guess it's the fear of failing again or not being able to handle the pressure. I've struggled with commitment before, and I don't want to disappoint myself.

Consultant: That fear of failure can be quite overwhelming. Let's explore this a bit. Can you think of a time when you faced a challenge and succeeded? What helped you through that experience?

User: Well, when I decided to try quitting drugs the first time, I did manage to stay clean for a few months. I felt really proud of myself then.

Consultant: That’s a significant achievement! You showed resilience and determination. How can those qualities you demonstrated during that time help you approach these job opportunities?

User: I suppose if I remind myself of that accomplishment, I might find the strength to try again. I really want to build something meaningful.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing your past successes can empower you. Let’s think about some practical steps you can take as you consider these job opportunities. What would be a small step you could take towards applying for a job?

User: Maybe I could update my resume and look at applying for those factory jobs. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Setting a manageable goal can really help make the process feel less daunting. How about we set a timeline for that? When would you like to have your resume updated?

User: I could probably do it by the end of this week. 

Consultant: That’s a great timeline! Now, let’s think about how you can feel more supported while you work on this. Do you have any friends or family you can share your job search with?

User: I have a friend who’s been really supportive. I think I can talk to him about it. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful! Having a support system can make a huge difference. What do you think you might say to him when you talk about your plans?

User: I’d tell him how I’m trying to find a job and that I could use his encouragement. 

Consultant: That sounds like a positive conversation! Encouragement from others can help reinforce your determination. How are you feeling about this plan so far?

User: I feel a bit more motivated, actually. It helps to think of it step by step instead of all at once.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Taking it step by step makes it manageable. What other small steps can you think of that could help you feel prepared for the job applications?

User: I can practice my interview skills. Maybe I could ask my friend to help with that. 

Consultant: Practicing with a friend is a fantastic idea! It can help build your confidence. Let’s set some time for that practice as well. When do you think you could arrange that?

User: I can ask him this weekend to help me out.

Consultant: Perfect! It sounds like you’re laying a solid foundation for your job search. As you follow through with these plans, let’s keep in mind any feelings that might arise. How can you remind yourself to stay focused on these goals?

User: Maybe I can keep a journal of my progress to help me reflect on things.

Consultant: Journaling is an excellent tool! It allows you to track your thoughts and feelings throughout this journey. How do you feel about starting that, and what would be a good frequency for you to write in it?

User: I think writing at least once a week would be good to start.

Consultant: That’s a very reasonable schedule. As you engage in this process, are there particular challenges or triggers that you anticipate might come up?

User: I worry that stress might trigger cravings again, especially if I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: Acknowledging those triggers is crucial. What are some strategies you've used in the past to cope with cravings or stress?

User: I used to go for walks or talk to someone about how I felt. 

Consultant: Those are effective strategies! Keeping those in your toolkit will be essential. How can you make sure to integrate those coping mechanisms into your routine as you pursue your job search?

User: I guess I could schedule regular walks and check in with my friend if things get tough.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Being proactive about your well-being can make a big difference. As we wrap up today, let's reflect on the progress you've made. What is the one thing you’re most proud of in this process so far?

User: I’m proud that I have a plan now and feel more hopeful about the future.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, you’ve taken important steps forward. As you embark on this journey, I believe you’ll continue to build on this progress. If you face challenges, remember you always have tools and support to draw upon. 

User: Thank you. This was really helpful, and I feel more confident.

Consultant: You're very welcome! It’s been a pleasure working with you today. I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. Remember, you have the strength to manage this journey. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Zhang! I'm really glad to see you again. It sounds like you’re experiencing some positive changes in your life lately. Let's talk about how work has influenced your feelings and motivations.

User: Hi! Yes, it's been quite an experience. Working as a temp has given me a sense of purpose, I feel like I'm finally able to gain some control over my life again. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Finding purpose in work can be incredibly empowering. Can you tell me more about what specific aspects of the job make you feel accomplished or in control?

User: I think it's mostly the routine. Having a schedule and tasks to complete helps me feel like I'm moving forward. It feels really good to achieve something at the end of the day.

Consultant: A routine can definitely provide structure and a sense of achievement. It sounds like you're also finding joy in completing tasks. How has this impacted your thoughts about your past struggles with substance use?

User: It makes me feel like maybe I can really change things. But at the same time, I still have this resistance toward completely giving up drugs. I’m not sure if I can handle that. 

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel that way. Change can be intimidating, especially when it involves giving up something that may have provided temporary relief. What do you think are some of the fears or concerns that make you resist this change?

User: I guess I’m afraid of losing my coping mechanism. Even though I know it's not healthy, it sometimes feels like my only way to deal with the stress.

Consultant: Your feelings are valid. It sounds like you're navigating a complex relationship with your coping mechanisms. Let’s explore what aspects of the drugs you find comforting. Could we discuss the pressures or stresses that lead you to use them in the first place?

User: Sure. I often feel overwhelmed by my feelings of anxiety and hopelessness. Those moments can be pretty dark, and that’s when I usually reach for drugs to escape.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that, Zhang. It makes sense that you would seek relief from overwhelming thoughts and emotions. Would you be open to discussing some other strategies that could help you cope with those anxious feelings without relying on substances?

User: I guess I could. I want to find healthier ways to manage my anxiety.

Consultant: That's a great step! Exploring new coping strategies can empower you. What might be some healthy activities that bring you relief or joy? 

User: I enjoy going for walks and listening to music. Sometimes painting helps too, but I haven't done that in a while.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful activities! They’re both creative and physically engaging, which could help uplift your mood. How about integrating painting back into your routine? It could serve as a positive outlet for your emotions.

User: That sounds nice. I used to feel really relaxed when I painted. I just haven’t made time for it lately.

Consultant: It can be difficult to prioritize self-care, especially when life gets busy. What if we set a small goal for you? Maybe starting with just 15 minutes of painting a few times a week?

User: I think I can do that! Fifteen minutes doesn’t feel overwhelming.

Consultant: Perfect! That’s a tangible goal that can fit seamlessly into your routine. Alongside this, how about we talk about your achievements at work? How have they influenced your overall sense of control and self-worth?

User: They’ve made me realize that I can still succeed in life. Completing tasks and receiving positive feedback has really boosted my confidence.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It’s great to hear that you’re recognizing your abilities and successes. How do you think you can use this newfound confidence to address the challenges of overcoming substance use?

User: I suppose if I can succeed at work, maybe I can succeed in my personal life too. It gives me hope that I’m capable of change.

Consultant: Absolutely! Your belief in your capabilities is key to making lasting change. Have you thought about how to maintain this momentum moving forward? What other goals could you set for yourself?

User: Maybe I could aim to attend a support group. It feels scary, but I think it could help to talk to others with similar experiences.
