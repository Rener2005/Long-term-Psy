Consultant: Hello Kirti! I’m really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I guess I’m okay, but school has been stressful lately. I feel like no one understands me, and that really gets to me. 

Consultant: It sounds like school has been a tough place for you recently. Can you share a bit more about what happened that made you feel this way?

User: Well, my classmates sometimes tease me because I struggle with certain subjects, and the teachers don’t seem to have much patience. It just makes me feel angry and frustrated.

Consultant: That must be really difficult to deal with. When those moments happen, what thoughts go through your mind?

User: I think they don’t get it. Why can’t they just see that I’m trying my best? It feels unfair and I get really mad.

Consultant: I can understand why you would feel upset about that. It feels unfair when people don’t see your efforts. Let’s explore that thought a bit—what evidence do you have that they don’t understand your efforts?

User: I don’t know… It’s just how it feels. They laugh, and when I ask for help, they roll their eyes. It just makes me feel like I don’t belong.

Consultant: I hear you, and it’s painful to feel like you don’t belong. Sometimes our feelings can distort how we see what others are doing. Have you ever noticed if there are other interpretations to their actions?

User: I guess they might just not know how to help me? I just wish they would be nicer.

Consultant: That’s a great realization, Kirti. It's possible that they simply don’t understand how to approach you. What if you were to talk to them about your feelings, or even let them know how you would like support?

User: I don’t know. I feel scared to be open like that. What if they just make fun of me more?

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel scared about that. What could be a small step you could take to express how you feel, maybe in a way that feels safer for you?

User: Maybe I could write them a note? But I’m still worried they’ll laugh when they read it.

Consultant: Writing a note sounds like a good idea! It gives you time to express your thoughts without the pressure of a face-to-face conversation. Sometimes, sharing feelings can open up understanding. Can we practice what you might say in that note?

User: Sure! I’d say something like… “I feel angry when I don’t get help, and I want us to be friends.” 

Consultant: That’s a very honest and clear way to express yourself! How do you think your friends might respond to that?

User: Maybe they’ll think about it and understand? I hope they will be nicer. 

Consultant: That hope is valuable! It’s also important to prepare for different responses. How might you cope if they don’t respond the way you hope?

User: I guess I could try to remember that it’s about them, not me? I shouldn’t take it personally. 

Consultant: Exactly, remembering that helps protect your feelings. Let’s also think about some techniques to manage the anger when those tough situations arise. Have you tried any calming techniques before?

User: Not really… I usually just feel overwhelmed. 

Consultant: That’s understandable. Let’s introduce a simple one. It’s called deep breathing. When you feel that anger rising, you can take a moment to breathe in deeply through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then slowly breathe out through your mouth. Would you like to try that together?

User: Okay, I’ll try it. *breathes in and out* It feels a bit calming.

Consultant: Great job, Kirti! This is a useful tool that you can use whenever you start to feel angry or frustrated. How do you think you can incorporate this into your daily routine?

User: I could practice it whenever I feel overwhelmed, like before tests or when I feel annoyed. 

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Each time you practice, you’ll become more comfortable using it. How are you feeling about the upcoming week with everything we’ve discussed?

User: I feel a bit better, but I’m still nervous about school. 

Consultant: That’s completely normal. Adapting to challenges takes time. Just remember to use your breathing techniques whenever you feel overwhelmed. You’re learning valuable skills. 

User: Thanks! I’ll try to remember that.

Consultant: You’re doing really well, Kirti! For our next session, let’s continue to explore any new situations that come up at school. We can build on what we’ve talked about. 

User: Sounds good! I’ll make sure to share what happens.

Consultant: Perfect! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences. Remember, it’s all about progress at your pace. You’ve got this! 

User: Thank you! 

Consultant: Thank you for being here today, Kirti. I believe you’ll keep moving forward. Take care until next time!

Consultant: Hello, Kirti! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been trying to cope with the new class schedule, but honestly, it's been really challenging. I feel overwhelmed and a bit angry about it.

Consultant: I hear you. Adapting to new changes can be quite difficult. Can you share more about what specifically makes you feel overwhelmed?

User: Well, the subjects seem harder, and I can't keep up with the homework. I get frustrated when I can't understand something right away.

Consultant: It sounds like the pressure from school is really weighing on you. When you feel frustrated, what kind of thoughts come to your mind?

User: I often think that I'm just not smart enough to handle this. It feels like no matter how hard I try, I just can't keep up.

Consultant: That's a tough mindset to be in, Kirti. Let’s explore that thought together. What evidence do you have that you're not smart enough? 

User: I guess I don’t have any specific proof, but I see other classmates doing better than me.

Consultant: It's easy to compare ourselves to others, but remember, everyone has their own pace. What if we challenge that thought? Instead of “I’m not smart enough,” how might you reframe it?

User: Maybe I could say that I'm still learning and it's okay to struggle sometimes?

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a healthier perspective. It’s important to give yourself permission to learn at your own pace. What could be a small goal to help you feel accomplished in your studies?

User: Maybe I could aim to finish one subject's homework each day instead of trying to do it all at once.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Setting manageable tasks can really help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed. How do you feel about that goal?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful about it. Like it’s something I can actually do.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Now, when you start feeling angry or frustrated, what are some strategies you can employ to cope with those emotions?

User: I usually just stay quiet and hold it all in, but that doesn’t help. Maybe I should try talking to someone or take a break?

Consultant: Taking a break and expressing your feelings can be very beneficial. How about we work on some relaxation techniques you can use when you feel these intense emotions?

User: That sounds useful. I think it would help me calm down.

Consultant: Great! We can practice some deep breathing techniques together, which can help you feel more centered and calm. Would you like to try that now?

User: Yes, let’s do it!

Consultant: Okay, let’s take a moment. Breathe in deeply through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Let’s do this a few times together.

User: (After breathing) That feels nice. I think I can use this when I’m feeling stressed.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, Kirti! Remember, you can use this technique whenever you face challenging moments. What else do you think would help improve your interactions with your friends?

User: Maybe if I talk more openly with them about how I feel. I sometimes feel like they don’t understand.

Consultant: Speaking up is a valuable skill! How about we practice some ways you could express your feelings to your friends? 

User: I think I could start by telling them when I'm overwhelmed. 

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start! Open communication can strengthen your relationships. How might you frame that message when you speak to them?

User: I could say, “Hey, I’ve been feeling stressed with school and I’d love your support.”

Consultant: That’s a clear and honest way to express your feelings. I believe that your friends would appreciate your openness. How do you feel about taking this step?

User: I feel nervous, but it sounds like a good idea. 

Consultant: It's completely natural to feel nervous about sharing your feelings. Remember, it’s a brave step towards improving your relationships. 

User: It really is. I just hope they understand me.

Consultant: It’s understandable to worry, but by opening up, you’ll create space for understanding and support. We can work on talking points if you'd like.

User: Yes, that would help!

Consultant: Sure! Let’s jot down some key points you want to communicate to make you feel more confident when talking to them. 

User: Okay! I could mention how much I value their friendship and how I want to keep connecting even if I’m struggling.

Consultant: Those are wonderful points! They show that you care about the friendship while being honest about your feelings. How do you feel about sharing those thoughts with your friends now?

User: I feel more prepared! It’s less intimidating knowing what to say.

Consultant: That’s an excellent shift in mindset! Progress takes time, and being prepared makes it easier. As we wrap up today, what do you feel is your biggest takeaway from this session?

User: I learned that it’s okay to take my time with schoolwork and that communicating will help my friendships.

Consultant: Those are valuable insights, Kirti! I’m proud of the steps you’re taking. Remember, it's all about progress. I’m looking forward to hearing how your conversations with your friends go next time we meet.

User: Thank you! I feel more optimistic about everything now.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Keep practicing those strategies, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need support before our next session. Take care, Kirti!

Consultant: Hello Kirti! I'm really happy to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I think I've been okay, but I still feel a bit worried about how to communicate with my friends. I had a misunderstanding recently that made me upset.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like the misunderstanding affected you quite a bit. Can you tell me more about what happened with your friends?

User: Well, I thought they were talking about me, but later I found out they were actually discussing something else. It made me feel really upset and angry.

Consultant: That sounds frustrating, especially when misunderstandings like that happen. How did you cope with those feelings at the moment?

User: I got really angry and ended up saying some things I didn't really mean. I just wanted them to understand me, but it all went wrong.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel angry when you think someone isn’t being clear or respectful. We can work on ways for you to express your feelings without escalating the situation. What would you like to achieve in your next interactions with your friends?

User: I want to be able to communicate better so that misunderstandings don’t happen again. I want to tell them how I feel but not get angry.

Consultant: That's a great goal, Kirti! Learning to express your feelings calmly is very important. To start, let’s practice some basic communication skills, like active listening. How do you think listening to others can help in preventing misunderstandings?

User: I guess if I listen better, I can understand what they really mean.

Consultant: Exactly! Active listening can help you clarify what someone is saying before jumping to conclusions. Let’s try a little role-play. I'll play the role of your friend, and you can practice how you would respond and ask questions to clarify.

User: Okay, I can try that.

Consultant: Alright. Let’s pretend I'm your friend, and I just made a comment that you misunderstood. I say, "I’m frustrated with my grades." What would you do or say next?

User: I would probably say, "Are you talking about me? Because I'm trying to do better too."

Consultant: That’s a good start! But try saying it in a way that expresses your willingness to understand. How about, “Can you tell me more about what’s frustrating you?” This opens up the conversation more.

User: Oh, I see. That’s better!

Consultant: Great! Let's practice that again. What would you say if I made that same statement?

User: "Can you tell me more about what’s frustrating you?"

Consultant: Perfect! How does that feel to say that in practice?

User: It feels good! It’s like I’m showing I care about what they feel.

Consultant: Absolutely! Caring about others' feelings can strengthen your friendships. Now, think about a situation where you could apply this technique with your friends. How can you use what we practiced today in your next conversation?

User: I could try it the next time we talk. Maybe I can suggest we talk whenever there's a misunderstanding.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! You’re already thinking about how to apply what you’ve learned. How do you feel about trying this new approach?

User: I feel more confident about talking to them. I think I can make it work!

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Confidence grows with practice. As we prepare to wrap up today’s session, what do you think will be your biggest challenge in applying these skills?

User: I think I might get nervous or forget what to say.

Consultant: That’s completely normal! When you feel nervous, remember to take a deep breath and remind yourself of what we practiced. It’s okay to take your time when responding too. How could you remind yourself to stay calm in those moments?

User: Maybe I could think about the breathing exercises we learned before. That might help me.

Consultant: Absolutely! Deep breathing can be very effective. It can give you a moment to collect your thoughts before responding. What other strategies can help you remember to use these skills?

User: I could write down some phrases to use or practice with my family.

Consultant: Those are excellent ideas! Writing down phrases can give you a reference to turn to. And practicing with family will help build your confidence, too. So, let’s think about our next steps. What would you like to focus on for our next session?

User: I want to practice more with real-life situations and maybe role-play again.

Consultant: That sounds like a productive plan! We can focus on specific scenarios you encounter. Before we finish today, what’s one takeaway you have from our session that you can carry with you?

User: I learned that listening is important, and I can use phrases to help me express how I feel without getting upset.

Consultant: That's a wonderful takeaway! I’m proud of you for recognizing the importance of communication. As you go through your week, remember that you’re learning and growing. You’re doing a great job, Kirti!

User: Thank you! I feel more positive about trying these skills now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! I believe in you. Remember, if you encounter any challenges, we can talk about them in our next session. Keep practicing, and take care!

User: Thank you! I will. See you next time!

Consultant: Hello Kirti! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident, actually. I tried participating in a school social event, and while it was nerve-wracking at first, I ended up enjoying it. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you took a significant step in building your confidence. Can you share what it felt like for you during the event?

User: At first, I was anxious and worried that I would embarrass myself. But once I started talking to others, I felt more relaxed. It was nice to interact, and I even made a few new friends.

Consultant: I'm so proud of you for overcoming those initial nerves and connecting with others! What do you think helped you feel more relaxed as the event went on?

User: I guess I just focused on the conversations and tried to forget about my worries. I reminded myself that it's okay to be myself and that everyone makes mistakes.

Consultant: That's a great strategy! Remembering that it’s okay to be yourself can really help ease social pressure. How about your feelings after the event? Did it change your perspective on social situations?

User: Yes, definitely! I feel like I can handle more social events in the future. It felt good to push through my anxiety.

Consultant: It sounds like you're really starting to recognize your own strength! Have you thought about what other social situations you’d like to try next?

User: Maybe another event at school, or even getting involved in a club. I'm still a little scared, but I think it could be fun.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant idea! Engaging in clubs can be a great way to meet new friends and practice your skills. What steps could you take to prepare for that?

User: I could talk to someone from the club beforehand, maybe to get a feel for it. That might ease my nerves a bit.

Consultant: Absolutely! Reaching out for a little information can really help diminish anxiety. Let's explore some ways you can approach that conversation. What would you want to ask?

User: I think I’d like to know about what activities they do and if new members are welcomed. That could make me feel more included.

Consultant: Great choice! Knowing what to expect can provide a sense of control. How would you feel about initiating that conversation? 

User: It makes me a little nervous to think about it, but I know it’s important. I want to grow and enjoy myself more.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel nervous. Sometimes, just taking a small step can boost your confidence tremendously. How about we role-play that conversation right now?

User: Okay, I can try! 

Consultant: I’ll be the person from the club. Go ahead when you’re ready.

User: Hi, um, I’m interested in learning about your club. What kind of activities do you all have?

Consultant: That’s a great start! I really appreciate you reaching out. We usually do a variety of fun activities like games, discussions, and projects. How about you? What interests you the most?

User: I like games! They make it easier to interact. 

Consultant: Wonderful! Games are a fantastic way to break the ice and have fun. What would you feel comfortable asking about game nights?

User: I could ask when the next game night is and if I can join in. 

Consultant: Perfect! You’re doing an amazing job with this. If you were to ask that, would you feel ready to join this club?

User: Yes, I think so! It feels more manageable when I practice like this.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Practicing in this way really makes a difference. What are your feelings about trying this approach in real life? 

User: I feel more confident. I think I can do it now!

Consultant: That’s fantastic! Remember, feeling nervous is part of the process, but you have the tools to handle it. How about we check in on how you felt after you try this out?

User: That sounds good! I’d like to share how it goes.

Consultant: I’m looking forward to hearing about your experience. Remember, each step you take is a victory. Let's also think about how you can continue building your connection with your family. How has that been going? 

User: I’ve talked to my mom about how I’m feeling lately. It helps to share a little about my day and what I’m learning.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful way to open up! It sounds like you’re realizing how valuable family support is. How has her reaction made you feel?

User: She seems proud of me, and it feels nice to have her support. I want to keep talking more about my feelings.

Consultant: That’s an excellent goal, Kirti! Maintaining an open line of communication with your family can enhance your support system significantly. How do you plan on bringing up your feelings in the future?

User: I think I’ll make a habit of sharing something small every day, like how my day went or something I enjoyed doing.

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan! Small daily conversations can really help strengthen those connections. As we wrap up our session today, what would you say is the most important takeaway for you?

User: I think I learned that practicing makes it easier to face new situations and that I can rely on my family for support.

Consultant: That's a powerful insight! I'm proud of how far you've come, and I believe in your continued progress. Keep focusing on those small steps and remember I'm here to support you. If you need anything, don't hesitate to reach out. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Kirti! It's been a pleasure working with you. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Kirti! I'm really glad to see you here today. Last time, we talked about how important family support is for you. How have you been feeling since then?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, I guess. The trip with my family was nice, and I actually enjoyed talking to them more. But sometimes, I still get angry when things don't go my way. 

Consultant: That sounds like a positive step forward, enjoying your time with your family! However, I hear that anger is still something you're dealing with. Can you tell me more about those moments when you feel angry?

User: Well, it usually happens when I can't understand something in school or when my little brother annoys me. I feel like I’m overwhelmed.

Consultant: It sounds like those situations can be really frustrating for you. When you feel that anger building up, what kinds of thoughts go through your mind?

User: I often think it’s unfair, like why can’t I just get it right away? And then I want to yell. 

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way when things don’t seem fair. Remember, it’s okay to feel frustrated. But we can work on finding different ways to express those feelings. What do you think would happen if you didn’t yell and found another way to express your frustration?

User: I guess it would feel better? But I just don't know how to stop yelling when I'm really upset.

Consultant: That's a great insight! Finding new ways to express feelings can help reduce the intensity of that anger. Would you be open to exploring some strategies together that might help you manage those feelings when they arise?

User: Yeah, I think that could help. I don’t want to keep yelling!

Consultant: I'm glad to hear you're willing to try. One thing we could practice is taking a moment to breathe deeply when you start feeling overwhelmed. How does that sound?

User: It sounds okay. I know breathing helps, but I sometimes forget to do it.

Consultant: It’s totally normal to forget in the heat of the moment. We could make a little reminder for you—maybe something simple like a note at your desk. What do you think?

User: That could work! I just hope I remember to look at it.

Consultant: That’s a good point! Let’s make sure it’s in a spot where you’ll see it easily. Now, outside of school, how have your conversations with your family changed since we last met?

User: I’ve been trying to talk more openly, especially during our trip. I told my parents some things that bother me.

Consultant: That’s wonderful progress, Kirti! Sharing your feelings with your family is such an important way to strengthen those connections. How did they respond when you shared your feelings?

User: They listened and seemed to understand me better. It felt nice.

Consultant: Such a valuable experience! When people listen and show understanding, it can really help build trust. Are there specific topics you’d like to continue discussing with them moving forward?

User: I think I want to talk more about school stuff and how I feel about it all. 

Consultant: That sounds like a great plan. Creating an open dialogue about school can help your family support you better. How about we think of some specific ways you can approach those conversations?

User: Maybe I could set a time to talk with them regularly? Like at dinner or something.

Consultant: Regular check-ins are an excellent idea! Establishing a routine can make it easier and more comfortable to communicate. What might you want to share during those dinners?

User: I could tell them about my day or things I struggle with in school. Just so they know what’s going on.

Consultant: Perfect! Sharing daily experiences will help them understand your world better. Remember, it’s okay to express what you find challenging too. How do you feel about having those conversations?

User: I feel a bit scared but also kind of excited. 

Consultant: That’s completely normal! It’s a big step to share your struggles, but it can lead to more support. As we wrap up today, let’s reflect—what are three things you’re taking away from our session?

User: I think the breathing techniques, having regular talks with my family, and being more aware of my feelings are important.

Consultant: Those are excellent takeaways, Kirti! I’m proud of you for your openness and willingness to work on these strategies. As we move forward, we can continue to build on what you’ve learned and ensure that you feel supported at school and home. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful now. 

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, you have the tools to express yourself and manage those feelings. I look forward to hearing how your conversations with your family go next time. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello Kirti! I'm glad to see you again. It’s lovely to hear that you've been feeling more positive lately. Can you share a bit about how you've been doing since our last session?

User: Hi! Yes, things have been better. I participated in some new activities at school, and it felt nice to engage with my classmates. I’m trying to be more social, but sometimes, I still feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s great to hear that you’ve been actively participating! It sounds like you're making wonderful progress. What specifically has been working for you lately, and what situations still feel overwhelming?

User: I enjoyed joining the dance club. It was fun, and I liked being around others. But when we have group discussions, I feel anxious and sometimes don’t know what to say. I worry they'll judge me.

Consultant: Joining the dance club sounds like a wonderful experience! It’s completely normal to feel anxious in group discussions, especially when you’re worried about being judged. Can you tell me more about the thoughts that come to mind during those discussions?

User: I often think that everyone is smarter than me or that I’ll say something silly and they’ll laugh. It makes my heart race.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really distressing. It seems like you’re experiencing a lot of pressure in those moments, which is understandable. What do you think would happen if you did say something that you consider silly?

User: I guess it wouldn’t be the end of the world. People might laugh, but they probably wouldn’t remember it for long. 

Consultant: That’s a very insightful observation, Kirti. It’s interesting how our fears can feel so intense, but the reality can be far less daunting. Do you think it might help to remind yourself of this when you’re in those situations?

User: Yes, that could help. I usually forget in the moment, though. 

Consultant: It’s completely normal to forget in the heat of the moment. We could think about developing a small reminder or mantra for you to use when you start feeling anxious in discussions. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good! Maybe something simple, like "It’s okay to be myself"?

Consultant: "It’s okay to be myself" is a fantastic and affirming mantra! I encourage you to practice saying it before discussions. How about we also explore other ways you can prepare for group discussions to reduce your anxiety?

User: That would be great! Sometimes I feel I just freeze and can’t think of what to say.

Consultant: Absolutely, let’s consider some strategies. For instance, you might think of a few points you’d like to share beforehand. This way, you’ll have some ideas ready that can help you feel more confident. 

User: I like that idea! I’ll try to prepare a few thoughts before classes.

Consultant: That’s excellent! Preparation can certainly help. Also, remember that it’s okay to pause and collect your thoughts during discussions. Taking a moment can help you feel less pressured. 

User: I never thought of doing that! I usually feel like I have to respond right away.

Consultant: It’s a common feeling, but pacing yourself can really make a difference. You might even find that others appreciate the thoughtfulness in your responses. Can you think of a situation where you could try this out soon?

User: Yes, we have a discussion in English class next week. I can practice my points and take pauses!

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect opportunity! It will be a great chance for you to implement what we discussed today. How are you feeling about it?

User: I’m feeling a bit less anxious just thinking about it. 

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember that each step you take, no matter how small, is progress. Is there anything else you want to talk about today regarding your social experiences or school?

User: I think we've covered a lot! I feel encouraged, but I want to make sure I can keep this momentum.

Consultant: Consolidating what you’ve learned is key, and it sounds like you’re very aware of that. Let’s wrap up by summarizing your progress and planning out some support for the next steps. 

User: Okay, I like that!

Consultant: Since we’ve focused on preparing for discussions and building your confidence, what would you like to do over the next few weeks to maintain this progress?

User: I’d like to keep going to the dance club and practice speaking up in class. 

Consultant: Those are excellent goals! Keeping active in dance while practicing your communication skills will serve you well. If you ever feel you need extra support, remember that you can come back for more sessions anytime.

User: Thank you! It really helps to talk things through.

Consultant: I’m so glad to hear that. Let’s schedule another session in a few weeks to check in on your progress. Keep practicing your mantra and those strategies we discussed!

User: I will! Thanks again for your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, Kirti! Take care, and I look forward to seeing your continued progress next time.
