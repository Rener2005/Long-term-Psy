Consultant: Hello! I’m glad you’re here for our session today. Since we’ve talked before, I’d like to check in on how you’ve been feeling lately. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed since the last time we spoke. I keep thinking about what my classmates said after the teacher criticized my work. It just makes me feel so low and anxious.

Consultant: It sounds like those comments from your classmates have really affected you. Can you share more about how their words impact your feelings and thoughts?

User: Every time I think about it, I feel this knot in my stomach. I start to doubt myself, and I worry about what they think of me. It feels like I’m always under a microscope, and it’s exhausting.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. Feeling like you’re being watched can be very distressing. What do you think it is about their comments that makes you doubt yourself so much?

User: I think it’s because I’ve always struggled with my self-esteem, and their criticism just reinforces those negative thoughts. I feel like I’m not good enough at anything.

Consultant: It's understandable that criticism can trigger those feelings, especially if you’re already struggling with self-esteem. Can you identify any specific thoughts that come to mind when you feel this way?

User: I often think things like “I’m a failure” or “I’ll never be able to succeed.” It’s like a loop that I can’t escape from.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really overpowering. To help us address these, let’s consider how much evidence you have for those beliefs. What might you say to a friend if they were feeling this way?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone makes mistakes and that it doesn’t define who they are. But I don’t apply that to myself—I just feel so stuck.

Consultant: It’s interesting how we can be more supportive of others than ourselves. Let’s try to challenge that a bit. What if we looked for evidence that contradicts those thoughts? Can you recall any recent accomplishments or positive feedback you’ve received?

User: Well, I did get a good grade on my last math test, and my mom always says I’m a hard worker. I guess those moments exist.

Consultant: Exactly! Those are important pieces of evidence that show your abilities and strengths. How does recognizing those achievements make you feel in comparison to your previous thoughts?

User: I feel a bit better, actually. It’s like I can see that I’m not just a failure, but I still focus on the negative most of the time.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! It’s a big step to acknowledge both sides. Moving forward, how might we incorporate this new perspective into your daily thinking to help reduce that sense of hopelessness?

User: Maybe I could try to remind myself of those positive moments when I start feeling low again. It might help to keep a journal or something.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Journaling can be a helpful way to process your emotions and recognize patterns. What other strategies do you think might help you manage moments of anxiety or overwhelm?

User: I’ve been thinking about trying to avoid situations that trigger my anxiety, but that sometimes ends up isolating me. I’d like to find a balance.

Consultant: Finding a balance is essential. Gradual exposure to those triggering situations, while applying your coping strategies, could help reduce the anxiety over time. Are there specific situations or places where you feel most anxious right now?

User: I really struggle in group settings, especially at school. I often feel like everyone is judging me.

Consultant: That’s a common fear. How about we explore ways to approach those situations differently? We can strategize how you might engage when you start feeling overwhelmed.

User: I could try deep breathing before going into those situations. It might help me calm down a little.

Consultant: Deep breathing is an excellent technique! Let’s practice that a little so you can feel more comfortable applying it when needed. Imagine you’re about to enter a situation where you feel judged. How would you initiate your breathing technique?

User: I would take a deep breath in, hold it for a few seconds, and then breathe out slowly. I think doing it a few times could help me feel more grounded.

Consultant: Perfect! Grounding yourself through breath can create a moment of calm in a stressful environment. Is there anything else you’d like to cover today?

User: I want to make sure I’m not just suppressing my feelings, either. I might need to express them better. 

Consultant: That’s an essential insight! Expressing feelings is a healthy part of emotional regulation. How might you do this, perhaps through talking with someone you trust or through creative outlets?

User: I think talking to my mom could help. She usually understands me well. I might also try drawing to express what I’m feeling.

Consultant: Those sound like wonderful options! Sharing with your mom could strengthen your support system. Drawing could also be a therapeutic outlet for your emotions. 

User: Yes! I really like that idea. I feel like exploring these feelings through art could be freeing.

Consultant: It definitely can be! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize what we’ve discussed. You’re working to challenge negative thoughts, practice deep breathing, and express your feelings. 

User: Exactly! I think that’ll help me feel less overwhelmed.

Consultant: I believe so too! Take it one step at a time and remember, it’s okay to have ups and downs. Whenever you need support, I'm here for you. 

User: Thank you so much! I feel better just talking it out. I appreciate your help.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad you’re feeling a bit lighter. Let’s continue to build on this progress next time. Take care and see you soon!

Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad you're here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been struggling quite a bit. School has been overwhelming, and I feel really anxious about interacting with my classmates. It’s like I get this wave of fear just thinking about it.

Consultant: That sounds really difficult. You seem to be experiencing quite a bit of anxiety, especially in social situations. Can you tell me more about what specific thoughts or feelings come up when you're faced with these interactions?

User: I keep worrying that I'll embarrass myself or that they won’t want to talk to me. It makes me feel really small and insignificant, like I don't belong.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts are quite intense and are impacting how you see yourself in social settings. What kind of emotions do those thoughts bring up for you in those moments?

User: I feel really nervous, my heart races, and sometimes I just freeze up. It’s like my body is reacting before I even get a chance to think.

Consultant: I can imagine how unsettling that must be for you. It's as if your thoughts trigger a physical response that makes the situation even harder. Have you noticed any specific situations that provoke this reaction more than others?

User: Mostly during group discussions or when I have to speak in front of others. I just start to panic and feel like everyone is judging me.

Consultant: That’s understandable. Speaking in front of a group can be really intimidating. Let’s explore those judgments you feel from others. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that they are judging you negatively?

User: I don’t know, maybe it’s just a gut feeling. I see them look at each other and whisper, and I think they must be talking about me.

Consultant: It seems like you’re picking up on their behavior and interpreting it in a negative way. Instead of assuming they are judging you, what if we considered other possibilities for their actions? What might they be discussing?

User: I guess they could be talking about anything else. But it’s hard not to think the worst.

Consultant: Absolutely, and it’s normal to feel that way. Let’s think about how often those fears come true. Can you recall any instances where the outcome was different from what you expected?

User: There have been times when I spoke, and they seemed engaged, but I still felt uneasy afterward.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight. It sounds like sometimes your fears don’t match reality. If a friend were in your place, what advice would you give them about those situations?

User: I would probably tell them to relax and just be themselves. But I can’t seem to do that for myself.

Consultant: It’s much easier to give advice to others than to ourselves. Perhaps you could take your own advice into those situations. How might you practice a more relaxed approach moving forward?

User: Maybe I could try to focus on breathing before speaking or remind myself that it’s okay to be imperfect.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Focusing on your breath can help ground you and calm your mind. How do you feel about integrating that into your routine before group interactions?

User: I think I could manage that. It sounds like it's worth a try, at least.

Consultant: Absolutely, and we can also explore other coping strategies together. How about we also practice some scenarios where you might feel anxious? This way, we can develop confidence in those interactions.

User: That sounds helpful. I often avoid these situations, but practicing could make a difference.

Consultant: That’s a great approach. Facing those situations gradually can help reduce the anxiety over time. Let’s pick a specific social situation for you to practice. Which one feels the most manageable to start with?

User: Maybe I could start with talking to a classmate during lunch. It’s less formal than speaking in class.

Consultant: That’s a perfect choice. During lunch, you can have more time to engage casually in conversation. Let’s plan how you can start that interaction. What could you say to break the ice?

User: I could ask them about their weekend or comment on something happening in class. 

Consultant: Those are excellent conversation starters! They are light, engaging, and less pressure for you. How do you feel about trying this out next week?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also hopeful. I really want to improve this aspect of my life.

Consultant: That's a great mindset to have! Remember, feeling nervous is a natural response, but you’re taking proactive steps to manage it. How would you like to reflect on this experience afterwards?

User: I could write down how it went and how I felt afterward, maybe share it in our next session.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Keeping track of your emotions and experiences can be a powerful tool. Lastly, let’s consider how to combat any negative thoughts you have about this situation. What would you like to remind yourself of when those self-doubts arise?

User: I want to remind myself that everyone has their fears, and it’s okay to be myself, regardless of what others think.

Consultant: That's a wonderful affirmation. Holding onto that perspective may help ease your fears. As we wrap up today, remember that it’s all about taking small, manageable steps forward. 

User: Thank you. I really appreciate your support and the practical strategies we’ve talked about today.

Consultant: You’re so welcome! I’m proud of you for facing these challenges head-on. I look forward to hearing how it goes next time. Take care, and we’ll see each other soon!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I’ve been feeling really frustrated. After the argument with my close friend, it feels like everything went wrong. I’m struggling to trust others now.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable that you're feeling this way after such a significant event. Can you share more about how you’ve been coping with these feelings of frustration and mistrust?

User: Well, I just feel so alone right now. I don't know who to talk to, and I worry about being rejected by others if I try to reach out. 

Consultant: It makes sense that you would feel alone, especially given the recent fallout with your friend. You’re likely feeling vulnerable and uncertain about reaching out to others. What would it look like for you to feel more secure in your relationships?

User: I guess I want to feel like I can trust my friends again and maybe rebuild that connection. But, I’m really anxious about the possibility of things going wrong again.

Consultant: Rebuilding trust takes time and effort, and it’s okay to feel anxious about it. Let's focus on small steps you might take to work on these feelings. What kind of support would you need from others right now to help you feel more secure?

User: I think just having someone listen to me without judgment would help. But I’m not sure my friends would do that.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to want a safe space to express your feelings. Perhaps we could brainstorm a few ways to approach your friends, so it feels less intimidating for you. What do you think?

User: Yeah, that might help. I just don’t know how to start the conversation.

Consultant: Starting the conversation can be the hardest part. One way to begin could be to express how much your friendship means to you. What do you think about sharing your feelings and concerns openly with them, maybe starting with an “I” statement?

User: I can try that, like saying “I feel hurt because…”? But what if they don’t respond well?

Consultant: That’s a valid concern. People may react differently, but expressing your feelings honestly is important. It opens the door for better understanding. Remember, you can’t control how they react, but you can control how you express yourself. How does that make you feel?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also relieved at the same time. It will be good to get it off my chest.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. Nervousness is a natural response when we’re about to be vulnerable. It shows that this matter is important to you. Would you like to practice what you might say in that conversation?

User: Sure! I’d like to see how I could phrase my thoughts.

Consultant: Great! Let’s role-play. I can be your friend—what would you start with?

User: Okay... I guess I’d say, “I feel really hurt because of what happened, and I miss our friendship.”

Consultant: That’s a fantastic start! You’ve clearly expressed your emotions and your desire to reconnect. How does saying that make you feel?

User: It feels good to say it out loud. But still a bit scary.

Consultant: It's completely understandable to feel scared. Remember that expressing your feelings is a sign of strength. After your friend hears you, you might want to ask how they feel about everything too. How do you feel about that?

User: That makes sense. I think it’s important to know how they’re feeling too. I just fear they might not care.

Consultant: It’s normal to have that worry, but asking about their feelings shows you’re open to understanding their perspective. It can also foster a deeper connection. When you think about their potential response, what thoughts come to mind?

User: I guess I just keep thinking that I might not be valued as much as I hope.

Consultant: That thought can feel very discouraging. Let's explore that idea. What evidence do you have to support it, and what evidence might suggest it’s not true?

User: Well, I sometimes feel like I’m always the one reaching out, but I do have friends who care about me... just not always around.

Consultant: It sounds like there is a mix of experiences you’ve had with your friends. You’re right—there are friends who value you, even if it doesn’t always feel that way. What could remind you of their care, especially when you’re feeling down?

User: Maybe I could think of the times they’ve supported me, like when they helped me study for exams.

Consultant: Those are great examples. Recalling those moments can help you remember that you are valued. It’s important to reinforce those positive beliefs, especially when negative thoughts arise. How can you practice this before talking to your friend?

User: I can make a list of supportive moments and read it before I talk to them. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! It can serve as a reminder of your connections. As we move forward, it’s important to keep building your confidence. How do you feel about the steps we discussed today?

User: I feel more hopeful about reaching out to my friends now. It feels less daunting.

Consultant: I’m really proud of the progress you’ve made. It’s perfectly okay to feel nervous—it shows that you care. As we wrap up today, what will be your takeaway from this session?

User: I think I will work on expressing my feelings and building my confidence in friendships. I’ll practice the conversation and reference the supportive times.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. Keep believing in your ability to reconnect, and we’ll work together on this. Take care!

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’ll do my best.

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for today's session. How have you been feeling since our last talk?

User: Hi. I've been managing a bit better, but I still find myself doubting my abilities sometimes. I've achieved a small goal recently, which felt good, but I'm worried I won't be able to keep it up.

Consultant: It's great to hear you've experienced some improvement and achieved a goal. That’s a positive step! Can you share more about this goal and what it meant for you?

User: I set a target to study for an hour each day, and I actually did it for a week. But then I started questioning whether I could keep doing it consistently. It's frustrating.

Consultant: I can see how that would be frustrating. Achieving the goal was a good start, but those doubts about maintaining it are common. What thoughts do you have when those doubts creep in?

User: I often think things like "Maybe I can't keep this up" or "What if I mess up next time?" It makes me anxious and hesitant.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound quite heavy. Let's explore them together. When you think, "Maybe I can't keep this up," how does that make you feel?

User: It makes me feel anxious and a bit defeated. It's like I’m setting myself up for failure, even if I did well before.

Consultant: That feeling of anxiety and defeat can be really tough to handle. It's important to challenge those thoughts when they arise. What evidence do you have that you might fail to keep it up?

User: I guess I don’t have real evidence; it’s more like a fear based on past experiences where I struggled to stick to things.

Consultant: That makes sense. Past experiences can linger in our minds. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their fears?

User: I would probably encourage them to focus on their progress and not let past failures define them. 

Consultant: That's a wonderful perspective! Focusing on progress can be really empowering. How might you incorporate that mindset into your own situation?

User: Maybe I could remind myself of the progress I’ve made rather than just focusing on the potential to fail.

Consultant: Absolutely. Emphasizing your achievements can help reinforce your confidence. What small step could you take to remind yourself of your progress this week?

User: I could keep a journal of my achievements, no matter how small. That could help me see how I’m moving forward.

Consultant: A journal sounds like a fantastic idea! It can serve as a tangible reminder of your growth. How do you think keeping this journal might affect your feelings of self-doubt?

User: I think seeing my achievements written down might make me feel more accomplished and help reduce the doubts.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Tracking your achievements can help solidify a more positive self-view. As you start this journaling, how can you reward yourself for your efforts?

User: I could treat myself to something small, like my favorite snack or a bit of extra relaxation time. 

Consultant: Those sound like excellent rewards! Celebrating your efforts, no matter how small, is key to reinforcing that positive behavior. What's your plan for starting this journal?

User: I think I’ll start it tonight after school. I can set aside a few minutes each day to write down what I achieved.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Setting aside that time will help make it a routine. How do you feel about your ability to keep this up in the coming days?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Having a plan in place makes it seem more manageable now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s all about taking things one step at a time. As you work on your journal this week, how do you plan to deal with any doubts that might come up again?

User: I could remind myself of the progress I’ve made, read through my journal, and talk about it if I feel overwhelmed.

Consultant: That’s a solid approach! Having tools at your disposal can really empower you. What did you learn about yourself today that you’d like to carry into next week?

User: I learned that focusing on my progress is important and that I can take practical steps to reinforce my confidence.

Consultant: Exactly! You have the ability to create a positive dialogue with yourself. As we wrap up today, how confident are you feeling about maintaining this new mindset as you go forward?

User: I feel more confident now. I believe I can put these strategies into practice.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! I really admire your commitment to improving your mindset. Remember, it’s all about progress, not perfection. I'm excited to see how your journaling goes. 

User: Thank you! I feel grateful for the support you provide. I’m looking forward to our next session.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m here to support you, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Let’s keep building on this momentum together.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session? I remember you mentioned that you were managing a family crisis quite well.

User: Hi! Yes, I feel like I handled that situation better than I expected. I was a bit anxious at first, but I found some confidence in my ability to cope. However, I still want to work on being more independent and not relying too much on my family.

Consultant: That's really great to hear! It sounds like you're making progress in developing your confidence. Let's dive deeper into your feelings. What specific aspects of independence would you like to focus on today?

User: I want to communicate better with my mom and friends without feeling anxious. Sometimes, I worry that I might say the wrong thing or disappoint them.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel anxious about communication, especially with those close to us. What do you think is the source of that worry? Are there any specific situations that trigger these feelings for you?

User: I think it's mostly because I care about their opinions and worry about judgment. I have a fear of not meeting their expectations, which makes me hesitate to express myself.

Consultant: It's normal to care about how others perceive us, but let's examine that fear a bit more. Do you remember a time when a conversation went well despite those worries? 

User: Yes, there was a time when I talked to my mom about school. I was really honest about my struggles, and she was supportive. I felt relieved afterward.

Consultant: That sounds like a positive experience! What do you think allowed that conversation to go well, and how can we apply that to other interactions you may feel anxious about?

User: I think being open and honest helped a lot. I suppose I need to remind myself that it’s okay to share my feelings, even if I fear their reaction.

Consultant: Absolutely! Recognizing the importance of honesty can be empowering. So, when you feel anxiety creeping in during a conversation, what could be a helpful thought to replace that fear of judgment?

User: Maybe I could remind myself that everyone has struggles and that being open might actually strengthen our bond instead of harming it.

Consultant: That's a wonderful perspective! Let's explore how you might practice this in a real-life situation. Is there an upcoming conversation where you could try this approach?

User: Yes, I’m planning to have a chat with my mom about some stress I’ve been feeling at school. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent opportunity! How might you initiate that conversation, keeping in mind the open and honest approach we discussed?

User: I could start by telling her that I’ve been feeling overwhelmed with certain subjects and that I just want to share what’s on my mind.

Consultant: That sounds like a great way to begin! Remember, sharing your feelings can pave the way for mutual understanding. How do you feel about practicing this with your mom?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but more prepared than before. I truly want to try it.

Consultant: It's entirely normal to feel nervous, but it’s great to hear that you're feeling more prepared. Let's talk about what kind of support you might need from me or any strategies we can plan for if things feel overwhelming during the conversation.

User: I think just having a reminder that it's okay to share openly would help. Also, maybe thinking about what I want to say beforehand.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! You can write down your main points to help structure your thoughts. What else can we work on to help you feel more at ease ahead of this conversation?

User: I think understanding more about how to deal with my anxieties in the moment would be useful.

Consultant: Let’s prepare for that by discussing some grounding techniques. When you start feeling anxious, what’s one practice you could use to ground yourself before speaking?

User: I could take a few deep breaths to calm myself down before I start talking.

Consultant: Deep breathing is an effective technique! You could also visualize the positive outcome of your conversation. How could you incorporate that idea into your preparation?

User: I could imagine my mom reacting positively and being supportive, which might ease my anxiety. 

Consultant: Visualization is a powerful tool! I encourage you to practice this image as you prepare for your talk. It’s all about building a positive mindset. How do you feel about your progress today?

User: I feel much better! Talking about this helps me see things clearly. I’m excited to try out the techniques we discussed.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! Before we wrap up, let’s summarize what you've learned today and create a small self-help plan. What key points do you want to remember going forward?

User: I want to remember to be open and honest, use deep breathing to manage my anxiety, and visualize positive outcomes.

Consultant: Excellent! Those points will serve you well in future conversations. Remember, you’re building skills to help maintain your independence. How do you feel about setting goals for the next step of your journey?

User: I want to focus on practicing these skills and becoming more independent. I'm feeling ready for this! 

Consultant: I believe you can achieve this! Remember that progress takes time, but you are already on the right path. If you ever feel overwhelmed, don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for sharing today—it's been a pleasure working with you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your support. I'm looking forward to our next session already!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm really glad to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling better overall. I've been able to communicate more openly with my mom and classmates, which feels good. I'm also optimistic about stopping my medication.

Consultant: It's wonderful to hear that you're feeling more open and optimistic. That shows significant progress. What's been the most positive change for you lately?

User: I think just being more comfortable talking to people has helped. I feel less anxious about social interactions.

Consultant: That’s a big step forward! Social interactions can be quite challenging, especially when dealing with anxiety. How do you think this increase in comfort will help you in your daily life moving forward?

User: I think it will make it easier for me to ask questions in class and maybe even build friendships, which I really want.

Consultant: That sounds like a great goal! Building friendships can provide support and happiness. Have you had any specific situations recently where you felt this comfort helping you?

User: Actually, yeah! I had a group project where I shared my ideas. I was nervous, but I spoke up anyway, and it felt good.

Consultant: That's fantastic! Speaking up in a group setting is an excellent achievement. What thoughts were going through your mind before and after you spoke up?

User: Before, I was really scared they'd think my ideas were silly. But after, I felt relieved and proud that I did it.

Consultant: That’s a beautiful reflection. It sounds like you challenged that initial fear and discovered a sense of pride afterward. How do you think you can apply this experience to future situations where you feel anxious?

User: I suppose I can remind myself that my thoughts might not be true and that I’m capable of contributing positively.

Consultant: Exactly! By recognizing those thoughts and adjusting your perspective, you can reduce anxiety. Is there a particular situation coming up that you feel might trigger anxiety?

User: Yes, I have a presentation next week, and I'm a bit worried about it.

Consultant: It's natural to feel anxious about a presentation. Let's explore what thoughts you have surrounding it. What specifically worries you?

User: I'm afraid I'll forget what to say or make mistakes.

Consultant: Those thoughts are quite common. If a friend were in the same situation, what advice would you give them?

User: I'd probably tell them to practice and that it's okay to make mistakes, everyone does.

Consultant: That’s excellent advice! Practicing and accepting mistakes can help alleviate some of that fear. How about we brainstorm a small plan together for preparing for your presentation?

User: That sounds helpful! Maybe I could practice in front of my mom or a few friends first.

Consultant: Practicing in front of supportive people is a great strategy. It can help you feel more comfortable and confident. How about also setting aside some time to visualize yourself giving the presentation successfully?

User: I like that idea. Visualizing success might help me feel less nervous.

Consultant: Absolutely. Visualization can be a powerful tool. Let’s discuss how you feel about your progress overall. Do you feel ready to manage these situations independently now?

User: I think so! I feel like I've learned a lot and can handle it with some support.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization. As we consider the next steps, what ideas do you have for maintaining this progress without medication?

User: I could keep practicing mindfulness and maybe stay connected with supportive friends.

Consultant: Those are great strategies! Mindfulness can help manage anxiety effectively. How do you feel about gradually reducing your medication with these new strategies in place?

User: I feel pretty good about it. I think I could manage without it for now, especially with your support.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that. It appears you have a solid foundation to build on. Let’s ensure you have a good plan for ongoing support. What steps can we outline together to help you through this transition?

User: Maybe regular check-ins with you to talk about any challenges and keep practicing my new skills.

Consultant: That sounds insightful! Regular check-ins will allow us to address any new challenges as they arise. Is there anything else you wish to discuss before we wrap up today?

User: No, I think we’ve covered everything. I feel really positive about moving forward.

Consultant: I’m so proud of the progress you’ve made! Remember, you’ve developed tools and strategies to help you through this. If you ever need to reach out, I'm here for you. 

User: Thank you so much! I appreciate all your help.

Consultant: You're very welcome! Take care and keep implementing those strategies. I’m confident you’ll do great!
