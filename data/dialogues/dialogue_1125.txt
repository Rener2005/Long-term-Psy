Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for our session today. I understand you've been feeling quite anxious, especially in social situations. Can you start by sharing a bit about what you've been experiencing lately?

User: Hi. Yes, it’s been really tough for me. I often feel overwhelmed and nervous, especially when I think about having to perform or speak in front of people. My recent psychological assessment made me feel like I really need help, and it hit my confidence hard.

Consultant: It sounds like you're facing significant challenges with your self-esteem and social anxiety. You want to feel more confident in public situations. What specific thoughts or feelings come up for you when you think about performing or speaking publicly?

User: I immediately feel this tightness in my chest and my mind races. I often think that everyone will judge me harshly if I mess up. I can't help but doubt my abilities, and that makes me want to avoid those situations altogether.

Consultant: I see, so it seems like you're experiencing a lot of fear about being judged by others. Those thoughts sound very overwhelming. When you’re in those moments, how do you usually cope with those feelings?

User: I usually just try to avoid the situations that make me anxious. I would rather skip an event than risk embarrassing myself. But deep down, I hate that I let my fears control me like that.

Consultant: Avoiding situations can provide short-term relief, but it sounds like it might be reinforcing your anxiety over time. What do you think could happen if you challenged that avoidance and faced those situations instead?

User: I’m not really sure. It feels like it would be unbearable. I can’t imagine feeling comfortable performing in front of others without getting really anxious. 

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. Let’s take a moment to explore those thoughts more deeply. When you think about performing, what exact thoughts cross your mind that contribute to your anxiety?

User: I think things like "What if I forget my lines?" or "What if everyone laughs at me?" I assume the worst possible outcomes, and that really freaks me out.

Consultant: Those thoughts sound very distressing. It seems like you’re engaging in a bit of “catastrophizing,” where you envision the worst-case scenario. Would you be open to discussing what evidence you have for those thoughts? Are there times when things did not go as badly as you expected?

User: I guess there have been times in the past when I thought I would fail, but it turned out okay. For instance, during a presentation in class, it wasn't perfect, but nobody laughed or criticized me. They were actually supportive.

Consultant: That’s a really good observation! It shows that sometimes the outcome is not as bad as we fear. How might you reframe those worries to create a more balanced perspective when you think about performing in the future?

User: I could remind myself that mistakes happen and that I still have people who support me. Maybe thinking about it as an opportunity rather than something I must perfect would help.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Shifting your perspective to view challenges as opportunities can be very empowering. What steps do you think you can take to incorporate that mindset in daily situations?

User: I could practice speaking in smaller, less intimidating groups first. Maybe I could also start sharing my thoughts or experiences with friends to build up my confidence before tackling bigger audiences.

Consultant: Those are excellent steps! Gradually exposing yourself to social situations can help diminish your anxiety over time. Would you like to set any specific goals for practice sessions, perhaps for this coming week? 

User: I think I could start with sharing something about my weekend with a close friend. Then, maybe later in the week, I could join a small group discussion.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful plan! Taking it step by step will help you build confidence. How do you feel about reaching these goals and facing those situations?

User: I feel a bit nervous but also excited. I think practicing in smaller groups could make it less daunting. But I know that I still might feel anxious.

Consultant: It’s totally normal to feel nervous! Remember, it’s part of the process. How about we also discuss some coping strategies you can use to calm those nerves when they arise during your practice sessions?

User: That would be helpful. I often feel lost in those moments of anxiety.

Consultant: We could consider techniques like deep breathing or visualization. For example, picturing yourself successfully engaging with others could help you feel more prepared. Would you be willing to try that technique?

User: Yes, that sounds doable. I can practice breathing exercises before I speak to help calm my nerves.

Consultant: Great! Practicing those techniques can empower you and help you regain control over your anxiety. As we wrap up today, let’s review your progress. You’ve acknowledged your fears, begun identifying how to challenge those thoughts, and created a plan for small steps forward. What stands out to you about our conversation today?

User: I feel like I’ve gained some clarity about my fear of performance. I now have a plan in place, and it helps to know that I can practice gradually.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! You’ve made significant progress in understanding your anxiety and creating a pathway forward. How will you remind yourself of these insights when you face challenging situations in the future?

User: I will write down my insights and keep reminding myself of the supportive moments from the past. Plus, recalling my goals to practice makes it easier to face my fears.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid strategy. Remember, this is a journey, and it’s perfectly okay to feel nervous. You’re taking important steps toward achieving your goals. If you find yourself needing support along the way, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate that. I feel more hopeful about tackling these situations now.

Consultant: You're very welcome. As we conclude our session today, remind yourself of the progress you've made. I believe in your ability to face these challenges. I look forward to hearing about your experiences in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I’ll work on my plan and see you next time.

Consultant: I’m looking forward to it! Take care until then!

Consultant: Hello! I’m really glad you’re here today. I’d like to start by checking in on how you’ve been feeling lately, especially with the increased opportunities to speak in class. 

User: Hi. I've been really anxious, to be honest. Every time I'm invited to speak, I just freeze up and feel like I can't do it. I end up turning down those chances because I'm terrified of making a fool of myself.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable to feel anxious in those situations, especially when you have a fear of embarrassment. Can you share a bit about what thoughts go through your mind right before you’re supposed to speak?

User: I often think that everyone will judge me or that I’ll forget what to say. I imagine scenarios where I just stand there in silence, and it feels awful.

Consultant: It’s clear that those thoughts are really impacting how you feel. You mentioned the fear of being judged—do you think these thoughts are realistic, or might they be a bit extreme?

User: I guess they are extreme. But it feels very real to me in those moments. It’s like I’m sure everyone is scrutinizing me.

Consultant: That feeling of being scrutinized can be overwhelming. Let’s try to challenge those thoughts a little. If a friend were in your situation, what would you tell them about the likelihood of such negative judgment?

User: I’d probably tell them that people are usually busy thinking about themselves and not focusing on others as much as we might think.

Consultant: Exactly! That’s a great insight. It sounds like you already have a more balanced perspective. Let’s explore how you can apply that thinking to your own situation. What might help you remember this perspective when you’re faced with speaking in front of others?

User: I could maybe think of it as just sharing ideas rather than performing. That might take the pressure off a bit.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful approach. Shifting the focus from performing to sharing can help reduce anxiety. Speaking of sharing, how do you feel about practicing this with me in a safe environment? 

User: I think that could help. I’d feel safer practicing with you first.

Consultant: Perfect! Let’s start with a simple role-play where I take on the role of your classmates and you share a brief idea or opinion. What topic would you like to talk about for this practice?

User: Maybe I could talk about a recent book I read. It’s something I feel somewhat confident about.

Consultant: That sounds like a great choice! Whenever you’re ready, go ahead and start sharing about the book. I’m here to support you.

User: Okay, um... I read a book called "The Alchemist." It’s about... well, it follows a young shepherd named Santiago who dreams of finding treasure.

Consultant: Great start! What do you think makes Santiago's journey significant?

User: I think it’s about following one’s dreams and listening to your heart. It’s quite inspiring, actually.

Consultant: Absolutely! That’s a key element of the story. Now, let’s consider how you felt delivering that. What thoughts and feelings did you experience while speaking?

User: I still felt nervous, but it wasn’t as bad as I expected. I even managed to remember some details.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization! You managed to share your thoughts despite feeling nervous. How might we build on this experience for when you're in a real classroom setting?

User: Maybe I can remind myself that it’s okay to feel nervous and that I can start with topics I’m confident about.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy. Gradually building your comfort level by choosing topics you enjoy can really help. Let’s discuss specific strategies to manage your anxiety right before you speak. What methods have you tried so far?

User: I usually just freeze and end up overthinking things. I haven’t really tried anything specific.

Consultant: It might be helpful to incorporate some breathing techniques or positive affirmations before you start. Would you be open to trying a breathing exercise together?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I’ve heard breathing can help but never really practiced it.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath together. Inhale slowly through your nose… hold for a moment… and now exhale slowly through your mouth. How did that feel?

User: It felt okay. I feel a bit more relaxed now.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Regularly practicing this kind of deep breathing can help manage anxiety in real situations. How do you plan to integrate this technique before your next speaking opportunity?

User: I could remind myself to breathe deeply before I speak. That might help calm my nerves.

Consultant: Absolutely! And remember to prepare your thoughts in advance if you have the opportunity, as that can also boost your confidence. As we wrap up today, what do you think is the biggest takeaway from our session?

User: I think I’ve realized that I can tackle this anxiety gradually and that it’s okay to feel nervous. Also, practicing helps.

Consultant: That's a huge and empowering insight! You’ve certainly taken important steps today. Moving forward, think about how you can gradually expose yourself to more speaking opportunities while using the techniques we discussed. If you need support, I’m here for you. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate this. It feels good to know I have some strategies now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, you're doing great, and every step counts. I look forward to our next session. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. I remember that you’ve been working on dealing with anxiety related to speaking in public. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi, I’ve been really anxious. I made an attempt to go on stage during a student club event, but I ended up feeling too tense and had to step down midway. It’s frustrating because I want to improve.

Consultant: That sounds discouraging, and it's understandable to feel that way. Stepping out of your comfort zone can be really challenging. Can you share some specific thoughts or feelings that went through your mind right before and during your attempt on stage?

User: Well, right before going up, I was thinking about how I might mess up, and what people would think of me. It felt like everyone was judging me, which just made my heart race even more.

Consultant: That’s a very common reaction, and it can intensify your anxiety. It seems like those thoughts caused a lot of pressure for you. Have you noticed if these kinds of thoughts show up in other situations as well?

User: Yes, definitely. When I have to present in class or anytime I'm in the spotlight, those thoughts come flooding back. It just makes everything worse.

Consultant: Alright, it's clear that these thoughts are having a strong impact on your emotions. Let’s work on identifying and challenging these negative thoughts together. Can we start with examining those beliefs? For instance, how accurate do you think those thoughts about being judged are?

User: I guess I don’t really know if people are judging me harshly. It might just be my imagination...

Consultant: Exactly! It’s a good step that you recognize that. Sometimes our minds can paint a more dramatic picture than reality. What if we tried to think of alternative explanations for the crowd's behavior? What could you tell yourself instead when you are up there?

User: Maybe I could think that they are there to support me or just focused on their own issues. I guess that would take some pressure off.

Consultant: Yes, that's a wonderful reframe! It can really help to shift the focus from fear of judgment to understanding that everyone is human. Now, to build on this, let’s explore some techniques you can use if anxiety strikes again. Have you ever tried deep breathing exercises?

User: I’ve heard of them, but I’ve never really tried them seriously.

Consultant: Deep breathing can be very helpful! It's a simple way to calm your nervous system. I can guide you through a quick exercise. Would you like to give it a try right now?

User: Sure, that sounds helpful.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a deep breath in through your nose for a count of four... 1, 2, 3, 4... Now hold it for a moment... and slowly exhale through your mouth for a count of four... 1, 2, 3, 4. How does that feel?

User: That actually feels nice. I didn’t realize it could help calm me like that.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You can do this right before going on stage to help center yourself. Would you like to talk about how to incorporate this into your routine before performing?

User: Yes, I think I need a plan. I usually just feel overwhelmed right before going up.

Consultant: How about this? You can commit to practicing deep breathing for a few minutes right before your turn. Perhaps also visualize yourself succeeding on stage. How does that sound to you?

User: That could work! Visualizing myself doing well might help lessen the stress.

Consultant: Absolutely! Visualization can be a powerful tool. Let’s also set a small, achievable goal for your next performance. What do you think you can realistically aim for?

User: Maybe I could aim to stay on stage for at least a minute this time, instead of focusing on perfection.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, and it feels manageable. Focusing on the process rather than perfection will help build your confidence. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel more hopeful. Having a goal makes it seem less daunting.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Remember, every step counts and helps build your self-efficacy. Do you think you can also start journaling your experiences after each performance? It may help to reflect on what went well.

User: Yes, I can definitely do that. It might help me notice the positive feedback more.

Consultant: Absolutely! Documenting your successes is a great way to reinforce those positive experiences. As we begin to wrap up today's session, what do you think has been your biggest takeaway?

User: I think learning to challenge my negative thoughts and using breathing techniques are really valuable. I feel more prepared now.

Consultant: That’s a significant insight! As you move forward, reflect on these techniques and remember to be gentle with yourself as you practice. How do you feel about your anxiety now compared to when we started?

User: I feel more confident, but I know I still need to work on it. I’m still a little worried about performing again.

Consultant: That’s completely normal. It’s all part of the journey. You’ve made great strides today. Remember, the more you practice these techniques, the more comfortable you’ll feel. If you find yourself needing support again, feel free to reach out. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your guidance.

Consultant: It’s my pleasure! I believe in your ability to push through these challenges. Take care and see you next time!

Consultant: Hello, D! I'm glad you're here today. It sounds like you've made some progress since our last session. How are you feeling about your recent experiences with public speaking?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit more confident since I successfully completed that self-introduction. But there's still this nagging worry about feeling anxious again if I have to perform in front of a larger audience.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've gained some confidence from the positive feedback you received! It's completely normal to have concerns about feeling anxious in future performances. Can you share more about what specifically makes you worried about larger audiences?

User: I think it's the fear of getting judged. When I performed before, I was really nervous, but the support from my friends helped. In a bigger crowd, I feel like the pressure to impress would be much greater, and I might forget what I want to say.

Consultant: That fear of judgment is a common concern, especially when we find ourselves in larger settings. However, it sounds like the support from your friends had a significant positive impact on your performance. How do you think you can use that support in future situations?

User: I guess I could invite some friends to watch me practice. Having their encouragement might help ease my nerves.

Consultant: Absolutely! Having a supportive audience can really make a difference. Practicing in front of a smaller group not only helps you gain confidence but also familiarizes you with performing in front of others. How did you feel when you received positive feedback after your introduction?

User: It felt really good! I was surprised by how much their compliments helped me feel more at ease. I often doubt myself, but their kind words reminded me that I can do it.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Acknowledging positive feedback is essential in building confidence. Have you thought about keeping a record of such compliments or experiences to refer back to when you're feeling unsure?

User: I haven’t really done that before, but it sounds like a good idea. It might help me remember the times I’ve succeeded rather than just focusing on my anxiety.

Consultant: Keeping a record can definitely reinforce those positive experiences. Let's explore how to create a system for you to document these moments. How about starting with a journal entry after each performance or practice session, noting the positive aspects and any feedback you receive?

User: That sounds manageable! I can write down what went well and how I felt during the performance. 

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Reflecting on your experiences will help train your mind to focus more on the positives. After you write these entries, you can revisit them whenever you feel anxious about performing again. How does that proposal sound to you?

User: I think that would really help! I can look back at those moments of success instead of just stressing about what might go wrong.

Consultant: Exactly! This practice can shift your focus from worries to memories of achievement. Also, let’s talk about strategies you can use right before a performance to help reduce anxiety. Have you tried any relaxation techniques?

User: Not really. I usually just dive right in and hope for the best.

Consultant: It might be helpful to incorporate some relaxation techniques before performing. Simple breathing exercises or positive affirmations can calm your nerves. Would you be willing to try a couple and see how they work for you?

User: I’m open to that! I want to learn how to manage my anxiety better.

Consultant: That's a great mindset to have, D! Let’s try a breathing exercise together. When you feel anxious, can you take a deep breath in for four counts, hold it for four, and then exhale for four? We can practice it now if you'd like.

User: Sure, let’s do it!

Consultant: Okay, let’s take a deep breath in together... (inhales) one, two, three, four... now hold it... (holds) one, two, three, four... now exhale... (exhales) one, two, three, four. How did that feel for you?

User: I actually felt a bit calmer after that! It’s nice to take a moment to breathe instead of rushing in.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, you can use this technique any time you're about to perform or feel anxious. It will help ground you and bring your focus back to the present. How comfortable do you feel about using this technique before your next opportunity?

User: I feel pretty good about it. I’ll definitely give it a try!

Consultant: That’s excellent! In our next sessions, we can talk about how it went and continue building on these strategies. Remember, it’s all about taking small steps. What are some of your goals for the next few weeks concerning your public speaking?

User: I want to practice in front of my friends a few times and also keep track of my successes in my journal.

Consultant: Those are fantastic goals! It sounds like you have a solid plan in place. As you work on these, try to remain gentle with yourself. Progress may take time, and that’s perfectly okay. 

User: Thank you, I appreciate that reminder. I’m excited to put everything into practice!

Consultant: I’m excited for you too, D! It’s been a pleasure discussing your journey. Remember, I'm here to support you along the way. If you need anything or want to share your progress, feel free to reach out.

User: I will! This session has really helped me feel more prepared. Thank you!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! You've done great work today. I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time. Take care until then!
###################
Consultant: Hello D! I'm really glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session? 

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better about myself. I tried to apply some of the techniques we discussed, especially during group work. I felt more at ease presenting and even received positive feedback from my teammates.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you're making significant progress. Can you share what specific techniques you used that helped you feel more at ease during the presentation?

User: I focused on my breathing before speaking, and I also reminded myself that it was okay to make mistakes. It helped me to be more present instead of worrying about what might go wrong.

Consultant: It’s great to see how you're applying those techniques! How do you feel about your ability to present in front of others now compared to before?

User: I still feel a bit nervous, but it's not as overwhelming as it used to be. I think I'm starting to accept that some level of anxiety is normal.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel a bit anxious, and recognizing that is a huge step. In what ways would you like to continue pushing yourself to improve your confidence?

User: I want to challenge myself to speak up more in class discussions. Sometimes, I still hold back because I'm scared of saying something wrong.

Consultant: That's a great goal! Speaking up in class can definitely enhance your confidence. How do you think you could start integrating that into your routine?

User: Maybe I can start by preparing a few points to share for each class. If I have something ready, I might feel more confident to speak up.

Consultant: Preparation is an excellent strategy. It can give you that extra boost of confidence. How about setting a goal for yourself? For example, aiming to share at least one point in each class for the next week.

User: That sounds achievable! I could also reward myself after I manage to do it.

Consultant: I love that idea! Rewards can be very motivating. What kind of reward are you thinking of?

User: I might treat myself to a nice coffee or something relaxed like watching my favorite show.

Consultant: Those sound like great incentives! Now, considering how you felt about your presentation skills, what aspects do you think you still want to improve?

User: I guess I still want to work on conveying my thoughts more clearly and confidently, especially when I get surprised or interrupted.

Consultant: That’s a valuable skill to develop. How do you feel about practicing that—perhaps through some role-playing or simulations of such situations?

User: Role-playing could be helpful! It might prepare me for unexpected interruptions and help me think on my feet.

Consultant: Absolutely, practicing that way can increase your comfort level. Would you be willing to try a little exercise like that during our next session?

User: Yes, I would love to! That way, I can become more familiar with handling those unpredictable moments.

Consultant: Great! Let’s plan to incorporate that. As we move forward, what thoughts do you have about tracking your progress alongside the challenges you’re setting for yourself?

User: I think keeping some notes on my feelings and experiences could help. It would show me how much I’ve grown and what I still need to work on.

Consultant: That sounds like an effective approach! Measuring your progress can really solidify the changes you’re making. What will you focus on when you review your notes?

User: I’d like to look at how often I pushed myself to speak up and how I handled my nerves when I did. 

Consultant: Excellent focus! Tracking your behavior and feelings surrounding these challenges can really highlight your growth over time. Do you feel ready to take that journey?

User: Yes, I feel a bit nervous about it, but mostly excited. I want to see how far I can go!

Consultant: That’s a fantastic mindset, D! Embracing both excitement and nervousness is part of the journey. Remember, it’s about gradual improvement, not perfection. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. It makes me feel more capable of tackling these challenges.

Consultant: I'm here for you, and I believe in your ability to tackle these goals. As we wrap up today, what is the biggest takeaway you’ll carry into the next week?

User: I think it's to be kinder to myself as I challenge myself and recognize that it's okay to be anxious while also growing.

Consultant: That’s a powerful takeaway! Self-compassion is key to growth. Keep that in mind as you move forward. 

User: I will! Thank you for today's session. I'm looking forward to our next one!

Consultant: You're very welcome, D! I'm excited to see how you progress. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything before then. Have a great week ahead!
###################
Consultant: Hello D, I'm really glad to see you again for today's session. It's fantastic to hear about your recent experience organizing and leading an event. How are you feeling about that accomplishment now?

User: Hi! I'm feeling pretty good about it, actually. It was a bit nerve-wracking at first, but I managed to get through it. I feel more confident now, and it feels great to have led a small gathering successfully.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you faced some nerves but managed to channel that energy into a successful event. How do you think this experience has impacted your self-confidence and your view of what you can achieve in social situations?

User: I think it's really boosted my confidence. I used to think that I couldn’t handle being in front of a crowd, but now I feel like I can handle things better than I used to. It makes me want to try more activities like this.

Consultant: It’s great to see how you’ve recognized that growth in yourself. What kinds of activities are you thinking about trying next? 

User: I’m considering joining more club events or maybe even helping out with larger gatherings. I really want to build on this momentum.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Engaging in more activities could certainly help reinforce the confidence you’ve gained. How do you feel about the idea of seeking out these opportunities proactively?

User: I feel excited about it! But there’s still a part of me that worries—what if I can't manage it or if I get too anxious again?

Consultant: It's completely normal to have those worries, especially after stepping out of your comfort zone. Let's explore that thought: when you imagine the possibility of feeling anxious again, what exact thoughts come to your mind?

User: I guess I think that everyone will notice if I start to get nervous, and that they'll judge me for it. 

Consultant: It makes sense that you would worry about being judged. But let me ask you—when you're in that situation, do you think everyone truly notices your anxiety as much as you might believe?

User: I don't know. Maybe not everyone pays attention... But it feels so strong in the moment.

Consultant: It can feel overwhelming in those moments, but often, what we fear is not as visible to others as we think. If a friend were in your shoes, experiencing anxiety, what would you tell them?

User: I’d probably tell them that it's okay to be anxious and that people are usually more understanding than they expect. 

Consultant: Exactly! Now, let’s try to apply that same understanding to yourself. How might you view your own anxiety in future situations differently, knowing that it doesn't define your whole experience?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it's natural and that it doesn't mean I won't succeed at something. 

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, D. Skipping the judgment and embracing the possibility of learning from anxiety can be liberating. Are there specific strategies you think could help you when you start to feel that anxiety creeping in at upcoming events?

User: Maybe I could practice some grounding techniques or breathing exercises beforehand. I’ll also try to remind myself of what I learned from this last experience.

Consultant: Those sound like excellent strategies! Grounding techniques and deep breathing can be very effective in managing anxiety. It might also help to visualize yourself leading future activities successfully. How do you feel about incorporating visualization into your preparation routine?

User: Yeah, that sounds like a good idea! I could envision myself being relaxed and confident.

Consultant: Visualization can be a powerful tool—it will reinforce your confidence and help reshape your expectations. As we wrap up today’s session, let’s reflect on how you can continue building on your progress. What do you think is the next step you’d like to take towards engaging more in group activities?

User: I will look for more events to participate in and maybe volunteer for some roles. I want to keep this momentum going.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Taking those steps can help you maintain and grow your newfound confidence. Before our next session, I encourage you to note any experiences you have, both positive and challenging. We can discuss those together when we meet again.

User: I will! Thank you for your help today. I feel more ready to take on new challenges.

Consultant: I'm really glad to hear that, D. You’ve made significant progress, and I believe you are capable of maintaining it. Remember, I’m here to support you whenever you need. Looking forward to our next session!
