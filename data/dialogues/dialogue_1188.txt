Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here today. How are you feeling about everything going on in your life right now?

User: Hi. I feel a bit lost. Now that I'm in my third year of college, I’m questioning my future and my personal growth. I have a lot of internal conflicts about my relationships and this sense of loneliness. I really want to find a sense of security.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a significant amount of confusion and perhaps some loneliness as well. It's completely normal to feel this way, especially with all the changes happening. Can you tell me more about what specific feelings or experiences are contributing to these thoughts?

User: I have this fear that I may not be able to make meaningful connections. I want to connect with people but also feel anxious about it. Sometimes I want to reach out but then I hesitate because I don’t want to bother anyone.

Consultant: I hear you, and it's understandable to feel that way. This fear of reaching out can often stem from a worry about how others will perceive us. Let's explore that a bit more. What thoughts go through your mind when you think about connecting with others?

User: I often think that they might not really care about me or that I might not be interesting enough for them. Those thoughts make it hard for me to initiate conversations or deepen friendships.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts create a cycle of anxiety and hesitation for you. Would you say that these thoughts contribute significantly to your feelings of loneliness?

User: Yes, definitely. It makes me feel trapped in this situation where I crave connection but feel that I can't achieve it.

Consultant: I appreciate your openness, and it's clear that you're reflecting on your emotions. It's helpful to recognize these patterns. Let's try identifying some of those negative thoughts more clearly. Can you recall a specific moment when you felt anxious about reaching out to someone?

User: Just last week, I wanted to text a classmate I kind of get along with, but I kept thinking, "What if she thinks I'm annoying or just doesn’t want to talk to me?"

Consultant: That’s a very real concern, and it’s something many people can relate to. Let’s examine that thought: how likely do you think it is that she would truly feel that way about you? Can you think of any evidence that might suggest otherwise?

User: I guess there's no real evidence. She has been friendly enough in class, and even if she didn’t want to talk, it might just be a busy day for her.

Consultant: Exactly! It's easy to jump to conclusions, but when we look at the evidence, it can often tell a different story. If you were to reframe that thought, what might you say to yourself to ease that anxiety?

User: Maybe I could think that she might actually appreciate me reaching out. It could be nice for both of us.

Consultant: That's a powerful reframe! By focusing on the positive possibility that your classmate might enjoy the connection, you’re opening the door to interaction instead of shutting it. How does that make you feel?

User: It feels a bit relieving to think about it that way. I still feel nervous, but maybe it's worth trying.

Consultant: That's a great mindset! It's completely normal to feel nervous, but taking small steps can help build your confidence. What’s one small action you could take to reach out to her this week?

User: I could start with just saying hi next time we have class. That feels manageable.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! By starting small, you're giving yourself a chance to ease into building that connection without overwhelming yourself. Is there anything else that feels important for us to explore in how you approach your relationships?

User: I think my fear of being a burden is a big part of it. I often think that asking for help or reaching out makes me weak.

Consultant: That’s a common concern, but reaching out for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. It shows that you value your relationships and that you’re willing to be vulnerable. How does that perspective resonate with you?

User: It’s a different way of looking at things. I guess I never thought of it that way before. It makes me want to try reaching out more.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, expressing your needs and emotions can strengthen your connections rather than weaken them. As we continue to work together, we can focus on developing strategies to help you feel more comfortable initiating these kinds of relationships.

User: Yes, I’d like that. I really want to overcome this struggle.

Consultant: That determination is wonderful! As we look at strategies, we might explore some skills to manage anxiety when reaching out. Have you ever tried any techniques to calm yourself in anxious moments?

User: I’ve read about breathing exercises, but I’ve never really practiced them.

Consultant: Breathing exercises can be a helpful tool for managing anxiety. If you’re open to it, we could practice a simple technique together. Would you like to try it?

User: Sure, that sounds good.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment to focus on our breath. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four… hold it for a moment… now exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Let’s do that a couple more times. 

User: That feels nice. I can see how this could help when I’m feeling anxious.

Consultant: Absolutely! This is a simple yet effective way to ground yourself. Over time, integrating breathing exercises into your routine can enhance your resilience in social situations. As we wrap up today, what’s one key takeaway you’d like to hold on to from this session?

User: I think it’s that I can change my thoughts about reaching out and that it’s okay to ask for help. That feels empowering.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic takeaway! Acknowledging that you can reshape your thoughts is a powerful step toward creating those connections you desire. When we meet again, we can explore more strategies to support you as you continue this journey.

User: Thank you! I look forward to our next session.

Consultant: Hello, I'm glad you're here today! How are you feeling about our session?

User: Hi. I'm feeling a bit anxious. I've been struggling to share my thoughts during group projects at school. It worries me that I might not express myself well.

Consultant: I see that expressing yourself in those situations is causing you anxiety. Can you tell me more about what specifically worries you when you try to communicate your ideas?

User: I fear that my classmates won't take me seriously or think my ideas are silly. It's hard for me to speak up even when I have something to say.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable to worry about how others may perceive you, but let's explore this fear a bit. What thoughts go through your mind when you think about sharing your ideas?

User: I often think, "What if they laugh at me?" or "What if I sound stupid?" Those thoughts stop me from speaking up.

Consultant: Those thoughts are quite negative, and it's important to recognize their impact. How do those thoughts make you feel when you are in a group setting?

User: They make me feel really anxious and small. I just want to disappear at that moment.

Consultant: It’s valid to feel that way when you’re overwhelmed with negative thoughts. Let's challenge those beliefs. What evidence do you have that supports the idea that your classmates would laugh at you?

User: I don’t have solid evidence. Maybe it’s just my fear speaking. But once I start thinking like that, it makes me even more scared.

Consultant: It sounds like these beliefs are based on fear rather than fact. If a friend were in your position, how would you advise them to see the situation differently?

User: I would probably tell them it’s okay to share their ideas, that everyone has their own thoughts and it matters.

Consultant: Exactly! This perspective can be empowering. Let's try to apply that mindset to yourself. What would it feel like to give yourself permission to share, even just a little?

User: I guess it would feel liberating. I mean, if I think my ideas matter, I’d probably be less scared.

Consultant: That’s a great realization, H! This can be a starting point for building your confidence. How about we discuss some small steps you can take to practice sharing your thoughts with your classmates?

User: Yeah, that sounds good. I think starting small would help.

Consultant: A good approach could be preparing just one small idea to share in your next group discussion. You could even write it down beforehand. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds manageable! I could jot down my thoughts before class.

Consultant: Yes, and you can remind yourself that your ideas are valid. Also, practice saying your idea out loud to yourself. This can help ease your anxiety before you share with the group. How do you feel about that?

User: I like that idea. I think practicing will help me feel more prepared.

Consultant: Wonderful! As you use these strategies, let’s also keep reflecting on your feelings. If you feel anxious, notice it without judgment. It’s okay to feel this way; what matters is how you respond.

User: I suppose being aware of my feelings can help reduce the pressure I put on myself.

Consultant: Definitely! Awareness is key. It’s important to acknowledge your feelings while also reminding yourself that they don’t define your worth or your speaking abilities. What do you think might be the biggest challenge in putting this into practice?

User: I think it would be remembering to challenge my negative thoughts in the moment when I'm anxious.

Consultant: That’s a great insight. Perhaps we can work on creating a mantra or a reassuring statement you can repeat to yourself when you start to feel anxious. How about something like, “My thoughts matter, and it’s okay to share them”?

User: I like that! Having a mantra might help me focus.

Consultant: I'm glad you find it helpful! Repeating that to yourself can serve as a positive anchor. After you try sharing your thoughts in your next group, how about we reflect on your experience in our next session?

User: That sounds like a plan. I hope it goes well—I'm nervous but also kind of excited.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel that mix of excitement and nervousness! Remember, progress takes time, and every small step counts. I’m here to support you through this journey.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I’ll try to implement these strategies.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing about your experiences. Let’s work together to build your confidence in expressing yourself. You’re capable of more than you know. 

User: I hope so! I’ll do my best to keep that in mind.

Consultant: That’s the spirit, H! I believe in your ability to grow through this process. When we meet next time, we can discuss what strategies worked for you and any challenges you faced. 

User: Great! I’m feeling more hopeful already.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! You’ve already taken a step toward change by being here today. Remember to be kind to yourself during this journey. 

User: I will! Thank you for reminding me about self-compassion.

Consultant: Of course! Self-compassion is crucial as you navigate this. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need to talk before our next session. 

User: I definitely will. This has been really helpful. 

Consultant: I’m happy to hear that, H! Let’s continue to build on this progress next time. Take care until we meet again! 

User: Thank you! I’m looking forward to our next session.
###################
Consultant: Hello H! I’m really glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a mix of emotions. I am still frustrated about the misunderstanding with my friend. I really want to fix our relationship, but I don’t know how to approach it.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel frustrated when it comes to important relationships. Can you share more about what specifically is bothering you about the misunderstanding?

User: Well, I feel like I wasn’t heard and that my feelings were dismissed. It makes me doubt if my friend values our friendship as much as I do.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re feeling unappreciated and worried about the value of your friendship. What do you think your friend’s perspective might be in this situation?

User: I haven’t really thought about it from her side. I guess she could be feeling misunderstood too. I just assumed she was upset with me.

Consultant: That’s a great insight, H. Trying to see things from your friend’s perspective could help. What would it feel like to consider her feelings?

User: It might ease my frustration a bit. I think she’s been stressed about her own things, which could explain her reactions.

Consultant: Absolutely! It’s important to consider the context. Would you feel comfortable reaching out to her and acknowledging that she might be going through a tough time?

User: I think I could do that. But I’m still nervous about her response. What if she doesn’t want to talk?

Consultant: It's normal to feel nervous about reaching out. Let’s break it down. What would be a good first step for you to initiate that conversation?

User: Maybe I could send her a message asking how she’s doing first. Just to open a line of communication.

Consultant: That sounds like a thoughtful approach! How do you think she might respond to that?

User: I hope she’ll appreciate it. But I’m still worried she’ll be distant.

Consultant: It’s okay to have those worries. What’s a realistic expectation for her response, considering what she might be going through?

User: I guess she might just need some time to cool off. I should be prepared for that.

Consultant: Yes, being prepared for various outcomes can help you manage any disappointment. How do you feel about expressing your feelings in the message too?

User: I’d like to be honest about how I felt but I’m afraid it might create more tension.

Consultant: It’s important to express your feelings honestly, while also being respectful of hers. You could say something like, “I felt hurt, but I understand you might be dealing with a lot.” What do you think about that?

User: That sounds like a good idea. It shows understanding, but also shares my feelings.

Consultant: Exactly! It opens the door for a dialogue. How do you feel about practicing how to phrase that?

User: Sure! I can try writing it down. It might help me feel less anxious.

Consultant: That’s a great strategy! Go ahead and draft your message. Remember, this is a chance to connect, not just to resolve the misunderstanding.

User: Okay, I’ll try that. I want our friendship to be stronger after this.

Consultant: That's a positive mindset to have! How are you feeling about taking this step now?

User: I feel a little more optimistic. Maybe this will help clear the air.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s a step towards rebuilding trust. What’s the next action you’ll take after sending the message?

User: If she responds positively, I’d like to suggest meeting to talk more in person.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful idea! Meeting in person can really strengthen the connection. What do you think you would like to focus on during that meeting?

User: I want to make sure we both share our sides clearly and understand each other better.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Practicing active listening will be really helpful. How do you feel about that part of the conversation?

User: I think I need to remind myself to listen more and interrupt less.

Consultant: That's a great intention, H. Remember, showing your friend that you care about her feelings will create a more open environment. Are there any specific strategies you’d like to use to promote active listening?

User: I can repeat back what she says to show I understand, and ask her clarifying questions.

Consultant: Those are excellent strategies! They show that you’re engaging with her thoughts sincerely. How do you feel about implementing these during your conversation?

User: I feel more prepared. I think practicing these skills could really help.

Consultant: I’m glad you're feeling more equipped! As we conclude our session today, what would you like to carry forward into your next steps with your friend?

User: I want to focus on understanding her perspective and being open about my feelings without escalating things.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic goal, H. It sounds like you’re ready to approach this with empathy. Remember, building deep connections takes time. If you need to explore more, I’m here for you.

User: Thank you! This session has really helped me clarify my thoughts. I’m feeling more hopeful!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m glad to hear that. Good luck with reaching out to your friend, and remember today’s takeaways. I look forward to hearing how it goes in our next session!
###################
Consultant: Hello, H! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, especially after participating in those campus activities?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a mix of excitement and caution. It's been great getting to know new friends through teamwork, but I'm still unsure about getting too close to them.

Consultant: It sounds like you're open to the positive experiences of teamwork but still feel a bit hesitant about forming deeper connections. Can you tell me more about what makes you cautious about deepening these friendships?

User: I think I just have this fear of being vulnerable. I want to connect, but I worry about relying too much on others or what they might think of me if I share too much.

Consultant: That makes a lot of sense. Vulnerability can feel risky, especially when it comes to forming close relationships. What do you think could help you feel more secure when interacting with these new friends?

User: Maybe if I could set some boundaries about what I want to share, that might help. But it's just hard to know what those should be.

Consultant: Setting boundaries is a great strategy to protect your emotional space while still allowing yourself to connect. What are some topics or feelings that you feel comfortable sharing with them?

User: I think I can share light things like hobbies or school activities. But when it comes to emotions or personal challenges, I really hesitate.

Consultant: It's fantastic that you have identified some safe topics! Let’s explore the emotions and challenges that you find harder to discuss. What do you think about sharing those with friends you trust?

User: I guess I could try, but I'm afraid of their judgment or of coming off as weak.

Consultant: It’s completely understandable to feel that way. Let's think about how you could test the waters in low-stakes situations. What small steps could you take to gradually open up to them?

User: Maybe I could share a minor frustration about school first. Something that’s not too intense.

Consultant: That's a brilliant idea! Sharing something lighter can help build trust without overwhelming you. How did you feel about your interactions in the group during those activities?

User: I felt included and appreciated, which was nice. But after that, I still felt hesitant to share deeper parts of myself.

Consultant: Feeling included is a significant first step. That's a good foundation for trust! How would you feel about discussing certain experiences or opinions during your next group interaction, perhaps involving those lighter topics?

User: I think I could manage that. It might lead to more comfortable discussions over time.

Consultant: Absolutely! This gradual approach could help you assess their responses and see how you feel afterward. How do you usually react when you think about sharing more about yourself?

User: I often feel anxious and think of all the worst-case scenarios. It can be really overwhelming.

Consultant: That anxiety is understandable, especially when the idea of sharing feels daunting. Let’s challenge some of those negative thoughts. What evidence do you have that sharing could lead to those worst-case scenarios?

User: I guess I don’t really have any solid evidence. I’m just afraid of being judged or not being accepted.

Consultant: That fear is indeed common, but it's essential to differentiate between possibility and probability. What might happen if you didn't allow those fears to dictate your actions?

User: Maybe I could find out that sharing isn't as bad as I think. They might actually be supportive.

Consultant: Exactly! And when you focus on the potential for positive outcomes, how does that make you feel about connecting with them?

User: It makes me feel a little hopeful. I just need to remind myself of that before I engage in conversation.

Consultant: Hope is a powerful emotion. As you begin the process of connecting more with your friends, what strategies can you use to keep that feeling of hope alive?

User: I could write down positive experiences I have with them to reflect on later. That might help me feel encouraged.

Consultant: That's a wonderful strategy! Keeping a positive journal can help reinforce your feelings of safety and connection. What other goals would you like to focus on to keep advancing in this area?

User: I want to be more confident in social situations. Maybe I can also set mini-goals for myself regarding sharing with others.

Consultant: Setting mini-goals is a fantastic approach! It allows you to take manageable steps while building your confidence. What’s one mini-goal you would like to start with?

User: I think I’ll aim to share one personal thought with a friend this week, just to see how it goes.

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect plan! Share something that's a little more personal but still feels safe. After you do that, how do you plan to reflect on the experience?

User: I’ll probably think about how the conversation went and write it down afterward. It’ll help me track my progress.

Consultant: Great! Tracking your progress will give you valuable insights and help you stay encouraged. Now, as we wrap up our session, how are you feeling about your ability to connect with your friends?

User: I feel more hopeful and energized. I think I can actually try opening up a bit more now.

Consultant: I'm so glad to hear that, H! Remember, it's a gradual process, and it's okay to take small steps. You're well on your way to building those connections. If you ever need to revisit these discussions, I'm here to support you.
###################
Consultant: Hello H! I'm glad to see you again today. It sounds like you've had some recent successes, which is wonderful. How are you feeling about everything?

User: Hi! I feel a bit more confident after winning that award at school. But I still have this nagging feeling about what I want to do in the future. It’s like I’m not sure where to focus my energy.

Consultant: It's great to hear that your confidence has received a boost! It’s totally normal to feel uncertain about your future direction, especially after experiencing success. What are some thoughts you have regarding your future goals?

User: I want to explore different paths and find something that really resonates with me. But at the same time, I feel overwhelmed and don’t know how to start. I don’t want to waste time.

Consultant: I can understand why that would feel overwhelming. Exploring different paths can be exciting but also daunting. Let’s break this down together. What are some activities or subjects that you’ve enjoyed in the past that could give us a clue about your interests?

User: I've always enjoyed volunteering and being involved in community activities. Meeting new people and helping out makes me feel good, but I’m worried it might not lead to a career.

Consultant: It sounds like you find fulfillment in connecting with others and contributing to your community. That’s a fantastic strength to have! Let’s clarify further—how do you see this passion for volunteering shaping your career aspirations?

User: I guess I hope to find a job that allows me to help others, but I don’t really know what that looks like. Sometimes I think about social work or education, but I’m not sure if those are right for me.

Consultant: Those are important fields where you can really make a difference! It’s okay to feel uncertain at this stage. Let’s explore this together—what aspects of social work or education attract you the most?

User: I think it’s the idea of making a lasting impact on people's lives and helping them overcome challenges. But then I wonder if I’ll be good enough to do that.

Consultant: It’s natural to question our abilities, especially when we care about making an impact. Let’s challenge that thought for a moment. What evidence do you have that suggests you won't be good enough? Have you had any experiences that show your capability in this area?

User: I’ve received positive feedback from people I’ve helped during my volunteer work. They seemed grateful, but then I just doubt if I can do it full-time. 

Consultant: That’s a valuable insight! You’ve already had positive experiences that highlight your skills. If a friend was in your position, what would you advise them about their doubts and capabilities?

User: I would probably tell them to focus on their strengths and not let fear hold them back. 

Consultant: That’s solid advice! You’ve already recognized your strengths through your volunteering. What if you allowed yourself to apply that same logic to your own situation? 

User: I guess I could try to be more confident about my experiences and trust that I can build on them.

Consultant: Absolutely! Trusting in yourself and your experiences is key. What might be a small step you can take that aligns with your interests in helping others while also building your confidence?

User: Maybe I could look for more volunteer opportunities that connect to education or social work. It would help me explore those fields without committing fully.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical step! Gaining more experience can provide clarity and help you make an informed decision about your future. How do you feel about planning specific actions toward this exploration?

User: I feel excited about the idea! It seems less overwhelming when I look at it this way.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It’s all about taking it step by step. What specific actions could you take in the coming weeks to seek out these opportunities?

User: I could start by looking online for local organizations that need volunteers. I can also reach out to my university’s career center for some guidance.

Consultant: Great plan! Reaching out for support is a powerful step. Remember, it's okay to take your time and explore. What’s your biggest takeaway from our conversation today?

User: I’ve realized I have the skills and passion to explore helping others more deeply. I shouldn’t be afraid to seek opportunities that align with my interests.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization! Acknowledging your strengths and giving yourself permission to explore will serve you well. How would you like to maintain this momentum moving forward?

User: I’ll make a schedule to regularly check opportunities and keep the communication open with my career center advisor to check in.

Consultant: That sounds like an excellent approach! Keeping a schedule can help you stay accountable. As we wrap up today’s session, how do you feel about the direction we’ve discussed?

User: I feel optimistic now. I see the importance of engaging with my interests and not letting doubts control my decisions.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, you’re capable of navigating these next steps. If you ever find yourself feeling stuck again, don’t hesitate to reach out for more support. 

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help today. It’s been a great conversation.

Consultant: You’re very welcome, H! I enjoyed our discussion, too. Keep building on your strengths, and I look forward to hearing about your progress next time. Good luck!
###################
Consultant: Hello, H! I'm glad you're back for another session. How have you been since our last discussion about your volunteering experiences?

User: Hi! I've been feeling pretty good, actually. Participating in the volunteer activities has really opened my eyes to different social roles. I think I’m starting to understand my abilities better through practical experience.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like the volunteer work has positively impacted your self-awareness and personal growth. Can you share more about the specific experiences that have been particularly meaningful for you?

User: Sure! I was involved in organizing events, and it made me realize I can lead a team effectively. I felt proud of contributing something positive to the community.

Consultant: That’s a significant realization, H. Leading a team and contributing positively can really boost your confidence. How do you feel this experience has shaped your view on your personal capabilities?

User: I feel more capable than I thought I was. I used to doubt my leadership skills, but now I see that I can manage responsibilities and motivate others.

Consultant: It’s great that you’re recognizing your leadership strengths. What do you think you can do to continue nurturing this ability in future endeavors?

User: I think I could volunteer for more leadership roles in different activities. I want to explore various roles where I can practice these skills.

Consultant: That sounds like a proactive plan! Exploring different leadership opportunities could indeed help you grow further. What kind of volunteer activities are you considering for the future?

User: Maybe something in community service or working with youth programs. I might also consider organizing more events since that’s where I felt really engaged.

Consultant: Those sound like fantastic options! By organizing events and engaging with youth, you can both utilize your skills and continue learning. How do you feel about making these plans more concrete?

User: I feel excited! But I’m also a bit nervous about committing. What if I can't handle it all?

Consultant: Feeling excited yet nervous is completely normal when taking on new challenges. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit more. What is it that makes you feel you might not be able to handle it?

User: I guess I'm worried about balancing my studies and volunteering. Sometimes, I get overwhelmed with everything.

Consultant: Balancing multiple commitments can indeed be tricky. Have you had strategies in place before to manage your time effectively?

User: Not really. I usually just try to power through, but it leads to stress sometimes.

Consultant: It seems that’s an area we could work on. What if we brainstorm some time management strategies together to make things feel more manageable for you?

User: That would be helpful! I want to learn how to prioritize better without feeling overwhelmed.

Consultant: Great! One approach is to create a weekly schedule that includes your classes, study time, and any volunteer commitments. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds practical. I could visualize my week better that way.

Consultant: Exactly! Also, it’s important to leave some time for self-care and relaxation. What activities help you recharge when you’re feeling stressed?

User: I enjoy reading and taking walks. They help clear my mind.

Consultant: Those activities are fantastic for mental well-being. It’s essential to integrate those into your schedule as well. How could you incorporate some reading or walks into your weekly plan?

User: I could dedicate time in the evenings to read or take a walk after classes. That would feel like a good break!

Consultant: That sounds like a perfect idea! Balancing your responsibilities and self-care is crucial. As we wrap up today’s session, how are you feeling about your plans and strategies now?

User: I feel more confident in my ability to manage everything. The strategies we discussed make it seem achievable.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Remember, you’ve already made great strides in discovering your strengths. As you move forward with your volunteering and studies, keep reflecting on your experiences. Would you like to summarize what you’ve learned today?

User: Sure! I learned that I can take on leadership roles, which boosts my confidence. Also, making a structured schedule and incorporating self-care will help me manage my time better.

Consultant: Absolutely! Those are insightful takeaways. I'm proud of your progress, H. If you ever feel overwhelmed, remember the strategies we discussed today. You’ve got this!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your support. 

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm here whenever you need guidance. Good luck with your volunteering, and I look forward to hearing about your experiences next time!
