Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyun! I'm glad you're here for this session. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi. I've been really anxious about graduating soon. The pressure to find a job or internship feels overwhelming. I also dread interacting with strangers, and I worry I might get taken advantage of or deceived.

Consultant: It sounds like you're facing a lot of stress with graduation approaching and the uncertainty of finding a job. Let’s talk about this anxiety you feel towards interacting with new people. Can you share a bit more about what specifically worries you in those situations?

User: I just feel a strong sense of distrust towards others. I always think that people might have bad intentions, and it makes me really nervous to talk with them, especially in interviews or networking events.

Consultant: I can see how that would be very difficult for you. Feeling anxious about the intentions of others can create a barrier to forming connections. Let’s explore where these feelings are coming from. Can you recall any experiences that have led you to feel this way about people?

User: Well, I grew up with my grandmother. My parents were often away for work, and I felt pretty alone. I've always been somewhat shy and kept to myself. It’s like I learned to rely only on myself and assumed others wouldn’t care.

Consultant: It’s understandable that those early experiences have shaped how you view relationships now. It seems like you've built a protective barrier around yourself. Now that you’re at this critical point in your life, how do you think this perception of others is affecting your ability to find a job?

User: I hesitate to reach out and connect with potential employers. I feel like I'm not good enough, so I don't even try to network much. The thought of being judged or rejected is terrifying.

Consultant: That fear of judgment and rejection can be very paralyzing. Let’s take a closer look at some of those negative thoughts. When you think to yourself that you’re not good enough, what evidence do you have for that belief? 

User: I don’t know... Maybe it’s just because I haven’t had much experience, and I sometimes feel like my academic performance isn’t impressive compared to others.

Consultant: It’s quite common to feel that way, especially when comparing ourselves to others. However, can you think of any accomplishments or strengths that you bring to the table, even if they might feel small?

User: I’ve worked hard for my grades, and I’m a good listener. People often tell me that I help them feel better during tough times. 

Consultant: Those are valuable skills, Xiaoyun! Being a good listener is an asset in any field, especially in interviews where connecting with others is important. Let’s challenge that thought of not being good enough. What would you say to a friend who felt this way about themselves?

User: I would probably tell them that everyone starts somewhere and that they shouldn't sell themselves short. 

Consultant: Exactly! Practicing that same kindness towards yourself can be beneficial. How might you apply that advice to your own situation when preparing for interviews or networking?

User: I guess I could remind myself that I have strengths and that it’s okay to not have everything figured out yet.

Consultant: That sounds like a great shift in thinking. Additionally, we can create small, manageable goals for you to practice interacting with others. What’s a simple social situation you could step into to build your confidence?

User: Maybe I could start by talking to someone in my class or joining a study group. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful start! Engaging in familiar environments like your class can ease the pressure. Let’s also discuss how you can approach these interactions. How about setting a goal to just introduce yourself to one new person each week?

User: That sounds doable. I think even just saying hello might help me feel a bit less anxious over time.

Consultant: Absolutely! Building trust takes time, and each positive interaction can strengthen your sense of connection. Before we finish today, let’s reflect on what we’ve discussed. Can you highlight one key takeaway you have about your fear of interpersonal interaction?

User: I think it’s about recognizing that my fears come from my past, but I can challenge those thoughts and focus more on my strengths.

Consultant: That’s a powerful realization, Xiaoyun. It’s about taking small steps toward changing your perspective and practicing self-compassion. Remember, it's okay to feel anxious, but you have the capability to navigate these challenges. 

User: Thank you. I appreciate that. I'll try to implement what we talked about.

Consultant: You're welcome, Xiaoyun! I’m proud of you for being open to this process. Remember to keep practicing those small interactions, and when we meet again, we can discuss how it went. Take care until then, and know that progress can occur at your own pace!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyun! I'm glad you're back today. Let's take a moment to discuss how you're feeling right now and what we can work on together.

User: Hi! I’ve been thinking a lot about my fear of social interactions. I still feel really anxious when I try to engage with classmates, especially during group activities.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re reflecting on your social anxieties. Can you share a little more about what specific situations trigger that anxiety for you?

User: I recently went to a small gathering with my classmates, but I found myself avoiding conversations. I felt really out of place and it made me remember how uncomfortable social situations make me.

Consultant: I see. It must be challenging to feel out of place in those settings. What thoughts were running through your mind at that gathering? How did those thoughts contribute to your feelings of anxiety?

User: I kept worrying that I would say something stupid or that others wouldn't want to talk to me. It felt like everyone was judging me, which made me want to hide.

Consultant: Those thoughts must have been quite overwhelming. It sounds like you might be experiencing some cognitive distortions, like assuming others are judging you negatively. What do you think would happen if you challenged those thoughts and considered other possibilities?

User: I guess I could try to think that maybe they weren't judging me as harshly as I feared. But it’s hard to shift that mindset in the moment.

Consultant: Absolutely, it's not easy to shift those perceptions in the moment. It takes practice. If a friend found themselves feeling the same way, what advice would you give them to help them through it?

User: I would probably tell them that most people are too focused on themselves to really judge anyone else so harshly. But it’s hard to apply that to myself.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It sounds like you already have some helpful strategies. Let’s explore step by step how we can put that advice into action. Can you think of a small social situation you could practice this in?

User: Maybe I could try to talk to a few classmates in the cafeteria next time. That feels a little less intimidating than a bigger group.

Consultant: That sounds like a good plan! How can you prepare yourself for that conversation? What thoughts might you remind yourself to help you feel more at ease?

User: I could tell myself that it’s okay if I stumble over my words and that the other person may be feeling nervous too. It's just a casual conversation after all.

Consultant: Yes! That’s a wonderful approach. Remember, everyone experiences nervousness. Let’s think about how we can record or reflect on that experience after the interaction. How do you feel about that?

User: I think writing down my thoughts afterward could help. I might feel embarrassed, but it could also help me see things more clearly.

Consultant: That’s a terrific idea! Reflecting on your thoughts can offer valuable insights and help you recognize any patterns in your feelings. Would you be willing to try journaling after your upcoming interactions?

User: Yes, I’d like to give it a shot. I hope it can help ease my anxiety in the long run.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re motivated to make progress, which is great! As you prepare for this, how are you feeling about facing this small challenge?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but also a little excited. It’s nice to think about trying something new instead of avoiding it.

Consultant: That's a positive mindset! Remember, it’s completely normal to feel nervous. It's a sign that you're stepping out of your comfort zone. How can you celebrate or reward yourself after your attempt, no matter the outcome?

User: Maybe I could treat myself to something nice afterward, like a dessert or a favorite snack. That could make it feel more worthwhile.

Consultant: Excellent! Rewards can be motivating. After you've had your interactions, we can discuss how they went in our next session, and you can share what you learned as well. 

User: That sounds good! I think reflecting on the experience will help me process everything better.

Consultant: Absolutely! I look forward to hearing about your experiences. As we wrap up today, how are you feeling about our discussion and the steps you've planned?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. Talking about it has made me realize that I can take small steps and that I don’t have to do it all at once.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Xiaoyun! Remember, progress takes time, and each step counts. You're making important strides in understanding and managing your feelings. If you ever feel overwhelmed, it's okay to reach out for support.

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help. I will definitely try writing afterwards and see how it goes.

Consultant: You're very welcome! I believe in you, and I’m here to support you. Take care, and I'll see you next session!

User: See you!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyun! It's good to see you again. How are you feeling today, especially after our last session?

User: Hi. I think I feel a bit better, but I'm still anxious about people discovering my background. I did manage to talk to a few classmates, but I worry they'll think less of me if they find out.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you've been able to have some conversations! It's completely understandable to feel worried about how others perceive your background. Let's talk more about that. What exactly concerns you about revealing your past?

User: I guess I'm afraid they'll judge me or see me as less worthy because I went through a tough childhood. It makes me feel insecure in social situations.

Consultant: It's really brave of you to share that. Many people fear being judged for their backgrounds, and it can certainly impact how we connect with others. Have there been any specific situations lately where you felt this anxiety the most?

User: Yes! When I was talking to my classmates, I could feel my heart racing, and I kept thinking about what they might be thinking about me. I wanted to open up more, but I stopped myself.

Consultant: It sounds like those moments can be really intense for you. Let's explore those thoughts further. In that situation, what kind of thoughts crossed your mind that made you hold back?

User: I thought things like, "If they knew where I came from, they would think I'm not good enough," or "They'll just see me as a charity case."

Consultant: Those thoughts can certainly be overwhelming. Let's examine them. How true do you think those thoughts are? Is there any evidence that supports or contradicts them?

User: I don’t know. I guess I have no real proof that they'd think that—maybe it's just my fear.

Consultant: That’s an important realization! A lot of our fears can stem from irrational thoughts. If a friend were in your position, how might you advise them to view the situation?

User: I’d probably tell them that their worth isn’t defined by their background, and that people care more about who they are now.

Consultant: Exactly! You have valuable insights that could benefit you. Let's focus on how you can practice that mindset for yourself. What would it look like for you to believe that your worth isn't defined by your past?

User: I suppose I could work on appreciating the strengths I’ve developed despite my background. Maybe I could start sharing some of those positive qualities with my classmates.

Consultant: That’s a great plan! It could really help shift your focus from fear to strength. What are some strengths or qualities you admire in yourself that you could share with others?

User: I think I’m resilient. Even with the struggles I’ve faced, I've managed to keep going and do well in school.

Consultant: Resilience is such a powerful quality! Recognizing that can help you feel more confident in social interactions. Would you feel comfortable sharing that with your classmates the next time you chat?

User: I think I could. It might help me feel more connected to them.

Consultant: Absolutely! Focusing on your resilience can help create a bond. Let’s also think about some small activities you can do with your classmates that could foster a sense of belonging. What comes to mind?

User: Maybe I could invite them to study together or take part in some group activities. It might help me feel more comfortable.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful idea! Engaging in shared experiences can help build trust and connection. How do you think you’ll feel after taking that step?

User: I think it might be easier to let my guard down and see that they’re not judging me. I might even enjoy it!

Consultant: That’s a healthy perspective. It’s important to remember that building trust takes time, and it's okay to take small steps. How do you plan to follow through with this?

User: I’ll try to set up a study group next week and see how it goes. I’m a bit nervous, but I want to try.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to feel nervous! Just remember that taking that first step is a significant achievement. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you’ve learned or felt during our conversation?

User: I’ve realized I need to focus more on my strengths and be more open with others about my experiences. I feel a bit more hopeful.

Consultant: That’s such an encouraging takeaway! Recognizing your strengths can truly change how you connect with others. As we continue, we can keep working on building that trust and confidence. I believe in your ability to make these connections. Thank you for sharing today, Xiaoyun. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and feel a bit lighter after today’s talk.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyun! I'm glad to see you today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been feeling a bit better, actually. Participating in the workshop helped me feel more connected, but I still struggle with trusting people fully.

Consultant: It's great to hear that you're feeling a bit better and that the workshop had a positive impact on you. Trust can be a challenging issue, especially when it comes to social interactions. Can you tell me more about what you felt during the group activities?

User: It was nice to share with others and feel their support. I enjoyed being part of something, but I still had this nagging feeling that I shouldn't get too close to anyone.

Consultant: That makes sense. Engaging in group activities can be uplifting, yet the fear of getting hurt or disappointed can hold you back. What do you think that feeling stems from?

User: I guess it’s from my childhood experiences. Growing up, I often felt alone since my parents were away, and I wasn’t sure who I could trust. It’s hard to shake that off.

Consultant: It sounds like your past experiences have shaped your current feelings towards trust and connection. Acknowledging those experiences is an important step. As you reflect on this, what do you think would make it easier for you to trust others in a group setting?

User: Maybe if I could find common ground with them? Like shared interests or goals. That might help me feel more comfortable.

Consultant: Finding common interests is a great idea! It creates a sense of belonging. We can explore some activities or topics that you feel passionate about. What are some things you enjoy that could spark conversation with others?

User: I love drawing and sometimes indulge in photography. I think sharing that could be a good way to connect.

Consultant: Those are wonderful interests! Sharing your hobbies can open up many doors to connection. How do you feel about discussing your drawings or photography with others during the next group activity?

User: I feel a bit nervous, but I think it could be a starting point for building connections.

Consultant: It's perfectly normal to feel nervous, especially when trying something new. Let’s focus on that anxiety—what specific thoughts come to your mind when you think about sharing your work?

User: I worry that they won’t like my art or that it won’t be interesting to them. 

Consultant: I understand that concern. Let’s challenge that thought for a moment. What evidence do you have that supports or contradicts the idea that others wouldn’t appreciate your art?

User: I don’t really have any concrete evidence... it's just a fear based on past experiences.

Consultant: Acknowledging that it’s a fear rather than a fact is a significant step. If a friend of yours was in a similar position, what would you tell them about sharing their artwork?

User: I’d probably encourage them and remind them that art is subjective.

Consultant: Exactly! Art is indeed subjective, and your unique perspective is valuable. How would you feel about framing it that way when you think about sharing your work with the group?

User: I think that would help me feel more confident. It’s just a matter of changing how I look at it.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic realization! Changing your perspective can significantly affect your confidence. Let’s think of one small step you can take to incorporate this new mindset in the next group session.

User: Maybe I can prepare a piece of my artwork to share and just focus on what I enjoy about it instead of worrying about others’ opinions.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant plan! Focusing on your enjoyment can help shift the pressure off you. How do you feel about this approach?

User: I feel more optimistic! It’s doable and feels less intimidating.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As we prepare for your next group session, let’s also think about how to manage any anxious thoughts that might crop up before or during the sharing. What strategies could you use to calm those fears?

User: I could remind myself that it’s just one piece of art and that everyone else has their own perspectives. Plus, I can take deep breaths to manage my anxiety.

Consultant: Deep breathing is an excellent technique! Allowing yourself to remind you of the subjectivity of art can foster a supportive atmosphere. Would practicing deep breathing together help you feel more prepared?

User: Yes, I’d love that. 

Consultant: Great! Let's take a moment and do that together. Inhale deeply... hold... and exhale slowly. Imagine the support of the group surrounding you as you let go of tension.

User: That feels relaxing. I think I could definitely use that moment to ground myself.

Consultant: Wonderful! Incorporating these mindful moments will help you feel more in control. As we conclude today, what is one thing you’re taking away that will support you in your upcoming group activities?

User: I’m taking away that I can share what I love while changing how I view this experience. I feel better equipped to build connections.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic takeaway, Xiaoyun! I believe you’ll do great in your next session. Remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. If you need assistance, I'm here to support you.

User: Thank you! I’m feeling hopeful about the future now.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! Looking forward to our next session, where we can continue building on this progress. Take care!
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyun! I'm glad to see you again for our session. How have you been feeling since our last conversation?

User: Hi! I feel a little better, actually. I’ve been thinking about what we discussed and trying to keep a more positive mindset about my job search.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! It sounds like you’re making progress. Can you share more about any specific thoughts or feelings you’ve had regarding your job search recently?

User: Well, I used to feel really anxious and doubt my abilities. But after talking with that senior, I’ve started to consider different job opportunities and feel a bit more hopeful.

Consultant: It sounds like that conversation had a positive impact on you. What specific opportunities or areas are you exploring now?

User: I’ve been looking at internships in marketing and communications. I think I could be good at that, even if I’m not really sure yet.

Consultant: Exploring internships in fields you’re interested in is a great step! What about marketing and communications excites you or seems appealing?

User: I like the idea of being creative and working with people. It feels better than just sitting behind a desk all day. But part of me still wonders if I’m really cut out for it.

Consultant: It's normal to have those doubts, especially when stepping into new territory. When you think about your ability to succeed in this field, what are some of the skills or qualities you believe you possess that could help you?

User: I think I'm good at coming up with ideas and communicating. My friends often tell me I'm a good listener, too.

Consultant: Those are valuable skills in marketing and communications! It’s important to recognize your strengths. How do you feel about showcasing these skills in job applications or interviews?

User: I’m not sure. I worry that I won’t present myself well. What if they don’t see my potential?

Consultant: That fear is valid, but it’s great that you’re aware of it. Let’s break it down—what evidence do you have that suggests potential employers wouldn’t see your value?

User: I don’t have much experience, and I feel like that’s all they’ll see. I tend to focus on my lack of practical skills.

Consultant: It's understandable to worry about experience. Instead of focusing on the lack of experience, can we reframe it? What about the skills and qualities you have learned through your education and life experiences?

User: I guess I have worked on group projects, and I’ve gained experience collaborating, which could be relevant.

Consultant: Absolutely! Those collaborative experiences are valuable and demonstrate your ability to work as a team. How can you highlight that in your applications or discussions?

User: Maybe I can mention specific projects and my role in them? But what if they ask about technical skills?

Consultant: That's a thoughtful approach! You can emphasize your willingness to learn and adapt. If technical skills come up, you can express your enthusiasm for developing those skills on the job. How does that sound to you?

User: That makes sense. I can say I'm eager to learn! It might show that I'm open and flexible.

Consultant: Exactly! Emphasizing your eagerness to learn can make a positive impression. Have you thought about any practical steps to prepare for applying to these opportunities?

User: I plan to update my resume and perhaps practice some interview questions. But I sometimes feel overwhelmed by everything.

Consultant: It’s great to have a plan but feeling overwhelmed is also understandable. Let’s break it down into smaller steps. What’s one small task you could focus on this week to make the process less daunting?

User: I could start by drafting my resume. I think just getting it down on paper will make me feel better.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! Taking that first step can often make things feel more manageable. Remember to celebrate that effort. How do you think completing the resume might shift your confidence?

User: I think it would give me a boost. Plus, it’ll make the job search feel more real if I have something to show.

Consultant: Absolutely, seeing your qualifications on paper can be very empowering! As you move forward, what practices can you use to maintain your positive mindset and keep anxiety at bay?

User: I could remind myself of the skills I do have and focus on the learning aspect. Maybe also talk to friends or mentors for support.

Consultant: That’s an excellent strategy! Connecting with supportive people is key. As we begin to wrap up our session, can we reflect on the progress you've made today and the steps you have set for yourself?

User: Sure! I feel like I’ve recognized my skills more clearly and have a plan for my resume. I’m also feeling more hopeful about my job search.

Consultant: That sounds like a significant shift! How do you plan to continue this momentum in your journey moving forward?

User: I’ll keep working on my resume and reach out for support when I need it. I feel more capable now.

Consultant: I’m really proud of the progress you’ve made. Remember, it’s all about taking one step at a time. If any doubts arise, come back to this conversation and remind yourself of your strengths. You’ve got this!

User: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help. It makes me feel more confident.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Remember that this is just the beginning, and I believe in your ability to navigate your career path. Feel free to reach out anytime you need support. Take care, Xiaoyun!

User: I will! Talk to you next time.
###################
Consultant: Hello, Xiaoyun! It's great to have you here today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi! I’ve been feeling a lot more confident lately. My recent internship made me realize that my skills are valued, which is a new experience for me.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like your internship has had a positive impact on how you perceive your abilities. What specific moments during your internship made you feel recognized?

User: There was this project where my ideas were really appreciated by my supervisor. It felt like I was contributing something meaningful, and it's pretty rare for me to feel that way.

Consultant: It sounds like that acknowledgment really resonated with you. How did that experience change your outlook on your skills and contributions?

User: I think it made me realize that I'm capable of doing good work. I’ve always doubted myself, but now I'm starting to feel like I belong in the professional environment.

Consultant: It’s incredible that you're experiencing a shift in self-perception. Let’s explore this more—how has this newfound confidence affected your social interactions or relationships with peers?

User: I’ve been more open to talking to my classmates and participating in group activities. I used to avoid that because I felt insecure about my input, but now I’m more willing to share my thoughts.

Consultant: That's a significant change! Engaging more with classmates can really enhance both your social skills and confidence. Are there any challenges you still face in social situations?

User: Sometimes I still feel a bit of anxiety when I meet new people. I worry they won't like me or that I won't know what to say.

Consultant: It’s very common to feel some anxiety about meeting new people. Would you be open to discussing ways to manage that anxiety when you're in social situations?

User: Yes, I would like that! I don't want this anxiety to overshadow my progress.

Consultant: Absolutely! We can work on strategies that help you feel more comfortable in those settings. One approach is to shift your focus from worrying about what others think to simply being present in the moment. How does that idea resonate with you?

User: That makes sense. If I focus more on the conversation instead of my insecurities, it might help me relax.

Consultant: Exactly! Additionally, practicing small conversations in low-pressure environments can also build your confidence. Do you have any specific situations coming up where you could practice this?

User: I have a study group session coming up. I could try to contribute more actively there.

Consultant: That’s a great opportunity! What kind of contributions do you think you could make during the session?

User: I could prepare some discussion points or questions related to our study topic. Just having those ready might help me feel more at ease.

Consultant: That's a practical strategy! Being prepared can often ease anxiety. How do you feel about setting a small goal for yourself in that group session?

User: I think I can aim to share at least two of my thoughts during the meeting. It feels manageable.

Consultant: It sounds like a realistic and achievable goal! Reflecting on your experiences after the session could also be helpful. How do you plan to evaluate how well you engaged in the group?

User: I think I could take a moment to reflect right after the session, maybe even jot down a few notes on how I felt about my contributions.

Consultant: Excellent approach! Keeping track of your feelings and experiences will allow you to see your progress. Over time, this self-reflection can strengthen your confidence even more. How do you feel about all the steps we’ve discussed so far?

User: I feel excited! It makes me hopeful that I can keep building on my progress.

Consultant: That’s the spirit! Remember that progress takes time, and it's important to celebrate the small wins along the way. As we wrap up, what do you think will be the most significant changes for you in the upcoming weeks?

User: I think I’ll feel a lot more open to connecting with others. I’ll also be working on being more present and less focused on my fears.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan. You’ve already made significant strides, and I’m confident you will continue this journey. For our next session, we can review how your study group experience went. How does that sound?

User: That sounds perfect! I’ll be looking forward to sharing my experiences.

Consultant: I look forward to it as well! You’ve done incredibly well today, Xiaoyun. Please take care of yourself, and remember, I’m here to support you whenever you need it.

User: Thank you so much! I’ll see you next time.
