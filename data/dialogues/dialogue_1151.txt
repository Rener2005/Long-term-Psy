Consultant: Hello, Jin! I'm glad you've come in today. Let's start by talking about how you've been feeling lately. Can you share what's been on your mind?

User: Hi. Honestly, I've been feeling really down since starting university. I miss high school a lot, and I just don't feel like I belong here. It's really hard to connect with anyone.

Consultant: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of sadness and loneliness due to this transition. Missing high school and feeling out of place can be very challenging. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you miss high school?

User: I think it was just so much easier to communicate with my friends back then. Everyone knew each other and there was this sense of familiarity. Now, I feel lost among strangers.

Consultant: That familiarity and connection you had in high school seems to be a comforting memory for you. It’s understandable to long for that when you’re facing new and unfamiliar situations. How are you finding it difficult to connect with your classmates now?

User: I’ve tried to introduce myself and join some conversations, but it feels like I just don’t have anything in common with them. I often feel awkward and end up just staying quiet.

Consultant: Feeling awkward in a new environment can be really tough. It's understandable that you'd feel hesitant when it seems like you don’t share common interests. What kind of things do you wish you could talk about or share with your classmates?

User: Well, I love playing video games and watching movies, but most of the conversations seem to revolve around sports or other activities I'm not into. I just feel like I can't connect.

Consultant: It’s important to feel a connection with those around you, and it sounds frustrating to feel like your interests aren’t shared. Have you thought about any ways you could explore shared interests with your classmates or perhaps find new groups that align more with your hobbies?

User: I haven't really considered joining specific groups. I guess I'm just so stuck on how I feel right now. It’s hard to think positively.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel stuck when you’re facing difficulties. Let’s explore your feelings a bit more. What thoughts come up for you when you think about joining a group or getting to know others?

User: I think about how it might not work out and I’ll just embarrass myself again. I don’t want to be rejected.

Consultant: That fear of rejection can be a strong barrier to taking action. Let’s take a moment to challenge that thought—how likely do you think it is that everyone you meet will reject you?

User: I guess there’s a chance some would be cool, but there’s also a chance they won’t be interested in me.

Consultant: That's a fair point. It’s natural to focus on the likelihood of negative outcomes, but what if we look at it from a different angle? If you were advising a friend who was in your position, what would you say to encourage them to take that step?

User: I would probably tell them to just go for it and not think too much about what others might think. It's better to try than to stay stuck.

Consultant: Yes, that's a wise approach! It sounds like you have a good understanding of what helps. Maybe we can develop a small plan to help you take that first step without feeling overwhelmed. What do you think could be a manageable way for you to connect with others?

User: Maybe I could start by just attending a club meeting? It’s less pressure than trying to talk to a lot of people all at once.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Attending a club meeting can give you a chance to see how others interact in a more structured environment. Before the meeting, what could you tell yourself to help ease some of that anxiety?

User: I could remind myself that everyone is likely nervous and just being there is a good step. And I could think of it as an opportunity to learn about new things.

Consultant: Absolutely! By reframing your thoughts in that way, you can focus on the experience rather than the potential judgment. Let’s also consider a few ways to facilitate a smoother interaction. What conversation starters do you think you could use?

User: I guess asking about what games they play or their favorite movies could work. Those are safe topics for me.

Consultant: Those are excellent conversation starters! They align with your interests and allow for a more natural connection. How do you feel about trying this plan moving forward?

User: It makes me feel a bit more hopeful. I think I can at least give it a try.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful mindset to have, Jin! Remember, it's about taking small steps and being gentle with yourself as you navigate this adjustment. Would you like to discuss any other strategies to help maintain your confidence moving forward?

User: I think I just need to remind myself that it’s okay to feel uncomfortable while I adapt. I don’t have to have everything figured out right now.

Consultant: Exactly! Embracing that discomfort as part of your growth can relieve some pressure. As we wrap up, let’s reflect on what you’ve learned in this session. What are some key takeaways for you today?

User: I feel like I’ve learned that it’s okay to feel lost, and that making connections is something I can practice, not a test I have to ace immediately.

Consultant: That's a valuable insight, Jin. As you continue to practice these strategies, you’ll find it easier to navigate your new environment. Remember, it’s a process, and I’m here to support you whenever you need to talk. Our time together today is coming to an end, but I look forward to hearing about your progress in our next session. 

User: Thank you! I really appreciate your help today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! Take care, and I’ll see you next time.

Consultant: Hello, Jin! I'm really glad you're here today. I’d like to start by understanding how you’ve been feeling lately, particularly with your experiences in the university environment.

User: Hi! I've been struggling a lot. I feel kind of down since starting university, and it’s been hard for me to connect with others. I tried participating in a class event recently, but I felt so out of place.

Consultant: It sounds like you've been feeling quite isolated and disappointed about your interactions with others. Can you tell me more about what specific feelings came up during that class event?

User: During the event, I tried to engage, but I just felt like no one really noticed me. I keep thinking that maybe I'm just not good at making friends, which makes me feel even worse.

Consultant: I see. So, it seems that your thoughts about not being good at making friends are really affecting your feelings and experiences. Let’s explore those thoughts a bit. What evidence do you have that you're not good at making friends?

User: Well, I’ve always had a hard time in social situations. Back in high school, it was easier for me, but here, I just feel like I don’t belong. I sometimes think everyone else fits in better than I do.

Consultant: It sounds like you're comparing yourself to others, which can be tough. Let's discuss that. Have there been any moments, even small ones, where you've felt connected with someone or had a good interaction?

User: I remember saying a few words to one classmate during a group project. They smiled back, but I quickly backed off thinking it was just a fluke.

Consultant: That’s a positive interaction to build on! You did manage to engage with a classmate, and that’s a step forward. How did that moment make you feel, even if briefly?

User: It felt good, actually, but then I dismissed it immediately. I guess I just get overwhelmed and think, “What’s the point?”

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed, especially in a new environment. Let’s try to challenge that “What’s the point?” thought. If a friend were feeling similarly, how would you encourage them?

User: I would probably tell them to keep trying and that it's okay to feel unsure. I’d reassure them it takes time to adjust.

Consultant: That’s a great perspective! You showed a lot of empathy there. Now, how can you apply that same kindness to yourself when you’re feeling uncertain?

User: I guess I could remind myself that it’s okay to take my time and that not everyone finds it easy at first. 

Consultant: Exactly! That self-compassion can be really helpful. Let's think about what small steps you could take next time to connect with someone without feeling overwhelmed. What’s one small action you could take?

User: Maybe next time, I could try to talk to someone before class starts—like asking about the assignment or something. 

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Asking about the assignment is a natural conversation starter. What do you think could help you feel more confident in doing that?

User: I suppose practicing what I might say could help. Like, if I rehearse it in my head.

Consultant: Practicing is a valuable tool! You could even write down a few phrases or questions that you feel comfortable with. This way, it becomes easier to approach someone. How does that sound to you?

User: That sounds manageable. I can definitely try that.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! As you work on these small steps, it might also be helpful to keep track of your thoughts and feelings. This way, you can recognize any patterns that come up. What do you think about that?

User: I like that. Keeping a journal could help me reflect on my experiences and see if I’m improving.

Consultant: Absolutely! Journaling can provide valuable insights into your feelings and progress. Let's also talk a bit about maintaining a positive mindset. When you notice negative thoughts creeping in, what can you tell yourself instead?

User: I could remind myself that everyone has difficulties, and it’s okay to not have it all figured out right now.

Consultant: That’s a perfect strategy! Acknowledging that it’s okay to feel uncertain can lighten that pressure. As we wrap up today’s session, what do you feel you’ve gained from our discussion?

User: I feel like I have some practical steps to work on and a better understanding that it’s normal to struggle. I also feel less alone.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Jin! Recognizing that you're not alone and having strategies to move forward are important steps. Remember, it's a process, and it's okay to reach out when you need to. How do you want to keep this momentum going until our next session? 

User: I think I'll focus on reaching out to someone next week and keeping a journal about my feelings.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid plan! I'm proud of your commitment. Remember, I'm here to support you whenever you're ready to share your experiences again. Take care, and I'll see you next time!

Consultant: Hello there! I’m glad you’re here today. How have you been feeling lately since our last session?

User: Hi! I've been a bit better, but I still feel this lingering anxiety about fitting into college life. I’ve been thinking a lot about my high school days, and it makes me feel kind of lost.

Consultant: It’s understandable to feel that way, especially with such a big change. You mentioned feeling lost; can you tell me more about what specifically makes you feel that way?

User: Well, in high school, I had a solid group of friends and felt confident in my activities. But now, I struggle to connect with anyone, and I miss that sense of belonging.

Consultant: That sense of belonging is really important. Feeling disconnected can be tough. Have you experienced any situations recently that intensified those feelings of anxiety or loneliness?

User: Just last week, I tried joining a club, but I felt so out of place that I left early. I felt embarrassed and like I didn't fit in.

Consultant: That sounds really frustrating. Leaving early must have felt disappointing. Can you share what kind of thoughts were running through your mind during that experience?

User: I kept thinking, “Everyone else seems to know each other,” and “I’ll never find people to connect with.” It just made me feel worse.

Consultant: Thank you for sharing that with me. It seems like those thoughts really influenced your feelings that day. Let's explore them a bit—how accurate do you think those thoughts are? Are there any alternative interpretations?

User: I guess it’s true that some people might know each other, but not everyone. I might be jumping to conclusions, thinking I won't find anyone.

Consultant: Exactly! It’s quite common to fall into those patterns. If a friend were in your shoes, what advice would you give them about those thoughts?

User: I’d probably tell them to give it a chance and not assume the worst. That makes sense.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! It's important to challenge those negative thoughts. What could be one small step you could take to approach social situations differently next time?

User: Maybe I could try to stay a bit longer at the next club meeting and just introduce myself to one person first. That doesn’t seem too overwhelming.

Consultant: That's a fantastic plan! Taking small steps can help you gradually build confidence. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel a bit anxious just thinking about it, but also somewhat hopeful that it could work.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel anxious about stepping outside your comfort zone. You’re cultivating hope, which is a positive change. What other strategies could you apply to manage anxiety during those social interactions?

User: I could practice some breathing exercises beforehand to calm my nerves. I’ve actually learned some techniques in a health class.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Practicing breathing can really help manage anxiety. How about exploring emotional regulation techniques and other activities outside of those initial moments in social settings?

User: Sure! I do enjoy art, and I think getting involved in more creative things could help me express myself and meet others with similar interests.

Consultant: Getting involved in creative activities sounds wonderful! It can provide a sense of community and also allow for self-expression. Is there a specific art-related activity or group you're interested in?

User: I’ve been thinking about joining a painting workshop. It could be fun, and I can meet new people who share the same interest.

Consultant: A painting workshop sounds like a fantastic opportunity! It combines creativity with social interaction. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel excited about it. It feels like a chance to start fresh and embrace something I love.

Consultant: That’s a great way to look at it! Embracing what you love is definitely a pathway to positive experiences. As you think about this, what positive outcomes do you envision coming from attending that workshop?

User: I hope to make new friends and feel more confident in expressing myself, and maybe even enjoy the process of painting without the pressure.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful outlook! Enjoying the process is really important. As we wrap up our session, how do you feel about the strategies we discussed today? 

User: I feel optimistic. I have a clearer plan now and more confidence to tackle these feelings.

Consultant: That’s great to hear! Remember, taking small steps and engaging in activities you enjoy can significantly help. Before we finish, is there anything else you’d like us to discuss or any concerns?

User: No, I think we covered everything. I’m excited to start this new journey in a creative environment!

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that, and I believe you’ll do well. Take time to reflect on the steps you've outlined, and remember you're not alone in this process. Looking forward to our next session!

User: Thanks! I'm looking forward to it too.

Consultant: Hi, Jing! I'm glad to see you again today. It seems like you're eager to talk about your experiences in university. How are you feeling about your involvement in the club activities?

User: Hi! I feel quite good about it. Joining the club was a bit intimidating at first, but I've started to enjoy working with others and collaborating. It’s a nice change from how I felt when I first came to university.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like being part of the club has brought some positive emotions for you. Can you share more about what specifically you enjoy when collaborating with others?

User: Well, I like how we can share ideas and support each other during projects. It feels good to be part of a team. I missed that sense of community when I started here.

Consultant: It sounds like teamwork has been a refreshing experience for you, giving you a sense of belonging. How do you think this sense of community might impact your overall feelings about university life?

User: I think it makes me feel more connected and less isolated. I think I’ve started to recognize that I can make friends and enjoy my time here more than I thought.

Consultant: That's a significant insight, Jing. Feeling less isolated can be a powerful shift. How has this change in perspective influenced your thoughts about your identity or self-recognition in university?

User: I guess I feel like I can be more myself. In high school, I was quite popular, but I didn’t know how to fit in once I got here. Now I’m starting to rediscover parts of myself I thought I lost.

Consultant: It’s great to hear you’re reconnecting with yourself! Identifying and embracing who you are can be very empowering. What activities or aspects of university life do you think could further support this rediscovery?

User: I want to try more activities, maybe join another club or go to social events. I feel like there’s a lot more I can explore here.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic plan! Exploring new activities may not only enhance your sense of identity but also help you meet new people. What kind of activities are you considering?

User: I’m thinking about joining a sports club or maybe something creative, like an art group. I’ve always enjoyed both, but I didn’t know if I could balance them with my studies.

Consultant: Pursuing your interests is important, and it’s good that you’re thinking about balance. How could you integrate these activities into your current schedule without feeling overwhelmed?

User: I suppose I could start by trying one thing at a time. Maybe attend a couple of meetings and see how I feel. If it’s too much, I can adjust.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical approach! Trying one thing at a time can help you gauge your interest and manage your time effectively. How would it feel for you to reach out and attend these meetings?

User: It feels a bit nerve-wracking still, but I think I’m more open to it than I was before. I want to push myself a little.

Consultant: It's completely normal to feel a bit anxious about new experiences, but pushing yourself can lead to growth. Can you recall a time when you stepped out of your comfort zone and it turned out well?

User: Yes, when I first joined this club, I felt really anxious, but it turned out great because I met some cool people and learned a lot.

Consultant: That’s a perfect example! Reflecting on that experience can serve as motivation. What are some specific steps you can take to prepare for reaching out to new activities?

User: I could research the clubs online and maybe send an email or message. It would make me feel less anxious if I knew a bit about them in advance.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Preparing beforehand can help ease your mind. What emotions do you anticipate feeling as you take these steps to explore further?

User: I think a mix of excitement and nervousness. I really want to make the most of my time here and meet new people.

Consultant: That combination of excitement and nervousness is very common. Embracing those feelings can be a part of your journey. What support do you think you might need as you move forward with this exploration?

User: I think talking to my family about it could help. They’ve been supportive, and it would be nice to share these plans with them.

Consultant: Sharing your plans with your family sounds like a great way to seek support. They can provide encouragement and maybe even celebrate your achievements with you. How do you feel about this idea?

User: I feel good about it! I think they’ll be happy for me. It’ll be nice to feel their support as I try new things.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear, Jing! It seems like you have a solid plan in place to engage with your interests and connect with your family. As we wrap up today, what do you feel you've gained from our conversation?

User: I feel more motivated to explore and connect with others. I’ve realized that I can balance my activities while still focusing on my studies.

Consultant: That’s a great realization! It sounds like you’re becoming more confident in your ability to navigate this transition. Remember, you have the skills to handle this, and I’m here to support you. If you ever feel overwhelmed or need help, don’t hesitate to reach out.

Consultant: Hello! Welcome to our session today. I’m glad to see you. How have you been feeling since our last talk?

User: Hi! I feel a bit better, actually. Talking to my family helped. I shared some of my university experiences and challenges with them, and they were really supportive.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like communicating with your family has made a positive impact on your feelings. Can you tell me more about what you shared with them?

User: I talked about how I’ve been having a hard time adjusting to university life. I miss my high school friends and the comfort of home. They listened and encouraged me, which felt nice.

Consultant: It’s great that your family provided support. Missing familiar surroundings and friends can be really tough during transitions. How did sharing these feelings with them change your perspective?

User: I felt relieved to get it off my chest. It reminded me that I have people who care about me, and it gave me a sense of belonging, even if I’m far away.

Consultant: That’s an important realization. Feeling connected to loved ones can help during challenging times. Since it sounds like your communication has improved, how do you think you can continue to express your feelings to your family?

User: I think I could update them regularly about my life at university, not just when things are tough. That way, I can share both the good and the bad.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic approach! Regular updates can not only keep your family in the loop but also strengthen your bond. What kind of things would you like to share with them?

User: I’d like to tell them about my classes and the things I enjoy, maybe even share some fun moments with new friends.

Consultant: Sharing your joys and experiences with them sounds like a good strategy. It can definitely help you build a support system. In our last session, we discussed your feelings of longing for the past. How has that been since you talked to your family?

User: It's still there, but it’s not as overwhelming. I’m starting to appreciate the new experiences I’m having, like meeting different people.

Consultant: It’s encouraging to hear that you’re beginning to value new experiences. How does that shift in focus affect your mood when thinking about college life?

User: I feel a bit more hopeful. I want to try to make new memories instead of just wishing for the past.

Consultant: That’s a positive mindset to have. Making new memories can be rewarding. Can you identify some specific steps you might take to create those new experiences?

User: I could join some clubs or groups, maybe get involved in campus activities. It would help me meet others with similar interests.

Consultant: Joining clubs is a great idea! It can also make it easier to connect with others. What interests you most about the activities you’re considering?

User: I’ve always liked music, and I thought about joining a band or choir. It seems like a fun way to meet people.

Consultant: That sounds like a fantastic choice! Music can be a wonderful way to bond with others. How would you feel about taking that step to join a band or choir?

User: I’m a bit nervous, but also excited. I think it would be good for me to try something new.

Consultant: It’s completely normal to feel nervous about new experiences. That excitement shows that you’re willing to step outside your comfort zone, which is an important part of growth. Is there something specific making you nervous about joining?

User: I worry that I might not fit in or that I won’t be as good as the others.

Consultant: Those thoughts are common, and it’s understandable to feel that way. What could you tell yourself to challenge those fears and remind you that trying is what matters most?

User: Maybe I could focus on the idea that it’s about having fun and learning, not just performing perfectly.

Consultant: That’s a positive way to reframe your thoughts! Focusing on enjoyment and growth can help ease the pressure. What steps can you take to remind yourself of this when you feel nervous?

User: I could write it down and keep it somewhere visible, like on my desk or in my notebook. That way, I can see it often.

Consultant: That sounds like a practical plan! Keeping reminders on hand can reinforce your positive mindset. As we wrap up our session today, how are you feeling about the progress you’ve made since talking to your family?

User: I feel much more confident, and I have a clearer plan to engage with new experiences. It’s nice to see some progress.

Consultant: That’s fantastic! It sounds like you’re really making strides. Keeping up with family communication and being open to new activities could significantly enhance your adaptation process. Remember, if you ever feel overwhelmed, you can always reach out. How do you feel about our next steps moving forward?

User: I feel optimistic about it! I’m excited to try new things and keep my family updated. Thank you for your support.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I’m really glad to see your shift in perspective. Continue nurturing those connections and trying new experiences. I look forward to hearing about the progress you make in our next session.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Staying positive and encouraging yourself will only enhance your growth. Looking ahead, what are some goals you’d like to set for yourself in the upcoming semester?
