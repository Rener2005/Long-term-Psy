Consultant: Hello! I'm glad you're here for today’s session. I’d like to start by understanding how you've been feeling lately, especially since you’ve had a lot of changes in your work environment. What’s been on your mind?

User: Hi there. I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed since I was assigned to the new company. There have been conflicts with my superiors, and I’m starting to doubt my own abilities. It’s been hard to get motivated to work.

Consultant: It sounds like you’re experiencing significant pressure from your new role and the conflicts you've been facing. Can you share more about how these situations make you feel? 

User: I just feel so inadequate and frustrated. I used to be more confident in my work, but now I just feel lost. I often can’t sleep at night thinking about the issues at work.

Consultant: That sounds really tough, and it's understandable that you'd feel this way given the circumstances. Let’s explore a bit deeper—how do you think these conflicts with your colleagues affect your self-perception at work?

User: I think every time I disagree with them, I start to believe that I'm not good enough for this job. It's like I can't escape those negative thoughts about myself.

Consultant: It seems like those disagreements are leading you to have some pretty harsh self-judgments. When these thoughts pop up, do you notice any particular automatic thoughts or beliefs that contribute to that feeling?

User: Yes, I often think things like "I shouldn’t be here" or "They think I'm incompetent." It's like I’m constantly trying to prove myself but failing.

Consultant: Those thoughts can be really damaging. Let’s take a moment to question them. What evidence is there that supports those thoughts, and is there any evidence that might contradict them?

User: I guess my experience in the role shows that I have the skills, but when I’m in those meetings, all I can focus on is what they think of me. So, even if I have good intentions, I just can’t shake that feeling of doubt.

Consultant: It’s great that you acknowledge your experience and skills. If a friend were in your position, what would you tell them about their abilities in the face of conflict?

User: I would probably tell them that they are doing their best and everyone has disagreements sometimes. They shouldn’t take it personally.

Consultant: Exactly! It sounds like you have a compassionate perspective when it comes to others. Let’s work on applying some of that kindness to yourself. What if you could challenge those negative thoughts about your competence with that perspective?

User: That could help, but it’s easier said than done. I still find it hard to believe those positive comments about myself.

Consultant: I completely understand. It isn’t easy to reframe those thoughts. It might be helpful for us to think about some small steps you could take to reinforce that belief in your abilities. What are some actions you could take in your work that remind you of your strengths?

User: Maybe I could list out my achievements and contributions to the projects. I haven’t done that in a while.

Consultant: That sounds like a great idea! Reflecting on your accomplishments can remind you of your capabilities and provide evidence against those negative thoughts. Would you be willing to commit to creating that list before our next session?

User: I can try that. It might help remind me of what I’ve done.

Consultant: Wonderful! In addition to that, let’s think about some ways to manage the increased pressure and anxiety you feel in the workplace. Are there particular moments or situations when you feel more anxious? 

User: I feel anxious during the weekly meetings when I have to report our team's progress. I worry about what they’ll think of me.

Consultant: Those meetings sound particularly stressful for you. What if we experimented with some strategies to help you feel more at ease during those times?

User: Like what? I’m not sure anything can help.

Consultant: How about practicing some deep breathing techniques before the meeting? Taking a moment to breathe deeply can help calm your nerves. Would you like to give that a try next time?

User: I suppose that could help. I’ll try to remember to breathe before speaking up.

Consultant: That’s a great start! Also, would it be beneficial to have a few affirmations prepared to say to yourself before you enter those meetings? Positive reminders of your qualifications might help reinforce a positive mindset.

User: Yeah, I think having something prepared could boost my confidence. 

Consultant: Excellent. We can create some affirmations together. For example, something like, “I am capable and have valuable contributions to make.” Does that resonate with you?

User: That sounds okay. I like the idea of reminding myself of my value.

Consultant: Fantastic! Let’s keep building on this strategy. We can also discuss coping mechanisms for when you start feeling overwhelmed at work. Are there activities you enjoy that could help relieve some stress?

User: I enjoy going for walks, but I haven’t made the time to do that lately.

Consultant: Walking could be a wonderful way to clear your mind and reduce anxiety. How about we plan for you to take a short walk during breaks at work? 

User: That’s doable. I can try to fit in a walk during lunchtime.

Consultant: Great! Let’s check in on how that goes next time. In the meantime, remember that it's okay to seek support from friends or family as well. This can help lighten the load.

User: I have been keeping things to myself, thinking I should handle it on my own, but maybe talking to others would help.

Consultant: Absolutely, sharing can be incredibly beneficial. Reaching out can provide different perspectives and support when you need it. 

User: I’ll think about who I could talk to. I guess I’ve been isolating myself more.

Consultant: It makes sense that stressful situations can lead to isolation. Remember, reaching out can be a sign of strength. Let's summarize what we discussed and set goals for our next session.

User: Alright, so my goals are to create that list of accomplishments, practice deep breathing and come up with a couple of affirmations. 

Consultant: Exactly! And let’s add in those walks as well. We’ll revisit these strategies and see how they’ve worked for you. You’re making great progress in understanding your feelings and finding healthy ways to manage them.

User: Thank you! I feel a bit more hopeful about handling this now.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, it takes time and practice. You’re not alone in this. I look forward to catching up on how it goes next time. 

User: Thank you for your support. I’ll see you next session!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you here today. How have you been feeling lately?

User: Hi there. I've been feeling quite anxious, especially with the work issues piling up. It's tough being alone in this city without my family. I just feel kind of lost and doubt my abilities.

Consultant: I hear you. Being away from your family and facing work challenges can be really overwhelming. Let's dive a little deeper—what specific thoughts or feelings come to mind when you feel that anxiety creeping in?

User: I often think that I'm not making enough progress at work. I constantly question whether I'm capable of handling my responsibilities. It leads me to feel frustrated and even paralyzed sometimes.

Consultant: That sounds really tough. It’s understandable to feel frustrated when you're questioning your abilities. Can you share a specific moment or situation at work where you felt this way recently?

User: Sure. Just last week, I had a meeting where I felt unprepared. I worried that people were judging my performance. I left feeling like I had let everyone down.

Consultant: That sounds very challenging. It seems like during that meeting, your doubts really surfaced. What thoughts were going through your mind right after the meeting?

User: I thought to myself, "Everyone must think I'm not fit for this role," and "What if I never get better at this?" It just spirals from there.

Consultant: It sounds like those thoughts can be quite harsh on yourself. Let’s explore this—how strong do you feel the evidence is for those thoughts? Are there other ways to view that situation?

User: I guess I don't really know. I mean, I've had successes in my career, but those thoughts just overshadow them in moments like these.

Consultant: It's easy to focus on the negatives, especially under stress. What if you reframed your thoughts? For instance, recognizing your past successes might help balance out those harsh judgments. How does that sound to you?

User: That does sound helpful! I really need to remind myself of my strengths rather than dwelling on my failures.

Consultant: Great! Let's think about one success that you're proud of. What was it, and how did it make you feel at the time?

User: I successfully led a project last year that resulted in a significant profit for the company. It felt amazing to see my team work together and achieve something great.

Consultant: That's a fantastic accomplishment! How can we leverage that success to combat those negative thoughts in the future?

User: I could remind myself that my team trusted my leadership and that we achieved our goals together. Maybe I could visualize that success more often to counter my doubts.

Consultant: Absolutely! Visualizing that success can be a powerful tool. It helps keep your mind anchored in your abilities. What other strategies can we develop to help manage those feelings of uncertainty and anxiety?

User: Perhaps I could go back to my daily routine of reflecting on what I'm grateful for. That used to help me stay positive.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! Practicing gratitude can definitely help shift your focus from anxiety to appreciating what you have. How about incorporating simple mindfulness exercises into your routine, too? 

User: That could be useful. I’ve heard a bit about mindfulness but never really tried it. How does it help?

Consultant: Mindfulness helps you stay present and aware of your thoughts and feelings without judgment. It allows you to observe rather than react. It can be especially beneficial when you feel overwhelmed. Would you like to try a simple mindfulness exercise together?

User: Yes, I'd like that.

Consultant: Great! Let’s take a moment. Close your eyes if you’re comfortable, and take a deep breath in... and out. Now, focus on your breath. With each breath, try to let go of some of the tension. How does that feel for you?

User: It feels calming, actually. I can feel the tension easing a bit.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! Regular practice can enhance your ability to deal with stress. When can you fit this into your daily routine?

User: I could do it every morning before I start work. Just a few minutes to center myself.

Consultant: Perfect! That could set a positive tone for your day. Now, as we start wrapping up, let’s summarize what we've discussed today. What key takeaways do you have that you can apply moving forward?

User: I should remind myself of my past successes, practice gratitude, and incorporate mindfulness into my routine. It seems doable.

Consultant: Absolutely! Those are actionable steps you can take to balance your feelings and strengthen your self-belief. How do you feel about our session today?

User: I feel a bit lighter and have a clearer plan. It really helped to talk things through.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Remember, you have the tools to manage your anxiety and doubts. If you ever feel overwhelmed again, just reach out. It's been a pleasure working with you. Take care!

User: Thank you! I really appreciate it.

Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite stressed because of my new position. I'm really worried about not making a good impression and failing in my job.

Consultant: I understand that you're feeling a lot of pressure regarding your new role and it's making you anxious about your performance. Can you share more about what specifically worries you about this job?

User: I guess it’s the fear of disappointing my superiors. I don’t want to seem incompetent, especially since I’ve moved to a new city and started working in a different environment.

Consultant: That sounds really challenging. It’s understandable to feel that way when you’re in a new position. How are these worries affecting your daily work and interactions with your colleagues?

User: I find it hard to concentrate. Sometimes, I just sit at my desk and feel overwhelmed. It affects my communication with colleagues, as I hesitate to share my thoughts or ask questions.

Consultant: It's tough when anxiety makes it difficult to engage with others and focus on your tasks. What do you think would help you become more comfortable in those interactions?

User: Maybe if I could just feel more confident about sharing ideas, it would help. But I'm afraid of looking foolish or being criticized.

Consultant: A lot of people feel that way in new situations. Let’s look at those thoughts together. What evidence do you have that sharing your thoughts would lead to negative feedback?

User: I suppose I don’t have any solid evidence. It's more of a feeling I have. I just worry that what I say won’t be good enough.

Consultant: That’s a common cognitive distortion called “catastrophizing,” where we imagine the worst-case scenario without real evidence. How would you advise a friend in a similar situation? What would you tell them?

User: I would probably tell them that it’s normal to make mistakes and that it’s all about learning and growing from them. 

Consultant: Exactly! It’s important to remember that growth often comes from experience and even mistakes. What would it look like for you to focus more on your learning process than the outcome?

User: I think I’d feel a bit lighter. If I could change my focus to learning instead of purely achieving, it might reduce my pressure overall.

Consultant: That sounds like a wonderful shift in perspective. We can work on strategies that help reinforce that mindset. Do you have any specific examples of situations at work where you felt you were learning despite the pressure?

User: Yes, there was a meeting where I struggled to present my ideas, but I did get feedback which helped clarify my thoughts. I suppose that was a learning experience.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic example! Feedback is a valuable part of the learning process. How about we explore ways to use that feedback effectively in your future presentations?

User: Sure, that sounds helpful. I think I need to understand how to incorporate it better.

Consultant: One way to do this is to actively seek feedback in situations where you feel comfortable and reflect on it. What other strategies do you think might help create a more supportive environment for yourself?

User: Maybe preparing more before meetings could help me feel more assured when speaking up. 

Consultant: Preparation is a great strategy! It can alleviate anxiety and boost your confidence. Can we set a goal for you to prepare specific points before your next meeting?

User: Yes, that would be a useful exercise. I'd like to try that out.

Consultant: Perfect! Also, remember to remind yourself of the positive feedback you receive and celebrate your progress. What do you think about that approach?

User: I think that could help me recognize my growth, instead of just focusing on what went wrong.

Consultant: Exactly, recognizing progress helps build resilience over time. Let's make a plan for you to reflect on your achievements regularly. How does that sound?

User: That sounds good. I often forget to acknowledge my small wins.

Consultant: It’s easy to overlook them when we’re focused on our worries. We’ll work together to create a habit of celebrating those wins. How do you feel about what we've discussed so far?

User: I feel relieved. It's good to have someone to talk things through. I didn’t realize I could change how I look at these situations.

Consultant: I’m glad to hear that! It’s a big step to recognize that you have the power to change your perspective. As we wrap up today’s session, what is your main takeaway?

User: I think I need to focus more on the process rather than only the results. That way, I can learn and grow without putting so much pressure on myself.

Consultant: That’s a great insight! Keeping that mindset will definitely aid your progress. Remember, it’s okay to seek help and reflect on your achievements. I look forward to catching up with you next time. 

User: Thank you! I feel more hopeful about managing my work stress.

Consultant: You’re welcome! I believe in your abilities and look forward to seeing the changes you make. Take care until next time!

Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you again. It seems like we have some positive developments to discuss. How have you been feeling about your interactions with your colleagues since our last session?

User: Hi! Well, I've noticed some slight improvements in my communication with my colleagues, but I still find myself fearing failure in collaboration. It's quite stressful.

Consultant: I appreciate you sharing that. It sounds like while there's been some progress, the fear of collaboration still holds you back. Can you share a specific instance where you felt this fear affecting your communication?

User: Yes, during a recent team-building activity, I felt a bit anxious about speaking up during discussions. I worry that my ideas won’t be well-received or that I might cause conflict.

Consultant: That’s a very common concern. It seems you're striving to contribute, but the fear of conflict or rejection is creating hesitation. How do you typically respond when you sense those fears arising?

User: I tend to stay quiet and avoid putting my thoughts out there, hoping that others will take the lead instead.

Consultant: I see. You prefer to avoid the situation rather than risk conflict. What do you think would happen if you shared your ideas despite those fears?

User: I suppose I might feel relieved if my ideas are accepted, but I also fear that rejection could reinforce my anxiety.

Consultant: That’s a really insightful point. It sounds like you’re caught in a cycle where the fear of rejection leads you to avoid speaking up, which then prevents you from gaining confidence. Let’s explore some strategies to help you break this cycle. How do you feel about practicing some role-playing exercises to build your confidence?

User: I think that could be helpful. I just need to work on overcoming that initial anxiety of speaking up.

Consultant: Absolutely! Let’s start with a scenario you might encounter at work. Imagine you're in a meeting, and there’s a discussion about a project. Can you try to share an idea you might have? Just think of it as practice for now.

User: Okay, I’ll give it a shot. I would say, “I think we could try a different approach to this project, focusing on customer feedback first. It might yield better results.”

Consultant: That’s a great start! How did it feel to articulate that idea, even in this practice scenario?

User: It felt a bit daunting, but once I said it, I felt a small sense of relief. 

Consultant: That relief is a good sign! It shows that putting your thoughts out there can be freeing. Now, let’s challenge that fear a bit more—what evidence do you have that sharing your ideas would lead to rejection? 

User: Well, I guess I don’t really have any solid evidence. It’s just a worry that occupies my mind.

Consultant: Understanding that this fear may not be based on reality is an important step. Could you consider how you might approach a colleague after a meeting, even casually, to discuss your ideas further? 

User: I could try talking to someone I trust after the meeting. That sounds less intimidating than speaking up in front of the whole group.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic idea! Building communication one step at a time with someone you feel comfortable with can really help ease your anxiety. How do you feel about setting a goal to do this in the coming week?

User: I think that sounds manageable. I can definitely aim to have a chat with a colleague.

Consultant: Excellent! As you work on this, remember to celebrate any small victories, no matter how minor they seem. How do you plan to recognize your progress?

User: I might keep a journal to note down each time I share my thoughts, even if it’s just a small interaction. 

Consultant: That’s a wonderful strategy! Reflecting on your progress can reinforce your confidence. Is there anything else you would like to explore in our session today?

User: I think we’ve touched on the main points I wanted to discuss. I just hope I can actually follow through with this when the opportunity arises.

Consultant: It’s completely natural to have doubts, but having this plan in place is a great start. Remember that it’s a process, and each step counts. How do you feel about your ability to take these steps now compared to when we started?

User: I feel more hopeful now. Having a plan makes it seem less overwhelming.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you’re beginning to embrace the possibilities instead of just focusing on the risks. Before we wrap up, what’s one small action you could take today that might help reinforce your commitment to this goal?

User: Maybe I could write down a few topics I’d like to discuss with my colleagues for future meetings.

Consultant: That’s a brilliant idea! By preparing those topics, you'll feel more equipped to contribute. I look forward to hearing about how that goes in our next session. Keep building on this momentum, and remember I'm here to support you. 

User: Thank you! I appreciate your help and guidance.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I believe in your ability to grow and adapt. Until next time, take care and be kind to yourself.
###################
Consultant: Hello! I'm glad to see you again today. How have you been feeling since our last session?

User: Hi. I've been feeling quite a bit better, actually. I'm starting to enjoy my time here more and feel more open to social activities.

Consultant: That’s wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some great progress. What specific social activities have you participated in recently?

User: I joined a local trading group and have made a few friends. We've been meeting regularly, and it really helps me feel more connected.

Consultant: That sounds like a great step toward building your social support! How does this connection make you feel about your overall situation?

User: It's reassuring. I feel less isolated, knowing there are people around who share similar interests and challenges.

Consultant: It’s excellent to have that kind of emotional support. How do you think maintaining these social interactions will impact your mood moving forward?

User: I believe it will help keep my spirits up, especially since I tend to feel a bit lonely sometimes. I really want to make sure I don’t slip back into a negative mindset.

Consultant: Acknowledging that is important. How do you plan to stay engaged with these social activities and avoid feelings of loneliness?

User: I aim to schedule regular meetups and perhaps participate in some community events. I think having a plan will keep me active socially.

Consultant: That sounds like a solid strategy! Making a plan can help you stay motivated. Are there any particular challenges you anticipate while engaging more socially?

User: I worry about the time commitment, especially with work and settling into this new role. Balancing everything feels tricky sometimes.

Consultant: It's understandable to feel that way. Finding a balance between work and social life can be challenging. What if we brainstormed some strategies together to manage your time effectively?

User: Yes, I’d like that. I often feel overwhelmed, and having some strategies could ease my mind.

Consultant: Great! One approach could be setting specific time limits for work tasks to create windows for social activities. Does that sound feasible to you?

User: That could work. Setting clear boundaries might help. I usually just work until I can’t anymore, so it might be good to change that habit.

Consultant: That’s an insightful realization. Establishing boundaries can lead to a more balanced routine. What other strategies could support you in ensuring you have that social time?

User: Maybe I could combine socializing with some of my work activities. For example, inviting colleagues to join me for lunch or meetings outside the office.

Consultant: That’s an excellent idea! It allows you to blend professional and social interactions, making the most of your time. How do you feel about taking that step?

User: I feel positive about it. It seems like a natural way to build relationships and network at the same time.

Consultant: I'm glad to hear that! Maintaining those connections can really support your emotional well-being. Let's think about how you can measure your progress in this area. What indicators would suggest you are successfully balancing work and social life?

User: I suppose if I manage to consistently attend social events and feel energized rather than drained afterward, that would be a good sign.

Consultant: That’s a helpful way to evaluate your engagement. Keeping track of how you feel after these interactions will give you valuable insight. Are there any specific social events coming up that you're looking forward to?

User: Yes, there's a local business networking event next week that I'm excited about. I think it’ll be a good opportunity to meet new people.

Consultant: That sounds exciting! It’s a great chance to expand your network further. How do you plan to prepare for it?

User: I think I’ll research some topics to discuss and maybe reach out to a few people in advance. That way, I’ll have some conversation starters.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! Preparing ahead of time can lessen anxiety and boost your confidence. If you encounter any feelings of apprehension, what coping strategies might you apply?

User: I could remind myself that it’s okay to feel nervous. Maybe practice deep breathing or visualize a positive outcome beforehand.

Consultant: Those are effective strategies! Practicing self-compassion and using relaxation techniques can make a significant difference in your comfort level. How do you feel about implementing these strategies in preparation for the event?

User: I feel good about it. They seem manageable, and I think they’ll help me stay calm.

Consultant: I'm glad you feel that way! As we prepare to wrap up today, let’s summarize your progress and plans moving forward. What are you most excited about as you continue this journey?

User: I’m excited about the balance I’m starting to create. I feel more optimistic about my social life and how it can positively influence my mood and productivity.

Consultant: That’s a wonderful realization! Remember, maintaining this balance is key to your emotional well-being. Let’s ensure we check in on your experiences and strategies in our next session. How does that sound?

User: That sounds perfect. Thank you for your guidance today!

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I'm looking forward to hearing about your experiences in our next meeting. Remember, you’re doing great.
###################
Consultant: Hello! It's great to see you again today. I'm glad to hear that you've been feeling satisfied with your current state. Let's dive into our session—what specific improvements have you noticed recently?

User: Hi! Thanks for having me. I've experienced better sleep quality and feel more stable emotionally. My work relationships have also improved significantly. It’s a relief, honestly.

Consultant: That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like you've made some meaningful progress. What do you think has contributed to these positive changes?

User: I think part of it is my effort to communicate better with my colleagues and manage my time more effectively. Being away from my family was tough, but I tried to focus on my work and establish connections here.

Consultant: It's great to see you actively working on your relationships and time management. These are essential steps toward personal and professional fulfillment. Have you noticed any challenges that might affect your sustained progress?

User: Not really, but I worry that without my family's support, it might become harder to maintain this balance in the long run.

Consultant: That's a valid concern, and it's good that you're aware of it. Let's explore how you can maintain this balance while embracing your family situation. Have you thought about strategies or routines that could help you stay grounded?

User: I haven’t really planned anything specific. I guess I could set aside time for regular calls with my family, but I’m not sure how else to cope without them physically here.

Consultant: Scheduling regular calls is an excellent idea! It can help you feel more connected. Also, we could look into activities or hobbies that might fulfill that emotional gap. What activities do you enjoy or think you could explore?

User: I used to enjoy reading and exercising, but I haven't made time for either since my move. I think I should try incorporating those again.

Consultant: Reintroducing reading and exercise sounds promising! Both can be great for mental well-being. Let's talk about practical ways to fit these into your routine. How many days a week could you realistically dedicate to these activities?

User: I can probably manage to read a bit every day and maybe aim for exercises three times a week. That doesn’t seem overwhelming.

Consultant: That sounds like a well-balanced plan. To make it even more effective, could you specify when during the day you want to fit these activities in? 

User: I think I could read in the evenings before bed and exercise in the mornings. It might help set a positive tone for the day.

Consultant: That’s a fantastic approach! By establishing this routine, you’re likely to reinforce your positive state. Now, let’s consider how you can reward yourself for sticking to this plan. How does that sound?

User: I like the idea of rewarding myself. Maybe after a week of sticking to it, I can treat myself to a nice dinner or something.

Consultant: Great idea! Reinforcing your efforts with rewards can be motivating. How do you feel about discussing any potential obstacles that might arise when implementing your new routine?

User: I’m a bit worried about work-related stress creeping in and distracting me from these plans.

Consultant: That’s understandable, but it’s excellent that you’re considering it ahead of time! One approach can be to set clear work boundaries. How do you usually manage work stress currently?

User: I try to take short breaks, but sometimes I just get caught up and forget about them.

Consultant: Short breaks are crucial. We can formulate a plan that reminds you to take those breaks and incorporate your reading and exercise alongside them. Would setting timers on your phone help?

User: Yeah, that sounds helpful. I could use phone reminders to keep me accountable.

Consultant: Excellent! Using timers can encourage you to step away from work for a moment. Let's also consider how you could track your progress with the reading and exercise habit. Would a journal or an app work for you?

User: I think a journal might be better for me. It feels more personal, and I could reflect on my progress.

Consultant: A journal is a great tool for reflection and accountability. How about setting aside a few minutes each week to review your entries? That way, you can celebrate your successes and adjust as needed.

User: That sounds perfect! I can definitely do that. It helps to have a plan laid out like this.

Consultant: I’m glad you feel encouraged! As we wrap up today, let’s summarize your action points: establish reading and exercise routines, use phone reminders, keep a journal, and create a reward system. Is there anything else you’d like to add before we finish?

User: No, I think we covered it all! I feel motivated and look forward to making these changes.

Consultant: That’s fantastic to hear! Remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. You’ve shown significant dedication and effort. I believe you’re on the right path to maintain your improvements. If you feel comfortable, we can schedule our next session to continue discussing your progress.

User: That sounds great! I’ll confirm a time soon. Thank you for your support today.

Consultant: You’re very welcome! I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress next time. Take care, and remember I’m here for you if you need assistance in between sessions.
